  &lt;li&gt;柯耀林誤會播片毋須到庭遲到半小時 林卓廷：叫佢請食早餐啦！&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;官問何謂抗爭派 區諾軒以何桂藍為例指對方有左翼思想&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2u4MPQK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。控方今早續播放2020年7月9日，戴耀廷與區諾軒等於初選前召開的記招片段，並讓區諾軒閱讀另外5個記者會的錄音謄本作確認。會上戴耀廷重申初選不違法，黃之鋒及朱凱廸亦籲港人投票，黃稱要「讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝」，朱亦指要「畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服」。此外，柯耀林今早因誤會播片時不用到庭而遲到半小時，到達後林卓廷打趣說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成問睇咗財政預算案未柯耀林遲到半小時&quot;&gt;鄒家成問「睇咗財政預算案未」柯耀林遲到半小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨午播放部分戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢於2020年7月9日召開的記者會片段，今早播放餘下片段，其餘時間讓區諾軒閱讀其他記者會謄本確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告今早10時入庭，各被告神情輕鬆，鄒家成向旁聽席問：「睇咗財政預算案未？」，再笑說「支持」，林卓廷亦與黃碧雲交談，早前受傷的吳政亨則已拆除其三角手掛。林卓廷一度向面前的懲教用力眨眼和活動眼球，提及「最近睇緊本書，所有靈長類都冇眼眉，係得人有眼眉，點解呢？」，黃碧雲作回應後，林稱「以前係咁講，後尾發覺唔係」，並解釋眼眉和眼白是表達情感和溝通的工具。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至10時許，柯耀林尚未到庭，有懲教表示「爭一個」，被告欄有人提到：「今朝打畀佢，仲喺屋企」，有被告發笑，後亦有法庭職員表示：「未齊人，仲有一個未到，所以未開得庭。」林卓廷打趣說：「阿柯要請你哋食飯喎」，其後各還柙被告被帶返囚室，鄒家成一度稱：「我想留喺度喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至10時34分，身穿棒球褸和裇衫、微喘的柯耀林小跑着推開法庭大門，有被告說「柯耀林到啦！」，還柙被告亦即被帶返法庭，林卓廷對保釋被告說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」鄒家成亦附和：「請食早餐喎！」案件終於10時40分開庭，代表柯耀林的大律師表示柯誤會了今早播片時毋須到庭，已向柯講解法庭的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&quot;&gt;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票：用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後續播放記者會片段，黃之鋒、朱凱廸等輪流發言。區諾軒不時轉身望向被告欄上方的大屏幕及旁聽席，一時托腮，一時雙手交叉握拳，一時翹起雙手。在會上，黃之鋒形容「初選係《國安法》立法之後第一次公民表態嘅機會」，籲所有港人出來投票，「讓國際社會知道香港人未投降，亦讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wkWGhCD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃之鋒（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;朱凱廸則提及：「大家都知道凡係共產黨要極力阻止喺香港發生嘅事，我哋就要更加令到佢搞得成功」，又指現時政府與共產黨的立場已經顯明，「初選就係一個非常之關鍵重要嘅一個過程⋯⋯畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服嘅」，籲「香港人勇敢出嚟投票，我哋用文明去暴露共產黨嘅野蠻」。朱凱廸發言前，主控周天行指朱早前未有出現，區確認朱的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ew2VnKB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷重申初選不違法-若當局任意解讀大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況&quot;&gt;戴耀廷重申初選不違法 若當局任意解讀「大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷重申，否決財政預算案是《基本法》賦予的權力，「呢個應該係一個常識嚟⋯⋯我諗每一個人都會知道立法會行使權力本身就係一個合法嘅行為，我又見唔到有任何嘅非法元素喺裡面。」但他亦指，知道《國安法》並非普通法，用普通法原則解讀雖沒理由違法，但若當局「鍾意任意去解讀呢個《國安法》，連一個公民一齊出嚟投票嘅行動都可以定為非法、甚至為嚴重違法嘅話，咁我諗香港就即係個法治係點樣狀況，大家都識得判斷㗎啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又指，看不到初選會突然出現腰斬，亦會要求票站遵守限聚令要求。趙家賢亦強調，民主動力和香港民研舉辦初選計劃，「係一定要全部係合法嘅，我哋先至會去做，呢個係絕對清楚，我哋會做足所有措施去確保符合返香港現有或者新加嘅法例。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到DQ風險，區諾軒指「相信我哋個個都冇水晶球，因為真係唔知佢開邊路」。他自言不會十分樂觀，「而家基本上係佢哋想做乜就做乜」，但指認為初選合法，沒有問及警方部署，「都希望佢哋唔好去干預一啲合法嘅事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本-吳政亨與女友交流何桂藍在電腦打字&quot;&gt;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本 吳政亨與女友交流、何桂藍在電腦打字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播畢片段後，區諾軒確認當中情況與他出席時一致。控方其後讓區諾軒閱讀2020年6月9日、7月6日、7月11至13日5個記者會的錄音謄本，法官陳慶偉着區閱讀謄本確認與他的理解是否一致。陳慶偉續指法官將離席，留下法庭書記在場，至於律師、被告及公眾可以按其意願留下，但特別提醒勿騷擾區閱讀謄本，否則會要求該人立即離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名法官於約11時10分離去，眾被告亦陸續離開。余慧明一度留下與律師溝通，其後亦離去，剩下吳政亨一人被帶到被告欄最盡處的角落，被兩名懲教看守。區諾軒則留在原位獨自翻閱兩個大文件夾的錄音謄本，期間3名懲教人員站在他後面看守，區不時抬頭望向被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在區諾軒閱讀謄本期間，吳政亨全程與旁聽席的女友以手勢交流。何桂藍於約11時半亦從囚室步回法庭，向旁聽席張望後，便默默在用來摘錄筆記的電腦打字，時而若有所思。旁聽席則尚有十數名人士留下，部分人閉目睡覺。區諾軒於12時53分表示「我睇完啦」，並獲懲教帶離法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/URk0BsZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。法官李運騰今問及區諾軒口中「抗爭派」的意思，區形容他們在民主派系中站在「較進步」的位置，指「佢哋都好多元」。區又以不認罪被告為例，指鄒家成、余慧明和何桂藍3人為抗爭派，並形容何桂藍「係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，引起何桂藍等多名被告大笑，區一度向被告欄笑着問「準唔準確呀？我好驚我標籤錯人呀」，被法官提醒是問區的理解，不是被告的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，主控周天行今展示截圖要求區諾軒認出何桂藍，惟屢被法官質疑區不在場、回應欠證據價值，且控方提問方式不恰當，有如「在律師席上作證」。區已作供10日，控方指主問已大致完結，確認下周一會說明「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的證據，並在法官提問下釐清所有被告於2020年7月1日均已加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選-官法庭真的需要知道嗎&quot;&gt;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選 官：法庭真的需要知道嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午問及初選投票情況，區諾軒供稱，在7月11至12日的投票日，全港共設200多個票站，每個地方選區約佔50至60個，而除5個地方選區，功能組別只包括超級區議會和衞生服務界。控方問及原因，區解釋曾有其他功能組別想過是否搞初選，但最終只接納衞生服務界參與；至於超區則因過往都由直選產生，故亦在初選計劃內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續請區再解釋背後原因，但法官陳慶偉兩度問：「法庭真的需要知道嗎？（“Do we really need to know?”）」周起初說是，其後猶豫片刻，指這解釋了初選計劃的部分結構。法官李運騰問這如何幫助控方證明控罪，法官陳仲衡亦指該議題與受審被告無關，亦與法庭無關。周指他只是提供背景，將會問到相關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區主辦單位整體負責超區戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&quot;&gt;區：主辦單位整體負責超區、戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後問及誰負責跟進超區事宜。區解釋，就初選投票安排，組織者一直將超區與其他地方選區一併考慮，而超區協調會是「由我哋主辦單位整體去負責嘅」，包括他、戴耀廷及代表民主動力的趙家賢。他又指，他與戴耀廷均有出席超區協調會議，趙家賢則「應該冇」，至於衞生服務界則一直由戴聯絡相關人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問如何理解抗爭派-區稱在民主派系企喺一個較進步嘅位置&quot;&gt;官問如何理解「抗爭派」 區稱在民主派系「企喺一個較進步嘅位置」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後向區展示一段片段，惟法官陳仲衡即指：「作為說故事的人（storyteller），我期望你告訴我們將要展示什麼。」法官李運騰亦指，控方在展示任何證物前，應先確立基礎，先就事件發問以看證人有否相關印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，區諾軒曾否與何桂藍親身見面（何的律師早前曾表示爭議片中身分），區稱他們曾於7月在香港島一同出席宣傳初選投票的競選活動。周問競選活動與誰有關，區答「好似係有啲抗爭派嘅人選」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰表示，區曾數度提及「抗爭派」，但沒有印象解釋過意思，問區「抗爭派」與「傳統民主派」的分別。區表示，「一個較好嘅歸類事件」，是初選投票日後的一個記者會，會上「參加者都係標籤自己係抗爭派」。延伸庭有被告聞言竊笑，梁晃維亦對着袁嘉蔚「戚眉」及露出笑容。控方問區如何理解此標籤，區解釋：「民主派當時嘅派系分類裡面，佢哋（抗爭派）係企得喺一個較進步嘅位置。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZcJZ3gE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「進步」亦可有不同理解，問區是指「激進（radical）」、「極端（extremist）」抑或其他。區笑着說：「佢哋都好多元嘅」，鄒家成點頭，吳政亨等亦發笑，延伸庭的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維及吳敏兒也發笑。李運騰笑指「那並沒有什麼幫助」，提議區可舉出人名。區續說：「如果我哋以不認罪嘅被告做例子啦……」被告欄即起哄，鄒家成等人說「嘩」。李運騰亦笑說：「如果這能幫助你說明，隨便。（“Well, if it helps illustrate your point, by all means.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區以不認罪被告為例-指鄒家成余慧明何桂藍為抗爭派&quot;&gt;區以不認罪被告為例 指鄒家成、余慧明、何桂藍為抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續說：「我嘗試向法官閣下說明，例如鄒家成係本土派啦」，他邊說邊笑着望向鄒家成，並擺動左手示意，多名被告發笑。李運騰問他是否即視「本土派」為「抗爭派」，區指「係其中一種諗法啦」。李再問其他被告的情況，區說：「如果你話何桂藍嘅話，我會覺得佢係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，何桂藍聞言面露驚詫，掩嘴大笑，正庭和延伸庭多名被告也發笑。區再補充：「我意思係經濟上面追求社會公平」，此時陳志全等被告也笑起上來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即區諾軒認為何桂藍可被界定為「抗爭派」？區答「係」，並咧嘴笑着轉身向被告欄問：「準唔準確呀？」，何桂藍笑着反問：「我答唔答得？」，鄒家成等多名被告大笑，區再向法官笑說「我好驚我標籤錯人呀」。陳慶偉向區說，「我們是問你的理解，不是問他們的理解」，其後直接按被告座位逐一讀出名字，要求區確認他們是否「抗爭派」。問到鄒家成、余慧明及何桂藍3人時，區答「係」，至於其餘13人，區均答「唔係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當簡直是在律師席上作證&quot;&gt;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當：簡直是在律師席上作證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續回到之前關於競選活動的問題，問區指在香港島哪裡出席，區回應「應該係東區或者灣仔區」，陳志全和林卓廷等發笑。區再說：「因為佢哋有位代表係袁嘉蔚，我曾經為佢講說話。」此時延伸庭的梁晃維即望向袁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行再問，區為何認為抗爭派「進步」，區指「主要令我有呢個印象，係喺佢哋喺初選之後舉行記招之後發表嘅言論」，並指該記招於7月15日舉行，但他不在場，今早亦沒有看過相關錄音謄本。周天行欲就該言論再發問，惟代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 質疑控方提問沒有基礎，法官陳慶偉同意，李運騰亦着控方勿就此再提問。控方續展示區諾軒提及的競選活動片段截圖，區認出他自己和何桂藍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後欲再播7月15日片段，惟法官李運騰指控方似乎未說明上述活動的日期。周續問區是否記得該片段顯示什麼活動，區指是幫袁嘉蔚造勢的活動，這時延伸庭的袁手摸下巴思考。周再指區諾軒說過該活動是在7月11日舉行，惟李官指區並沒說過，周遂改為問區是否記得何時舉行，區稱「應該係初選投票日嘅時候」，延伸庭的袁輕輕搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0oldmh7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再向區展示7月15日記者會片段截圖，惟李運騰打斷：「再一次，你向證人展示圖片前並未確立基礎。」周稱因區沒出席該記者會，惟李即問：「那向他展示圖片有什麼意思？」周解釋只是望區辨認被告，區其後並從圖片認出何桂藍。李運騰再質疑，沒有出席記者會的區諾軒，並沒有資格就該場合作供，而控方提問時先指出這是7月15日的記者會，再要求區認出被告身分，「我不認為這是恰當的提問方式，因為你簡直是在律師席上作證。（“I don’t think this is a proper way to ask questions, because you are simply giving evidence from the bar table.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，若最終沒有其他證人能就該記者會的場合作供，那區諾軒的證據價值只會很有限，周天行回應會有其他證據。法官陳慶偉即指控方大可一早說明，周說是，並指會轉為問下一個議題，陳志全、吳政亨、施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱主問大致上完成-下周一說明共謀者原則立場&quot;&gt;控方稱主問大致上完成 下周一說明「共謀者原則」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再展示九龍東的 WhatsApp 群組，區確認訊息內容正確，周並指他已大致上完成主問環節，需時翻閱筆記，以考慮有否追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周確認會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，並表示會於辯方盤問前說明清楚。法官李運騰續提醒控方，主問將完結，控方須應辯方要求說明就「共謀者原則」的立場，即會依賴其他被告的什麼言論來指證不認罪被告。周天行同意，並在法官追問下指會於下周一說明立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入-官稱階段尚早&quot;&gt;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入 官稱階段尚早&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文提出，望控方表明串謀何時開始和每名被告何時加入，指對被告而言很重要。法官陳慶偉續指，刑事串謀並非串謀者的書面協議，人們可以隨時加入或退出。沈表示明白，並希望下周一得知相關資訊，以知道辯方盤問的範圍。陳慶偉着沈向控方提出，指如何鋪排案情由控方決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑亦指，被告何時加入串謀與「共謀者原則」相關。陳慶偉同意，但認為現時只是首名控方證人的主問階段，亦尚未進入盤問，不會要求控方現時就根據區諾軒的證供說明每名被告何時加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認所有被告於202071已加入串謀&quot;&gt;控方確認所有被告於2020.7.1已加入串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後提到，控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，問控方是否指所有被告於7月1日已加入串謀，周天行確認。陳世傑認為並非新資訊，惟法官李運騰認為是新的說法，指被告原本有機會被指在不同時間加入串謀，惟據控方現時澄清，所有被告實於7月1日已成為「共謀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉問，控方是否即指串謀最早於2020年7月1日出現，李運騰指不一定。馬維騉續問，法庭是否會要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，李運騰認為那是證據的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始-官稱不能早於國安法實施日期&quot;&gt;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始 官稱不能早於《國安法》實施日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉重申，刑事串謀非常流動，可能本案起初只是源於一個飯局，有戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢3名發起人，然後在不同時期和階段有不同被告加入和退出，但至2020年7月1日，所有人都成了共謀者。馬維騉再問，是否即控方認為「串謀」於最初便開始，惟李運騰即指，或不應用「串謀（Conspiracy）」一字，因據控方說法，初選計劃在《國安法》實施後才變成違法，而此前只是未必違法的「計劃（Scheme）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後再問，法庭會否要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，法官重申《國安法》於2020年6月30日才實施，故非法的串謀不能早於該日期出現。陳慶偉並提醒，馬並非代表所有被告，着他集中於其當事人，馬指當然會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今早遲到的柯耀林，下午由棒球褸和裇衫，換回平時穿着的黑色西裝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另區諾軒今早完成閱讀5個記者會的錄音謄本，下午向控方確認謄本「都係準確嘅記載」。控方其後要求區認出各記者會出席者，區確認，6月9日「民主派35+公民投票及眾籌行動」記者會，出席者包括他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟；區議會主席楊彧、蔡澤鴻、程張迎、黃偉賢；區議員郭平。7月6日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、鍾庭耀和一名香港民意研究所職員；7月11日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢；7月12日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾劍華、陳家洛、鍾庭耀；7月13日有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢和鍾劍華。區並確認記者會情況與他記憶中一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">柯耀林誤會播片毋須到庭遲到半小時 林卓廷：叫佢請食早餐啦！ 官問何謂抗爭派 區諾軒以何桂藍為例指對方有左翼思想</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第十四日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-23-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-14.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第十四日】" /><published>2023-02-23T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-23T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-14</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-23-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-14.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪受審。何桂藍的代表大律師於審訊第5日，反對控方傳召兩名警長以「專家證人」身份就Facebook及YouTube作供，因控方太遲提供專家報告予辯方，致她難找辯方專家，最終法庭批准兩警長作供，但不代表接納報告內容。法庭今（23日）就相關決定頒下書面理由，直言控方就延遲送達報告的解釋並不合理，控方應該以嚴格的舉證基礎準備案件。惟法庭認為容許控方呈交報告未會對被告造成不可彌補的損害，亦不會影響審訊的公平性，而且可透過短暫押後或頒下相應的賠償令作為補償。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指報告延遲送達-控方無遵守有關規定&quot;&gt;辯方指報告延遲送達 控方無遵守有關規定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方申請傳召兩名警長就Facebook及YouTube方面，以「專家證人」身份作供。《國安法》指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡於判詞指，雖然案件於2022年6月已交付至高院，但辯方卻在開審第一天，才收妥控方所有專家報告。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel反對指，該些專家報告延遲送達，以及控方沒有遵守相關的法律規定及指示。被告將因控方傳召專家證人而受到不可挽回的損失；另外控方在沒有正當理由的情況下，公然無視專家證據的規定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方強調已盡快獲取報告&quot;&gt;控方強調已盡快獲取報告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪承認控方沒有按《實務指示》遵守要求，在交付程序之前，將專家報告送達辯方。但他強調已盡快獲取該些專家報告，亦預期與辯方達成部分協議，可是最後卻未能達成協議，因此控方認為確實需要索取有關報告。但控方認為被告並沒有受任何損害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方一早知道會依賴甚麼證據&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方一早知道會依賴甚麼證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，控方在起訴時已知道會依賴甚麼證據，他們不能坐着等待視乎哪些事項獲得同意或不同意，再決定是否傳召專家證人。控方有義務盡早列出證據，尤其在具有針對性的專家證據上，以容許辯方向其他專家索取意見，以及決定是否傳召他們辯護。在現階段，辯方無法在有限的時間內找到相關領域的其他專家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭認為控方解釋不合理-應以嚴格基礎準備案件&quot;&gt;法庭認為控方解釋不合理 應以嚴格基礎準備案件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭直言，控方就延遲送達報告的解釋並不合理，他們應該一早知道會依賴Facebook及YouTube的片段，控方應該以嚴格的舉證基礎準備案件，而非期望會與辯方達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭指被告夠時間索專家意見-但收報告後3星期卻未嘗試&quot;&gt;法庭指被告夠時間索專家意見 但收報告後3星期卻未嘗試&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但另一方面，法庭考慮到現時距離傳召警長尚有一段時間，被告仍然有足夠時間考慮有關報告及索取辯方專家的意見。法庭強調，被告面對的控罪嚴重，為了司法公正，相關專家證據應該呈交予法庭並進行適當的評估。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭亦指，辯方指在尋找辯方專家時會遇困難的說法是推測性的，加上辯方收到報告已超過3星期，但他們仍然沒有嘗試徵求辯方專家的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭指未會對被告損害-亦不影響審訊公平&quot;&gt;法庭指未會對被告損害 亦不影響審訊公平&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭最後指，雖然控方未能及時將專家報告送達予辯方，但若繼續容許控方在這方面舉證的話，卻未會對被告造成不可彌補的損害，亦不會影響審訊的公平性。法庭認為，若因報告延遲而對辯方造成不便，可透過短暫押後或頒下相應的賠償令作為補償。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;考慮到上述原因，法庭決定批准控方就該4份專家報告舉證，但不代表在現階段接受報告的內容。另外，兩名警長獲批准作供，但其專家資格是否確立，以及其證據所佔的比重，則有待日後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。控方續引初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，顯示趙家賢曾稱區諾軒和戴耀廷在協調會議傳閱「白紙黑字」協議予與會者確認，雖沒簽署但屬「互相同意的協議（mutually agreed consents）」，戴耀廷亦指新西和九東兩區參選人均同意簽署協議，並夾附在提名表格。控方其後回溯至6月14日的訊息，遭3名法官質疑不按時序發問，令人難以跟上，法官李運騰質疑控方問題「跳來跳去」，法官陳慶偉亦質疑「如果這是有陪審團的審訊，他們怎能跟得上？」，提醒控方要「記住本案的議題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢曾稱協調會議有白紙黑字-ciruclate-畀大家確認&quot;&gt;趙家賢曾稱協調會議有「白紙黑字 ciruclate 畀大家確認」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引初選組織者的「PfD 35＋計劃」WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，顯示趙家賢在6月19日轉發「墨落無悔」發起人的聲明後，曾於群組稱：「屯門張可森依幾條友就擺到明要隊到行啦，仲有大家之前開咗會嘅協議，區軒同埋 benny 係有白紙黑字 ciruclate 畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個 mututally agreed consents。」區解釋，理解「協議」是指「協調會議上面曾經傳閱嘅協議」。（編按：「ciruclate」及「mututally」分別應為「circulate」及「mutually」。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙家賢「白紙黑字」指的是什麼，區指「我冇辦法代入佢個角度諗啦」，但「組合返我所憶述嘅協調會過程，我會話係第一次會議嗰個傳閱過程」。區諾軒早前供稱，部分選區首次協調會議曾傳閱「35+計劃」文件，他在法官陳慶偉詢問下表示，該文件在首次會議傳閱，而沒有在會前傳閱，至於會後傳閱的已是總結會議的各區協調機制初稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂問，組織者當時是否要求參與者對協調機制初稿提出意見，但最終沒有要求簽署任何文件？區確認。陳再問，所以趙家賢「白紙黑字」指的並非在會議上傳閱的「35+計劃」文件，而是會議後傳閱的協調機制初稿，否則趙不會形容為「mutually agreed consents」？區答：「係有一個咁嘅過程。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷619稱新西已決定簽署協議-後夾附於提名表格&quot;&gt;戴耀廷6.19稱新西已決定簽署協議 後夾附於提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，戴耀廷在趙家賢發訊息後，曾回應：「新西昨晚各參選人已決定了由他們自己簽署一份協議（內容與之前傾妥的一樣），交民主動力。民主動力之後會公布有哪人交回這協議」，及「九東則由秘書處提出一份共同綱領，包括了原先協議的內容，各參選人都同意簽署。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西訊息，區確認「協議」指新西參選人報名時簽署的「民主派新西協調機制協議」。被問到「內容與之前傾妥的一樣」的意思，區指當時不知道新西「傾妥咗嘅內容」，「不過我哋事後睇到嗰個（新界西協調會議）錄影同開會嘅謄本，應該佢講緊就係新界西第二次協調會議」，而該份協議與參選人報名時夾附的文件一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文一度提出，傳譯主任漏譯了「新界西第二次協調會議」，並指現時控方圍繞新界西文件發問，但不知有何重要，因為所有新界西候選人均認罪。法官李運騰續指，如果控方有其他選區的文件，希望他們能呈上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;九東秘書處提共同綱領-施德來夾附於提名表格&quot;&gt;九東「秘書處」提共同綱領 施德來夾附於提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就九東訊息，區表示「共同綱領」指當時九龍東候選人在提交提名表格時夾附的聲明，並解釋當時九東成立了一個推動初選的秘書處，但因他沒有去第四及五次會議，不知道秘書處狀況，只能依賴一個6月14日的訊息。被問及秘書處有什麼成員，區指他只知道蔡澤鴻會向組織者報告九東狀況，亦沒有印象有組織者是秘書處成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示由施德來簽署、夾附在提名表格的九龍東「共同綱領」，區確認正是戴耀廷訊息提及的「共同綱領」。區昨提及，只有新界西和九龍東兩區候選人簽署「共同綱領」並夾附在提名表格，周天行再問組織者有否要求參與者簽署協議文件，區表示：「我們沒有要求他們簽署共同綱領。」周天行欲再追問為何不要求簽署，惟法官陳慶偉即指「Next, next.」，法官李運騰亦指早前已提及相關議題。鄒家成等被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示619訊息後再展示614訊息-官質疑難跟上&quot;&gt;控方展示6.19訊息後再展示6.14訊息 官質疑難跟上&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在展示3個6月19日的訊息後，控方再展示6月14日的 WhatsApp 訊息，惟法官陳慶偉即問：「周先生，如果這是有陪審團的審訊，他們怎能跟得上？」周天行回應現時仍然在談及抗爭派聲明的議題。惟法官李運騰指控方的問題「跳來跳去」：「5分鐘前我們在談及6月19日的事件，現在又跳去6月14日，我們覺得有點難跟上」；法官陳仲衡亦指，「你作為控方案情的說書人（storyteller），最好當然是你的故事引起我的興趣，但至少應該要容易跟得上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行與主控萬德豪商量片刻，對要回溯之前的事致歉，但指因區提及沒有去過九東第四和第五次會議，只能依賴一個6月14日的訊息，故就此發問。法官陳慶偉續指，他們是來審理被告面對的控罪，「我們對初選的歷史不感興趣。」周天行一度再發言，惟陳慶偉即打斷指不欲再爭辯，但提醒控方「記住本案的議題（“Bear that in mind, bear what are the issues of this case.”）」。周稱「我正嘗試集中於本案議題」，陳慶偉嘆道：「Thank you.」，有被告發笑，周遂繼續就6月14日的訊息發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x5vIP0Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。控方續引初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，區諾軒曾轉述九東參選人稱認為要發布一份由大會認可的公開協議，又指大會若不接納「怕兵變」。區承認，當時認為大會已無權威左右地區決定，故最終容許九東參選人簽署「共同綱領」並夾附在提名表格。區同意當時望避免民主派內鬥，指參選者有不同光譜、對協調機制有不同詮釋，若不斷公開表態會有「收窄模糊」的情況；並以九東參選人、民主黨主席胡志偉為例，指他曾稱民主黨因怕被「揪秤」而不欲簽非官方協議，惟終因組織者的容許而簽下共同綱領，區承認「有把關不力嘅責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方引述戴耀廷在中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，曾向參選者發訊息稱不提35+目的是否決每個議案和癱瘓政府，區指理解戴「想修正35+嘅講法，規避法律風險」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蔡澤鴻稱九東欲發布公開協議-望組織者認可否則憂兵變&quot;&gt;蔡澤鴻稱九東欲發布公開協議 望組織者認可否則憂「兵變」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引初選組織者的「PfD 35＋計劃」WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，一度被法官質疑不按時序發問，令人難以跟上。控方其後引2020年6月14日區諾軒發出的訊息，提及九龍東開會後蔡澤鴻託他向組織者報告5點，區並說出自己的4點建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，發訊息前收到蔡澤鴻電話，指九龍東開會後「就住是否公布一份文件表達異議」，並總結出5點。第一，他們認為「要發布一份公開協議，去說明五大訴求，缺一不可」；第二，他們要求大會認可該份公開嘅協議；第三，蔡特別強調以上理解為民主黨同意，引述民主黨立場：「只要是官方的公開協議，他們願意簽」；第四，關於「積極運用權力否決財政預算案」，蔡指「他們覺得怕DQ的話，可以避重就輕」；第五，區指蔡澤鴻稱「希望大會可以接納，如果唔係，佢怕兵變」，並在電話強調這一點。區解釋第四點時，特別提到「我唔敢講個『他們』係咪代表與會者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區胡志偉曾稱民主黨不希望簽非官方協議&quot;&gt;區：胡志偉曾稱民主黨不希望簽非官方協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，相信蔡提及第三點是源於較早前，他曾與時任民主黨主席胡志偉會面，胡當時表示民主黨「唔希望簽一啲非官方嘅協議」，因就處理立法會議案的立場，民主黨「覺得冇理由政府話起學校、起醫院都要否決」，而且「如果不斷有一啲公開嘅協議，恐怕會被人揪秤，有理無理都好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第四點「避重就輕」的意思，區解釋如之前所述，「當時嘅環境，任何人發表對財政預算案否決嘅公開言論，都會增加無法參選立法會嘅風險」，理解蔡是有此意思。控方再問他們如何避免該風險，區答：「我諗最好就係唔好…唔好表達呢啲講法啦。」此時大律師馬維騉指訊息來自沒有被控的蔡澤鴻，或構成傳聞證供，惟法官不同意，指控方是要問及區諾軒對蔡澤鴻訊息的理解，從而得出他的建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱認為大會無權威左右地區決定-認把關不力&quot;&gt;區稱認為大會無權威左右地區決定 認「把關不力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引述區諾軒回應蔡澤鴻的4點建議，提及「地區的共識，我認為大會無權威左右，故順從是唯一選擇。沙盤推演，五區隨時有類近的動作，換言之我方最初的善意（防止DQ），最差局面不但不奏效，而且衍生了爭端，而且最後也白紙黑字化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，因為九東想自行發布一個共同綱領，故當時憂慮其他選區都會有類似行為。他重申，沒有要求參與者簽署文件其中一個目的，是不欲增加參選人被DQ的風險，「所以我當時覺得，只能夠被動地應對情況」，又指「因為佢哋都講到話用『兵變』嚟形容情況嘅嚴重，我當時認為大會已經冇權威去左右佢哋嘅決定，所以我有把關不力嘅責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，區起初避免「白紙黑字」，是否想減少參選者被DQ的風險，區同意。李再問35+計劃的哪部分令他認為會導致DQ，區重申當時有輿論稱若有人參選，並「妄顧後果」運用基本法賦予的否決權，就會被視為不尊重《基本法》，故避免「白紙黑字」是「當時處理候選人嘅一種措施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱初選者光譜不同-若公開不斷表態會收窄模糊情況&quot;&gt;區稱初選者光譜不同 若公開不斷表態會收窄模糊情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引區諾軒第3點建議：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「如今應對藍圖該是順勢而行，視乎各區意願順從之，『全國為上，破國次之；全軍為上，破軍次之』，若果不搞到鬥黃，寫了些共識了事，沒了那些關鍵DQ風險，當『執到』，最差不過是原文公開，亦沒法制止。但至少立於不敗之地，欲拆大台者再也找不到借口。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區重申，當時認為大會已無能力處理地區看法。法官李運騰問及「鬥黃」意思，區指「我會認為不斷逼人表達立場，哪怕佢本身未必真係支持嗰個立場，我會定性為鬥黃」，李再問是否即「人們嘗試顯得盡可能激進（“People try to appear as radical as possible”）」？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續解釋，「初選參與者有唔同光譜，呢個大家都理解嘅，本身大家對於個機制有唔同詮釋都係存在。如果公開地不斷去作出表態，就會有收窄咗呢啲模糊嘅情況」，亦是他指「鬥黃」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無法阻止官方認證九東共同綱領-致胡志偉簽署&quot;&gt;區稱無法阻止「官方認證」九東共同綱領 致胡志偉簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，他是否嘗試避免民主派內鬥，區同意，並舉例「如果冇6月14號嘅呢個事件（蔡澤鴻向他傳遞訊息），我相信胡志偉係唔會簽署呢份文件嘅」，此時被告欄內的鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。法官陳慶偉表示不太理解，指訊息提及民主黨稱除非有官方協議否則不會簽署，那區指胡志偉簽署文件是什麼意思。區解釋，正如6月14日的訊息所說，九龍東秘書處「要求大會認可呢份協議，而我哋認為冇能力阻止」，最終胡志偉並簽署九龍東的共同綱領。陳慶偉問胡為何會改變主意，區答：「就係因為有呢個官方嘅認證過程。而我當時，係冇辦法阻止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問區提及「官方認證」，是否意指組織者容許該份共同綱領出現及夾附在提名表格？區同意。陳再問，是否因為組織者的容許，故胡志偉代表民主黨簽署？此時代表民主黨林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文反對，指胡並非代表民主黨，而是以個人名義簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續稱「所以我話我有責任」，並確認胡志偉是以「個人」名義簽署，「唔代表黨」，並在被問及民主黨立場是否不簽任何協議時指，「胡志偉有向我作為當時嘅組織者表達過民主黨嘅立場，但最後佢做唔做，係佢嘅立場。」區確認該份共同綱領只在九東出現，陳慶偉最後問：「所以這並非官方文件？你只是容許參選人在提名表格夾附一份文件。（“So this is not official at all? You simply permit the candidates to attach a document at their wish in their nomination forms.”）」區答：「呢個係公允嘅說法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指尹兆堅稱願簽聲明但不想無限簽民間聲明-望大會轉達&quot;&gt;區指尹兆堅稱願簽聲明但不想無限簽民間聲明 望大會轉達&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指區諾軒曾於6月24日在群組發訊息稱：「有一樣要求我是 facilitate 不到民主黨的，因尹兆堅昨日和我說，若明天記者會，應認同民主黨當初若簽抗爭聲明他們是願意簽，只是最後不想無限簽民間聲明，所以才不簽墨落無悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒解釋，尹兆堅指民主黨願意簽署聲明，但不想無限簽署民間聲明才不簽「墨落無悔」，並望區在翌日記者會上表達其說法。惟區指，「冇理由個大會去幫一個黨去講說話」，而最後亦「根本冇呢個咁嘅記者會」，故無法順應尹的要求。被問到尹的說法是他本人抑或民主黨的意見，區認為說是尹的意見比較公允。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;中聯辦譴責後戴耀廷稱不說癱瘓政府-區諾軒理解他想規避法律風險&quot;&gt;中聯辦譴責後戴耀廷稱「不說癱瘓政府」 區諾軒理解他想規避法律風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，在「新界西訊息發布區」群組中，戴耀廷曾於初選後的7月14日發布訊息稱：「我公開的訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，今（編按：「今」應為「令」）特區政府問責。不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府。供大家參考。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及區諾軒，是否知道戴耀廷發此訊息的原因，區回答指：「如果時間正確，當時已有中聯辦、港澳辦譴責初選有機會犯法」，他理解戴耀廷將訊息發布「係想修正35+嘅講法，規避法律風險」。他又指，戴曾在各地區的訊息發布群組發出上述訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷想修正對否決財政預算案的說法&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷想修正對否決財政預算案的說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，區諾軒使用「修正」一詞，是否意指其說法與原本的有所不同。區表示，不爭的事實，是戴耀廷在過往數個月曾發布一系列文章 ，表達對否決財政預算案的看法，因此他在7月14日想修正有關說法。李官追問，是否代表就35+計劃目標的立場有改變，區表示：「我只能夠話佢喺呢個時間讓各位參考佢對於35+目的嘅表述。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後控方逐一展示新東、港島、超區、衛生服務等的訊息發布群組，區諾軒均確認戴耀廷曾於同日即7月14日，在各群組發布上述同一訊息，其中九龍西群組內，毛孟靜曾回覆「知道了」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1qRKmBc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。發起「三投三不投」、網名「李伯盧」的吳政亨於本案被控方指為初選組織者之一，控方今問及區諾軒是否認識吳，區指「直到被捕前唔認識」，只透過Facebook知道他。法官李運騰續問區被捕前是否知道「李伯盧」是35+計劃組織者之一，區答「唔知道」，只記得初選早期，戴耀廷曾表示他有與李伯盧或「三投三不投」的組織聯絡。此外，庭上播放2020年7月9日戴耀廷與區諾軒等召開的記招片段，當時時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞指初選或違《國安法》，戴會上強調，爭取立法會控制權要求政府問責是《基本法》賦予權力，看不到如何違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指不知道吳政亨為35組織者之一&quot;&gt;區諾軒指不知道吳政亨為35+組織者之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早就初選組織者的Whatsapp訊息提問，主控周天行下午問及，區諾軒是否認識本案第5被告吳政亨或李伯盧，區指「直到被捕前唔認識」。控方再問區，吳政亨有沒有做過任何有關初選的事情，區指「如果你講緊李伯盧，就係舉辦咗一個『三投三不投』嘅計劃」。代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘關注，根據證供區未曾見過吳政亨及與他交談，認為控方應先問區對吳政亨的認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於是問，以其理解吳還做過什麼，區表示只知道案發期間吳曾透過三投三不投計劃，在網上作宣傳，「希望初選參加者遵守承諾」。法官李運騰問及區，於被捕前他是否知道李伯盧是35+計劃組織者之一，區表示「唔知道」，此時吳政亨與相隔一個位的鄒家成交談。李官追問，區是否只透過Facebook專頁或貼文知道李伯盧，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷表示曾與李伯盧聯絡&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷表示曾與李伯盧聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘續指，雖不爭議部分帖文由吳政亨發出，但若區只從Facebook知道吳，則區其後的證供僅屬「傳聞證供」，不能被法庭接納，法官回應視乎控方問題。控方續問區如何得知李伯盧有舉辦「三投三不投」計劃，以及進行網上宣傳，區稱：「我只記得喺初選嘅較早期階段，戴耀廷曾經向我表示佢有同李伯盧或者三投三不投嘅組織聯絡」，但未有提及有多常聯絡對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9lTcLXV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後控方改為問及戴耀廷「真攬炒十步」文章，此時吳政亨再與鄒家成交談，並相視而笑。區續指，當初是在《蘋果日報》看到有關文章。控方再指出區其中一個Facebook帖文最底有戴耀廷的名字，字體為藍色，與超連結的顏色相同。控方追問藍色字體的意思，這時在延伸庭的被告傳來笑聲，區回答是「tag」功能，曾「tag」戴耀廷的專頁，他亦同意曾看過戴的專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱證影片真實性須播6小時片段-官指可予區諾軒閱讀謄本確認&quot;&gt;控方稱證影片真實性須播6小時片段 官指可予區諾軒閱讀謄本確認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方早上提及，由於有被告不承認控方片段，或需播放6月9日、7月6日、7月9日及7月15日4個記者會共長6小時的片段，由有出席的區諾軒確認，並強調播片非控方原意。控方午休前再確認會播放6月9日記招片段，法官陳慶偉問：「你想要證明什麼？」，周稱是為了證明影片真實性。法官李運騰續問，若控方能證影片真實，「你呈上這些片段有什麼目的？你想要證明什麼以支持控罪？」，周指是要依賴戴耀廷提及35+計劃的目標，以及DQ風險和參與者達成的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問及誰反對片段，代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文重申是「共謀者原則」的問題，指若控方表明不會以此片段指證其當事人，他就不會再反對；但若控方未能清楚說明援引的證據，他便會要求控方「嚴格舉證（strict proof）」。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 亦指，他不爭議影片真實性，但要求控方嚴格舉證。大律師馬維騉則指，若控方會依賴記者會的發言作為援引「共謀者原則」的證據，應播放整條片段；但法官李運騰指，若向證人展示錄音謄本，讓他確認會上內容與其記憶吻合，則毋需看片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午表示，會盡量透過錄音謄本的方式處理，但仍望播放7月9日的記者會片段，因有部分被告在當天記者會內沒有發言，單憑謄本難以看到他們在場的情況，包括他們在其他被告發言時給予的反應。至於錄音謄本的安排，法官李運騰建議可讓區諾軒在庭上閱讀，但不需要所有人都到庭，包括法官及大律師，以免浪費時間，又指大律師可自行安排代表到庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指看不到初選違國安法無參選人提分裂國家言論&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指看不到初選違《國安法》無參選人提分裂國家言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢於2020年7月9日召開記者會的片段，會上介紹初選及籲市民投票。出席者包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、黃之鋒、譚文豪、許智峯、張可森、劉凱文、范國威、楊雪盈、余慧明、朱凱迪、張嘉莉、李永財、劉澤鋒、李芝融、徐子見及安德里。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在記者會上，回應政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞曾提及，民主派初選有可能違法一事，戴指「佢指出有可能違法嗰啲地方呢，我哋都見唔到用一個常理去解讀香港嘅法律呢，係有可能違法嘅」，又強調就私隱保障方面，有《私隱條例》專家已檢視系統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又指，「我諗大家最關心嘅可能都係有關《國安法》嗰個問題」，但他認為「睇返我哋每一位參選人呢，係冇人提出過一啲係會涉及到分裂國家嘅言論，亦都唔係35+，我哋冇任何涉及到呢啲方面嘅主張嘅，咁所以我見唔到點樣同呢個《國安法》第20條，係有任何違反」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷爭取立法會控制權屬基本法賦予權力&quot;&gt;戴耀廷：爭取立法會控制權屬《基本法》賦予權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又重申35+目標是爭取立法會控制權，從而行使《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權力向政府問責，「咁呢個係《基本法》賦予立法會的嘅權力嚟嘅，我見唔到點樣係會符合到《國安法》第22條所講嗰個非法手段」。戴又指，即使真的否決財政預算案，根據《基本法》行政長官擁有職能解散立法會，他反問：「咁點樣會嚴重阻撓咗佢去行使職能呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷初選使用本地資源-與外國無關&quot;&gt;戴耀廷：初選使用本地資源 與外國無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴又提到，《國安法》第29條涉及勾結外國勢力，他強調整個初選均使用本地資源，亦是眾籌所得，與外國完全沒有關係。他亦表示，不論是投票的市民或參選人，均是自主作決定，「見唔到點樣有任何人有能力去操控到呢一個選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指表態是合法合憲公民權利-區諾軒稱無法想像局長指違法&quot;&gt;趙家賢指表態是合法合憲公民權利 區諾軒稱「無法想像」局長指違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢則表示，民主動力獲戴耀廷和區諾軒委託籌辦35+投票，指作為民主動力召集人，統籌選舉實務工作超過12年，對「一個坐喺局長位置都未夠半年嘅人」對初選的「關切」，「覺得好莫名其妙」。他又指，「我相信作為支持民主陣營嘅市民更加會心領神會，喺呢個咁大嘅壓力氣氛底下，我哋更加要堅定我哋嘅意志，係反映市民嘅意見，作出表態，呢個嘅表態係為咗香港係合法、合憲嘅公民權利嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後發言，表示對於民主派想做「團結協調」的工作，卻被局長指責涉嫌犯法，直言「係無法想像」，又指自己過往多次協調初選，這次當局卻使用嚴重的指控去恐嚇參與初選的香港市民及參選人。區形容責任沉重，最重要原則是不希望有人犯險，並指預緊可能會收緊「限聚令」，籲市民遵從相關衞生措施的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱國安法陰霾下望港人團結投票參選比以往更大代價&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱《國安法》陰霾下望港人團結投票、參選比以往更大代價&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他出席的被告則手持「支持民主派35+公民投票」及「7月11-12齊投票」的紙牌，並輪流發言。劉澤鋒提及進入議會將「否決政府不義嘅財政預算案」，彭卓棋團隊的李永財指要「對抗極權」，余慧明指是次初選「可能係最後一次嘅民主選舉，希望大家可以珍惜手上面嘅一票，參與一場冇DQ、冇篩選嘅選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈則指「我覺得每一個喺呢度參選嘅人，其實都背負住非常之大嘅責任，亦都係比以往更加大嘅代價去做呢個參選嘅決定」，又指更重要是「香港人有冇辦法喺《國安法》嘅陰霾之下走出嚟投票」，望港人團結「保護番我哋每一個香港人」。范國威指「極權政府無所不用其極咁打壓香港人」，但籲港人勿放棄，「極權政府就係要震壓民意嘅時候亦都懼怕民意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒閱讀謄本期間-其他人可自行選擇是否到庭&quot;&gt;區諾軒閱讀謄本期間 其他人可自行選擇是否到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放約40分鐘片段後，表示是時候休庭，明早續播放餘下片段。在完庭前，法官陳慶偉再次討論閱讀謄本的安排，指區諾軒閱讀謄本期間，三名法官將不會到庭，並會派書記作代表。他又表示大部分律師應該不會想到庭，若希望到庭的話亦可派代表。至於各被告則可按個人意願選擇是否到庭，此時林卓廷笑着說：「Of course not… never.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明早將會播放餘下片段，其後給予時間區諾軒閱讀謄本，法官預計下午再開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q4UMq81.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第13天。區諾軒續作供，提及5個地方選區各有協議，當中除新界西表明「會」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，其餘4區均僅稱「積極」運用權力否決預算案，並只有新西和九東兩區將協議文件附在提名表格上。庭上展示參選人簽署的提名表格，列明支持和認同協調會議共識，包括「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標。法官李運騰主動指出，對表格條款第6點「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」感興趣，區諾軒解釋民主動力設計該表格時，「希望每一個參與者都能夠奉行到第6點嘅精神。」而在本案中，8名新界西參選人均認罪，九龍東6名參選人中僅施德來一人不認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5區各有協議-僅新界西稱會用權否決財案並附在提名表格&quot;&gt;5區各有協議 僅新界西稱「會」用權否決財案並附在提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前確認會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，並會於辯方開始盤問前，交代在該原則下針對每名被告的證據。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今甫開庭，指若控方於主問完結才說明使用的證據，辯方或沒有足夠時間準備盤問，望能於明早前收到相關文件。法官指現時望先聽取證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨供稱，5個地方選區各有一份協議，但當時因憂慮違法及令參選人取消資格，而沒有公開該文件及要求參選人簽署。法官陳仲衡問及是否5區文件均有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區欲進一步解釋，但因有被告如廁而提早休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今續作供，表示在2020年6月9日記者會之前，戴耀廷曾在包括他、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及民主動力職員黎敬輝共5人的 WhatsApp 群組，發出以各地方選區命名的協調機制文件。他當時打開檔案，有個印象是所有文件均包括「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，但他指「我當時嘅觀察同事實唔係全對嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，因他沒有去新界西協調會議，直至6月19日新界西候選人遞交初選提名表格時夾附聲明，才知道新界西文件的字眼是「會」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，而其餘4區均是「積極」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案。區指，各區初選提名表格內容一致，但只有新界西和九龍東的候選人在交表時亦夾附其地區聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷63曾擬採通稱五區及超區已達成協議&quot;&gt;戴耀廷6.3曾擬採通稱五區及超區已達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示戴耀廷在6月3日曾發出有關6月9日記者會的採訪通知，該採通內容為：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「經過三個多月的努力，民主派在九月立法會選舉在五個地區直選選區及區議會（二）的協調，終達成了協議。35+協調機制計劃在七月舉行公民投票的程序，讓支持民主派的選民共同決定由哪些參選人代表民主派參與九月的立法會選舉。負責統籌協調的戴耀廷及區諾軒，協助各區協調的幾位區議會主席、副主席，及負責公民投票執行程序和民調的民主動力召集人趙家賢，會出席記者會講解協調的細節。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，採訪通知由戴耀廷撰寫，當時他認為相關內容可發放予傳媒，但趙家賢後來表示要「執一執」。法官李運騰問，是否代表當時已達成共識？區答：「我相信呢個內容係公允嘅，因為當時候佢（戴耀廷）發出咗一啲檔案啦，而都有呢個記者會嘅內容啦。」法官陳慶偉再問區與戴作為初選組織者，據他們理解，初選參與者是否在6月3日已經達成共識？區再表示「呢個係公允嘅說法」，重申共識是指戴耀廷在群組發出的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示紀錄，顯示戴於6月8日曾發出多個檔案，包括：「民主派35+公民投票」、「35+新西final」、「35+區二final」、「35+衛生服務final」、「35+九西final」、「35+九東final」、「35+新東final」及「35+港島final」，確認是達成的協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷發出新西協調文件與提名表格夾附聲明一樣&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷發出新西協調文件與提名表格夾附聲明一樣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又同意，趙家賢於2020年6月19日，曾將「墨落無悔」發起人鄒家成、張可森及梁晃維，質疑拒簽聲明者可無視共識的聲明轉發在群組。而區當時在群組回應：「我覺得有樣嘢要講清楚：由頭到尾我理解個協議唔係冇咗，而係冇喺記者會公開」，之後再撰〈以正視聽〉一文回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區再次確認，該「協議」指各區協調會議達成的協議。法官李運騰問到協議上有甚麼重點，法官陳慶偉表示區諾軒可參考相關文件回答。控方其後展示一份參選人提名表格，顯示由新界西參選人吳敏兒簽署，並附上題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新西協調機制協議」的文件。周天行其後逐項讀出文件條款，包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」，及會運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案等，惟大律師石書銘反對，指控方若想提醒證人，應讓證人閱讀文件而非在庭上逐點讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後解釋，新界西協調文件的內容，與其他地區的協調文件「大致相同」，當中只有3點不同，包括使用「會運用」而非「積極運用」的字眼；投票人數須多於4.8萬人；及爭取的議席數目與其他區不相同。控方一度問及，該協調文件與新界西協調會議達成的共識有沒有分別？區說：「但我冇參加新界西個會議」，林卓廷等被告發笑。控方其後再展示從趙家賢擷取、由戴耀廷於群組發出的新界西協調文件，區確認，該文件與提名表格夾附的聲明條款一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格列明認同戴區主導協調會議之共識&quot;&gt;提名表格列明認同戴、區主導協調會議之共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示初選提名表格，其中一項條款為「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區表示，「協調會議共識」指剛才提及的各區協調機制文件；而「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，則指協議內提及認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」就可參與協調機制。法官陳仲衡補充，目標還包括在立法會取得過半數，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選人報名時亦要提交1萬元保證金，控方其後展示吳敏兒簽署的選舉按金收據，亦提及須支持和認同協調會議共識，包括「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，亦列明：「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還；如候選人違反上述共識，將不予發還。」控方問及條款意思，區乾笑了一下，表示：「其實呢個係民主動力嗰份文件嚟嘅，如果照字面所講就係違反呢個共識嘅話，就唔發返比個參加者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格列明擁護基本法-區民動望參與者奉行該精神&quot;&gt;提名表格列明擁護《基本法》 區：民動望參與者奉行該精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後指，他仍在閱讀提名表格，「令我感興趣的是第6點：『我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區』，是誰提出要加上去的？」柯耀林等被告發笑。區解釋：「呢個係民主動力當初設計呢份報名表嘅時候，佢地希望每一個參與者都能夠奉行到第6點嘅精神」，並確認相關條文在所有參選人簽署的提名表格均有出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問：「有任何跟進嗎，周先生？（“Anything to follow up, Mr. Chow?”）」周猶䂊數秒後再問區：「據你理解為何會加上這點？」大律師沈士文再反對說：「他已經答了同一條問題。」法官陳慶偉續指，該文件屬民主動力，「為何你不留待民主動力成員作供才問？」李運騰其後稱留意到時間差不多，案件押後明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vw0GO10.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第13天。區諾軒續作供，同意35+目標是取得立會大多數，迫使政府回應民主派訴求，當中「有一定程度」的初選參與者講過「攬炒」，區指他們認為「攬炒」是透過否決財政預算案，最後促使特首下台。區又提及，2020年6月發文回應「墨落無悔」聲明發起人時，看不到有人公開反對運用權力否決財政預算案。法官問及，是否即當時所有參與者都同意運用否決權？區表示：「我唔敢咁武斷，只係話冇人公開反對啫」，並指他於7月中已退出初選工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不少參加者認為否決預算案致特首下台有攬炒意思&quot;&gt;區：不少參加者認為否決預算案致特首下台有「攬炒」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨就區諾軒〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉一文發問，當中區就「墨落無悔」發起人質疑參與者毋須簽署聲明作出澄清，區並在庭上解釋因憂慮違法及令參選人取消資格，而沒有公開該文件及要求參選人簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引述文章第3點澄清：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「直接點說，就算所有人都聯署簽紙，只要有人到時反悔，除了譴責，根本無法阻止。屁股決定腦袋，最具阻嚇力從來在選民，若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要，應該著力宣傳，令社會更多人站在我們一邊，令更多直選、功能界別選民敦促候選人，參與者間繼續夾到出血，效益很少。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要」的意思，區解釋，當時認為部分參加者「的確係相信攬炒同否決財政預算案係佢哋關心嘅議題」，而他當時認為與其敦促其他候選人，他們不如花時間宣傳理念，令更多人投票給他們。周天行續問他如何理解「攬炒」，區指理解有「一定程度嘅參加者，係有講過呢個概念嘅」，指他們認為透過否決財政預算案促使行政長官下台，是有「攬炒」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問是否所有參與者同意運用否決權-區唔敢咁武斷7月已退出初選工作&quot;&gt;官問是否所有參與者同意運用否決權 區：唔敢咁武斷、7月已退出初選工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒文章亦提及「而事實上，就不同黨派的公開回應，不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留。那大家反對的是誰？」。區解釋，在6月19日的時間點，「我睇唔到有參與者公開地反對可以運用否決財政預算案嘅權力」，故才在文中問「墨落無悔」發起人究竟反對對象是誰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂問，據區諾軒理解，是否當時所有參與者都同意運用該否決權？區回應：「我唔敢咁武斷，只係話冇人公開反對啫。」周天行續問，那直至區2021年1月6日被捕，參與者的立場是否一樣？區再答：「我唔敢咁武斷，特別係我7月15號已經係退出咗相關嘅工作啦。」法官陳慶偉再問，那參與者立場直至7月15日是否一樣？區重申：「我唔敢每刻都係睇住咗唔同嘅候選人嘅立場，我只能夠話喺6月19號，我透過一個咁嘅講法嚟回應聲明書嘅發起人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再問，據區的理解，參與者的立場直至7月15日是否一樣？惟代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文提出反對，指「問題已經問過，證人已經答過（“The question was put, the answer was given.”）」。周天行再指只是希望作澄清，惟陳慶偉即打斷：「沒有事情要澄清，下一條問題。（“There is nothing to clarify, next question.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區無聽過人公開表明反對否決預算案部分民主派預期最壞情況致特首下台&quot;&gt;區：無聽過人公開表明反對否決預算案、部分民主派預期最壞情況致特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續換個問法，問區有否聽過參與者在公開場合表明不同意否決財政預算案，區指「就我理解冇聽過」。周再問，是否直至他被捕那天也一樣？區再答：「我唔想將個時間拉得咁長。」周在法官問了數條問題後重新再問，那區認為他可以說出直至何時的情況？此時被告欄傳出輕聲的「唓」，區並說，「我諗較為合適係喺我仲參與35+工作嘅時候。」法官陳慶偉遂問，直至區退出初選工作的7月15日，區有否聽到參選人在公開場合表明反對運用否決權，區再答「冇聽過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在法官李運騰詢問下同意，35+計劃的目標是在立法會取得大多數，並迫使政府回應民主派訴求。李運騰再問，參與者是否期望「最壞情況」是導致行政長官下台？區答：「部分嘅民主派係咁諗。」李追問他是否知道其他人的看法，區說「我宜家腦裡面諗到有幾個，不過佢哋係一啲功能組別嘅參選人」，「佢哋唔係戴耀廷嘅35+（參加者）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，並播放2020年3月戴耀廷與區諾軒就初選召開的首個記者會片段。戴形容立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可運用否決權爭取特赦抗爭者及重啟政改等；區諾軒則自稱是「踢唔到波嘅球員」，指勝出功能組別對35+不可或缺，籲業界登記做選民。會上多名時任議員均表示過半失敗將迎來更大打壓，張超雄指若立會過半，共產黨就要學習「尊重返香港人」，否則「相信打壓係以數以倍計嘅力量加諸係香港人身上」；戴耀廷亦形容機會「千載難逢」亦「稍瞬即逝」：「如果我哋今屆唔能夠爭奪到呢個機會，相信中共專制政權一定會做好多功夫，去封殺晒未來嘅可能性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，列席認罪被告自區諾軒作供起獲安排於兩個延伸庭就坐，但上周五及昨天均因輪候公眾不足而庭內不設記者席，其中一個被告身處的延伸庭沒有任何公眾獲准入內。法庭今更改做法，安排所有列席被告於設有記者席的2號延伸庭就坐，包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器-正與區諾軒進行協調&quot;&gt;戴耀廷：立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」 正與區諾軒進行協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續作供，他確認於2020年3月26日就初選舉辦第一次記者會，目的是講述立會過半的願景，及介紹各區望能贏取的議席目標。控方其後播放該「立會過半」記招片段，區確認出席者包括他和戴耀廷；時任立法會議員張超雄和莫乃光；時任區議會主席程張迎、黎志強；及其他區議員或民間團體代表，包括劉卓裕、蔡雅文、劉志雄、張志偉及張國柱。區諾軒在播放片段時，時而觀看面前電腦螢幕，時而轉身望向被告上方的大屏幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷會上表示，雖然他們來自民主派光譜不同部分，但「我諗大家都有一個幾強烈嘅共同理念，就係希望能夠立會過半」。戴形容，立會過半是「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，可與抗爭運動連結、推動香港改變，包括運用否決財政預算案的權力，爭取特赦抗爭者、向警暴問責、重啟政改爭取雙普選。但戴亦強調如何運用否決權，仍需進一步討論，需時凝聚共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴表示，望在5個地方直選選區分別爭取「6 6 4 4 3」議席，共23席，並指與區諾軒「做緊好多協調工作……希望能夠將光譜咁闊嘅陣營嘅各方，都能夠大家拉埋一齊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴又表示，是次機會「千載難逢」但亦「稍瞬即逝（編按：應為「稍縱即逝」或「轉瞬即逝」）」，「如果我哋今屆唔能夠爭奪到呢個機會，相信中共專制政權一定會做好多功夫，去封殺晒未來嘅可能性」，「我哋都要共同揹起唔能夠過半帶嚟嘅後果」。他又指，立會過半「唔會改變到宜家制度嘅本質，但會加大反制專制政權嘅力量，從而有打破而家困局嘅契機」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒籲公司登記做選民-張超雄稱否決預算案可令特首下台&quot;&gt;區諾軒籲公司登記做選民 張超雄稱否決預算案可令特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在會上形容，自己是「踢唔到波嘅球員」，庭上面朝被告席上方大屏幕的區諾軒微微笑了一下。區強調，「喺立法會35+過半嘅戰役上面，功能組別嘅勝出係必要條件，係不可或缺」，籲所有公司都必須登記做選民，「唔理你係白公司定黑公司，總之登記到選民就係好公司。」他又指，《基本法》23條將至，政府亦以「殖民惡法」拘捕時任中西區區議會主席鄭麗琼，指立會過半「正正就係要話畀無論係中共定香港政府聽，我哋係唔要一個咁差嘅香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任工黨立法會議員張超雄則表示，若立會過半，便可由民主派出任主席，掌握「直接左右政府運作」的權力，又指《基本法》列明兩次否決財政預算案可令特首解散立法會及下台，故立法會並非無權，「只要攞到立法會過半，共產黨就需要學習點樣同香港人相處，點樣尊重返香港人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，只望維持香港核心價值，「要中央要政府兌現返佢哋喺《基本法》對香港人嘅承諾」，而這場立會之戰「只許勝，不許敗」，因眼見政府對區議會、整個反送中運動、及對年輕一輩的打壓，如民主派在立會選舉失敗，「我相信呢個打壓係以數以倍計嘅力量加諸係香港人身上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區議會主席接受戴耀廷邀請助協調&quot;&gt;區議會主席接受戴耀廷邀請助協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會上亦提到各區區議會主席協助協調，沙田區議會主席程張迎指民主派未能過半或面對更嚴厲打壓，故「義不容辭」接受戴耀廷邀請協助新界東協調工作，籲各派開心見誠和開誠布公討論協調機制。公民黨東區區議會主席黎志強亦指民主派無分裂的本錢，今次「唔成功真係成仁，佢哋嘅打壓會越嚟越犀利」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢後，區確認該記者會於日間舉行，而港島區協調會議在同日晚上舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信稱香港無法治可言-但不放棄對法治追求&quot;&gt;李予信稱香港無法治可言 但不放棄對法治追求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早亦播放餘下的超級區議會初選論壇片段，王百羽問李予信「《國安法》下法治係咪死咗？」，李指「我必須好鄭重咁講，喺《國安法》底下，香港已經冇法治可言」，但指問題是「我哋係咪要放棄對法治嘅追求，我會即刻話，一定唔係，我哋香港係需要法治」，最後表示「香港人頂住，我哋一定要一齊贏，五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉則強調，在DQ和《國安法》下，即使達到35+，也不認為否決財政預算案會發生，亦不認為政府會因此回應五大訴求，重申35+是要為港人創造破局機會；王百羽亦表示35+甚至40+是「海市蜃樓」，認為要為最壞情況打算，要有全力抗爭的候選人入議會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有被告需醫療診治-11天審訊改半日聆訊&quot;&gt;有被告需醫療診治 11天審訊改半日聆訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，早前辯方為受傷的吳政亨申請缺席聆訊進行物理治療，法官陳慶偉今表示因被告需醫療診治，審訊期間有11天將改為半日聆訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘今早亦提出，望控方說明串謀於何時開始，及各被告於何時加入串謀，指相關議題並未在開案陳詞提及，法官陳慶偉着他與控方商量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/23ro3BA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，並播放2020年3月公民黨記者會片段，時任黨魁楊岳橋承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，將否決政府每個法案、撥款和財政預算案，令行政長官解散立法會及辭職。今早已播放首次初選記招片段的控方，其後欲再播放另一條初選記招片段，惟遭法官多番追問播放目的。法官陳慶偉不耐煩指，若控方在播放片段後只是問3、4條問題，播片根本沒有意義，「我們不是來浪費時間看不相關的片段」；法官李運騰亦質疑，若片段「對法庭沒有幫助，亦無助控方案情，我們為什麼需要看？」；法官陳仲衡則打比喻，指他們就像餐廳內飢餓的客人，但控方現時只是將所有原材料放在桌上，而不是呈上煮好的菜餚。控方終沒有播放該片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指清楚控方引共謀者原則範圍之前-拒承認影片&quot;&gt;辯方指清楚控方引「共謀者原則」範圍之前 拒承認影片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方自上周四下午開始完整播放5條選舉論壇片段，並於今早播放2020年3月、長52分鐘的首次初選記者會片段，播畢後要求區確認他是否其中一名參加者，以及片段內容是否與他印象中一致，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後指出，公民黨曾於該記招前一日，於3月25日舉行記者會，區記得，並指據他所知，沒有公民黨成員曾在記招前與他或其他初選組織者提及相關事宜。控方其後欲播放該片段，指由於林卓廷和黃碧雲兩名被告未能承認片段，故要求區諾軒認出參加者，但在法官詢問下確認區沒有出席該記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表二人的大律師沈士文回應，該段影片嚴格上與他的當事人無關，但當不清楚控方引用「共謀者原則」的範圍和程度時，他們未能承認一些他們不清楚的東西。沈又指，不反對影片以臨時證物形式播放，若得悉控方不會以此片段指證其當事人時，便不會爭議影片真實性，並強調控方一日不澄清對共謀者原則的立場，同樣問題會一直出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;公民黨承諾將否決所有議案及預算案-直至政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;公民黨承諾將否決所有議案及預算案 直至政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長36分鐘的公民黨記者會片段，區諾軒確認出席者包括被告鄭達鴻、李予信、楊岳橋、郭家麒、譚文豪，以及林瑞華、郭榮鏗和梁家傑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋於會上表示，公民黨響應民主派爭取35+的大目標，亦有責任促成該目標。他承諾，若政府不回應五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府「每一個法案，每一個財政撥款」，亦會「義無反顧」否決預算案，令行政長官解散立法會重選及辭職，形容是「莊嚴嘅承諾」。他又指這不是「攬炒」，一切視乎林鄭月娥如何回應港人訴求，若林鄭不聽民意，「攬炒嗰個係林鄭月娥。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到中聯辦主任駱惠寧曾批評爭取立會過半是「奪權」，楊不認同，指中共若切實執行《基本法》高度自治、港人治港，「權喺香港人嘅手裏面，奪咩權呀？」、「呢個永遠都係建制派嘅咩？」，強調《基本法》賦予立法會制衡及監督的權力，他們只是將憲制責任發揮出來。法律界郭榮鏗亦批評，駱惠寧「完全冇民主社會嗰種胸襟，只有極權社會嗰種鬥爭思維」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒也表示政府要回應五大訴求的民意；譚文豪亦強調政府若沒有落實五大訴求，將「否決晒所有法案，否決晒所有撥款直至回應」：「你問我下一步會繼續點，就係繼續否決。佢搵邊一個特首上嚟，佢一日唔落實五大訴求，我哋一日反對落去。」公民黨主席梁家傑則表示，知道戴耀廷和區諾軒牽頭進行民間討論，公民黨會義無反顧支持民間協調，一定會服膺機制，絕不會「輸打贏要」。李予信在會上則沒有發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方欲播初選介紹記者會-官質疑浪費時間&quot;&gt;控方欲播初選介紹記者會 官質疑浪費時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放公民黨記者會片段後，沒有作任何追問，便提及戴耀廷於兩次記者會前的2020年3月21日，曾於《蘋果日報》刊登〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文，區確認，並確認於2020年6月9日，與戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及數名區議會主席舉行記者會，介紹35+初選計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後欲播放該記招片段，惟法官陳慶偉即問及播放目的。周天行在法官多次追問下，指證人觀看片段後，控方會就記招的安排發問及就錄音謄本的內容作出澄清，亦會要求他確認影片的真實性。惟陳慶偉指似乎沒有人挑戰影片真實性，並多次問：「讓我們看這些片段有什麼目的？」、「你想證明什麼？」，又不耐煩指：「我不想浪費時間看一些不知道有多長的片段，如最終你只是要問3、4條問題，看這些片段根本毫無意義，我們不是來浪費時間看不相關的片段。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡着周天行直接問問題，如證人有需要才播放相關部分。法官李運騰亦要求控方善用法庭時間，提醒控方呈上的證據不一定有助確立其指控，而若控方呈上的片段對法庭沒有幫助，亦無助控方案情，「我們為什麼需要看？」，着控方要謹記這點。陳仲衡亦補充，他們就像餐廳上飢餓的客人，但控方現時只是將所有原材料放在桌上，而不是為他們呈上煮好的菜餚（“Me and my brother judges are like hungry customers in a restaurant, but instead of presenting us the dishes, you put all the raw materials on the table for us.”）。控方回應，因林卓廷和黃碧雲爭議影片真實性，亦望證人能依據脈絡觀看片段，但法官指大律師沈士文已表明其立場。控方終沒有播放片段，轉為就區諾軒的文件發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RXOeO7T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，提及戴耀廷曾向初選組織者發出各地方選區的協調機制文件，內容包括「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」，惟戴在其後的記者會上指參與初選者毋須簽署協議，引來不少批評，鄒家成等人亦發起「墨落無悔」聲明書，質疑拒簽聲明者可無視共識。區諾軒其後發文澄清，指「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在」，又形容戴「出於善心，不想徒添暴政羅織罪名」。他今解釋，當時憂慮發布文件會令候選人被取消資格或觸犯《選舉條例》，「因為我哋就算搞初選都好，基本嘅倫理係唔應該讓到參加者犯法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議-翌日鄒家成等發起墨落無悔&quot;&gt;戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議 翌日鄒家成等發起「墨落無悔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早完整播放長52分鐘的首次初選記者會片段，及長36分鐘的公民黨記者會片段，惟下午欲再播放另一條初選記者會片段時遭官質疑浪費時間，遂改就區諾軒的文件發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示所有從區諾軒電腦及 Facebook 擷取的文件，區確認當中包括在各區協調會議傳閱、早前供稱由戴耀廷準備的「35+計劃」文件，指「第一次（協調）會議我有份睇到呢個內容」。文件列表亦包括由戴耀廷發送的香港島及九龍西的協調機制初稿文件、區諾軒製作並發給初選參加者的「35+民主派協調機制時間表」，及區製作的初選論壇文件等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示區諾軒的 Facebook 帖文，包括2020年6月19日發布的〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉一文，內文提及三位抗爭派立場聲明書發起人公開表示：「是否代表部分拒絕簽署聲明書的參選人可以無視我們早前的共識，甚至無視初選的結果？」區在文中表示作為參與過協調的個人，有幾點作澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒解釋，在2020年6月9日的初選記者會上，戴耀廷曾提及協調會議上有一個協議，但沒有要求參與者簽署，其後於記者會翌日，鄒家成、張可森和梁晃維便於網上發起一份「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」，他撰文是嘗試說服幾名發起聲明書的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴曾發各選區協調機制文件-參與者毋須簽署&quot;&gt;區：戴曾發各選區協調機制文件 參與者毋須簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引區諾軒文中頭兩點澄清：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;由始至終，就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在，只是當日記者會沒有公開。沒有公開，不等於參與過的人沒有承諾遵守。諸如五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案，如果協議沒有約束力，那多次會議得來的共識，便毫無意義。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;或許我可以承認，當初記者會戴耀廷教授出於善心，不想徒添暴政羅織罪名，不但無法如願，而且受到很多批評。事後他逐個致歉，懇求所有人諒解，強調聯合確立承諾是大家自行決定，無論如何都尊重，就此，請把所有責任怪到主辦單位，作為民主派，最不希望參與者將責任歸咎其他參與者，產生不信任。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在主問下表示，文中「多次會議」是指各區的協調會議，而「協議」是指各區協調會議後所擬定的地方選區協調機制文件，當中提及「五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案」等內容，並有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區形容文件是「嘗試總結各區傾出嚟嘅共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，該文件是戴耀廷於6月9日記者會前「忽然」發送予各組織者，但不肯定是否有全部發送予其他參與者，該文件亦沒有公開。區又確認，當時除了超級區議會界別外，每個地方選區均有一份協調機制文件，換言之有5份協議；而據6月9日的記者會，參加者毋須簽署任何文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒憂發布文件致取消資格或犯法&quot;&gt;區諾軒：憂發布文件致取消資格或犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，戴耀廷在記者會表示毋需簽署文件後，受到一定程度批評，並「不斷地搵唔同嘅人致歉」。被問到指戴「出於善心」、不欲「羅織罪名」的意思，他指當時憂慮若發布一份文件，或會導致候選人被取消資格，因當時有輿論指「任何人如果就住否決預算案表達睇法，會有機會被指唔尊重《基本法》」，增加無法參選的風險；他們亦擔心若每區候選人表明因某些決定而不參選，或會被視為阻止人參選，而觸犯《選舉(舞弊及非法行為)條例》。區強調：「因為我哋就算搞初選都好，基本嘅倫理係唔應該讓到參加者犯法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛要求如廁-官指不能在被告缺席下審訊-提早休庭&quot;&gt;長毛要求如廁 官指不能在被告缺席下審訊 提早休庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，區諾軒指有5份協議，是否每區文件均有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區指「我嘅表述會有啲複雜，請耐心聽一聽我講」。惟此時梁國雄舉手表示欲去洗手間，法官遂下令散庭。梁國雄一度以英文表示，自己的律師在庭內，「你不需要休庭」，惟法官陳慶偉指：「我們不能在你缺席的情況下繼續審訊，即使你想，我也不可以。」案件遂提早於下午約4時15分休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，連日來吳政亨均在審訊途中表示要求小休讓被告如廁，其代表大律師石書銘今午休後表示，那是被告之間的安排，如有人想如廁會透過吳來傳達。法官陳慶偉笑指知道並非吳個人要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於有被告明早有醫療預約，案件明午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒。列席被告自區諾軒作供起，獲安排於兩個延伸庭就坐，但上周五及昨天均因輪候公眾不足而庭內不設記者席，其中一個被告身處的延伸庭沒有任何公眾獲准入內。法庭今更改做法，安排所有列席被告於設有記者席的2號延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">庭上播立會過半記者會 張超雄：如成功中共將學習尊重港人 如失敗打壓將以倍計 控方欲再播片官阻止：如將未烹煮的原材料呈予飢餓食客 區諾軒稱憂簽協議致違法或DQ：搞初選唔應該讓參加者犯法</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第十一日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-20-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第十一日】" /><published>2023-02-20T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-20T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-20-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第11天。控方上周確認，於初選論壇片段會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，即依賴其他被告言論指證被告。控方今續播放新界東選舉論壇片段，何桂藍的代表大狀要求控方說明依賴其他被告的哪些言論舉證。控方一度指所有被告的言論都是證據，又望於陳詞階段才回應，惟法官李運騰反問「如果他們只說『Hello』，不能成為證據吧？」，又指以為控方開審前應有明確立場。何桂藍大狀亦指現時已是審訊第11天，被告已還柙兩年，「控方真的是說他們並不清楚他們的案情是什麼嗎？」控方終確認會在辯方盤問前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放新界東論壇片段，何桂藍表明入立會要奪主導權「破局」，鄒家成亦指要有具「攬炒意志」者入議會。梁國雄提及「《國安法》嚟咗之後，可能我都被控呢個煽動顛覆國家政權罪」，多名被告隨即起哄，梁亦發笑。區諾軒並確認，論壇上「所有環節，包括得罪人嘅環節，都係我設計，我安排」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀要求控方指出針對被告的證據-控方指不應此階段處理&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀要求控方指出針對被告的證據 控方指不應此階段處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周開始播放九龍西、九龍東和香港島的初選論壇片段，並確認會援引「共謀者原則」舉證，即除被告自身的言論外，亦會依賴其他被告的言論指證被告，但未有指出針對各被告的證據，指會在完成控方案情前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今表示，望控方在播放新界東初選論壇片段前，交代除了何桂藍本人的言論外，還會依賴其他出席者的哪些言論指證她。主控周天行回應，已表明會依賴其他被告的言行（acts and declarations）證明串謀存在。法官李運騰指，法庭並未就此作出裁決，而控方只確認了會引用「共謀者原則」，卻未有說明會依賴其他被告的什麼言論作為指控何桂藍的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續指，現時只是播片，問是否需於現在處理。李運騰指控方一直都必須說明針對各被告的證據，問題只是現時能否做到，又指以為控方在開審前，應該頗清楚會依賴其他被告的什麼言論作為證據。周天行續指就被告言行，控方有3個進路（routes），惟李運騰打斷指並非要知道控方的進路，而是要說明針對各被告的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱所有言論均成證據-官只說hello不能成為證據吧&quot;&gt;控方稱所有言論均成證據 官：只說「Hello」不能成為證據吧？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行答，基本上所有其他被告的言論都會成為證據。但李運騰指，一定要是促進串謀的言行（acts and declarations in furtherance of a conspiracy）才相關，「如果他們只說『Hello』，這不能成為證據吧？（“If they only say hello, it cannot be evidence against others, isn’t it?”）」有被告和旁聽人士發笑。周天行重申，現時只是舉證階段，認為在陳詞階段指出相關證據會較為合適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 即指，「現時已是審訊第11天，我的當事人已經還柙兩年，控方真的是說他們不清楚他們的案情是什麼嗎？（“Is the prosecution seriously saying they don’t know what their cases are?”）」周天行反問，是否即在控方證人作供時，控方亦須說明會依賴哪部分證供指證被告，重申應是陳詞階段才提出。但李官不同意，指被告需要知道控方案情，才能決定是否出庭作供或傳召辯方證人。周天行則指已在開案陳詞說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱盤問前會交代-官指需處理串謀何時開始和被告何時加入&quot;&gt;控方稱盤問前會交代 官指需處理串謀何時開始和被告何時加入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉亦有相關關注，堅持控方需在他開始盤問區諾軒前，說明會如何依賴其他被告的言行。周天行終同意會在辯方盤問區前，表明對於「共謀者原則」的立場，即會以論壇上其他被告的什麼言論指證被告。法官陳仲衡一度表示，論壇中每人的發言均需以其他人的言論作為脈絡理解；控方同意，並指在論壇上如果一名被告說話時有其他人在場，他的言論當然可用以指證其他被告。此外，法官陳慶偉和李運騰亦表示，串謀最早於何時開始，及每名被告於何時加入該串謀，是控方將須處理的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放2020年6月28日新界東初選論壇片段，區諾軒確認參加者包括不認罪的梁國雄、林卓廷、陳志全、鄒家成、何桂藍、柯耀林；認罪的楊岳橋、林景楠、范國威、劉頴匡、呂智恆；被捕但沒被控的李芝融；及沒被控的黎銘澤和李志宏。論壇主持為黃潔慧，嘉賓為李慧玲和桑普。播放片段時，區諾軒不時回頭望旁聽席，又轉身望向被告上方的大屏幕，一時托腮，一時撓手，不時會隨發言內容微微發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍立法會不再是議事殿堂-除下記者證望破局&quot;&gt;何桂藍：立法會不再是議事殿堂 除下記者證望「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪被告，前《立場》記者何桂藍表示，「立法會要過半，我哋唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單，而係要奪取主導權，將立法會變成人民嘅武器，要突破中共 set 畀香港嘅死局，需要最多嘅抗爭派進入議會」，指要「同全香港人一齊抗擊中共極權」，「一息尚存，力戰不降。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要從政而不繼續做記者，何表示在運動中，「相信好多嘅香港人同我有同一樣嘅經歷，就係我哋望住咁多嘅朋友，咁多嘅手足，佢哋付出咗前程人生為代價，去犧牲，咁我都會問番自己，我究竟可以做啲乜嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何認為，「立法會唔再係一個議事嘅殿堂，亦唔只係一個抗爭嘅陣地」，而在極權和政治打壓下，記者未必能完全履行社會責任，「政治制度一日唔變呢，我哋嘅新聞自由係無辨法爭取番嚟，所以我哋必須有人去改變個制度」。她續指，望推動「破局」的議程，「我必須要放低持平嘅身分」，「我必須親身落水嚟說服大家去參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成批中共為殖民者-稱要具攬炒意志抗爭者&quot;&gt;鄒家成批中共為殖民者 稱要具「攬炒意志」抗爭者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本土派鄒家成則表示，「我今日參選係因為我要代表香港民族嘅意志，對抗中國殖民。法治已死，制度沉淪，呢一刻，香港需要嘅，唔再係西裝骨骨嘅政客為大家議政，而係需要具備攬炒意志嘅抗爭者為大家衝擊體制，撕下香港政治上最後一塊畫皮」。提到「西裝骨骨嘅政客」時，坐在鄒家成旁的林卓廷向鄒指了指自己，鄒家成點頭回應。鄒又表示他參選目的「非常之旗幟鮮明」，「就係要宣揚香港民族主義，因為要建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成論壇上屢批評中共為殖民者：「香港就係面對緊中共殖民者全方位嘅入侵……一國兩制、《基本法》、立法會通通都係精心設計嘅殖民工具，所謂一國兩制就係一個殖民嘅代名詞，所謂五十年不變就係用緊五十年嘅時間將香港殖民到變成一個香港市，呢一本《基本法》已經係一本中共嘅喉舌文件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又認為，35+的機會「非常之低」，但重申參選就是要把握該焦點平台，宣揚其理念。但他重申，初選落敗後不會參選立會：「因為呢個墨落無悔係我鄒家成發起嘅，我發得起，我就會兌現呢個承諾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉頴匡問臭水配方惹笑聲-慢必稱議會抗爭要升級&quot;&gt;劉頴匡問「臭水」配方惹笑聲 慢必稱議會抗爭要升級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於人民力量主席慢必陳志全則表示，8年前參選立會，源於對傳統民主黨派的不滿，「個個都話議會抗議，唔通個個都有議會抗議咩？」指初選是要獲取最多議席，「亦都係畀大家有機會挑選真正抗爭派嘅議員代表我哋，人民力量過去係走在抗爭最前線，最早，最可靠嘅抗爭力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;慢必曾在立法會潑「遺臭萬年水」，認罪的劉頴匡提及自己2018年被DQ後亦試過「開臭魚」作抗爭，問「究竟你有冇得分享下你用嗰個配方係點樣，或者有冇啲特別嘅經驗可以分享下，等我哋第時入到議會都可以學習到呢？」 ，引來哄堂大笑。慢必指「太過 deatil 呢，就真係唔方便講」，但指「議會嘅抗爭真係要升級……你話我去掟呢個遺臭萬年水究竟係成功定係失敗呢，議會抗爭就係要令政府要通過啲惡法或者係撥款嘅時候，難度愈嚟愈高同埋要愈嚟愈樣衰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛稱國安法後或被控煽動顛覆國家政權-被告起鬨&quot;&gt;長毛稱《國安法》後或被控煽動顛覆國家政權 被告起鬨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於前立法會議員長毛梁國雄，表示自己過去「推動議會抗爭，發動五區公投，拉布抗惡法、苛政」，亦因公民抗命發起遊行被拘控，指「35+需要堅定嘅抗爭力量」，「要攞一個全面嘅否決權，操諸我手」。有網民問簽署「墨落無悔」的參選人是否會有Plan B，長毛搶答成功，但指「我就冇簽到嗰份抗爭宣言」，旁聽席發笑。梁續解釋不簽是因該聲明「係重複番35+嗰個初衷」，沒有需要簽，又指自己多年任議員，「年年都」否決財政預算案，「咁我覺得即係呢個問題對我嚟講已經唔係問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄又被李慧玲多番質疑為何仍繼續參選，不予機會年輕人，梁反問：「我畀到㗎咩？係選民決定㗎嘛。我畀咁呀，兄終弟及呀？」，又說「你問嗰啲投票畀我嘅人吖嘛，你問我有乜用啫？」，多名被告和區諾軒亦發笑。李又質疑梁「戀棧權位」，梁回應：「我又覺得你好怪喎，你正話話立場姐姐（何桂藍）嗰陣時就話人哋資歷淺走咗去喎，你真係你啲邏輯喺邊度呢？」，林卓廷笑着向梁豎起拇指，何桂藍亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄又表示：「其實老實講，《國安法》嚟咗之後，可能我都被控呢個煽動顛覆國家政權罪」，林卓廷、鄒家成等多名被告隨即起哄，梁國雄亦發笑，梁並強調「抗命就無分先後嘅，同心就不分長幼嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷批警隊非常不堪指政府派三萬要投贊成票&quot;&gt;林卓廷批警隊非常不堪、指政府派三萬要投贊成票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任民主黨副主席林卓廷，表示「中共粗暴制訂《國安法》，全方面鎮壓香港人。我哋香港人唯有用勇敢、智慧，同埋我哋嘅堅毅，去對抗呢個極權」，又指過去一年，「香港嘅警隊呢真係非常之不堪，無論係6.12、7.21、8.31，我哋都見到警隊呢，係打市民啦、打記者啦、打議員啦、貪贓枉法啦、畀假口供啦、去屈好多我哋嘅年輕人啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被質疑在委任張舉能任終審法院首席法官的議案投棄權票，是否並非「全面抗爭」，林稱要視乎「具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又指「如果政府話『每個香港人派三萬蚊』，我覺得一定要投贊成票喎，冇理由留返啲錢畀政府去做大白象工程㗎嘛」，強調不能以一個議案，「就講晒我哋過去咁多年喺議會上面監察個政府，抗衡個政權嘅立場。」林卓廷亦提及，他兩度被控違《權力及特權條例》，批當局限制議會抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;柯耀林議會行動戰線結合-稱要投選有抗爭意志參選人&quot;&gt;柯耀林：議會行動戰線結合 稱要投選有抗爭意志參選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任區政聯盟召集人柯耀林表示，「我哋好希望行動同埋議會係雙結合」，又指會在衝突現場和前線看到其團隊做支持，「我哋好希望係同大家香港人齊上齊落。五大訴求，缺一不可」，並指望初選「大家支持係有抗爭意志嘅參選人 」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前庭上曾播放論壇片段，柯耀林被問2018年民主黨新東補選出現紛爭，曾形容林卓廷「人格卑劣」，是否堅持看法，柯答「係」，但若林勝出而他落敗，「我哋會服膺我哋初選簽嗰個協議書，我哋係會支持所有出選初選嘅候選人」，引來被告大笑，林和柯互表歉意。庭上今播放該片段，林卓廷和鄒家成等亦再發笑。片中主持形容是次答問較長，但「可能大家對個題目都有啲興趣，嘉賓亦都好想問」，再引來林卓廷、柯耀林和鄒家成等多名被告大笑，區諾軒亦展露笑意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉頴匡稱完全信任德高望重戴耀廷區諾軒稱35不切實但望本土成主流&quot;&gt;劉頴匡稱完全信任德高望重戴耀廷區諾軒、稱35+不切實但望本土成主流&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪被告，時任民間集會召集人劉頴匡，指過去一直「身體力行」推動遊行、集會、各種街頭抗爭，「喺街頭監察警暴，支援被捕手足」；並強調自己身負暴動罪，「我真係同所有嘅手足係同呼吸，共命運，我希望大家可以投票去支持呢一個政府口中嘅暴徒，讓國際社會知道我哋所有香港人係同呢一班嘅前線手足係從來冇割席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又被質疑，2017年新東補選曾指會跟隨民主動力初選，但後來「自己跳出嚟選」。劉指他當年不參加初選因對民動不信任，「但係今次呢一個民主派嘅抗爭，成個初選，我哋係願意完全係信任戴耀廷教授，以及係區諾軒前議員，呢兩位德高望重嘅人物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉頴匡又坦言，「完全唔覺得35+係一個切實嘅目標嚟」，形容是「天空樓閣」，但認為初選更重要是在「冇篩選，冇DQ」的情況下，「大家去揀一個你哋覺得最值得去畀票佢嘅候選人」，「所以你話35+又好，35-又好，我好希望有堅定投爭意志嘅本土派可以成為主流，帶領香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋稱司法絕對有險可守承諾如有35會運用否決權&quot;&gt;楊岳橋稱司法絕對有險可守、承諾如有35+會運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋，屢被重提「dead body」、「案底令人生更精彩」等言論，及質疑他對法治的立場。被問「Dead body 出現先定陳同佳飛台灣自首先」，楊答「Dead body 呢樣嘢跟咗我四年，我亦都明白四年前可能講大咗」，但指作為律師，「過去幾年見證住法治嘅崩塌，係咪就咁一句 dead body，法治無險可守，跟住我哋就行開呢？」。有旁聽人士和何桂藍等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又被問及「被DQ是否使人生更精彩」，他回應「DQ只係令DQ你嗰個變得無恥，下流，賤格」，強調「人生是否精彩當然自己各自嘅判斷」，有被告發笑。楊又強調「司法絕對有險可守」，並指「攬炒」是由當權者造成，「無論嗰個係林鄭定係北京嘅當權者，真正做到攬炒嘅只有佢哋」。被問到《國安法》將落實，「你會唔會又 over your dead body 呢？」，楊答：「我會同香港人一齊，係咪 dead body，到時大家先算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又表明，公民黨承諾「如果我哋入到去（議會），有35+，我哋就可以運用《基本法》畀我哋嘅否決權」，又指如成功35+，「我哋就能夠有最大嘅力量去畀政府最大嘅壓力，去將一啲佢以前走數唔做嘅嘢呢，可以希望有機會變成事實」。但何桂藍質疑，公民黨「有35+就承諾乜嘢都會做，冇35+就乜都唔承諾」予人「投機」之感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂智恆稱攬炒議會癱瘓暴政范國威表明行使否決權迫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;呂智恆稱攬炒議會癱瘓暴政、范國威表明行使否決權迫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於社工呂智恆則提及，「會傾其所有去攬炒議會，癱瘓呢個暴政。」被問當選後會否簽署擁護政府和《基本法》的確認書，他表示：「今日割一城，明日割十城。你今次妥協得一次，佢下一次就要你再妥協多另外一次。佢叫你食屎，咁 你係咪去食屎呀？咁我唔會囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任新同盟召集人范國威則指，初選是讓選民「為民主派、本土派、素人揀選最強嘅隊伍⋯⋯奪取立法會過半議席，行使憲制否決權，迫使政府回應五大訴求」，又提及今時今日，「入去立法會要有充分嘅心理準備，唔單止係要有足夠嘅抗爭意志，要有經驗，仲要有被控、被捕、坐監、滅黨、被逮捕，呢啲咁嘅心理準備。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林景楠稱抗爭到最尾-林卓廷等發笑&quot;&gt;林景楠稱抗爭到最尾 林卓廷等發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於由不認罪改為認罪、並任控方證人的林景楠，表示原任海關關員的自己，於2015年因參加光復沙田而被政治打壓，後來成為阿布泰創辦人，「點解我依然尚存到而家呢，係因為我會同大家一齊抗爭到最尾」，林卓廷與鄒家成均發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至論壇尾聲，梁國雄表示「唔好食花生，7月1號上街。7月11號、12號投票，收咗一萬蚊，撐手足、撐手足」，林景楠即謂「撐手足嘅話呢，就可以捐6.12或者支持黃色經濟圈，我覺得係好需要嘅」，林卓廷和吳政亨等發笑，在延伸庭的岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦亦不禁大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指所有環節包括得罪人環節均由他設計&quot;&gt;區指所有環節包括「得罪人」環節均由他設計&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播放新界東片段後，周天行問區諾軒，論壇流程是否與他所安排一樣，區邊點頭邊回應：「所有環節，包括得罪人嘅環節，都係我設計，我安排，都係吻合嘅。」至於去過哪次論壇，他則表示：「我唔記得邊次有去，但我有出席大部分嘅論壇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QGbj2Wo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第11天。控方今續播放初選論壇片段，其中法官李運騰留意到新界西所有被告均認罪，問「播放片段有什麼意義？」，控方指因其他被告都是共同串謀者，其言論可證串謀存在，惟在辯方無反對下，終停止播放。庭上其後播放超級區議會片段，其中不認罪的李予信指會在議會和街頭「同大家並肩作戰」；認罪的王百羽則自稱「超區坦克車」，會將「阻住我哋議事嘅垃圾，立法會親中保皇議員，一個一個車出去議事堂」，正庭和延伸庭多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新西被告全認罪-官質疑播放片段有什麼意義&quot;&gt;新西被告全認罪 官質疑「播放片段有什麼意義？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午播放2020年7月3日舉行的新界西論壇片段，區諾軒確認出席者為：伍健偉、林進、潘朗聰、朱凱廸、吳敏兒、黃子悅、張可森、郭家麒、吳敏兒，主持為梁家權。其中除林進和潘朗聰沒被控，其餘均是認罪被告，另缺席論壇的尹兆堅亦是認罪被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放各候選人的自我介紹片段後，法官李運騰表示，似乎所有新界西參選人均認罪，周天行確認。李官略顯驚訝，續問：「那播放片段有什麼意義？（“So what’s the point of playing this video?”）」周指因其他被告都是共同串謀者（co-conspirator）。法官陳慶偉問：「So?」周重申該些被告言論可顯示串謀的存在及其程度，惟李運騰指，除非有辯方律師堅持播放，否則不認為應浪費庭上時間觀看。最終在沒有辯方反對下，控方停止播放新界西片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信指極權滲透要全方位應對議會街頭並肩作戰&quot;&gt;李予信指極權滲透要全方位應對、議會街頭並肩作戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放2020年7月4日的超級區議會論壇片段，區諾軒確認出席者包括不認罪的李予信、認罪的岑敖暉和王百羽，以及沒有被控的涂謹申和鄺俊宇，主持人為區家麟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪的被告，時任公民黨東區區議員李予信表示，作為社工和區議員的他，於6.12一周年時進行人道支援「都要畀黑警濫暴」，又指7月1日見證《國安法》下「警察成為特權階級，繼續去肆意去欺壓我哋嘅自由」，表明「無論喺議會定還是喺街頭，我都會同大家並肩作戰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，「其實當極權要全方位滲透呢個社會嘅時候，我哋嘅戰場就係要全方位地去應對，無論街頭或者議會」，強調議員要用公共身分指證「黑警」濫捕和不跟法規。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王百羽自稱超區坦克車-庭上多人大笑&quot;&gt;王百羽自稱「超區坦克車」 庭上多人大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪的兩人，時任元朗區議員王百羽，被問到如何懲罰立法會「瞓覺、亂噏同打人」的「保皇黨」時表示：「我可以好大聲咁同大家講，如果當呢啲垃圾嘅議員阻住我喺議會入面議事，甚至乎係做抗爭，我會用我自己嘅身位，超區坦克車，將呢啲咁樣阻住我哋議事嘅垃圾，立法會親中保皇議員，一個一個車出去議事堂，呢個係我對大家嘅承諾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王提及「超區坦克車」和「一個一個車出去」時，林卓廷、鄒家成等多名被告發笑，鄭達鴻笑得身體前傾；在延伸庭的岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和譚凱邦4人同樣發笑，袁嘉蔚也笑得身體前傾。王其後又指在議會內，「唔會淨係得一架坦克車，我哋會見到好多架坦克車」，嘉賓問他是否「建議大家都一齊增磅」，王表示會建議「健康地增磅，唔好令到自己高血壓、高膽固醇、高脂肪咁樣」，余慧明等多名被告再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王百羽又表示，「35+或者35-，我哋都要有相應嘅應對，如果係35-嘅話……我哋要做嘅就係要全面抗爭，响個議會入面，用我哋嘅肢體衝突去阻止惡法通過。」被問《國安法》後如何「反守為攻」，他則指現時「光復香港，時代革命」口號已不准講，可能以後「五大訴求，缺一不可」也不能講，「但係我都想話畀大家聽，呢啲恐懼係唔需要自己一個人去孭嘅，呢啲恐懼係我哋香港人一齊去面對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉不信35能落實五大訴求-稱極權下議會戰線可爭取破局&quot;&gt;岑敖暉不信35+能落實五大訴求 稱極權下議會戰線可爭取破局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任荃灣區議員岑敖暉則表示，「喺極權底下，議會戰線最大嘅目的就係爭取一個破局嘅機會」，又指「中共用《國安法》去對付香港人，香港人就要喺一切嘅戰線，令到對方都要付出最大嘅政治代價，呢一個係今時今日香港人面對極權，各個戰線嘅意義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉認為制度內不可能存有任何改變制度的空間：「35+之後會唔會落實五大訴求，我覺得呢一個係冇可能」，亦不認為可改變《警察通例》和查「黑警濫權」，「但係點解我哋仍然要喺議會戰線奮鬥，就係香港人仍然要把握呢個機會」，推動運動延續，「創造一個北京冇可能會接受嘅局面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播放岑敖暉回答主持問及如何避免犯下學聯的錯誤時，在庭上的岑專注地觀看片段，期間又雙手摸臉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;涂謹申稱有坐監準備-指達到35大把嘢可以玩&quot;&gt;涂謹申稱有坐監準備 指達到35+「大把嘢可以玩」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就沒有被控的民主黨涂謹申和鄺俊宇，涂認為：「如果我哋有35+，大把嘢可以玩！我哋全部主席做晒！除非政府唔夠膽上嚟，我哋好多嘢可以質詢佢！好多嘢令到佢好尷尬！好多嘢令到佢喺全世界面前出醜！……甚至可以通過一啲議案譴責佢（高官）！傳召佢出嚟！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涂又指在《國安法》下，「去美國訪問都可以坐監，同埋而家嘅起跳係三年、五年同十年」，但「我要發表嘅意見，我就照講，唔可以退縮，唔可以畏懼」。涂又提及要與世界結合，對中共產生最大的國際壓力，並指論壇上回答該問題，「我已經係冒五年、十年嘅監禁，呢個係我預算付出嘅」，「我有坐監嘅準備。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄺俊宇稱惠及基層要投贊成&quot;&gt;鄺俊宇稱惠及基層要投贊成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄺俊宇則表示，若民主派議席過半，「我哋可以堵截大白象工程，我哋可以幫助窮人基層，我哋可以否決財政預算案」，又指若議案能惠及基層和窮人，「好抱歉，我一定要去幫咗先……呢啲票係要投贊成嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，將繼續播放超級區議會初選論壇片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第10天。控方繼續播放各區初選論壇片段，其中在九龍東選區，6名參加者只有施德來一人不認罪，法官李運騰問及控方播片目的，是僅依賴被告言論作為指控他本人的證據，抑或會使用「共謀者原則」，即同時依賴其他被告的言論作檢控。主控周天行表示會引用「共謀者原則」，但未有指出針對各被告的證據，並指會在完成控方案情前交代。庭上片段中，不認罪施德來表明要入議會「攬炒政府」，認罪的快必譚得志、譚文豪等亦表明要否決財政預算案爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，列席的認罪被告今續被帶到兩個延伸庭觀看直播，其中岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和譚凱邦4人在2號延伸庭，另有被告在1號延伸庭，惟因該庭不設記者席，現場輪候的公眾人數亦不足，最終沒有公眾獲准入內旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問會否用共謀者原則-着控方若依賴其他被告言行需說明&quot;&gt;官問會否用「共謀者原則」 着控方若依賴其他被告言行需說明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨就籌辦初選論壇的過程作供，提及戴耀廷提議找《蘋果日報》等媒體合資格作，最終6場論壇均在《蘋果日報》大樓舉辦。控方昨播放九龍西初選論壇片段，區諾軒確認流程與其安排吻合。控方問他會否記起曾否出席該論壇，區說「唔確切，但我有肯定我有出席大部分嘅論壇」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續播放2020年6月26日九龍東初選論壇片段，播片前要求區諾軒認出所有參加者，包括李嘉達、胡志偉、譚文豪、黃之鋒、譚得志和施德來，其中僅施德來為不認罪被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ECq3xA3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 施德來（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰在播片前指，留意到九龍東論壇只有施德來是不認罪，並指昨日播放九龍西片段時忘記問控方，播放論壇片段時是否僅依賴被告言論作為指控他本人的證據，抑或會使用「共謀者原則」，即同時依賴其他被告的言論。主控周天行回應，會依賴被告言論指控他本人，至於「共謀者原則」的問題，他一度停下與身旁的主控萬德豪商量，稱稍後回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方應在完成控方案情前，對在「共謀者原則」下依賴什麼證據表達清晰的立場，辯方才能作出及時的反對，重申辯方有權知道控方到底會依賴其他被告的什麼言行作檢控，法庭或需就此作裁決。周天行回應會引用「共謀者原則」，並將在案情完結前識別出針對每名被告的證據，讓法庭清楚控方的檢控基礎。代表施德來的大律師表示，當提及該議題時，辯方會及時回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來稱要有全面攬炒決心承諾兩次否決預算案&quot;&gt;施德來稱要有「全面攬炒決心」、承諾兩次否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長74分鐘的九龍東論壇片段，其中施德來指，《國安法》是中共要打壓港人爭取民主自由的決心，直言「共產黨係信唔過嘅」、「今日嘅中共，我哋冇討論嘅空間，冇談判嘅餘地」，「入到議會裏面，我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有議案，同呢個政府抗爭到底，攬炒呢個政府，因為真正攬炒香港嘅就係林鄭，就係呢一個中共，所以我哋香港人一定要抗爭到底。」施德來邊看片段邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;嘉賓曾志豪問施德來，如前民協主席馮檢基想參選，會向他說什麼，施表示「馮檢基，如果你要選呢，就要參加初選，唔參加初選嘅馮檢基，我會叫佢唔好選」，又指「唔參加初選你肯定唔係35+嘅一員，肯定唔係同路人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問民協如何擺脫「又傾又砌」的脫節形象，施則重申「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決《財政預算案》，入到議會裏面，今日係要抗爭，唔抗爭嘅就行開」，又表明「35+要一個全面攬炒嘅決心」，最後稱「今日嘅民協同香港人同行，我唔怕DQ，唔怕攬炒，請你重新認識民協，相信民協」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;快必稱入議會衝撞抗爭否決財案癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;快必稱入議會衝撞抗爭、否決財案癱瘓政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘5名出席者均是認罪被告。其中快必譚得志表示議會需要「更加辣，更加衝撞，更加抗爭」的人，「邊個好打、邊個夠辣嘅就入立法會」，「絕地還拖」；又表明會「兩次否決財政預算案、癱瘓個政府、林鄭柒婆落台，嚟到做 bargaining power，爭取五大訴求，缺一不可」，即使全民派樓、派十萬也反對，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;快必亦屢提及不認罪被告慢必陳志全，指陳因「遺臭萬年水」而被罰十多萬；又指進入議會不止「打交」，亦要發言、開會要勤力，「陳志全做乜，我就做乜，議會應該要有兩個陳志全，三個甚至乎」，陳志全、鄒家成等聞言發笑，彭卓棋亦望向陳志全。快必又表示議會抗爭暴力與否視乎定義，「最暴力係邊個呀，沒有暴徒只有暴政，共產黨最暴力」，「打倒共產黨，反對《國安法》。」多次搶答成功的快必，亦引來施德來、彭卓棋等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;胡志偉譚文豪重申否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求&quot;&gt;胡志偉、譚文豪重申否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主黨主席胡志偉則表示，否決預算案是「最大武器」，有35+政府就必須回應五大訴求。他解釋民主黨不簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，是因參與協調時已經同意「要運用憲制上面賦予立法會嘅否決權，否決《財政預算案》」，並指「所有政府嘅法案，佢剝奪市民嘅人身自由、個人利益、個人意志自由，我哋都一定係會反對」，不過也反問：「起醫院、起學校我哋都要反對咩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;譚文豪重申公民黨立場，指只要有「35+」，為令五大訴求落實，他們承諾會行使《基本法》權力，「任何嘅政府法案，任何嘅撥款，同埋呢個最緊要嘅財政預算，我哋都會投反對票」，即使解散立法會後亦會再反對，令特首下台。被質疑公民黨在委任終審法院常任法官張舉能議案投下棄權票，他則解釋立法和司法機關一向「河水不犯井水」，法官任命一般不會投反對，又指若投反對票，他日有較開明法官委任，或會打開缺口令「保皇黨」作反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒稱推動國際線反擊北京-李嘉達指將抗爭帶入立會&quot;&gt;黃之鋒稱推動國際線「反擊北京」 李嘉達指將抗爭帶入立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒則表示，明白他會有被DQ的可能，但政府明顯並非只想DQ他，而是想「DQ晒所有反對《國安法》嘅人，甚至DQ晒成個選舉」，並指「面對住被消失、被送中，消滅人身自由嘅狀況，我好希望大家初選一定要出嚟投票，呢一個先係關鍵所在」。他又指除了議會戰線，他一直游說推動《香港人權民主法案》，會守住國際線，「連結世界、反擊北京」。被問其席位應在國際社會，他則指以往到外國游說，會被質疑欠民意授權，故認為初選的民意授權很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李嘉達則表示，進入全民抗爭時代，要「壯大黃色經濟圈，爭取更加多嘅資源投入抗爭」，並「將抗爭帶入立法會」，又指議會抗爭只是其中一條戰線，「攬炒唔係一個手段，唔係一個目標，係一個態度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第10天。控方今播放港島區初選論壇片段，其中不認罪的公民黨鄭達鴻屢被質疑對法治的立場，但堅稱「我哋唔會放棄法治」，並指《國安法》由特首「完全委任法官」是「絕對唔可取」，三名指定法官聞言沒有特別反應。發起「墨落無悔」的梁晃維則稱難保證所有人不背叛承諾：「既然大家都認同呢啲概念，咁點解唔能夠係真係做一個公開承諾呢？」至於認罪的時任東區區議員徐子見，形容自己是「好老嘅素人」，被問「點解我唔揀個後生嘅呢，而家抗爭係年輕人嘅事喎？」，徐答「有少少年齡歧視喎」，多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱引用共謀者原則舉證&quot;&gt;控方稱引用「共謀者原則」舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早表示，就初選論壇片段會引用「共謀者原則」，即依賴其他被告言行指證被告，但未有指出針對各人的證據，會在完成控方案情前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續播放2020年6月27日的港島初選論壇片段，要求區諾軒認出參加者包括梁晃維、楊雪盈、徐子見、羅冠聰、鄭達鴻、張嘉莉、彭卓棋、許智峯和袁嘉蔚。其中楊雪盈、鄭達鴻和彭卓棋為不認罪被告，許智峯和羅冠聰則已離港，沒有被起訴。論壇主持為區家麟，林彥邦和袁彌明為嘉賓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻稱不會放棄法治批國安法委任法官絕不可取&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻稱不會放棄法治、批《國安法》委任法官絕不可取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪的3人，公民黨時任東區區議員鄭達鴻曾表示，「真正去到『35+』，我哋達成議會過半呢……民主派先可以用個選票去迫使行政長官要落實五大訴求」，又指會否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LBwLbd6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻對法治的立場屢遭質疑，有網民問「法治爛成咁，憑佢點樣光復法治呢？」，又問他是否不敢說「光復香港」。鄭稱他「絕對夠膽講光復香港」，而「光復法治」是每個法律從業員畢生責任，「攞到35+，我哋就可以由制度根本改革，呢個先係光復法治嘅最好方法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋問鄭達鴻是否認為法治未崩壞，要在制度繼續糾纏，鄭答「我哋唔會放棄法治」，重申一個法律從業員，「佢去到警署見到一個遍體鱗傷嘅手足，佢一定要盡快咁救佢返嚟，呢個先係捍衛法治嘅最好原則。」該環節播放後，彭卓棋傾身向隔一個位的鄭達鴻交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維亦質疑，「成個法律制度入面，充滿一啲所謂嘅紅官、藍官，藍絲斬人就畀人讚情操高尚，我哋嘅手足、社工，佢哋只不過喺防線面前舉高社工證，叫警察放慢腳步，已經要面臨一年監禁，點解公民黨同埋鄭達鴻你，仲未敢講『法治已死』呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會上亦多次有人質疑，公民黨在委任終審法院常任法官張舉能議案中，有人投下支持和棄權，而非反對票。鄭達鴻表示，負責任命法官的司法人員推薦委員會亦曾委任開明法官來港，要尊重該制度，否則未來可能只是「藍絲嘅法官」獲委任；又指制度本身無問題，有問題是「我哋冇民主去 backup 呢個法治嘅制度」。鄭又指，《國安法》下將由特首「完全委任法官」，「呢個絕對唔可取嘅」，三名指定法官聞言繼續觀看電腦螢幕，沒有特別反應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋稱不惜肢體抗爭-共產黨要我跪我哋係唔會跪&quot;&gt;彭卓棋稱不惜肢體抗爭 「共產黨要我跪，我哋係唔會跪！」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;南區區議員彭卓棋則表示：「我哋面臨國安法壓境，我哋抗拒默沉，面對極權嘅奴隸，我哋吶喊高呼，聲討賣港派、港共派、中間派，仲有袁彌昌。我哋嘅敵人就係共產黨，我哋入到議會不惜以肢體抗爭、癱瘓政府、否決財政預算案，亦會用議員身位支援街頭抗爭」，又指他擁護本土尊嚴價值和反對23條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又在最後高呼：「捍自由來齊集這裏，全力抗對，共產黨要我跪，我哋係唔會跪，我哋會全力抗爭，對抗共產黨！」林卓廷聞言發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱連結港人能發光&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱連結港人能「發光」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈被問到「區議會主席都未做好，點解要參選立法會？」，指在其任期已反對《國安法》，而在許多政治事件中，「我哋唔怕民政處嘅打壓」，相信無論在哪個崗位，最緊要是幫到香港人和這場運動，「我相信我哋只要將我哋唔同嘅力量，就住唔同嘅人嘅崗位連結埋一齊，我哋一定可以發光，一定可以照亮更加多嘅地方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;嘉賓林彥邦其後問「發光」一說「即係咩意思？完全聽唔明」，坐在楊雪盈後方的林卓廷發笑。楊解釋在運動中每人有自己角色和能量，「咁每個人就好似發住光咁樣，就算喺我哋而家政治咁崩壞嘅環境之中，我哋都見到彼此，我哋都可以同大家一齊上」，林彥邦最後再說「其實唔係好明」，庭上的林卓廷和楊雪盈亦再次發笑。惟被問當選會否辭任區議會主席，楊則沒有正面回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈和彭卓棋論壇上亦就區議會事務爭拗，彭卓棋指灣仔區議會防疫包因寫有「武漢肺炎」而無法報銷，批身為主席的楊雪盈沒有諮詢其他議員。楊雪盈回應時二人多次疊聲，彭卓棋批楊「真獨裁就假民主」，又認為楊無正面回答其問題，一度問「補唔補返時畀我呀？」，主持區家麟說「冇㗎」，彭卓棋自己，及林卓廷、柯耀林、陳志全等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈其後邀請候選人選擇4個名單出選，彭卓棋說「anyone but you」，被告欄多人大笑，片中彭解釋楊在文化界最有機會勝出。而許智峯回應「手足A，手足B，手足C，手足D，所有真香港人都值得入議會」，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維稱用盡手段抵抗惡法-發起墨落無悔為向選民清晰交代&quot;&gt;梁晃維稱用盡手段抵抗惡法 發起墨落無悔為向選民清晰交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另外認罪的3人，被問到在「35+」議會的抗爭，時任中西區區議員梁晃維表示政權一定會用盡手段DQ參選人，甚至拘捕立法會議員，故會用盡一切可行手段，包括肢體抗爭，令街頭、國際戰線引起更大迴響，「抵抗一切惡法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維承認主張香港民族和本土理念，又指「我哋視中國為我哋嘅敵人」，知道中國「一定會用盡佢所有方法繼續壓迫我哋香港人」，「而我哋面對咁嘅壓迫，我哋係一定唔會退讓，我哋一定會再次挺身而出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問發起「墨落無悔」是否「夾緊其他人」，梁否認，指初選協調會議內容只有戴耀廷和出席者知道，無法保證所有人不會背叛承諾，「如果大家都係承諾咗，或者係都認同呢啲理念嘅話，其實點解唔能夠向住全香港市民做一個公開嘅承諾呢？」。他形容簽聲明是「基本責任」，「向選民交代到底我哋會唔會繼續堅定抗爭」，而若有人有「被夾」的「hard feeling」，可能本身就不同意協議內容。在搶答環節，梁晃維4次搶答成功，主持問「梁晃維撳掣咁快嘅你」，被告欄傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁嘉蔚稱要光復議會被問是否羅冠聰plan-b&quot;&gt;袁嘉蔚稱要光復議會、被問是否羅冠聰「Plan B」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任南區區議員袁嘉蔚則表示，「議會抗爭唔係單單靠投反對票，係需要一班用盡所有方法抗爭嘅民主派」，而初選是「要為民主派協調最堅實嘅陣容，九月光復議會」，又指要「向極權抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否羅冠聰的「Plan B」，在延伸庭觀看直播的袁嘉蔚即埋頭靠近螢幕，並專注觀看。當袁在片中回應自己是獨立出選時，庭上的她低頭並托眼鏡。其後林彥邦問到每一個民主派是否可完全補上任何位置，袁回答屆時再磋商，又指「要接前人意志」。庭上的袁看到片段後，隨即雙手遮臉，又不斷搖頭及撥頭髮，最後將頭傾側向一邊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任東區區議員徐子見，嘉賓袁彌明指他經常提自己是「素人」，徐指相信素人定義是沒有加入任何政黨，而自己應是「好老嘅素人」，有被告發笑。徐稱素人有堅定意志投贊成或反對，袁彌明遂問徐認為候選人中誰是素人，徐稱楊雪盈是素人，而梁晃維和彭卓棋則「一半一半」，因「好早接觸政治嘅嘢」，鄒家成、彭卓棋、林卓廷等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林彥邦多次問徐子見與其他年輕素人分別，又問「點解我唔揀個後生嘅呢，而家抗爭係年輕人嘅事喎？」，徐答「有少少年齡歧視喎」，彭卓棋、柯耀林、楊雪盈等多名被告再次大笑，黃碧雲邊笑邊拍大腿。徐指相信抗爭並非一個年齡層的事，「可以係一啲比較中年人嘅事，甚至乎係老年人嘅事」，認為以他年紀也可有智慧幫助「抗衡呢個不義嘅政權」。徐也提及有簽署「墨落無悔」，但認為「寫得比較怪」，此時發起該聲明的鄒家成亦輕輕發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;許智峯稱議會內外寸土必爭-羅冠聰認預咗畀人dq&quot;&gt;許智峯稱「議會內外，寸土必爭」 羅冠聰認「預咗畀人DQ」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就沒被控的兩人，許智峯表示「議會內外，寸土必爭」，「無論喺議會抗爭，喺街頭我必出席，同埋喺所有嘅法律訴訟、法律程序，我都做到盡」，指要透過司法制度給予政權最大的壓力，「迫佢哋承認錯誤。」被問到35+後可否有一致投票意向，許指民主黨光譜較闊，有「衝衝子」和「和理非」，要包容不同看法，又指民主黨過去四年施政報告和財政預算案均投反對票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅冠聰承認自己「預咗畀人DQ」，望突顯政權打壓的暴虐和不合理，籲選民投票支持他的信念，又指「街頭、議會、國際，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OXnzVZZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第9天。認罪被告區諾軒今續作供，重申戴耀廷在新界東協調會議提及「積極」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，是試圖迎合不同意見，又指會上有人批評泛民過往「行禮如儀」。區又供稱，超級區議會界別曾於2020年5月8日後舉行協調會議，但很快結束，因當時「大局已定」，其他區均已大致就舉行初選、目標議席和替補機制等達成共識，戴亦沒有提及否決財政預算案的主張。區又指，被捕前已刪除手機所有 WhatsApp 紀錄，並在2021年9月獲展示趙家賢手機紀錄才能重溫當時對話，確認那時他已協助警方調查。翻查資料，區諾軒於同月23日的第二次提訊日，首次表明擬認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申戴望說服與會者-故提積極運用權力否決財案&quot;&gt;區重申戴望說服與會者 故提「積極」運用權力否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨供稱，戴耀廷在不同地區的協調會議，不斷建議加入「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的條款，其中港島區司馬文表示反對，社民連指會支持涉全民退保等民生項目的預算案，新界東鄒家成則質問戴耀廷為何用「積極」，而非較確定的「會」字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行今續就新界東協調會議情況發問，問戴耀廷在新東第二次會議上，何時提及「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」字眼。區指據其憶述，戴是在會上看到相關討論後，在回應時才講述他對積極運用否決權的看法，「試圖迎合唔同嘅意見」，至於與會者在開會前有否討論該字眼，區則稱「我冇再之前嘅印象」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，為何說戴耀廷「不斷加入」該條款，區再解釋，當時會上有人質疑條款字眼，故戴嘗試說服會眾就算只用「積極」，「都比起唔用行前一步」。他指戴沒再闡述何為「再行前一步」，但認為戴「應該係為咗說服鄒家成」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱會上有人批泛民行禮如儀-就條款字眼沒有達成共識&quot;&gt;區稱會上有人批泛民「行禮如儀」 就條款字眼沒有達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區昨又提及，鄒家成的質問引發「激烈辯論」，期間民主黨被批評，林卓廷助理莊榮輝指民主黨中委會無授權他處理有關問題。周天行問「民主黨被批評」是什麼意思，區指會上「有人拎返以前民主黨好多事情出嚟批評」，批評對象亦包括街工，「都係講緊泛民主派過往行禮如儀」，旁聽人士聞言發笑。傳譯主任一度未能翻譯，大律師沈士文提議「just go through motions and rituals」，法官陳慶偉則提議「go through the formalities」。區並補充，莊榮輝的回應是在鄒家成提議即場投票處理條款字眼時發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行一度續問，相關議題是否指「否決財政預算案」，惟大律師沈士文提出反對，指是引導性問題，「運用《基本法》權力」與「否決財政預算案」是兩個不同字眼。法官李運騰同意，區並補充鄒當時是就「運用《基本法》權力」應用「會」或「積極」作投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，相關爭辯花了相當時間，最終沒有共識，其後並轉為討論該區初選應派出6或7張名單，因7張名單是「較為樂觀」的勝選目標。他並指，有與會者認為第7張名單若被界定為初選勝出者，可於正式立法會選舉報名，但不應展開選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱whatsapp紀錄於被捕前已刪除-僅靠趙家賢紀錄重溫對話&quot;&gt;區稱WhatsApp紀錄於被捕前已刪除 僅靠趙家賢紀錄重溫對話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，他只出席過新界東頭兩次會議，不清楚有否第三次會議。法官陳仲衡問新界東是否有 WhatsApp 群組，區指有，但對有否收過第三次會議的通知則「冇印象」，「特別係我只能夠覆睇趙家賢嗰部手機有關新界東嗰個群組嘅內容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰再問他是否身在該群組，及有否被通知有第三次會議，區確認他是群組成員，「但我沒有被知會有任何會議」。李續問，既然他在群組內，為何要看趙家賢的手機？區諾軒解釋：「因為喺我2021年9月收到本案關於趙家賢手機嘅 WhatsApp 紀錄，我先能夠重溫返當時候嘅對話」，李問即是他被捕後，曾被展示趙的手機紀錄？區同意。李問那時他是否已在「協助警方調查」，區亦同意。李再問他自己的手機紀錄在哪？區答：「關於我嘅任何紀錄，關於 WhatsApp 都已經剷走晒，喺我被捕之前。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，本案2021年3月1日首提堂後，區諾軒於2021年9月23日的第二次提訊日，與趙家賢和鍾錦麟首次表示擬認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前排：趙家賢（左）、戴耀廷（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東群組於報名期後由戴耀廷創立-發布初選訊息&quot;&gt;新東群組於報名期後由戴耀廷創立 發布初選訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，該群組約於2020年5、6月建立，但對有否收過會議摘要則沒有印象。周天行問及群組成員名單，區指「如果向我展示嗰個 WhatsApp group 嘅名單，我能夠睇得返，知道有咩成員參與」，吳政亨、梁國雄等發笑。法官李運騰續指，理解現時在談論多年前的事，亦非測試記憶，但區是否不記得任何成員。區指只能確定包括初選參與者及其代表，要一一數出「恐怕有錯漏」，重申「比較好」的做法是如早前作供時控方展示九龍東的群組紀錄，「我覺得用嗰個方式，會比較恰當回應嗰個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示從趙家賢手機擷取「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」的 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，顯示於2020年6月24日創立。區解釋該群組是「訊息發布的地方」，法官李運騰一度問是否呈上錯誤的群組，惟區諾軒核實是指此群組。控方問新界東是否有另一群組，區更正指應另有一個發送訊息的名單，但「趙家賢先至有」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據群組紀錄，區諾軒是群組管理員，他起初稱是由他創立群組，再加入其他與會者，但不肯定是否所有成員都由他加入。惟其後顯示戴耀廷亦是管理員，區則改稱群組應由戴創立，「但我唔敢肯定點解我做咗 admin」，有旁聽人士發笑。區同意，群組是在新界東兩次協調會議及6月19日的初選報名期後創立，「我推斷係因為完成咗報名，先創立呢個群組，發布訊息予參加者。」大律師馬維騉一度指其回應為意見，質疑呈堂性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱協調及訊息發布兩群組不會同時進行-相信九東群組完成協調後關閉&quot;&gt;區稱協調及訊息發布兩群組不會同時進行 相信九東群組完成協調後關閉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問其他區是否都有類似群組，區確認，並在法官李運騰詢問下確認，有部分選區會於協調會議時創立群組，「但過咗報名期後，無論之前有冇開過 WhatsApp 群組，我哋都會確保每一區開設訊息發布嘅群組」，又指據其印象「冇一個選區嘅群組係有兩個同時間進行」。傳譯主任一度猶豫：「冇一個選區嘅群組係有兩個同時間進行……」，區再主動翻譯：「There is no WhatsApp group running concurrently.」被告欄和旁聽席傳出笑聲。區其後再確認，初選報名日期完結後，參與者便不會再使用協調會議群組，而改用發布訊息的群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後重新展示早前呈堂、處理協調會議的九龍東 WhatsApp 群組，於2020年2月創立，5月20日後便沒有任何訊息。區指他沒有去九龍東第四次和第五次會議，不清楚他們進度，「但係我有理由相信，呢個群組處理完協調會議嘅事務之後，佢哋已經完成咗任務，所以就閂咗個群組。」紀錄亦顯示，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻最後移除群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區形容超區協調會議舉行時大局已定-各區已大致定替補機制等&quot;&gt;區形容超區協調會議舉行時「大局已定」 各區已大致定替補機制等&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就超級區議會協調會議發問。區供稱，超級區議會曾舉行一次會議，他不記得日期，但肯定是在2020年5月8日新界西第二次協調會議之後，出席者包括他、戴耀廷、涂謹申、鄺俊宇、王百羽、李予信和岑敖暉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，當時由戴耀廷主持討論，而會議「好快就結束」，「因為喺成個協調會議，咁多區嚟講，我會形容為大局已定。」他又指，與會者亦是有政治聯繫人士，故會上只是集中介紹超級區議會目標是「5席贏3席」，及簡介選舉論壇和投票日內容，席間戴耀廷並無提及關於否決預算案的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及何謂「大局已定」，區解釋其他選區的協調會議已完成舉行，並指基本方向是各區都會舉行初選，亦訂下目標勝算議席，但有個別選區則保留彈性，決定初選投票日後才決定確切出選名單數目。法官問還有什麼其他共識，區指除香港島外，其餘選區當時均已決定以「靈童制」作為替補被「DQ」者的機制；當時亦就舉辦選舉論壇達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於新界西，區昨天指「新界西我冇參與過，所以我唔能夠評論新界西嘅事」，今重申他並沒有出席過任何新界西協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第9天。認罪被告區諾軒今續作供，指早期與戴耀廷商討初選時，已打算舉辦選舉論壇，戴耀廷提議找《蘋果日報》及其他媒體合作籌辦，最終由《蘋果》提供場地，民主動力作選舉申報，區負責籌備。庭上播放九龍西選舉論壇片段，多名候選人對黃碧雲提出質疑，其中馮達浚問黃碧雲如果當選，「你願唔願意同我一齊衝？」黃拍枱高聲答： 「一齊衝，希望一齊贏！」；劉澤鋒問黃「你識唔識得唱《願榮光歸香港》呀？你唱嚟聽吓」，黃答「我哋一齊唱」，均惹來被告欄和旁聽席大笑，黃碧雲則笑着搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷提議找蘋果合辦初選-獲回覆可提供場地&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷提議找《蘋果》合辦初選 獲回覆可提供場地&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今就初選論壇作供。他確認負責籌備初選論壇，於6月25日至7月4日舉辦6個論壇，包括5個地方選區和超級區議會。區表示，2020年3月與戴耀廷傾談初選早期，已預期要舉辦選舉論壇。當時戴耀廷曾指可嘗試找《蘋果日報》及其他媒體一起合作，因此他聯絡一位《蘋果日報》記者，表達想搞初選論壇的意見，《蘋果》並回覆可以提供場地。區亦聯絡網台《城寨》、《D100》 和《立場新聞》問有否興趣合辦論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，與4個媒體各派出的一名代表，舉行兩至三次會議準備論壇的工作，會上討論播放模式，決定由《蘋果日報》錄制影像，再分發予上述媒體在同一時間播放；並思考邀請什麼人做嘉賓及主持，「經過幾間媒體物色人選下」訂下名單；並指他們最初憂慮論壇所牽涉的選舉開支，及是否需要作選舉申報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;以35名義辦論壇-民主動力安排申報選舉開支&quot;&gt;以「35+」名義辦論壇 民主動力安排申報選舉開支&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區提及，就選舉申報曾徵詢《蘋果日報》一方的法律意見，惟法官李運騰即打斷：「我不認為我們需要知道所有細節。」區續指他只是想解釋在6月9日記者會，他曾表示不以「35+」的名義舉辦論壇，但與媒體開會後認為應作選舉申報，故最後還是以「35+」名義舉辦論壇，並由民主動力安排候選人申報選舉開支的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區製作35論壇須知文件-擬定論壇流程&quot;&gt;區製作〈35+論壇須知〉文件 擬定論壇流程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，曾準備〈35+論壇須知〉和〈Candidates’ memo（候選人備忘）〉兩份文件，發給每位初選參加者，分別列明6個論壇的錄製和播放日期、發言時間；及論壇流程、嘉賓和主持等資料，並指論壇環節是參考一般媒體的立法會選舉論壇。他並曾將文件發給戴耀廷和趙家賢，指他們知悉該兩份文件，「但都係由我製作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又透露，與戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和民主動力職員黎敬輝有一個名為「PfD 35＋計劃」的 WhatsApp 群組，群組於2020年6月創立，創立者「唔係趙家賢，就係戴耀廷」，群組最後訊息於7月23日發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾去大部分選舉論壇趙家賢沒去過戴耀廷只去一次&quot;&gt;區稱曾去大部分選舉論壇、趙家賢沒去過、戴耀廷只去一次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，論壇於《蘋果日報》大樓舉行，指「當中大部分我都有去，但我唔記得冇去邊一兩個」，形容自己「只係去做觀察」，而戴耀廷只去過一次，趙家賢應沒有去過。法官多次問及區有否參與，他再指大部分都有去，「即使冇去都好，我都有睇晒所有論壇」，但就九龍西論壇「我冇100%確保我有去」，但確定所有選舉論壇流程都由他處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方原不打算播放所有論壇片段，但大律師馬維騉表示，於盤問會播放新界東論壇片段，望庭上能播放所有論壇片段。法庭押後讓雙方商討，控方於午休後指會播放完整片段。資深大律師潘熙一度指大部分辯方律師對論壇沒有爭議，不要求在區諾軒作供時播放所有片段，法官陳仲衡提議先由新界東片段播放，惟馬維騉指他希望順時序播放。法官陳慶偉指交由控方決定，「你們之間永遠不會達成共識。（“There will be no consensus among you all.”）」有被告大笑，林卓廷笑着重複：「There will be no consensus.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播片前，指有部分被告不承認片段，要求區諾軒認出參加者，自辯的劉偉聰表示沒有爭議身份，區並認出黃碧雲、劉澤鋒、何啟明、毛孟靜、馮達浚、岑子杰、張崑陽、安德里和李軒朗，其中劉偉聰、黃碧雲、何啟明為不認罪被告。開始播片時，區諾軒一度回頭望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 劉偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長1小時20分鐘的九龍西初選論壇片段，先是每人30秒的「開場介紹」，劉偉聰提及要將最多同路人送入議會，「裏應外合」；黃碧雲提及「今日上嚟論壇，小心我可能畀人重點招呼」，但重申35+要團結合作抗暴政，有被告發笑；何啟明則提及自2019年8月起，「我同一班70+手足，喺深水埗警署門口，一齊嚟到反暴政，一齊嚟到食TG」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲論壇被多人質問-惹被告及旁聽席大笑&quot;&gt;黃碧雲論壇被多人質問 惹被告及旁聽席大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後進入每人3分鐘的「自由搏擊」環節，多名候選人均質疑黃碧雲立場，其中張崑陽問黃「過去一年，喺抗爭上做過啲咩嘢？」、「七一嘅時候，點解要同勇武手足割蓆？」，又指在「中大保衛戰」時有人曾聽到她說「嘩，咁多人嘅，係咪 open day 呀？」，黃回應時二人疊聲，張說「宜家係我嘅主場，唔好惱羞成怒」，多名被告發笑，林卓廷笑着搖頭。岑子杰問黃如何說服港人她進入議會後會「積極抗爭」，黃指民主黨「一定會抵抗惡法」，指面對《逃犯條例》，「我哋係全部一條心，民主派嘅議員係一齊共進退」，而隨《國安法》來臨，「已經冇得分咩叫和理非，咩叫勇武。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案認罪被告馮達浚則指，現時共產黨政權為「共同敵人」，「議事堂內已經係冇任何議事嘅空間」，問黃碧雲：「我見到你用咗8年時間，係學識點樣去捐山窿，但係我想問嚟緊4年，你願唔願意同我一齊，如果一齊當選嘅話，你願唔願意同我一齊衝？」黃碧雲拍枱高聲答： 「一齊衝，希望一齊贏！」引來旁聽席大笑，彭卓棋、柯耀林、鄭達鴻等前俯後仰，黃碧雲亦笑着搖頭。安德里其後問到少數族裔議題，黃碧雲指「過去兩屆，我同 Ms Mo 都喺立法會度有啲關注少數族裔嘅工作做嘅」，惟毛孟靜說「我冇同你一齊做呀」，再惹被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一認罪被告劉澤鋒，則指黃碧雲曾在戴耀廷舉辦的佔中訓練營訓練擋水砲，多次質問：「點解你唔去擋水砲？」，又說「既然你係抗爭者，你識唔識得唱《願榮光歸香港》呀？你唱嚟聽吓」，黃碧雲答「我哋一齊唱」，再引來林卓廷等被告和旁聽人士大笑。其後劉轉為問張崑陽問題，黃碧雲續說「我見到你嗰種憤怒係好明白，不過希望我哋嘅憤怒，係對住呢個政權」，劉即說「我宜家問緊張崑陽呀，你收聲吓」，林卓廷等再大笑，黃碧雲再苦笑搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲稱會用盡憲制權力爭五大訴求何啟明指不簽墨落無悔要foul走&quot;&gt;黃碧雲稱會用盡憲制權力爭五大訴求、何啟明指不簽墨落無悔要「foul走」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉澤鋒又質疑，黃碧雲拒簽墨落無悔，問黃民主黨「係咪應承一定攬炒」，黃指如戴耀廷認為九龍西要再簽協議，「我哋好樂意」，又稱會用盡憲制內的權力和手段爭取五大訴求，「如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」何啟明則稱，35+是要團結入議會，若有人不簽「墨落無悔」，市民「就用佢雪亮嘅眼睛，就用佢手上一票，咪 foul 走佢囉」，又指35+是要「令到立法會成為呢個政府同埋保皇黨嘅地獄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明亦提到，過去一年「見證住無數警暴」，指「呢個極權政府，淨係針對年輕人，好多濫捕、濫告，甚至有好多死得不明不白嘅死者」，又指周梓樂是他的中學師弟，該案必須徹查。其後劉偉聰稱，議會是一條戰線，指「首先我哋就炒晒班（立法會）保安，跟住請番晒自己嘅手足」，黃碧雲發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張崑陽則問劉偉聰是否知道議會內「做唔到法治重光」，劉指法治是「制約當權者的權力」，又說「如果大家覺得我哋仲需要制約當權者嘅話，有你，有我哋，大家一齊嘅話，法治係唔會死」。他又指「有35+，我相信好多嘢都可以做，包括修改呢啲惡法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑子杰被問為何不簽墨落無悔，他形容「覺得嗰種夾泛民嘅意味太重，佢好似會創造一種撕裂，我唔鍾意」，又指：「社民連有邊一次嘅財政預算案係投過贊成票嘅啫？係咪先？未有你哋，社民連係第一個講議會抗爭嘅！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰稱法治未死-何啟明指中共攬炒&quot;&gt;劉偉聰稱法治未死 何啟明指中共「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後為嘉賓提問環節，嘉賓為資深傳媒人湛國揚及阮穎嫻。問黃碧雲時，阮穎嫻形容「其實我覺得大會，喺現場呢個節數其實都係為咗呢一刻㗎，可能係咁」。湛國揚後提及當時81歲李柱銘和「擺咗喺床下底嗰個楊森」都被捕，問民主黨「大中華」概念是否太天真。黃指回歸前寄望有高度自治，但回歸廿多年，中央插手香港事務，甚至有《國安法》，「的確令我哋對於中共呢個政權，同埋佢過去做出嘅承諾，係幻想破滅」，籲港人團結向專制政權說不、抵抗所有惡法，包括《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰後被問到法治「死咗未？死定係未死？」，答「梗係未」，又說：「我死唔死唔緊要，我 dead body 係唔重要嘅⋯⋯你哋未死嘅話，法治就未死。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何啟明，嘉賓指「攬炒受傷最大嘅就係基層」，但何啟明已簽署「墨落無悔」，「你會選擇背棄堅定抗爭聲明定係背棄深水埗嘅支持者？」何回應基層市民眼睛雪亮，明白「攬炒係中共吖嘛」，又指「真正令到基層市民生活苦，嗰個係共產黨，係呢個極權社會，係呢個極權政府」，他們知道「共產黨係一個殺人政權」，故他要出來「反暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明倡打倒共產黨岑子杰指想長毛再參選&quot;&gt;何啟明倡打倒共產黨、岑子杰指想長毛再參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;到了特選片段和網民提問的搶答環節，被問如何運用議會資源結合街頭抗爭，毛孟靜成功搶答後說，「我呀？啊，好叻叻呀，多謝晒！」林卓廷和施德來等被告大笑。毛指她正支援街頭抗爭；何啟明則指會用資料「請手足」，「打倒共產黨。」岑子杰被問為何任沙田區議員，要選九龍西選區，則指「長毛係第一個喺議會提倡抗爭嘅人，我好想長毛再次出嚟參選」，不認罪的梁國雄專注看片段。其後馮達浚連續成功搶答兩條問題，鄒家成俯身發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後是各人10秒的總結環節，劉偉聰說「最重要係支持最大多數同路人進入議會，到時 they would fear you，建制會驚你」，黃碧雲指「贏唔到」會全力支持勝出隊伍，何啟明則說元朗 YOHO 商場有8男4女被捕，「不如宜家我哋就一齊去元朗，一齊守護手足，一齊守護下一代，好唔好呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢，法官指明天會播放其他片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QgnVZuL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今續就九龍東協調會議作供，指有與會者曾製作會議摘要並發送到 WhatsApp 群組，但由於他幾乎每個月有「刪機」習慣，故控方並沒有該檔案作為呈堂證物。區又指無法記得所有文件內容，但指戴提倡「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」一句「應該有喺當時加喺文件裡面」，有被告起哄。此外，辯方屢批評主控周天行以「引導性問題」發問，法官李運騰指他有同樣關注，只是一直等待辯方提出反對，驚訝此前無人提出，惟相信此後控方會更小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指積極運用基本法權力否決財政預算案一句應該存在&quot;&gt;區指「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」一句「應該存在」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就九龍東協調會議提問，區諾軒昨稱第二次會議曾決定不舉行「初選」，轉為舉行「棄選」，但有地區人士反對。控方今展示 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示當時譚文豪、胡志偉和施德來均認同再考慮舉辦初選，黃之鋒亦曾稱「我都支持初選，希望可以促成初選機制順利進行，唔好五區獨欠九東」。而戴耀廷亦於4月中指九西、港島和新東都同意有投票程序，新界西和超級區議會將在月底前開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及第三次會議內容，區供稱當時決定「重新搞返公民投票」，目標在5席贏取3席，亦有初步討論宣傳策略，他亦有報告選舉論壇進度。周天行問會上曾否提及初選目標，惟大律師沈士文即打斷，指上述內容昨天已問過，法官陳慶偉問：「周先生，你是否在重複自己？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周遂改為問會議後有否任何文件紀錄。區諾軒確認，會議翌日時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻曾在「35+九東立選座談會」的 WhatsApp 群組，傳出名為「35+九東final.docx」的會議摘要，指「昨晚戴教授召開九東立選協調會，會上大家同意進行初選，以上是初步協調結果，我會抽時間做份更詳細的給大家」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cNoVXSV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指無第三次會議摘要-區解釋有刪機習慣&quot;&gt;控方指無第三次會議摘要 區解釋有「刪機」習慣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問區是否能確定有人傳送該文件給他，惟李運騰即指，看不到任何文件，只有一連串數字和符號。周說區確認文件有發出，李運騰反問「但我們有那份文件嗎？」，周確認沒有，何啟明、余慧明等發笑。周天行改為問「初步協調結果」為何，區稱無法記得所有文件內容，但至少可以確認，「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」該句「應該有喺當時加喺文件裡面」，話畢被告欄起哄，柯耀林等人發笑，有被告說：「哇，應該有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區形容，該摘要是「九龍東咁多次會議黎累積底下嘅一啲討論結果」，而蔡澤鴻兩日後再補發最終版本，並附上戴耀廷就協調會議的補充。李運騰問及，在 WhatsApp 收到文件後，若仍保留手機及該訊息，該文件是否「理應仍然存在」。區解釋，因他「幾乎每個月都有刪機嘅習慣」，「所以起碼我被捕之後嗰個檔案就冇咗。」控方再問他能否確認「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」一句有加入文件，區答：「應該存在。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方關注控方提引導性問題問傳聞證供&quot;&gt;辯方關注控方提「引導性問題」、問傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 其後表示，關注控方以「引導性」的方式提問，即要求證人確認某些事情曾發生，而非問他記得發生過什麼。法官李運騰指他有同樣關注，只是一直等待辯方提出反對，在場人士發笑。Beel 說如果有引導性問題應立即停止，李再指他其實挺驚訝沒有人反對，以為代表辯方沒有爭議，惟現時辯方提出，相信控方會更小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 訊息提及，戴耀廷於《明報》發布的一篇文章，問區當時有否看過。區指因「隔得太久遠，我都唔實際記得寫嘅內容，我只能夠推斷佢寫呢篇文嘅動機」，陳志全聞言哈哈大笑。控方再問區有否看過文章，惟大律師石書銘質疑，區並不是戴耀廷，他的回答只會屬傳聞證供（heresay）或猜測（speculation），李運騰指要待區諾軒回答才可判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示蔡澤鴻曾提及九東35+初選籌備工作小組經3輪協調會議，「各派成員初步達成共識」。周天行要求區確認曾收到該訊息，大律師 Trevor Beel 再次質疑是引導性提問，法官李運騰再囑控方避免問引導性問題。周改問他曾否收過，區確認於5月收到，而蔡當時引述的「共識」便是「35+九東final」文件內的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱無出席九東定下初選制度後的兩次會議&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱無出席九東定下初選制度後的兩次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，第三次會議後，九龍東於2020年5月18日及6月中，分別舉行第四次及第五次協調會議，但他沒有出席。他解釋，因當時九東初選制度「已經上咗軌道」，即已決定勝選目標為3席，並會採用公民投票進行初選，「個制度已經喺度啦，咁所以我應該專心做其他事情」，並表示九龍東直至初選投票日前應沒有其他會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱無證據何桂藍出席記招-區諾軒即錄第11份口供-辯方批控方重塑證據&quot;&gt;稱無證據何桂藍出席記招 區諾軒即錄第11份口供 辯方批控方重塑證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今甫開庭，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 即提出，這是他首次參與沒有陪審團、由3名法官審理的高等法院審訊，而法庭任何決定均不應由單一法官作出，惟昨天他反對控方提問時，法官陳慶偉沒有與其餘兩名法官商討便立即拒絕。法官陳仲衡指，若他們有不同立場便會提出；陳慶偉亦指商討並非必須，一般而言會由主審法官決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又提及，上周曾指出控方開案陳詞中，沒有證據顯示何桂藍曾於2020年7月的抗爭派記者會出現，惟控方於上周五（10日）即為區諾軒錄取第11份證人供詞，要求他認出記者會上出現的人。Beel 批評控方似乎是在「重塑（remake）」證據，做法不恰當。李運騰指，他同樣關注控方延遲提交證據，「因控方似乎有數以月計、甚至年計的時間準備這案」，並指會考慮該些證據的比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，指戴耀廷於首次港島區協調會議上，曾倡積極運用權力否決財政預算案，遭與會的南區區議員司馬文反對，戴嘗試「迎合」他並解釋該權力「可以用，可以唔用」。區又指，即使有分歧，戴仍「好堅持」其想法，並將「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句加入協調機制文件。不過區形容，當時與會者似乎沒有對該想法有積極討論，形容他們對此「漠不關心」。此外，區諾軒稱對與會者取態「冇印象」後，控方一度再追問，惟被法官厲聲打斷：「我知道你不喜歡這個答案，但這就是答案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年3月港島首次會議-司馬文反對戴耀廷倡積極否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;2020年3月港島首次會議 司馬文反對戴耀廷倡積極否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續就香港島選區的協調會議作供。他供稱，首次會議於2020年3月26日灣仔富德樓香港獨立媒體進行，當時他、戴耀廷、趙家賢、許智峯、羅冠聰、司馬文、羅健熙、人民力量成員，以及同案被告鄭達鴻、徐子見、梁晃維和彭卓棋團隊均有出席，楊雪盈則派了代表出席，眾人並以「35+港島」的 WhatsApp 群組溝通。他重申絕大部分參與初選者都有出席協調會議，又補充「新界西我冇參與過，所以我唔能夠評論新界西嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，會上先由戴耀廷介紹35+計劃，並與九龍東協調會議一樣，傳閱由戴耀廷準備、名為「35+ 計劃」的文件。他指「特別注意到香港島嘅選票係比較緊張」，民主派派出4人參選，「已經好掹掹緊」，會上決定港島要爭取4席後，司馬文曾建議該區以「投4票」的機制進行初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，當時戴耀廷已開始建議「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」，但遭南區區議員司馬文反對。他指戴當時嘗試解釋「積極」一字，意思是「你可以用，你可以唔用，但如果政府唔聽民意，我就使用呢個憲制權力」，以「嘗試迎合司馬文嘅睇法」。在法官詢問下，他指沒有印象戴如何進一步闡述何為「唔聽民意」，但強調戴每次引述都是他上述所記憶的定義。周天行問及會上有否其他反對聲音，區指「相關嘅討論我再冇其他印象」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求區諾軒講述事實-而非相信什麼&quot;&gt;官要求區諾軒講述事實 而非「相信」什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示「35+ 計劃 Project 35+」的文件，問與會者有否就該文件討論。區表示「我相信重點集中喺第5點」，因該點提及港島區議席數目。惟陳仲衡指，法庭並不關注他「相信什麼」，而是「當時發生什麼事」。李運騰亦問區說「我相信」是代表他不肯定，抑或只是一種說話方式（manner of speech），有被告發笑。陳慶偉補充：「假如我是你的話，我會說『對，重點在第5點』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續回應：「我認為當日係有討論第5點」，惹來眾人大笑和起哄，有被告說「哇」，身處第一庭觀看直播的黃之鋒亦不斷搖頭。法官李運騰再提醒：「我們懂得怎麼說廣東話，也懂得外行人如何說話（how laymen speak），但我們現時在專業的法庭，如果你肯定便說肯定，不肯定便說不肯定，不記得便說不記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒遂改稱「我肯定當日有討論」，並指戴耀廷或許有介紹文件內容，「我相信有部分內容我都有介紹嘅」，解釋會議上凡有關選舉論壇事宜，皆由他介紹，而「有時若果戴耀廷講嘅論點唔足夠，我會作出補充」，但因「時間太久遠」，故沒有印象特別介紹哪一點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區首次會議後戴傳港島協調機制初稿-加積極運用權力否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：首次會議後戴傳港島協調機制初稿 加「積極運用權力否決財政預算案」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒提及，首次港島區會議後，戴耀廷曾草擬一份名為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」的文件，個別地傳予每個與會者。控方展示該文件，問戴為何準備。區指他理解文件的存在，是戴耀廷為總結首次會議上的想法而設，他不記得文件上是否每點都曾在會議討論，但戴目的是希望所有人知悉文件內容。李運騰問文件有沒有修改、或有人指出有不正確的地方，區指此乃初稿，「喺往後嘅會議，的確有一啲內容係有另一啲變化嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指港島區與會者對積極否決財政預算案漠不關心&quot;&gt;區諾軒指港島區與會者對「積極否決財政預算案」漠不關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後將「35+ 計劃」及「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」兩份文件並置，顯示後者提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，區重申是司馬文在首次會議反對的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，若當時有不同意見，為何新一份文件有該說法。區解釋，因戴耀廷在每個會議「都好堅持講佢嘅諗法，然後將佢對35+嘅諗法，加入去協調機制嘅內容裡面」，但區指，當時與會人士並未對該想法有很積極的討論，「我相信係因為大家未意識到⋯⋯」陳仲衡此時再打斷，提醒不是在問他「相信」什麼，區即指：「我只能話喺當時嘅會議，與會人士漠不關心」，又指「如果真係有人關心，我會有好深印象」，他在往後的會議亦會引述有關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否代表第一次會議的出席者對「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」這一點沒有共識？區回答：「與會人士諗法存在分歧。」李再指：「那即是沒有共識？」區諾軒確認，但同意該句還是由戴耀廷加入文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師馬維騉一度指出，傳譯主任將「漠不關心」翻譯為「totally ignored」，希望更正為「indifferent」，惟法官李運騰提議改做「they did not care」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島共辦5次會議-羅冠聰料無法入閘提議靈童制作替補制&quot;&gt;港島共辦5次會議 羅冠聰料無法入閘提議「靈童制」作替補制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方後再問及，除司馬文外，港島區會上是否沒有其他人對否決財政預算案提出異議，區同意。法官陳慶偉再問，那有沒有人表明不關心否決財政預算案，區則表示「冇印象」。周天行再追問他沒有印象是什麼意思，惟法官陳慶偉即厲聲打斷：「沒有印象，多謝，我知道你不喜歡這個答案，但這就是答案。（“No recollection, thank you. I know you don’t like the answer, but this is the answer.”）」被告欄傳出笑聲。法官李運騰亦指，「如果證人說沒有印象，我不認為還可以繼續問下去」，周說因不肯定區指「冇印象」是指有否發生，李運騰再反問：「如果已經說了沒有印象，他還怎樣告訴你其他人說過什麼？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，港島區共有4次協調會議，他有份主持所有會議。第二次和第三次會議分別於2020年4月17日及5月19日舉行，出席人數與首次大致相同，袁嘉蔚於第三次會議才出現，徐子見缺席其中一次，至於戴耀廷則不肯定有否出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方要求他由第二次會議內容說起，惟區指他「真係分唔到邊次係第二次講、邊次係第三次講」，問：「請問我可唔可以兩次一齊講？」他其後指，第二或第三次會議上，關於替補機制有較大爭議，其中楊雪盈和徐子見傾向以「排名制」作為替補機制；羅冠聰則預算自己很大機會無法「入閘」，故傾向採用「靈童制」，在他無法參選時指定袁嘉蔚出選。會議最後協調以「靈童制」作港島替補機制。當區提及羅冠聰指定袁嘉蔚參選，在延伸庭的袁將頭仰後，並摸了一下額頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示第四次會議於2020年6月舉行，時間很短，基本上有份參加初選的人士都有出席。他指，當時一直有找香港民意研究所合作設計初選投票程式的戴耀廷，與程式公司溝通後，發現無法處理投4票的選項，故望港島有份參與人士「考慮由4票轉返1票」，區形容「與會者無奈接受」。區續指，初選舉行後，於2020年7月有第5次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒續就九龍西的初選協調會議作供，他憶述其中一名與會者張崑陽提及戴耀廷的文章〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，戴重申「參選立法會要有心理準備做唔到4年」。張崑陽又表示支持否決財政預算案，惟岑子杰提出質疑，指「講抗爭，邊有人及得上社民連」，但他仍要支持民生議案包括全民退休保障。區諾軒又表示：「當我睇到呢篇文章，曾經同佢（戴耀廷）講，我話佢嘅想法太瘋狂。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;政治聯繫尷尬者能否參選-戴只要認同五大訴求便可&quot;&gt;政治聯繫「尷尬」者能否參選？ 戴：只要認同「五大訴求」便可&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒下午就九龍西協調會議作供。他指首兩次會議分別於2020年3月24日及4月26日舉行，首次會議出席者除了他之外，還有戴耀廷、何啟明、劉偉聰、馮達浚、岑子杰、黃碧雲助理、毛孟靜助理、油尖旺區議會主席林健文及前立法會議員劉小麗。社區前進的代表有出席第一次會議，至於趙家賢則不肯定有否出席。區交代上述各人的政治聯繫後，再表示：「依家補充返，有個人都有出席兩次會議：張崑陽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒憶述，會議曾討論的議題包括政治聯繫較「尷尬」的人，例如新思維的狄志遠，是否可以參與初選。傳譯主任一度翻譯「尷尬」為「embarrassed」，惟區諾軒隨即指正應譯為「ambiguous」。區續指，戴耀廷當時回答是，「只要認同『五大訴求』就可以參選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷九西會議提否決財政預算-未得到太大關注&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷九西會議提否決財政預算 「未得到太大關注」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒指，會上亦曾討論九龍西選區的目標，戴耀廷認為6席裡民主派最多可以贏得4席，而與會者認為九西做法可以較寬鬆，可容許初選推薦4至6張名單參選正式的立法會選舉，直至選舉後期才棄選。會上另有討論初選論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，戴耀廷亦在會議提及「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」，做法與早前提及其他區的會議差不多，即會上先傳閱「35+計劃」的文件，會後再傳閱另一份九龍西協調機制的文件，並指「就我記憶，當時有關字眼並未得到太大關注」。控方再問戴耀廷是否曾就此「討論」，區更正說法，指準確而言應是戴「介紹」該權力「可以用，可以唔用」，若政府不聽民意就可動用，但他沒有印象其他人參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區憶述岑子杰質疑否決財案-因需支持民生議案&quot;&gt;區憶述岑子杰質疑否決財案 因需支持民生議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二次協調會議，區諾軒指出席人士與首次會議相若，其中劉小麗沒有出席。會上曾討論邀請區議員辦事處和「黃店」作為票站，又集中討論應派多少張名單參選立法會，與會者認為應先投票，再於初選後討論推薦出選名單數目，並以5席為目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，張崑陽曾提及有留意戴耀廷的文章〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，引發戴在該會議重申文章理念，認為「參選立法會要有心理準備做唔到4年」。張崑陽回應他支持否決財政預算案，惟社民連岑子杰即提出質疑，稱：「講抗爭，邊有人及得上社民連」，但他亦要支持某些民生議案，例如全民退休保障，在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言一度發笑。惟區對其他人有否表達意見沒有印象。傳譯主任打算翻譯「全民退休保障」一字時遲疑數秒，法官見狀即指出「universal retirement scheme」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒攬炒十步想法太瘋狂&quot;&gt;區諾軒：「攬炒十步」想法「太瘋狂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指就着會議不同看法，戴耀廷再重申他使用「積極運用」字眼的用意，「由此可見，佢用呢個字眼處理會議上面唔同觀點。」控方其後問及，區有否看過〈真攬炒十步〉一文，區指在文章刊出不久後讀過，戴亦曾向他講過一次，並補充「喺度我想加個註腳」：「當我睇到呢篇文章，曾經同佢（戴耀廷）講，我話佢嘅想法太瘋狂。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，他提及在新界東第二次協調會議上，鄒家成曾質問戴耀廷，為何初選文件的條款，要稱「積極」運用基本法權力否決財政預算案，而非「會」否決預算案，並引起激烈辯論；而社民連曾稱若有全民退保等民生項目，亦會支持預算案。區又指，鄒家成希望即場投票用「積極」還是「會」字眼，但最後不成事，戴解釋用「積極」一字「比乜都唔用行前一步」，「希望寫得彈性少少。」法官陳慶偉問到，鄒是否想有一個「較確定」運用否決權的說法，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷新東會上提五大訴求為目標無印象有否傳閱35計劃文件&quot;&gt;戴耀廷新東會上提「五大訴求」為目標、無印象有否傳閱35+計劃文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒下午就新界東協調會議作供，他指曾出席兩次新界東協調會議，分別於2020年4月14日及5月5日，每次各約20人出席。有參加初選的出席者包括：鄒家成、何桂藍、柯耀林、李芝融、呂智恆及劉頴匡，部分人派助理或代表出席，包括民主黨林卓廷派莊榮輝、社民連梁國雄派陳寶瑩、新民主同盟范國威派關永業、人民力量陳志全派助理、公民黨楊岳橋派助理。而沒有參加初選的與會者，包括：區諾軒、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、時任沙田區議會主席程張迎、羅庭德、羅庭輝、街工代表盧藝賢。至於參加初選的林景楠兩次均沒有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，第一次會議中，戴耀廷介紹新東當選目標，希望在9席之中贏到6席，亦表示預設公民投票及棄選機制，並討論舉辦選舉論壇，但區沒有印象有否傳閱九龍東和港島會議均有傳閱的「35+計劃」文件。區亦指，「相信」戴曾提及「五大訴求」，指五大訴求是35+初選爭取的其中一個目標，法官陳仲衡提他勿用「我相信」，他遂改稱「佢係有講過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃浩銘曾致電區稱不要答應否決預算案&quot;&gt;黃浩銘曾致電區稱不要答應否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區供稱，5月5日的第二次會議前，社民連副主席黃浩銘曾致電他，說「陣間開會，唔好應承人哋會否決財政預算案嘅講法」。陳慶偉問黃為何如此說，區解釋其實他當時不太知道會議將發生什麼事，但黃的說話令他思考待會是否有人會討論該問題，他並回應他「知悉（acknowledge）」其意見，但對其餘對話沒有印象。黃最後沒有出席會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成質問戴耀廷為何用積極而非會字&quot;&gt;鄒家成質問戴耀廷為何用「積極」而非「會」字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，第二次會議開始後不久，鄒家成就質問戴耀廷，為何在35+計劃中，要稱「積極」運用基本法權力否決財政預算案，而非直接表示「會」否決財政預算案。法官李運騰問及他如何理解鄒的話，區指鄒當時應是察悉在協調機制內有「積極運用權力」的條文，並指當時戴耀廷在不同地區的協調會議，「不斷地建議加入『積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案』嘅條款」，他不知道有多少人知悉該句子及當中的爭議，但當時若有人知道並作討論，「喺當時嘅狀況可以理解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;與會者開始激烈辯論並批評傳統泛民&quot;&gt;與會者開始激烈辯論並批評傳統泛民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;傳譯主任一度將「質問」翻譯為「query」和「question」，法官李運騰遂問，鄒家成當時的語氣是敵對（hostile）還是普通疑問。區表示「我理解當時候最初都未係好緊張」，只是鄒與戴進行對話，但後來卻引伸到與會人士開始有「激烈辯論」。他指，會上許多其他地區人士亦有參與討論，並對傳統泛民政黨作出批評，包括民主黨、街工以及公民黨。鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴稱用積極是望彈性少少-區同意鄒家成想更明確運用否決權&quot;&gt;戴稱用「積極」是望「彈性少少」 區同意鄒家成想更明確運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，當民主黨被批評時，林卓廷助理莊榮輝表示，民主黨中委會無授權他處理有關問題；而社民連代表陳寶瑩亦質疑，若有民生項目例如全民退保，社民連亦會支持。街工盧藝賢則有回應不同意，但區不記得他實際所說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，鄒家成其後希望即場投票，決定文件用「積極」還是「會」的字眼，但最後「唔成事」。而戴耀廷的回應是「不如用『積極』，『積極』都比乜都唔用行前一步，希望可以寫得彈性少少」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ChhJ0NV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，「『會積極』運用權力於4時半休庭」，和「『會』運用權力於4時半休庭」 ，哪個意思較為「肯定（certain）」？區指「『會』係較為確定」和直接（straightforward）。法官陳慶偉最後問到，以區理解，鄒是否想更明確運用否決權力（“… he wants a more definitive use of vetoing power?”），區說「係有呢個含意」。陳慶偉續說區可以離席，「我們絕對會休庭。（“We will definitely adjourn.”）」被告欄和旁聽席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eTZ8cP2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。首名控方證人、同案認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，供稱戴耀廷2020年1月飯局曾明確提及取得立會過半後要「兩次否決財政預算案，解散立法會，令行政長官下台」，惟因當時不清楚其他團體是否願意參與初選，故與戴耀廷於2月至3月期間，分別或一起與政黨及有意參選者會面，包括公民黨、梁晃維、黃之鋒、朱凱廸、彭卓棋和劉頴匡等。其中公民黨有人曾對電子投票有保留，因認為可能有利較激進的候選人當選；黃之鋒則認為區將要離港留學，認為他「冇必要搞初選」，區解釋黃意見與初選無關，「佢只係以朋友嘅身分去忠告我啫。」在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言後搖頭苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又提及，與梁晃維見面時從無提及戴耀廷否決財政預算案的想法，因「我唔認為初選要係一個綑綁議員當選後工作嘅計劃」，又指當時環境當選人會否用《基本法》權力否決預算案並非值得關心的議題，因該否決權在《基本法》訂明，過往許多民主派議員反對財政預算案亦「一路相安無事」。法官李運騰要求區停止發表演說，以善用法庭時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴指大殺傷力憲制武器為兩次否決財政預算解散立會令特首下台&quot;&gt;區：戴指「大殺傷力憲制武器」為兩次否決財政預算、解散立會令特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;架黑色粗框眼鏡、穿灰色毛衣的區諾軒，今在3名懲教陪同下，經特別通道出庭作供，全程被懲教人員看守。區昨日供稱，於2020年1月尾與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人和黃浩銘的飯局內，首次談及初選，戴並指若立會過半，將是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可利用《基本法》賦予的權力行使否決權，包括否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今指，關於「大殺傷力憲制武器」的說法，可參考戴耀廷3月尾在《蘋果日報》發布的文章。惟法官陳仲衡提醒，現時證供仍圍繞1月飯局，尚未到3月的文章，法官李運騰亦要求他直接引述與會者說法，並問戴耀廷在飯局上有否提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後欲再引3月的文章以助闡析戴的論述，惟法官陳仲衡再次打斷，指現時有如問及肥皂劇情節，正在說第一集時，區不應以第20集的內容解釋第一集內容，「我們仍然在第一集。」區遂說，「咁我不如直接講」，指戴耀廷當時闡述「大殺傷力憲制武器」，是指「兩次否決財政預算案，解散立法會，令行政長官下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區會上討論民主動力負責初選行政工作&quot;&gt;區：會上討論民主動力負責初選行政工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，當時曾討論如何安排初選行政工作，而李永達認為「民主動力」過往曾進行初選和泛民主派協調工作，他們討論民主動力可負責收集報名表及作出宣傳，他遂在會面後聯絡民主動力召集人趙家賢，指「搵佢係順理成章嘅事」。區並指，因當時他完成立法會議員公職，有一段長時間在香港，李永達建議他任初選協調人與戴耀廷合作推動初選，他表明同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;對初選構想有分歧-遂接觸其他有意參選者及政治團體&quot;&gt;對初選構想有分歧 遂接觸其他有意參選者及政治團體&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行問，飯局後區諾軒與戴耀廷有否就推行初選計劃作商討。區指當時面對的問題，是不清楚應用「民調」抑或「公民投票」的機制，並提及飯局有一個「重點分歧」，就是不知道其他政治團體是否願意參與初選，特別是李永達與李卓人都不同意舉行公民投票，「因為當你連其他團體肯唔肯參加都傾唔成嘅時候，公民投票所用嘅資源，一定比淨係做一個民調貴同代價高，選舉申報都會多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續指，當時討論認為需進一步接觸有意參選立法會的民主派人士，而由於對初選構想有分歧，故透過李永達與李卓人聯絡梁家傑，望由他介紹與公民黨會面。最終於2020年2月，他、戴耀廷、李永達和李卓人一起與梁家傑會面，會上戴耀廷重複其立會過半的願景，但不確定有否詳細提及否決預算案令行政長官下台的步驟。區續引述梁家傑稱，由於他已退下前線政治工作，故轉介他們去公民黨執委會會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴赴公民黨執委會-公民黨對電子票有保留因或有利激進者當選&quot;&gt;區戴赴公民黨執委會 公民黨對電子票有保留因或有利激進者當選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，於2020年2月與戴耀廷兩人，往公民黨炮台山總部的執委會介紹初選工作，當時有約10名執委在場，他記得的公民黨成員包括梁家傑、賴仁彪、譚文豪、陳淑莊和余若薇。區指，當時將1月飯局提出的想法諮詢公民黨意見，包括應做民調還是公民投票、公民投票要投電子票還是實體票、他們是否同意協調各區出選等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區憶述，戴在會上再次提及對立會過半的願景，並提及運用《基本法》權力，兩次否決財政預算案並解散立法會，「最壞嘅後果」是行政長官下台。惟他形容，陳淑莊對戴耀廷說法「有保留」，因公民黨當時望推林瑞華參選功能組別飲食界，而功能組別會因界別利益，在處理財政預案的議題與地區直選有「唔同嘅諗法」，故考慮是否否決財政預算案時「會有較大嘅困難」。他又指，公民黨有人對只用電子票進行公民投票有保留，因若只是網上投票，其政治後果「可能係有利較激進嘅候選人當選」。他表示，對於初選計劃，公民黨「並冇話支持，只係話會後考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區與梁晃維黃子悅會面介紹初選-無提及否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區與梁晃維、黃子悅會面介紹初選 無提及否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，與公民黨執委會面後，在2020年2月至3月期間，他與戴耀廷各自與「有機會參與立法會選舉的民主派人士」會面，他本人曾與梁晃維、黃子悅、黃之鋒、朱凱廸4人會面。此時坐在延伸庭觀看直播的梁晃維、黃之鋒、朱凱迪3人聞言後竊笑，梁晃維轉身望向黃之鋒，再與朱凱廸交談。區指，他分開會見梁晃維及黃子悅，而黃之鋒及朱凱廸則是一同會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3aoJUDx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 朱凱廸（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區憶述，他於2020年2月在梁晃維的議員辦事處與他會面，當時可能有梁的議員助理在場，但只有他與梁對話。他當時問及梁有否興趣參與初選，並只是解釋初選是揀選民主派代表的制度，但因為「我唔認為初選要係一個綑綁議員當選後工作嘅計劃」，故從無提及戴耀廷提出否決財政預算案等想法。區指，梁當時並無回應是否參與初選，只是稱如有進一步資訊，區可再與他聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，他於2020年2月至3月左右於黃子悅會面，向她介紹一樣的內容，並簡單介紹民主派如要在立法會「再下一城」可如何實現。黃向他提及「想知道初選係乜嘢嚟」，他認為據其印象，黃當時「只係想了解初選究竟係乜嘢嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區與黃之鋒朱凱迪會面-黃作為朋友認為無必要舉辦初選&quot;&gt;區與黃之鋒、朱凱迪會面 黃作為朋友認為無必要舉辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續憶述，他於2020年2月至3月左右，在朱凱廸於立法會的議員辦事處內，與黃之鋒及朱凱廸會面。區形容會面「好唔正式」，因朱當時正參與立法會會議。區續指，他向二人提及他與戴耀廷將會舉辦初選，並指初選是為民主派於立法會爭取最大勝算的計劃。區指，當時朱凱廸「因為掛住開立法會，所以佢唔係好關心（初選）」，而黃之鋒則「直情覺得我冇必要去搞初選𠻹」，因當時區「就嚟去讀書」，「佢直情唔贊成我搞初選𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問，區只是任初選籌劃者，而非參加者，將要離港讀書與不搞初選有何關係，區遂說：「其實黃之鋒嘅意見係同初選無關，佢只係以朋友嘅身分去忠告我啫。」黃之鋒聞言後搖頭苦笑，梁晃維則望向身旁的譚凱邦，坐在延伸庭的公眾人士則望向被告發笑。區續指，他不記得他當時有何回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴稱與張可森鄒家成等見面-辯方反對傳聞證供無效&quot;&gt;區：戴稱與張可森、鄒家成等見面 辯方反對「傳聞證供」無效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行再問及區諾軒，戴耀廷與何人會面。區表示他不肯定戴與誰會面，但指戴提及曾與張可森、呂智恆、鄒家成、天水連線成員、區政聯盟成員、民主黨成員會面。惟他不清楚戴分開或一同與上述人士會面，亦不記得上述政黨有什麼成員參與會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，戴耀廷有否告訴他會面內容，此時何桂藍的代表大律師 Trevor Beel 起身反對，指屬傳聞證供（heresay），惟法官陳慶偉僅說：「No. Allow.」周天行遂繼續發問，區回應戴沒向他提及討論內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區彭卓棋關心勝算多於否決預算案-稱基本法訂明否決權故當時不關心&quot;&gt;區：彭卓棋關心勝算多於否決預算案 稱《基本法》訂明否決權故當時不關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，2月至3月期間與戴耀廷會見彭卓棋和劉頴匡團隊，其中彭卓棋團隊包括維多利亞社區協會的李永財，會面在天后的李永財議員辦事處進行。會上他與戴介紹初選計劃並徵詢使用電子票抑或實體票等，戴有提及立會過半願景，即民主派可掌握否決權，但至於有否詳細闡述整個流程，即否決財政預算案及特首下台，則沒有清晰印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行一度要求區諾軒闡述戴有關初選目的之說法。區回應「我相信大家都好關心戴耀廷究竟嗰時具體嘅論述講咗啲乜」，並指2021年8月落口供時憶述戴耀廷對立會過半的表述，初選目的具體而言就是爭取立會過半以爭取否決權，再爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行遂問，戴初選的目標為何，惟陳慶偉打斷指區已回答是取得立會過半、否決財政預算案及爭取五大訴求；周天行再問有否提及否決財政預算案，官再打斷指區已表示沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 主控 副刑事檢控專員 周天行（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續形容，彭當時「唔關心立會過半點運用權力嘅問題」，但關心使用電子票或實體票，「因為用乜嘢制度對佢嘅勝算係有影響嘅。」被問到為何不關心如何運用立會過半的權力，他指因當時參選立法會的環境，大家並不認為當選人會否用《基本法》權力否決預算案是「好值得關心的議題」，並提出「兩個觀察」，即《基本法》第49條和第52條有提及運用該否決權，「大家就覺得好理所當然」；而且以往許多民主派政黨或議員，「一路都係每一次財政預算案都係投反對票，一路都係相安無事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官着區諾軒停止發表演說善用時間&quot;&gt;官着區諾軒停止發表演說、善用時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳仲衡詢問下同意，上述均是他的「整體觀察」，並非會面上確實提及。法官李運騰遂指，「區先生，你要了解你作為證人的身份，若你停止發表演說並集中回答問題，可以節省我們許多時間（“It would save us a lot of time if you stop making speeches and concentrate on the question.”）」，又說「我們每天只有4小時審訊時間，所以請協助我們善用時間，否則我們會審到明年（“We only have 4 hours of sitting time every day, so please help us to use the time economically, otherwise we will be here until next year.”）」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續在法官詢問下，指彭卓棋在會上曾表示實體投票會對他「不利」，因他是「政治素人」，相較傳統政黨會較少地區動員能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於與劉頴匡的會面，是2020年3月在大圍一間餐廳，區憶述戴耀廷當時介紹初選制度、如何爭取立會過半，亦提及立會過半可以爭取否決權，以爭取五大訴求，但記不清楚他有否談及所撰文章及闡述其他內容。他亦不記得會上說過什麼或劉頴匡會上回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/roKI78N.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第7天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，提及因有意參選者就投票方式、替補被「DQ」者機制等有分歧，遂與戴耀廷為5個地方選區及超級區議會選區舉辦協調會議。就九龍東選區，區供稱曾舉行3場會議，會上黃之鋒與譚得志曾就替補機制爭拗，又一度決定搞「棄選」但被推翻。區又指，戴耀廷曾準備名為「35+計劃」的文件於會上傳閱，提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」及初選機制等，戴並曾倡加入「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」一句，意指「你可以用，你可以唔用，但若果政府唔聽民意，就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟」，惟其後被另一份文件取代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，被問及會議出席者，區諾軒一度稱「我驚我背漏」，有被告面露驚訝和發笑，法官李運騰即提醒區：「你不是來背誦任何事情，你是來告訴我們你記得什麼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴組織6區協調會議-商討辦選舉論壇替補機制等分歧&quot;&gt;區戴組織6區協調會議 商討辦選舉論壇、替補機制等分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒上午供稱，2020年2月至3月期間，與戴耀廷分別或一同與民主派政黨及有意參選立法會人士會面，解說初選及徵詢意見。他續指，二人在2至3月，於教協商討如何進一步整理有意參選者意見，當中就投票方式，傳統政黨較堅持用實體票，素人或新晉團體則擔心初選只是對泛民有利，較喜歡電子票；而二人當時亦未正式決定舉辦公民投票，因素人特別擔心會「招致好大額嘅選舉開支」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，有團體質疑是否值得舉辦初選、開支是否合理，而當時多區有多名潛在參選人，「佢哋都未有機會一齊傾。」有見及此，他遂與戴耀廷在香港島、九龍東、九龍西、新界東、新界西及超級區議會6個選區，組織協調會議以商討相關分歧，並指會議目的是「焦聚」各區有意參選民主派人士，「一齊傾一個制度去推行初選」，包括應否舉辦選舉論壇、勝選人被取消資格有何替補機制，及每區當選目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行向區澄清，該些事項是否均於協調會議討論，區答「的確有」，並問：「因為啱啱咁問，係咪我有任何遺漏內容……？」周天行否認，指僅望了解區的證供，鄒家成低頭搖頭苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區邀有意參選者入whatsapp群-黃之鋒譚得志等出席九東會議&quot;&gt;區：邀有意參選者入WhatsApp群 黃之鋒、譚得志等出席九東會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒確認，當時與戴耀廷合辦6區的協調會議，並以九龍東為第一個試點。就九龍東協調會議，區供稱，首次會議於2020年3月2日順安邨安逸樓地下會議室進行。控方要求他說出有誰出席，區諾軒說「我驚我背漏，但我先講原則上先……」。被告欄傳出起哄聲音，多名被告探頭望向區，面露驚訝的林卓廷與身旁的鄒家成對視，鄒難以置信地俯身大笑，陳志全等也發笑，區定睛望向被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰即提醒區：「你不是來背誦任何事情，你是來告訴我們你記得什麼。（“You are not here to recite anything, you are here to tell us what you can remember.”）」坐在延伸庭的馮達浚聞言後發笑。區續指，基本上所有最後參選人或其代表都有出席協調會議，另各區的泛民主派區議會主席亦有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，當時他或戴耀廷會透過 WhatsApp 或電話、或委託相熟的區議會主席，逐個詢問有意參選者有否興趣出席協調會議，並在各區設立 WhatsApp 群組商討地區協調事宜。他並主動提及，九龍東的邀請過程「可以參照民主動力被繳獲嗰個 WhatsApp 紀錄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示從趙家賢手機檢取的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示九龍東協調群組名為「35+九東立選座談會」，群組管理員為蔡澤鴻，成員包括區諾軒、趙家賢、施德來、註明來自香港公開大學的黃之鋒、譚文豪、胡志偉、譚得志、民主動力職員黎敬輝。區確認除上述人士外，時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭、觀塘願景召集人梁凱晴亦有出席首次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區首次九東會議-戴耀廷未提初選目標-黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制爭拗&quot;&gt;區：首次九東會議 戴耀廷未提初選目標 黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制爭拗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行問及會議內容，區諾軒指舉行首次會議的意義，在於「如果喺九龍東都冇辦法傾得成一個機制呢，其他區都只會更難」，因九龍東選區只有5席，民主派的目標為3席，可浪費的票數少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文一度指出，傳譯主任遺漏了「九龍東選區有5席」的部分，法官李運騰遂向區表示，「傳譯主任的工作非常艱難，因為你的句子傾向冗長（wordy），並牽涉不少難以翻譯的人名及政黨名稱」，並着區「逐句逐句回答，這會令傳譯主任的工作更容易，正如我現在一樣」，有被告發笑，區諾軒亦表示「抱歉」，「我會努力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，首次會議上商討「3席係民主派喺九龍東勝算嘅目標」，亦討論是否舉辦初選論壇，他表示他將籌備。他並提及，替補機制為初選制度內很重要的元素，而當時會上主要矛盾是黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制的爭拗，黃認為應採用「靈童制」，譚則認為應採用「排名制」。提及「靈童」時陳志全、鄒家成等多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，「靈童制」是指勝出候選人若被取消資格，將有權利指定一位替補者獲35+機制承認繼續參選，而其他不獲該候選人支持的參選人則不會獲承認。惟譚得志團隊不同意，認為應按初選投票結果排名，若勝出者被取消資格，便由次選者，即排後一位的候選人，替補參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴準備35計劃文件-寫有五大訴求缺一不可及初選機制&quot;&gt;區：戴準備「35+計劃」文件 寫有「五大訴求，缺一不可」及初選機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒並指，雖戴耀廷有出席首次會議，但他只處理是否舉辦選舉論壇、有何替補機制、九龍東勝選目標等事宜，當時未有透露「他相信的」初選目的。而會議上傳閱一份由戴耀廷準備、名為「35+ 計劃／Project 35+」的文件，為35+計劃的「最原初版本」，目的為介紹初選機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示相關文件，控方指文件第一段提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」，而戴耀廷於第二及三段訂下時序，分別說明有意參選者須於2020年5月中公開表明意向，及2020年7月初會舉行公投。戴在文件亦列明，民主派於各地方選區目標議席為「6 6 4 4 3」、替補機制為「排名制」，且若候選人支持度不足，須即時停止選舉工程，並支持其他勝選者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指出，除黃之鋒反對「排名制」的替補機制，無印象其他人就文件作任何回應。他並指，蔡澤鴻曾為該會議製作摘要，並傳送到 WhatsApp 群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區第二次會議決議靈童制作替補機制不搞初選搞棄選&quot;&gt;區：第二次會議決議「靈童制」作替補機制、不搞初選搞「棄選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒供稱，第二次九龍東協調會議於2020年3月16日晚上7時半舉行，出席人士與上次相若，惟原由譚得志代表的人民力量，改由劉家鴻代表。區提及，蔡澤鴻會前希望邀請地區組織「凝聚觀塘」列席，遭黃之鋒反對。坐在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言後發笑，並與前一排的譚凱邦交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，眾人於該會議達成共識，以「靈童制」取代「排名制」作為替補機制；並決定不舉行初選，轉為舉行「棄選」（即參選人在立法會競選後期透過民調形式決定是否繼續選舉工程）。他不確定會上曾否談及初選目的，但相信不遲於第三次會議前，有更進一步關於35+初選目的之討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區第三次九東會議議決辦初選-惟傳whatsapp群表決內容搵唔到&quot;&gt;區：第三次九東會議議決辦初選 惟傳WhatsApp群表決內容「搵唔到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續表示，第二次會議決定不搞初選後，有九龍東的地區人士包括區議員或義工，望能舉辦公民投票，故於4月推動重開會議商討九龍東舉辦初選的可能，第三次會議遂於2020年5月4日舉行，出席人士大致相同，但加入觀塘區議會副主席莫建成及李梓成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，會議議決九龍東可有5名候選人於初選出選，最後有3名爭取當選。李運騰問及是否與「6 6 4 4 3」的計劃相違，區否認，指3席仍是九龍東目標，但容許更多名單參選，是因經會上的人商議，「認為可以浪費嘅選票嘅額度都頗多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確定會上曾討論重辦初選及如何宣傳初選，李運騰問有否任何書面決議，區答「理論上係有」，在 WhatsApp 群組「有個 file 傳到出嚟，但係最後喺呢單案度搵唔到 」，有被告發笑。至於有否討論初選目的，區指「唔排除有，但我唔敢100%確定」，但肯定在其中一次會議一定有討論初選目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷倡文件加積極運用基本法權力否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷倡文件加「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續提出，在不遲於第三次會議，戴耀廷曾倡議在地區文件加入一句句子，即「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」：「佢嘅解釋係：『你可以用，你可以唔用；但若果政府唔聽民意，就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟。』」陳慶偉問與會者對此句有否任何回應，區指「冇印象邊個有特別回應」，又指該句原於第三次會議前加入九東文件，但到了2020年6月又被一份新文件取代，他亦不肯定在第三次會議上曾否討論該句內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，是否即會上沒有人對該句表示同意或反對，區表示「我認為呢句係一個公道嘅說話」。他續指，認為該句話與戴耀廷的立會過半願景有關，但要理解則要結合第三次九東會議前其他區的會議情況。法官問及，戴在會上如何解釋該句句子，區稱：「九龍東佢具體點樣推銷呢一句句子，我冇好鮮明嘅印象。但就我記得，佢喺各區都有推動呢句句子成為會議文件嘅一部分。」法官指，明天將會處理該議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午4時半散庭，有被告喊「情人節快樂！」，吳政亨亦做出心形手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;傳譯主任屢被糾正-辯方批譯漏重要字眼&quot;&gt;傳譯主任屢被糾正 辯方批譯漏重要字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，以中文作供的區諾軒，今再次與法官、主控周天行及辯方大律師等不時糾正法庭傳譯主任的翻譯。其中區供稱戴耀廷於首次九東會議「尚未透露他相信的初選目的」，傳譯主任僅譯出「初選目的」，而未有提「他相信的」，遭代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘指出，指該部分「非常重要」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而區諾軒提及 WhatsApp 群組包含「35+九東」字眼時，傳譯主任直譯「Kow Tung」，周天行指出應是「Kowloon East」，被告欄再傳出笑聲。至區提及「排名制」時，傳譯主任一度猶豫：「排名制即係……」，區提議「ranking」，獲傳譯主任接納。傳譯主任將「就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟」一句翻譯為「this constitutional power should be “taken out”」，周天行糾正應為「exercised」，陳慶偉則提議「used」，獲眾人接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席的認罪被告今續被分別帶到沒有記者、只有公眾席的1號及2號延伸法庭被告欄觀看直播，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人；及岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和尹兆堅4人，意味他們無法親睹證人作供及與不認罪被告見面。認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐，昨更被安排到不同法庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒稱黃之鋒「以朋友身分忠告」不必辦初選 黃聞言搖頭苦笑 被問誰出席九東協調會 區諾軒稱「我驚我背漏」 官提醒作供非背誦</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Atoms For Sale</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-14-atoms-for-sale.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Atoms For Sale" /><published>2023-02-14T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-14T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/atoms-for-sale</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-14-atoms-for-sale.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western sanctions on the Russian economy have been expanding. Nonetheless, Russia’s nuclear energy exports have not come under economic restrictions.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation (Rosatom), which has a monopoly over the Russian nuclear industry, has continued exports of nuclear fuel and other goods relevant to the nuclear energy sector. According to Russian customs data, sourced through a third-party commercial trade data provider, Russia has exported just over $1 billion-worth of nuclear energy-related goods and materials since the start of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some customers that have historically relied on Russian nuclear energy exports – like Ukraine, Czechia and Bulgaria – have sought to diversify away from Russian supplies. However, contractual obligations and technical challenges make diversification slow and complicated – although not impossible. Additionally, generous Russian financing arrangements make Russia an attractive supplier among its other competitors in the nuclear energy sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trade data reviewed by the author shows a drop-off in Russian nuclear exports to some countries in Eastern and Western Europe since the invasion of Ukraine, but also a significant rise in the overall value of Russian nuclear energy exports in 2022. Significant increases in value can be observed in Russian nuclear energy-related exports to China, which appear to be the result of Russian exports of fuel for the Chinese CFR-600 reactor at the Xiapu nuclear power plant (NPP). In a year-on-year comparison between 2021–22, the dataset also shows increases in overall Russian nuclear exports to Hungary, Turkey and India. And while the dataset studied by the author does not span a long enough time frame to draw definitive conclusions on longterm trends in Russian nuclear energy exports, or how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might impact these trends, it does point to the importance for the Russian nuclear energy sector of markets outside North America and traditional European customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The primacy among Russian nuclear energy customers of countries that have proven reluctant to support Western sanctions on Russia so far suggests that any EU and US sanctions on Rosatom and Russian nuclear trade need to be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts if they are to be effective in significantly curtailing Russian economic gains from its nuclear energy exports. Focusing efforts on bringing countries like Turkey and Hungary on board with increasing the political and economic pressure on Moscow – including through the provision of viable and sustainable alternatives to Russian nuclear energy-related supplies – will be key. Securing China’s cooperation will undoubtedly prove more difficult. As it has in other contexts, Russia will find ways to take advantage of these divisions to its own benefit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pass-go-and-collect-1-billion&quot;&gt;Pass Go and Collect $1 Billion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UK, the US, the EU and others have introduced several rounds of Russia-focused sanctions packages. These measures have targeted both Russian individuals and certain economic sectors in an effort to curb the flow of funds that are enabling Moscow’s war effort and enriching those in Russia perpetrating and supporting it. Western sanctions have targeted Russian energy exports as a major contributor to the Russian economy. However, one component of the Russian energy market – the nuclear energy sector – has been left unsanctioned. This omission of Russian nuclear exports from Western sanctions appears to be – at least in part – the result of persistent dependencies in some countries on Russian nuclear energy fuel and reactor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs data, sourced though a third-party commercial trade data provider and reviewed by the author in collaboration with Bloomberg shows that, between March and December 2022, Russia exported just over $1 billion-worth of materials and technology of relevance to the nuclear energy sector. This trade included exports to members of NATO and the EU. In fact, not only has the value of Russian nuclear-related exports not shrunk since February 2022, the data reviewed by the author suggests that it may be expanding, with a handful of loyal customers still eager to do business with Russia’s nuclear sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v60SLfQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Monthly Transaction Values of Russian Nuclear Energy Exports Over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian nuclear energy sector is monopolised by Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation (better known as Rosatom) and its many subsidiaries. The company also appears to have been directly involved in supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rosatom staff are present at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya NPP, on the front line of Russia’s invasion. According to Ukrainian reports, Rosatom has taken over the management of the plant and have been pressuring the NPP’s Ukrainian staff to sign employment contracts with the Russian company. A recent report by the Washington Post also detailed apparent offers by Rosatom to provide components, technology and raw materials to the Russian military and Russian weapons manufacturers. However, Rosatom has not come under Western sanctions, despite calls from Ukrainian officials as well as Members of the European Parliament to impose restrictions on Russian nuclear exports. Hungary – which has insisted on maintaining its nuclear cooperation with Russia – has stated that it would veto any such attempt from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents data and analysis on continued Russian nuclear energy exports since the invasion of Ukraine and highlights some of the difficulties countries may face in diversifying away from Russian supplies. At the same time, it points to the importance of customers outside of Europe and North America for the Russian nuclear energy sector and concludes that Western sanctions on Russian nuclear exports must be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts to curtail dependencies on Russian nuclear energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-on-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Notes on Methodology and Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data presented and analysed in this report was sourced from a third-party commercial trade data provider and captures Russian exports between January 2019 and December 2022. The data includes goods that fall under five nuclear-relevant HS codes – numeric identifiers used to internationally standardise the classifications of traded goods. The HS codes, their associated goods and notes on their relevance to the civilian nuclear fuel cycle are included in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all customs information datasets, the dataset reviewed by the author in this report is incomplete and may include some inaccuracies – including missing transactions or duplicates of transactions. The dataset also clearly excludes certain export destinations – likely because they do not make their customs data publicly available. For instance, Russian nuclear exports to Iran were not captured in the dataset. The author tried her best to validate the available data by comparing it against another commercial trade dataset from a different third-party provider. Some discrepancies are inevitable when comparing any large datasets and were indeed identified when comparing this dataset against a second one. Furthermore, the availability of data over time was inconsistent across the datasets; data was not available in the second dataset past June 2022, meaning the original dataset could not be validated past that date. However, despite these discrepancies, the alternative dataset does not contradict the analysis presented in this report and, within the timeframe of the data available in the second dataset (January 2019–June 2022), confirms the general trends outlined in this piece. Nevertheless, the author has kept her analysis within the bounds of the available data in the original dataset. The reader should also engage with the data and associated analysis presented with an understanding of these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that lack of data at certain points in the dataset may indicate either a lack of transactions in that instance or missing transaction data in this particular dataset. As detailed above, the author validated – to the best of her abilities – the overall reliability of the data available but is not in a position to make a final judgement on the origin of gaps in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for Russian nuclear exports to individual countries tends to be characterised by large peaks and troughs. This is unsurprising, as trade in the nuclear sector is often made up of periodic high-value transactions – such as the delivery of nuclear fuel batches or materials for the construction of nuclear plants – instead of a consistent flow of goods. Furthermore, timelines for nuclear energy projects are significantly longer than those in other energy sectors. Well-planned NPP construction projects take about 11 to 12 years to construct and commission. For instance, the agreement between Russia and Turkey for the construction of the Akkuyu NPP was signed in 2010; construction of the first of the four planned reactors did not begin until 2018. Negotiations in advance of the start of an NPP project can also take considerable time. Commissioned reactors will then operate for decades, requiring fuel, maintenance and servicing – all of which is often bespoke to the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from a nuclear trade dataset that only spans four years – as is the case in this instance, or to assess the long-term implication of changes observed in the data from the 10 months since the invasion of Ukraine (March-December 2022). The spikes and drops in trade value captured by the data may not necessarily point to persistent trends. Some of the transactions captured in the dataset for the post-invasion period may also represent an acceleration in the delivery of contracts for goods and materials – such as nuclear fuel – in advance of countries’ diversification from Russian supplies. As such, additional data over the coming months and years will be necessary to confirm whether the trade activity seen in the dataset represents persistent trends or one-off occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the Russian nuclear sector is monopolised by Russian state corporation Rosatom. Due to the volume of transactions, the author could not definitively confirm that all instances of nuclear-related exports from Russia were on behalf of Rosatom and its group of companies. However, nearly all of the transactions reviewed by the author within the database appear to have been conducted either by a subsidiary of Rosatom or on behalf of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-dependencies&quot;&gt;Global Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have detailed elsewhere, Russia occupies a major share of the global nuclear energy market, with dependencies on Russian nuclear fuel supplies particularly high in Central and Eastern Europe, but also apparent in the US and Western Europe. In 2021, there were 44 Russian or Soviet-built VVERs (water-water energetic reactors – a type of pressurised water reactor) operating outside Russia. Seventeen of them were in Ukraine, with the rest spread across 10 other countries. Many of these were built decades ago. However, Russia is continuing to construct nuclear reactors abroad. According to Rosatom’s webpage as of January 2023, the company had 34 active NPP construction projects ‘at various implementation stages’ (although the accuracy of Rosatom’s reporting on its construction portfolio has been questioned in the past and others have counted 13 reactors actively under construction at the end of 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s role in the global nuclear market includes not only the construction of nuclear reactors, but also the mining of raw uranium, conversion of uranium ore into fuel-useable compounds, the fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies, and the provision of other services across the nuclear fuel cycle – ‘from assessing and developing key nuclear infrastructure components in customer countries to NPP decommissioning’, as the company notes in its 2021 annual report. According to the 2021 report – the latest available – Russia occupied the greatest share of the global uranium enrichment market (38%) (other sources show that it had 46% of the world’s total operational and planned uranium enrichment capacity), was second in the world in terms of uranium production (15% of the market) and third in its share of the global nuclear fuel market (17%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, many countries with civilian nuclear energy sectors face significant dependencies on Russian provision of technology, services and fuel for their operation. A May 2022 report by Matt Bowen and Paul Dabbar for Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy assessed the degree of dependency of Western markets on Russian nuclear energy supplies. Bowen and Dabbar highlight in particular the key role Russia plays in uranium conversion and enrichment for global markets, including for American and Western European nuclear energy production. In 2021, subsidiaries of Rosatom provided 31% of enrichment services to EU nuclear utilities and 28% to US ones. They point out that replacing Russian uranium enrichment and conversion capacity possible, but that additional alternative capacity will need to be brought online, likely resulting in higher nuclear fuel prices. Alternative nuclear suppliers will also need to be convinced that the resources they invest in expanding their operations will not be in vain should any restrictions on Russian nuclear supplies be rescinded in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative suppliers would also have to be found for the fabrication of nuclear fuel. A consortium of Western companies has been conducting work on the diversification of VVER fuel supply for years, focusing mainly on the production and licensing of VVER-440 fuel supplies. According to recent industry media reporting, supplies of VVER-440 fuel produced by a collaboration between US energy company Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Spanish company Enusa should be ready for deliveries in 2024. French company Framatome also produces fuel under licence from a Rosatom subsidiary, which is reportedly identical to Russian-produced VVER fuel. Diversification away from Russian nuclear fuel supplies is time consuming, costly and presents technical challenges. Western nuclear fuel production lines need to be adapted, expanded and licensed for the production of VVER fuel, while customer countries need to license new suppliers which – according to one former senior Westinghouse engineer – can take at least five years. However, despite all this – and as has been demonstrated – diversification is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bowen and Dabbar note that reactors often rely on unique components produced by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which results in significant dependence on the OEM for replacement parts and servicing. The Russian customs data reviewed by the author shows Russian nuclear energy-related exports going to 21 different countries between January 2019 and December 2022. New reactors being constructed by Rosatom will also need servicing and spare parts over their lifetimes, which is likely to perpetuate future dependencies on imports from Russia. The Rosatom project for the construction of the El Dabaa NPP in Egypt, for instance, explicitly includes provisions for personnel training and reactor maintenance for the first 10 years of the plant’s operations, as well as fuel supply over the plant’s lifetime. Even more extensive long-term maintenance and operation provisions could be built into future NPP construction projects – for instance, the ‘build-own-operate’ model, which is being used for the first time in the construction of the Akkuyu NPP in Turkey and is discussed in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fuelling-up&quot;&gt;Fuelling Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the importance of Russia as a supplier of nuclear technology has been well-established, the dataset reviewed by the author points to an increase in the dollar value of Russian nuclear energy-related exports in the last few months, driven by a handful of countries outside of North America, Western Europe and traditional Eastern European customers. According to the dataset, the value of Russian nuclear energy exports increased considerably in the second half of 2022. In a month-on-month comparison, the dataset examined by the author shows values of 2022 nuclear energy exports exceeding 2021 exports in five out of 10 months captured by the data since the invasion (March – December 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ldEHTGA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Month-on-Month Value of Russian Nuclear Energy Exports.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prior to the invasion and since March 2022, Russia’s primary nuclear-related exports – by a significant margin – came under HS code 840130 – ‘fuel elements, unirradiated’; in other words, fresh fuel for nuclear reactors. According to the trade data reviewed by the author, nuclear fuel exports accounted for about 77% of Russian nuclear exports prior to the invasion, rising to 86% between March and December 2022. Prior to March 2022, the top five destination countries for Russian nuclear fuel in the dataset – by dollar value – were Ukraine, Czechia, China, Bulgaria and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some of these customers have sought to diversify away from Russian nuclear fuel. Czechia and Bulgaria have reached agreements with French and US suppliers for the supply of nuclear fuel for some of their reactors. However, the deliveries of this fuel are not expected until 2024 in Czechia and 2025 in Bulgaria. The trade data reviewed by the author shows that Russia has continued exporting nuclear fuel into both countries after the invasion, although the value of those imports dropped from 2021 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is of course the most obvious case of diversification away from Russian nuclear fuel supplies. Hosting 17 VVER reactors, Ukraine has relied heavily on Russian imports of nuclear fuel to keep the units powered. In the last year – and even before then – it became clear that this dependency was no longer feasible. After Moscow’s initial incursion into Ukraine in 2014, Westinghouse was granted contracts to supply nuclear fuel to a number of Ukraine’s VVER reactors. The company – which has the capability to produce fuel for VVER-1000 reactors – was reportedly supplying fuel for six of the country’s reactors as of April 2022. Ukraine went from being the top export destination for Russian nuclear reactor fuel prior to the invasion to not importing any at all after the end of February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TsGbbP5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases of China and Hungary, the dataset reviewed by the author shows the two countries assuming a larger proportion of Russian nuclear fuel exports since March 2022. In fact, the value of Russian nuclear fuel exports to Hungary in the 10 months between March and December 2022 far exceeds that of any of the previous three years. According to the transaction details captured in the data, the deliveries were for Hungary’s Paks NPP. In August 2022, Hungary controversially decided to go ahead with issuing permits for Rosatom construction of two new nuclear reactors at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data also shows a clear spike in Russian exports of nuclear fuel to China in the second half of 2022, which appears to be primarily driven by the export – for the first time – of Russian fuel for the CFR-600 fast neutron reactor currently under construction at China’s Xiapu NPP in Fujian Province. The supply of fuel for the CFR-600 reactor is part of a set of 2018 Russo-Chinese agreements on nuclear energy cooperation, which includes Russian commitments for the delivery of fuel, equipment and services for the Chinese-built CFR-600. The trade data shows three separate batches of nuclear fuel assemblies being exported to China in September, November and December 2022. This data corroborates public reporting of the fuel deliveries. Data for December 2022 also shows the export to China of control and protection system assemblies for the CFR-600 reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CFR-600 is a sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor. According to assessments by the US Department of Defense, the reactor could be used as a breeder reactor; this means that the reactor may be capable of producing more fissile material than it consumes. This has raised concerns that the reactor could be used for the production of plutonium, which could in turn be used for fuel in nuclear weapons, among unconfirmed suspicions that China may be expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that China is diverting – or planning to divert – plutonium from the CFR-600 to nuclear weapons production and some experts have suggested that there are more efficient ways for Beijing to increase its weapons-usable plutonium stockpiles than relying on a breeder reactor designed for civilian energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other Russian nuclear fuel shipments to China recorded in the dataset appear to be for the Russian-built Tainwan-3 VVER reactor. Rosatom is also due to construct four new reactor units at the Tainwan and Xudabao NPPs. One of these began construction on 25 February 2022 – the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and the other in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-nuclear-family&quot;&gt;The Nuclear Family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of trends in overall Russian nuclear energy-related exports, across all HS categories, also point to the emergence of several loyal customers for the Russian nuclear energy market. As many countries look to diversify their sourcing of nuclear energy supplies, a handful of others appear to be increasing Russian imports of nuclear goods and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BX2fFAJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Changes in the Value of Russia’s Nuclear Exports Between 2021 and 2022 by Destination Country.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before March 2022, the dataset shows that the top five destination countries for Russian nuclear exports were Ukraine, China, Czechia, Bulgaria and Hungary, with India not far behind. Since March, exports to Ukraine have stopped entirely according to the data. Other destinations for Russian nuclear exports also disappear from the dataset from March 2022 onwards, including the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands. However, even in the three years prior to March 2022, Russian nuclear energy exports to these countries made up a very small proportion of the entire dataset. As mentioned earlier, it is possible that more significant exports took place before 2019 and materials were stockpiled. However, the relatively small proportion of Russian nuclear energy exports to these countries suggests that Western customers – and retaining access to those export markets – will be relatively less important to Russia than customers in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s priority is likely to be focused on retaining and growing business in a handful of apparently loyal customers that remain less enthusiastic about imposing sanctions on the Russian economy. The data shows that both the relative share and net value of overall nuclear exports to China has skyrocketed, driven almost exclusively by the spike in the value of Russian nuclear fuel exports to China in the second half of 2022, which were discussed earlier. The relative and absolute value of Russian exports to Hungary has also grown, consisting – as before the invasion – almost entirely of nuclear fuel exports. The data also shows a significant amount of Russian nuclear exports going to India in the first half of 2022 – consisting of deliveries of nuclear fuel (HS 840130) and nuclear reactor components (HS 840140) – but dropping off after June of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Value of Russian Nuclear Energy Export Transactions to China Over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another country which – according to the data – continues to import a significant amount of Russian nuclear-related goods and materials, and whose importance in Russia’s nuclear export market has grown since March 2022, is Turkey. The data shows that Russian nuclear exports to Turkey took a dip in the first few months of the invasion but have since rallied in both relative and absolute terms. While future trade data will help to determine whether the importance of Turkey as a market for Russian nuclear exports will continue to grow, such a trend would not be surprising. Rosatom is in the process of constructing Turkey’s first nuclear power plant – the Akkuyu NPP, on the country’s Mediterranean coast. The project is the result of a 2010 agreement signed between the Russian and Turkish governments and – according to Rosatom – is the ‘largest project in the history of Russian-Turkish cooperation’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is the first application of the ‘build-own-operate’ model for nuclear reactor construction; under this arrangement, Rosatom will maintain ownership of the NPP after its construction, selling the generated electricity to a Turkish utility company – thus expecting to make a guaranteed profit off the project. According to the project’s webpage, Rosatom companies own nearly 100% of the project. When completed, the Akkuyu NPP will host four VVER-1200 reactors and is expected to generate 35 billion kWh per year – an estimated 10% of Turkey’s electricity. Construction of the first reactor began in April 2018 and of the fourth in July 2022. Descriptions of Russian exports to Turkey within the dataset reviewed by the author clearly identify shipments of nuclear reactor parts and other technology for the construction of the Akkuyu NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the methodology section of this report, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions on long-term trends in Russian nuclear exports just from looking at four years of trade data and especially from any movement in the 10 months following the invasion of Ukraine. The trends observed in the post-invasion trade data align with expectations on shifts in Russian nuclear energy customers, as a result of efforts in some countries – and publicly reported resistance in others – to diversify away from Russian nuclear energy supplies. However, additional data over the coming months and years will help confirm – or disprove – these apparent trends. For now, the observed increases in Russian nuclear energy exports to certain destinations in the reviewed dataset are best viewed as general confirmation of these countries’ commitments to nuclear cooperation with Russia, rather than a rapid expansion of these relationships since the start of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-for-a-penny&quot;&gt;In For a Penny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the aforementioned dependencies and difficulties in diversifying suppliers, several factors continue to make Russia an attractive supplier for existing and new customers. One key consideration is Moscow’s willingness to extend attractive financing schemes for its NPP construction projects abroad. As Matthew Bowen and Alec Apostoaei highlight in a recent report on government financing of nuclear reactor exports, the debt and equity arrangements that Rosatom is able to provide are government-backed and their conditions are not limited by restrictions placed on US, French and South Korean competitors by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). As such, the authors note, Russian financing arrangements are consistently more generous and attractive than other suppliers are able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such financing arrangements likely serve as an important motivator for countries that may not be able to front the costs of an NPP construction project themselves. Equally, they create commitments that are financially difficult to disentangle from down the road. For instance, Rosatom’s construction of two new units at Hungary’s Paks NPP is expected to cost €12.4 billion, with Russia providing €10 billion as a loan under a repayment period of 16 years. Russia is also providing Egypt with a $25 billion loan for the construction by Rosatom of the El Dabaa NPP, out of a total estimated cost of $60 billion. The repayment term for that arrangement is reportedly 22 years. In Bangladesh, Russia extended a loan for $11.4 billion, with a repayment term of 20 years for the construction of the Rooppur NPP. The loan represents 90% of the total original cost of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the regulatory requirements for the export of US nuclear technology versus nuclear exports from Russia as well as other major suppliers may also allow Rosatom to be a more nimble and attractive supplier, at least in relation to US competitors. In instances where the US wishes to make significant transfers of nuclear material or technology, US law generally requires the conclusion of a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act (commonly known as a ‘123 Agreement’). These agreements outline requirements around specific non-proliferation criteria that recipient countries must meet in order to receive US technology; 123 Agreements are reviewed – and may therefore be rejected or delayed – by the US Congress. Furthermore, these agreements require periodic renewal. The expiry of the US’ 123 Agreement with South Africa in December 2022 has meant that Westinghouse lost its US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licence to export nuclear fuel components to the country’s Koeberg NPP. As others have outlined elsewhere, while Russia also includes non-proliferation and export-control measures in its nuclear cooperation agreements, they are less extensive than those applied by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trade data reviewed by the author demonstrates, Russia’s nuclear export sector has continued to thrive since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. This trade in nuclear technology will directly benefit state corporation Rosatom, which appears to be actively supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some have called for the Russian nuclear industry to be sanctioned. Others have taken it into their own hands to find alternative suppliers for their nuclear energy sectors. On 5 February, Kyiv took the step of sanctioning 200 entities connected to the Russian nuclear sector. A few days earlier, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for sanctions on Rosatom and an embargo on imports of Russian uranium. Such actions are helpful and should be actively pursued as part of broader national and multilateral efforts to place economic pressure on Moscow and Russian entities supporting Russia’s invasion and atrocities in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sanctioning Rosatom and its subsidiaries, the US and EU can make it more difficult for the corporation to operate within the international financial system and to access certain services – like insurance – that it would need to move its wares to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as demonstrated by the trade data reviewed by the author, Russia’s most important customers for nuclear energy exports are located outside Western Europe and North America, and Russia appears to be increasingly reliant on business from countries that have shown less enthusiasm for sanctioning its economy. As such, for any US and EU sanctions on Rosatom and the Russian nuclear energy industry to be effective in significantly curtailing Russian economic gains from its nuclear energy exports, they will need to be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts to encourage and support diversification away from Russian supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing efforts on bringing countries like Turkey and Hungary on side to increase the political and economic pressure on Moscow will be key. It remains unclear to what extent these countries will maintain – or expand – their nuclear cooperation with Russia moving forward although incentives and restrictions to diversification clearly exist, as detailed in this report. Finding ways to support a sustainable shift away from dependence on Russian nuclear fuel and technology and towards alternative suppliers will be key to ensuring that emerging trends suggested by the data assessed for this report do not become permanent ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, securing the cooperation of China – Russia’s most important customer in nuclear energy exports – when it comes to curtailing Russian access to its nuclear energy market is an undoubtedly tall order. As it has already demonstrated, Beijing is likely to remain the persistently weak link in Western efforts to effectively apply sanctions against the Russian economy. As long as international consensus on condemning and sanctioning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains divided, Russia will find ways to benefit from these divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。法官上周提及，相信控方於本案依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」，以其他被告的言行推論被告參與串謀。有辯方律師今表示控方開案陳詞從沒有提及相關原則，遭法官質疑控方依賴該原則是顯而易見。此外，有辯方律師表示本案控罪始於2020年7月1日，被告此前言行不屬串謀一部分。惟法官李運騰指他完全錯誤，指所有人都知道《國安法》於7月1日才生效，原本合法的行為也可變成非法，而控罪屬「持續罪行」，《國安法》前的言行可為本案「謀劃」提供一個背景，證明被告的思想狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於上周列席的認罪被告全部不在正庭，據記者觀察，他們被帶到沒有記者、只有公眾席的1號延伸法庭被告欄就坐，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人。認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方控罪詳情為公開作為串謀指控被告贊成無差別否決財政預算&quot;&gt;控方：控罪詳情為「公開作為」、串謀指控被告贊成無差別否決財政預算&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方上周要求控方澄清，控罪所列的4項協議內容，是各被告的「公開作為」（overt act，即法庭可用以推論被告作串謀的間接證據），抑或視為控罪必要元素的「非法手段（unlawful means）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪今重申，本案「謀劃」內容是被告贊成無差別地否決政府提出的任何財政預算或公共開支，以迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，而本案控罪詳情均是該「謀劃」的「公開作為（overt act）」，即法庭可用以推論被告作串謀的間接證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑須證戴耀廷文章為他所寫-否則僅屬傳聞證供&quot;&gt;辯方質疑須證戴耀廷文章為他所寫 否則僅屬傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官上周批准控方傳召兩名警長就 Facebook 和 YouTube 的運作作供，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今指，他不爭議該些內容的真確性（authenticity），但認為控方在依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」前，須先舉證本案串謀協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方依賴其他被告如戴耀廷撰寫的文章，他認為戴不會出庭作供，無證據文章由他所寫，僅屬「傳聞證供」，控方須證明涉案文章由戴所寫。法官李運騰同意若控方證人並不知悉文章由誰所寫，控方或須就此提出證據；又指其他被告的文章在「共謀者原則」下可以呈堂，辯方屆時可再提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方開案沒提共謀者原則&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方開案沒提「共謀者原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文其後表示，控方並沒有在開案陳詞提及意圖依賴「共謀者原則」。法官李運騰指，開案陳詞大量引用戴耀廷文章，已清楚顯示控方會依賴該原則；法官陳慶偉亦質疑，辯方如有疑問為何不在案件管理聆訊提出。沈士文指是控方責任，沒預期控方會依賴該原則，遭法官陳慶偉批評他完全錯誤（totally misconceived），並反問：「難道控方每次開案陳詞都要列明依賴的每項原則？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文重申，根據案例，若控方依賴「共謀者原則」，辯方需知道控方依賴此原則下，針對每名被告的證據。法官李運騰指，本案所有促進串謀的言行（acts and declarations in furtherance of a conspiracy）均是針對所有共謀者的證據，不論他們於言行作出前或後才加入串謀。沈士文同意，但指控方未必依賴所有證據，不同證據亦可能達致不同結論。Trevor Beel 遂補充，本案或涉多於一個串謀，法官指將會稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控罪始於2020七一-官指國安法前言行可證被告思想狀態&quot;&gt;控罪始於2020七一 官指國安法前言行可證被告思想狀態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉續指，本案控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，控方似乎沒有指控被告於2020年7月1日前串謀，故被告此前言行不屬串謀一部分。法官李運騰指他完全錯誤（totally misconceived），指所有人都知道《國安法》於7月1日才生效，在此之前被告不可能干犯任何本案的「非法手段」，而本控罪屬橫跨一段時間的「持續罪行（continuous offence）」，《國安法》後原本合法的行為也可變成非法，故控方才以2020年7月1日為控罪開始日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟馬維騉指，《國安法》生效前並不存在本案的非法串謀，故被告此前的言行最多只是推動一個「協議（agreement）」，而非非法的「串謀」。李運騰回應，被告於6月30日或以前的言行，可為本案「謀劃」提供一個背景（setting），及證明被告的思想狀態（state of mind）。馬維騉同意7月1日前的言行可為本案提供背景，但重申不認為能證被告推動串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪補充，除了共謀者規則外，控方亦可能依賴「巧合（coincidence）」的規則，指涉案行為於相近時間發生，會邀法庭考慮被告犯案不是「純粹巧合」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;需時處理同意事實-押下午開庭&quot;&gt;需時處理同意事實 押下午開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早前未能同意承認事實，萬德豪指今早4時15分收到辯方要求修改承認事實，需時1小時再商討。Trevor Beel 指，由於需時與還柙被告會面，望能下午再繼續。法官終批准休庭至12時。直至近12時，法庭書記指押後至下午2時半。審訊下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。首名控方證人、被指為初選組織者的區諾軒下午作供，他供稱初選的計劃由2020年1月與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人和黃浩銘的一個飯局開始，當時戴耀廷提及立會過半願景，及如何在區選大勝後「再下一城」，在立法會為民主派贏取更多議席並爭取「五大訴求」。區指，當時戴耀廷較堅持以公民投票形式舉辦初選作協調，並推想每區可獲的議席數目；又指立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可利用《基本法》賦予的權力否決財政預算案和政府議案，並成立獨立調查委員會向警暴問責等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，飯局上他同意民主派過半及建立協調機制「會係一個好大嘅進步」，並答應以籌劃者身份與戴耀廷合作舉辦初選。他解釋，當時他剛完成立法會公職，打算赴日留學，2020年有約大半年時間在香港，「我認為我當時有時間，能夠貢獻我視之為民主運動嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早上就承認事實商討，主控萬德豪下午開庭後，原欲讀出修訂的承認事實，指屬法庭一貫做法，惟法官陳慶偉及陳仲衡均指應立即聽取本案證供，稍後才處理承認事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭其後於下午約2時45分，傳召首名控方證人、被指為初選組織者的區諾軒作供。他架黑色粗框眼鏡、身穿灰色毛衣，在3名懲教人員押送下手持一疊文件步入法庭，先向旁聽席和被告欄方向微微躹躬，再坐下。法官指他不能攜有文件，區一度問：「我嘅證供係咪可以留低，定係都唔得？」法官指他作供期間不能以書面供詞協助記憶，區其後將文件放在桌上，除下口罩以基督教誓章宣誓。區諾軒宣誓時，被安排在另一法庭觀看直播、已認罪的被告之一馮達浚搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱控罪日期為202071至202117-區係咪再早啲啊應該&quot;&gt;控方稱控罪日期為2020.7.1至2021.1.7 區：係咪再早啲啊應該？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供時確認，他由2009年12月至2017年9月為民主黨黨員，2012年至2019年任南區區議員，並於2018年3月至2019年12月經補選當選香港島立法會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除串謀顛覆國家政權罪外，他亦於2020年4月涉大聲公襲警被定罪、2021年4月涉組織參與非法集結被定罪，另2021年8月涉選舉舞弊和違反《立法會（權力及特權）條例》獲准守行為。控方指串謀顛覆國家政權罪控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日時，區諾軒一度面露疑惑：「係咪再早啲啊應該？」惟他迅即改口稱「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年1月首度與戴耀廷李永達李卓人黃浩銘飯局商討&quot;&gt;2020年1月首度與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人、黃浩銘飯局商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行負責主問環節，要求區諾軒順時序講述本案串謀計劃的發生。區諾軒供稱，2019年12月，戴耀廷於《蘋果日報》發表〈立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步〉一文，他起初有留意但沒有聯絡戴，直至2020年1月，泛民主派亦開始留意到該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「一切係由一個飯局開始」，指於2020年1月尾，與戴耀廷、民主黨李永達、工黨李卓人和社民連黃浩銘進行飯局作首次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，當時他剛完成立法會公職，打算赴日留學，而該飯局的重要性，在於是他首次與戴耀廷商討有關初選的問題。他形容，李永達和李卓人當時亦很關心在將要來臨的立法會選舉，「民主派可以點樣達到最大勝算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;飯局目標包括助民主派於立法會爭取更多議席&quot;&gt;飯局目標包括助民主派於立法會爭取更多議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒指，戴耀廷在飯局提出有關立會過半的願景及覆述文章看法，並提出三點值得留意，包括：當時民主派於2019年區議會選舉大勝，他們要思考如何「再下一城」，在立法會為民主派贏取更多議席；當時「五大訴求」是反修例運動主要內容，他們要思考如何爭取「五大訴求」；區議會選舉大勝後，要思考如何設立公民參與機制，包括活用民主派贏得的議席，並結合「黃營媒體」及公民社會團體的參與，建立一個平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第一點，區解釋泛民主派要在立法會贏取更多議席，需要一個「協調機制」。他指，立法會地方選區奉行比例代表制，而過往選舉常有一種規律，就是泛民主派獲得比建制派更多選票，但在部分選區無法獲得相應比例議席，因泛民主派有太多名單參選，以致部分選票被浪費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，建制派自2008年起已建立一套成熟的協調機制，但泛民直至2020年仍未成功建立，故與戴耀廷等人討論如何建立一套協調機制，讓不同黨派，無論是傳統泛民主派、激進泛民主派和本土派，總之任何「黃色陣營」內的政治勢力，參選立法會時均可互相協調，善用選票、按比例當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷堅持公民投票形式舉辦初選&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷堅持公民投票形式舉辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問及，戴耀廷目標是增加民主派於立法會選舉的勝算，那他有否提出任何方案以取得立法會多數議席。區諾軒指戴耀廷當時較堅持用公民投票形式舉辦初選，惟當時其他與會者認為較消耗人力物力，可用其他方法，如以選前民調調查候選人支持度，再讓大家參考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷當時的提議，區指雖然未有如2020年7月的初選般具體，但也有基本框架，即在不同地方直選選區、及功能組別的區議會第二界別（超級區議會），以公民投票選出泛民主派代表，決定他們出選的優先次序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續指，若能建立協調機制，在各選區便理應可獲多數議席，包括在港島區6席贏取4席、九龍西6席贏取4席、九龍東5席贏取3席、新界西9席贏取6席、新界東9席贏取6席、及超級區議會5席贏取3席，再將上述選區議席相加，便可得出還需爭取多少席以達35席。他並指就新界兩區，「如果諗得積極啲，可能（在一個選區內）會攞到7席嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，當時飯局未訂下確實數目，直至與不同團體諮詢後，戴耀廷才在之後的文章及3月底的記者會提出「6 6 4 4 3」的說法。但在法官詢問下，他同意在飯局上戴耀廷已曾作相關推想和推算，「佢有同我講呢一啲數字」，並指對與會者來說，「如果民主派能夠贏，當然係好」，但要推展整個民主派實現就需更多工作，如向不同團體諮詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒承認飯局上答應合作籌劃初選-貢獻民主運動&quot;&gt;區諾軒承認飯局上答應合作籌劃初選 「貢獻民主運動」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名指定法官不時加入發問，法官李運騰要求控方順時序發問，並要求區諾軒確實說出飯局當日「誰說過什麼」，又問他有沒有參與討論。區指他無法憶述具體的說話內容，但當時亦同意若民主派能過半，且能建立一個協調機制，「會係一個好大嘅進步」，「而且正正係當時，我答應同戴耀廷合作舉辦初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，他答應以籌劃者身份參與，因他即將要留學，2020年有約大半年時間在香港，「我認為我當時有時間，能夠貢獻我視之為民主運動嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷稱立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器-可否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷稱立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」 可否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於區諾軒提及會上第二點，即思考如何爭取「五大訴求」。區諾軒指，當時原意回應反修例運動，戴耀廷提及若立會過半，將是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，因民主派對政府會有更多議價能力，亦可以利用《基本法》賦予的權力行使否決權。他指，當時沒有特別指定否決對象，但有包括財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指不明白，如何沒有特定否決對象但又包括否決財政預算案。區諾軒解釋，「五大訴求」包括要求為警暴問責的條款，「若果我哋能夠運用立會過半所得到嘅地位，係可以有好多空間可以做嘅」，如設立獨立調查委員會或否決政府議案，戴耀廷當時正是指出立會過半後「可以做到嘅一啲可能」。他又指，由於當時飯局上的人，「一係就資深議員或前議員，一係就資深嘅政治工作者」，故對他們來說，該些概念都是耳熟能詳，無特別為意戴的含意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒應就實際所說作供-不應提個人猜想&quot;&gt;官提醒應就實際所說作供 不應提個人猜想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰提醒，指「我們正在處理非常嚴重的罪行」，區諾軒應盡量貼近飯局上人們實際的說話，而非對與會者想法作出猜想，又指相信區能分得出兩者分別，區點頭。李續問飯局上有否提及財政預算案，區指戴耀廷有提及過，並談及〈立會奪半〉文章內容，但他們沒有特別回應其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒最後重申，戴耀廷當時提及立會過半是「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，可以運用許多權力爭取五大訴求，包括否決財政預算案、設立獨立調查委員會，以及否決政府議案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒糾正法庭傳譯-旁聽席發笑&quot;&gt;區諾軒糾正法庭傳譯 旁聽席發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午近5時散庭，臨散庭前，法官李運騰重申區諾軒作供時不應保存任何文件，控方着懲教署保管，區諾軒在3名懲教押送下離開，臨走前向旁聽席及律師席注目及點頭。散庭時，林卓廷向母親說「情人節快樂」，吳政亨舉起拇指，旁聽席有女童喊「加油（長）毛伯伯！」，長毛妻子陳寶塋亦高喊：「各位加油！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，以中文作供的區諾軒，今不時糾正法庭傳譯主任的翻譯。其中區提及「公布」，法官李運騰指出翻譯錯誤，應為「make it public」，區說「I suggest to use “announce”」，法官採納，陳志全等被告及旁聽的民主黨劉慧卿發笑。至區提及戴耀廷作出就初選的「推想」，傳譯主任一度猶豫「推想啊……」，區提議「imagination?」，傳譯主任採納，旁聽席再發笑；區亦試過忘記等待傳譯主任翻譯便直接回答控方英文問題。另外，被問及飯局與會者的黨派，區諾軒稱「無黨派」，傳譯主任譯作「individual」，劉慧卿等再發笑，傳譯主任其後更正為「I did not belong in any party.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供時，正庭內的被告沒有太大反應，大多低頭以紙筆或電腦抄筆記，林卓廷一度閉目養神。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告分坐兩延伸庭看直播&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告分坐兩延伸庭看直播&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於上周列席的認罪被告，今全部不獲安排在正庭就坐，需於延伸庭觀看直播，意味無法親睹證人作供及與不認罪被告見面。據記者觀察，他們分別被帶到沒有記者席、只有公眾席的1號延伸法庭，及有記者席和公眾席的2號延伸法庭被告欄就坐，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人；及岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和尹兆堅4人。其中1號庭內設有3個直播熒幕，均面向旁聽席，坐在被告欄的被告均需傾前身體及仰頭望向右，才能觀看直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告於正庭同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐，今更被安排到不同法庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">官指串謀屬持續罪行 《國安法》前言行可證被告思想狀態 區諾軒開始作供 指2020年1月首與戴耀廷飯局商討 答應合作籌劃</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Russo-Ukrainian War In 2023</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-13-russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Russo-Ukrainian War In 2023" /><published>2023-02-13T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-13-russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Russia and Ukraine head into year two of a war that has defied expectations, a collection of CSIS experts examined driving factors for the future of the conflict. They borrow the approach from intelligence analysts, who seek to evaluate the possible trajectories of a conflict rather than make straight-line predictions, bounding reality for policymakers.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Emily Harding discusses the life-or-death question of continued outside aid for Ukraine and the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Ben Jensen discusses cohesion in the Russian military and the potential for catastrophic collapse. Heather Williams evaluates the looming nuclear question. Finally, Eliot Cohen examines how a conflict might end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-point-of-failure-will-outside-support-for-ukraine-endure&quot;&gt;Single Point of Failure: Will Outside Support for Ukraine Endure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Harding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of Kyiv’s war effort hinges on one unfortunate fact: Ukraine does not have the indigenous capacity to arm itself for this fight. Ukrainian president Zelensky knows it and has devoted considerable time and energy to shoring up relationships and corresponding supply lines — for example, leaving Ukraine to visit Washington and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West has responded: despite a slow, hesitant start, marked by hand-wringing over escalation, NATO members have stepped up to provide increasingly effective and potent weapons systems. HIMARS — the light, mobile, precision artillery platforms — are already a hero of the war, and Abrams and Leopard tanks are inbound. Debates over fourth-generation fighter jets and long-range fires are surely right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zelensky’s work is never done. Russia is working hard to widen any crack in support for Ukraine. Recent Quran-burning protests in Sweden seem to have been bought and paid for by Russian assets, designed to make it impossible for Turkey to support Sweden’s bid for NATO membership. A recent poll by the European Hybrid CoE suggests that segments of the public in key European nations are questioning why Europe is sending so much aid to Ukraine. Those segments are still minorities, but Ukraine is only a year into what most likely will be a very long fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO allies also have a structural concern beyond the whims of opinion polls. As CSIS’s Seth Jones argued in his recent report, Empty Bins in a Wartime Environment, support to Ukraine has drawn down U.S. stocks of critical weapons systems faster than they can be replenished, in our current peacetime production tempo. The report says “DoD has only placed on contract a fraction of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine. Many U.S. allies and partners in Europe also have defense industrial bases that are unprepared for major war, heavily reliant on the United States, and chronically underfunded.” At some point, U.S. and European military planners will begin to feel the pinch and question what should go to Ukraine and what should be held in reserve for a potential future fight, should this conflict dramatically escalate or China see an opportunity to move in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this conflict more than most, Ukraine’s chances at victory will be decided by both the weapons themselves and the symbolic value of the commitment to send them. Moscow is betting that time is on its side and it can grind Ukraine into dust. The key assumption in that bet is that Russia can outlast NATO commitment. Instead, Russia needs to fear that, just as it underestimated NATO’s willingness to help Ukraine and Ukraine’s ability to fight, it has miscalculated the West’s resolve to stay with Ukraine all the way to Crimea. The Biden administration has signaled medium-term U.S. commitment with its military aid package and training programs, and in one of his few lines on foreign policy in the State of the Union, Biden pledged that the United States “will stand with you as long as it takes.” On the heels of Zelensky’s trip, European allies need to find ways to signal the same commitment to their people and to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-ukrainian-resilience-hold&quot;&gt;Can Ukrainian Resilience Hold?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On February 24, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not escaping, but meeting. Meeting the enemy. Resisting and fighting. –Zelensky’s New Year address to the nation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelensky has been a symbol of his nation’s resolve and defiance in the face of a brutal enemy. He has been steadfast, but how long can Ukrainian resilience hold? As of January 15, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded 18,358 civilian casualties in the country: 7,031 killed and 11,327 injured. More than eight million Ukrainians have become refugees, at least six million more are internally displaced, and nearly half the population needs humanitarian assistance. Russia has engaged in a ruthless campaign to knock out critical infrastructure, including power and water, in the middle of winter. Ukrainians have suffered greatly and will continue to suffer as a result of Moscow’s blatant disregard for human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, reliable numbers of Ukrainian military casualties are difficult to calculate; the Ukrainian government has labeled them classified. In early December, Ukrainian government officials publicly estimated up to 13,000 killed and stridently denied a European estimate of 100,000 dead. Ukrainian soldiers have shown ingenuity and grit and have made clear they will fight to free their country for as long as is necessary with whatever is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and other friends of Ukraine should plan for a multiyear conflict and develop sustainable plans for keeping Ukraine’s forces and population resilient. For refugees, those plans look like work programs — in particular support for Ukraine’s women to work remotely in their Ukrainian jobs whenever possible — education for children, and mental health support. A soldier unburdened with worries about their spouse and kids is a soldier better able to focus on the fight. For those fighting, efforts to create sustainable rotations on and off the battlefield for training and rest are a basic start. Fostering the belief that the fight is winnable with public symbols of support — from flags waving over Washington, to the United Kingdom hosting Eurovision on behalf of Ukraine, to NAFO Fellas, to, yes, tanks and HIMARS — will keep determination high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-there-cohesion-in-the-russian-military&quot;&gt;Is There Cohesion in the Russian Military?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Jensen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to Ukrainian forces, Russian efforts in Ukraine have been plagued by faulty equipment, lack of winter gear, and reported fights and drunkenness in the trenches. What if the mutinies endemic in the Russian revolutions in 1905 and 1917 are a harbinger for the course of 2023? Military power requires cohesive fighting organizations as much as it does tanks and planes. Soldiers tend to reflect cleavages and power struggles in their societies. The combined stress of battlefield losses and growing crises on the home front can undermine military power through eroding cohesion. Look no further than the Kiel Mutiny in the German navy in 1918 and the cascading protests across that accelerated the end of World War I. Along similar lines, a recent study by Jason Lyall, director of the Political Violence Field Lab, found that military performance is linked to economic and social inequality in a society. The more unequal and stratified a society, the more likely the military is to underperform and even collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to Russia, which has seen a dramatic rise in income inequality over the last generation, alongside a rise in nationalistic xenophobic attitudes and racism against non-ethnic Russians, this finding suggests the winter could be longer for Moscow than it is for Kyiv. The signs are already present given changing sentiments in minority regions like Buryatia and mass emigration by military age males. Sanctions combined with the Kremlin’s rhetoric about historic Russia may bolster the elite that didn’t jump from windows, but it only acerbates the tensions tearing the nation apart and undermining its military performance. Russia has more forced conscripts and prison units than it does volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions are already present for a large-scale Russian military mutiny. Low morale, cold weather, and high attrition rates alongside nationalist rhetoric and economic decline will continue over the course of the next three months. In this environment, a spark can start a wildfire. Riots, rampant refusal of orders, and even defections and surrenders could spread like a disease through the burnt-out cities and trenches along the battlefield in Ukraine. Though impossible to predict, the most likely catalyst on the horizon is the first offensive of the spring in which mobilized conscripts currently training in Russia and Belarus discover the hell of modern trench warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-putin-continue-to-make-nuclear-threats&quot;&gt;Will Putin Continue to Make Nuclear Threats?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the war in Ukraine lasts months or years, nuclear weapons will continue to lurk in the background. Russian president Vladimir Putin has come to rely on nuclear weapons for coercion and bullying and will continue to make nuclear threats. Since the start of the invasion, Putin has made explicit and implicit reference to Russia’s nuclear arsenal. On December 21, he stated, “We will continue maintaining and improving the combat readiness of the nuclear triad” and listed Russia’s numerous nuclear delivery vehicles, including the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is relying on nuclear threats for two primary reasons. First, he wants to deter NATO from directly intervening in Ukraine. While the West has gradually increased its military support for Ukraine, Putin’s efforts have arguably had some success preventing direct Western military intervention for fear of escalation. Keeping NATO out of Ukraine will remain a top priority for Putin. But the second reason for Putin’s nuclear threats is even more dangerous and risky. By suggesting a willingness to use nuclear weapons, Putin is also signaling his commitment to winning the war in Ukraine at ever-increasing costs. In the event Russia is facing defeat on the battlefield, Putin may resort to tactical nuclear weapons use in a key strategic region, such as Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring Putin from using nuclear weapons will require concerted international efforts. The international community should make it clear that any nuclear use in Ukraine would turn Russia into an international pariah and while nuclear weapons might win a battle, they will lose Putin the war. This message would be particularly meaningful coming from Russia’s key strategic partners in Beijing and New Delhi. But U.S. and NATO leaders should also continue to rely on risk reduction measures and crisis communication channels, such as the October call between Secretary of Defense Austin and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu. The West may not be able to stop Putin from threatening to use nuclear weapons, but countries can work to prevent him from following through on those threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-might-this-end&quot;&gt;How Might This End?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eliot Cohen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom says “negotiations,” of course. That is the point that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, and numerous civilian officials in the U.S. government have often made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense this is true: a bunch of tired men sitting around a table conclude most wars — but that can be a surrender negotiation (which is not much of a negotiation), or a ceasefire arrangement (which merely creates an interlude until the next round of fighting) or a grand peace-fest like Vienna 1815. “Negotiation,” in other words, covers a multitude of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is most likely that what will not happen is the kind of negotiation Milley and others have in mind — a genuine compromise that brings about peace. What is more likely is that one side or the other collapses in exhaustion, and that the result is a ceasefire for now, which is the predicate for another conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, if the West continues to be dilatory in arming Ukraine, it could be Kyiv that crawls wearily to the table. But it is rather more likely the Russians will be the ones to do so, if (as laid out above) outside support is robust, the Ukrainians maintain their immense capacity to adapt and continue the fight, Russia sees collapses in its fighting force, and the West maintains a united front rejecting nuclear threats. After suffering another hundred thousand or more casualties and feeling the internal strains of an unjust and ill-conceived war, Russia could be driven by Ukrainian grit and Western firepower and battlefield intelligence to slump its way to a table at which it agrees to leave the lands it has pillaged, and the populations it has occupied, violated, and slaughtered. But it depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;

IPEF holds the rare distinction of being a multilateral approach to regional economic integration that includes both the United States and India — two nations often at odds during multilateral trade talks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Divided into four pillars — Connected Economy, Resilient Economy, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy — IPEF is aimed at structural economic transformation. The 14-member country arrangement is driven by the political urgency of countering Chinese economic influence in the region. With the special negotiation meetings for IPEF in New Delhi held between February 8–11, CSIS experts provide their analyses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-indias-supply-chain-disruptions&quot;&gt;Managing India’s Supply Chain Disruptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jayant Krishna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF aspires to rewrite the rules of engagement for the twenty-first century economies and enable them to grow faster and fairer. It is surely bigger than Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in size as well as clout and continues to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other nations with a significant industrial footprint, India also experienced serious supply chains disruptions in supply of electronic components, semiconductor devices, minerals, and other raw materials due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The worsening of trade relations among Asian countries, a logistics slowdown, and China’s economic coercion only added to its economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chain resilience is one of IPEF’s four key themes. Beyond the traditional risk management frameworks deployed by the industry, India could leverage IPEF to develop an adaptive capability of its supply chain to prepare for unprecedented events, become responsive to disruptions, and maintain business continuity at an optimum level of connectivity, coordination, and command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF already accounts for 40 percent of global GDP and is likely to cross 50 percent soon. With pragmatic supply chain framework understanding expected to be operative among IPEF signatory nations, India would be far better positioned to safeguard its supply chains against the associated vulnerabilities. This would ensure that India’s industrial output does not remain compromised and the GDP continues to grow uninhibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-consensus-on-cross-border-taxation-issues&quot;&gt;Building Consensus on Cross-Border Taxation Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mukesh Butani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPEF meeting presents a significant opportunity for India to push its key reform agenda on multilateral tax policy and trade, keeping in mind investment and inclusive economic growth. Specifically, it presents an opportunity to move forward with member states for comprehensive free trade agreements and reduction of trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum will play a critical role in building global consensus on contentious cross-border tax issues, such as taxation of digital services, virtual digital assets, and indirect transfer of capital assets. Most of these are being debated at wider multilateral institutions such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund, and World Bank — however, there is inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The member states should reaffirm their commitment to transparency by adopting global best practices on a common framework for the exchange of information for tax purposes and crypto trades. The forum is expected to supplement efforts to improve tax administration and mutual cooperation by supporting the ongoing work on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project’s Two-Pillar Solution and tax inspectors without borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-leadership-in-clean-energy-and-improving-domestic-programs&quot;&gt;Strengthening Leadership in Clean Energy and Improving Domestic Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kartikeya Singh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming ministerial meeting of the IPEF, leaders will gather to deliberate the next steps on the guiding pillars. India is a participant to pillar three: Clean Economy. To activate meaningful cooperation between India and the other members of this pillar, India can contribute in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;structuring reverse auctions for utility-scale clean energy projects to ensure lowest tariffs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;designing bulk procurement programs to reduce cost of energy efficiency, and e-mobility ventures;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promoting joint financial and technical partnerships for business transition toward clean energy verticals between state-owned enterprises, including National Thermal Power Corporation, Coal India, and Indian Oil with peer institutions in partner countries (i.e., to foster the growth of offshore wind industry); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidating the One Sun, One World, One Grid by designing effective electricity transmission, which would dovetail with the efforts to create an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) super-grid or the proposed undersea interconnection between Australia and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange, given the recent line items in India’s 2023 budget where clean energy featured heavily, India should work with IPEF partner countries to add value to these efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;work with partner countries to develop a green hydrogen ecosystem, including crowding demand for products like green steel to develop an edge in low carbon production;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jointly create the supply chains for critical materials that are required for powering the clean energy economy, given countries like Australia, Indonesia, and others with large reserves of these materials are in the coalition, is beneficial;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jointly develop and improve the technologies that can dovetail with India’s biogas (GOBARdhan Scheme) to ensure its success; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;negotiate how countries in IPEF might create their own versions of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to ensure healthy competition and joint benefit-sharing of localized job creation from enacting such incentive schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-governance-efficacy-and-attracting-foreign-direct-investment&quot;&gt;Improving Governance Efficacy and Attracting Foreign Direct Investment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alok Gupta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF is aimed at incentivizing partner countries to contribute to stability, prosperity, development, and peace in the Indo-Pacific region. Inducing cooperation between the countries requires effective governance at the back end. This is to ensure that the commitments made by partner countries are timely and effectively implemented. Several countries in the region suffer from endemic institutional problems such as ineffective bureaucracies and corruption. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for ensuring that development efforts in the region are not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contextualize, the United States should look at where India stands in terms of governance. Per the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) 2021, published by the World Bank, India occupies 11th position out of the 14 IPEF countries on two measured metrics — government effectiveness and control of corruption. Out of a maximum score of 100, India received 62.5 on government effectiveness, as opposed to index leader Singapore, which has 100, and Philippines, which is at the bottom of the chart with 57.69. Similarly, on control of corruption, India scored 46.63. New Zealand leads the chart with a score of 99.04, and Philippines is at the bottom with 34.13. While India has improved since the previous rankings in 2016, there is a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better governance and less corruption can enable a more conducive environment for commercial cooperation and technical exchanges which can increase the FDI in the country and growth in economy, thus driving to prosperity and peace. India needs to accelerate its efforts of improving governance and employ technological advances to work towards creating an efficacious environment for collaboration and cooperation. Specifically, India needs to proactively engage the United States on technological exchanges and commercial engagements to enhance trade and mutually benefit both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;官批准傳召兩警長就FB及YouTube作供 料4名同案被告作供需時6周&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wH5ye3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方昨已讀出整份開案陳詞，何桂藍的代表大律師今反對控方傳召兩名警長以「專家證人」身份就 Facebook 和 YouTube 作供，指控方太遲提供證人口供紀錄予被告，導致她難以尋找辯方專家，對她造成不公。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪則強調已在切實可行的情況下盡早把證人口供交予被告，況且4名認罪被告出庭作供需時6星期，被告依然有時間尋找辯方專家證人。法官最終批准控方傳召兩名警長作供，但二人的專家資格尚未確立，日後將會處理。案件下周一續審，預料控方開始傳召4名認罪被告區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則會自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱已在切實可行下盡早提供文件-未對被告不公&quot;&gt;控方稱已在切實可行下盡早提供文件 未對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪指，控方於2022年6月已把交付至高院文件夾給予被告，但當時仍未提供控方證人書面證供。至2023年1月，控方把審前覆核文件夾提供予被告，當中顯示控方有意傳召專家證人，而警長6533分別於1月6日及1月9日錄取口供，分別就 Facebook 和 YouTube 的運作提供證據。然而代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 卻於1月10日表達反對立場，但其時證人已完成錄取口供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方承認未有按《實務指示》在交付程序之前，將專家報告送達辯方，但強調只用了一星期時間把警長證人口供交給被告，乃在切實可行的情況下盡早（as soon as practicable）提交文件，沒有對被告構成不公。至1月16日，被告已收到相關文件。控方強調，由1月16日至今天，被告總共有26日研究及決定是否傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及其中一名專家證人為警長6533，但他錄取口供時職級仍是警員（police constable），之後才晉升至警長（sergeant）。法官李運騰指文件顯示他以警長身份簽署，要求澄清他身份是警員還是警長，「他預料到自己會升職嗎？」惹來被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方料4名同案被告作供需時6星期-並會傳召與協調會議有關的證人&quot;&gt;控方料4名同案被告作供需時6星期 並會傳召「與協調會議有關的證人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又表示，下周一起將傳召4名同案被告出庭作供，若計算辯方盤問的時間在內，預料合共需時4星期。法官李運騰一度反問控方是否有點樂觀，因合共有16名被告的辯方律師需要盤問。控方其後更正所需時間為6星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，然後會傳召一名與協調會議有關的證人，以及政府官員，包括選舉事務處，因此預料在4月中之前，控方仍未會傳召兩名警長，何桂藍仍有時間準備或尋找辯方專家，若果有任何對她不公的情況，也有時間作出補救。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，兩名專家證人僅就十分常用的社交媒體的一般運作提供證據，而該些社交媒體可以發布文章、照片和影片等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍控方遲交證供-致遭受不公&quot;&gt;何桂藍：控方遲交證供 致遭受不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則投訴，控方太遲提供證人口供，以致辯方沒有足夠時間尋找辯方專家，因為他們不像律政司般有自己的專家，而是需要在外尋找學者擔任辯方專家。Trevor Beel 指，被告於1月31日才收到警長6533首兩份口供的英文譯本，至2月6日即開審當日，才收妥所有口供，包括另一警長3137的口供及英文譯本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trevor Beel 強調是次並非一般的審訊，可能對辯方構成困難。法官陳慶偉認為此說法只是猜測，但 Trevor Beel 則指此乃合理期望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trevor Beel 又表示，若果控方安排兩名警察以專家證人身份作供，便會爭議兩名證人的專家身份；若果二人僅以事實證人身份作供，那便不會提出相關爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他總結指，其當事人因為控方遲來的專家證供，而遭受無法彌補的不公（unredeemable prejudice），要求法庭拒絕控方傳召兩名警長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提醒控方只可就法律陳詞&quot;&gt;法官提醒控方只可就法律陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表萬德豪回應時批評，辯方一直未開始尋找辯方專家，打算等待今日法庭決定是否批准傳召兩名警長作供後，才決定是否尋找。他又指何桂藍的律師團隊懂閱讀中文，能從中文本得知證人身份是警長而不是警員，而毋須等待英文譯本。法官李運騰打斷，此僅為翻譯問題，提醒萬德豪的陳詞應圍繞法律議題。萬德豪其後表示沒有進一步陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官批准傳召2名警長就-facebook-和-youtube-作供&quot;&gt;法官批准傳召2名警長就 Facebook 和 YouTube 作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭45分鐘後，法官陳慶偉宣布批准控方傳召兩名警長出庭作供，但不代表法庭接納二人的報告內容，而二人的專家資格是否確立則有待日後處理。稍後會頒布書面理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳官並指，從庭上雙方的陳詞可見，Facebook 和 YouTube 影片的真確性（authenticity）和可呈堂性（admissibility）是一項尚未處理的問題，可是沒有任何人在案件管理階段提出過相關議題，若果有任何人挑戰控方呈交的 Facebook 和 YouTube 影片，便會對審訊有重大影響。陳官表示，若辯方有意提出爭議，法庭期望他們在下周一續審時提出，屆時需研究有什麼選項，包括分拆案件審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提及控方開案陳詞指稱被告串謀計劃的協議內容涉及4項「非法手段」，然而早於案件進行交付程序時，控方卻指稱協議內容涉及公開行為（Overt acts)，要求控方釐清指控基礎。 法官則指稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文申請撤銷宵禁令，其他辯方律師紛紛提出相同申請，皆獲陳官批准，所有早前須遵守宵禁的保釋被告可獲撤銷宵禁令。陳官亦批准保釋的被告在審訊期間不需到警署報到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MyBlW79.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方繼續讀出開案陳詞中，針對5名新界東候選人何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷和梁國雄的涉案言行。其中何桂藍被指提倡奪取立法會主導權以「破局」，及宣揚攬炒和籲外國更強硬對待中共；鄒家成被指有份草擬「墨落無悔」聲明及宣揚香港民族主義，又稱要進入議會「打交」及「做任何手段癱瘓每一個議會進行」；林卓廷被搜出的初選論壇筆記，寫有「完全同意光復香港，時代革命呢個理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方指何桂藍出席抗爭派記者會，是重申無差別否決財政預算案，惟其代表律師稱她沒有發言，指控只是鬆散地（loosely）基於其他被告發言。法官李運騰表示開案陳詞中許多事實及宣言都是出自其他認罪被告，特別是戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢，相信控方是依賴「共謀者原則」，至於是否適用會由法庭判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉、黃之鋒和馮達浚亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何桂藍倡奪立會主導權爭破局&quot;&gt;控方指何桂藍倡奪立會主導權爭「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍，控方指她簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並在參選宣言〈一息尚存，力戰不降〉表示面對《國安法》的逼害及打壓仍不會放棄抵抗，「識時務者，會笑我哋螳臂擋車，作無謂嘅抵抗同犧牲。但佢哋永遠都唔會明白，我哋前仆後繼，係因為我哋知道，反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」。何又指：「面對極權，我哋的確一無所有，只能夠以我哋嘅人生、前程、甚至肉身同生命作為代價去抗衡國家機器⋯⋯喺今時今日嘅香港，議會要去助燃場運動，而唔係再拖抗爭嘅後腿⋯⋯我哋只可以用盡一切方法同中共周旋到底。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後發布宣傳影片，提及「攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」，又在初選論壇奪取立會過半「唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單」，而是「將立法會變成人民嘅武器」，指「要突破中共set畀香港嘅死局，需要最多嘅抗爭派進入議會」。播放片段時，何桂藍露出笑眼，又一度以雙手掩眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在新界東初選民間論壇，亦重申35+並非最終目的，不應幻想取得35+後可逼使政府實現承諾，並指當選者應「用盡一切嘅方式去繼續個議會抗爭，去繼續施壓」。何其後亦表明不害怕被DQ，並承諾與抗爭派議員站在同一陣線，於議會內進行肢體抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何桂藍宣揚攬炒籲外國更強硬對待中共&quot;&gt;控方指何桂藍宣揚攬炒、籲外國更強硬對待中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何宣揚及堅定支持「攬炒」，指《國安法》落實和外國介入是香港抗爭者觸發的連鎖效應，透過港人「犧牲」達致「攬炒」。她提倡以「街頭戰線」和「國際戰線」反抗，7月8日為袁嘉蔚助選時向被通緝的羅冠聰的海外游說工作致敬，並發文要求外國以更強硬態度對待中共的威脅。控方讀出何桂藍發言指「所以今日 Tiffany 再次喺《國安法》已經實施咗嘅宜家，國安公署就喺嗰邊，但係佢仍然好勇敢咁樣走出嚟」時，何轉頭望向袁嘉蔚微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何曾表示，為有效達到35+，民主派應團結利用初選配票，又在初選首日籲公眾投票，指在白色恐怖年代，初選投票率可向國際社會展示港人具頑強的反抗意志、無懼《國安法》，亦讓更多抗爭派議員進入議會帶來真正改變。何其後勝出初選並報名立法會選舉，但被DQ，她發文指DQ是要抹殺35+的可能性，呼籲繼續反對中共及中央政府，並要求外國介入，又在《洛杉磯時報》撰文重申在立會獲得多數反對的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，警方搜得她與岑敖暉的競選單張，其中控方指以〈中共推『國安立法』 香港變『一國一制』〉為題的單張推動抵抗中共；〈國安法打到嚟監控有冇得避？〉則指控《國安法》落實後會加強對港人監控，威脅港人安全和私隱。控方又指，何桂藍競選宣言透過指控「香港制度崩壞、法治無存」，鼓吹對政權的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀稱何無於抗爭派記者會發言-僅依賴其他被告說法&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀稱何無於抗爭派記者會發言 僅依賴其他被告說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何桂藍勝出初選後，與另外14名被告出席抗爭派記者會，重申會維持對政府堅定抗爭，即無差別否決財政預算以迫使特首回應五大訴求。惟其代表大律師 Trevor Beel 指，何並沒有在記者會發言，控方如有任何指控，亦只是鬆散地（loosely）基於其他被告的發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示明白，指開案陳詞中，許多事實及宣言都是出自其他認罪被告，特別是戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢。他指，相信控方是依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator rule）」，至於該原則是否適用則交由法庭判斷。周天行一度欲回應，但法官指現時為控方提出指控的階段，控方不用回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指慢必籲議會抗爭升級筆記稱簽墨落無悔是要有攬炒決心&quot;&gt;控方指慢必籲議會抗爭升級、筆記稱簽墨落無悔是要有攬炒決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任人民力量主席、立法會議員陳志全，控方指人民力量曾於2020年3月發聲明，表示全力投入「謀劃」，他於同月與人民力量副主席、譚得志主持的電台節目《人民主場》中，亦承諾人民力量會全力支持「謀劃」並盡力實現，強調參與者應遵守共同綱領，又批評《蘋果日報》錯誤指人民力量反對初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳志全曾在6月的街站，呼籲在街頭、議會、國際、網上及黃色經濟圈戰線持續抗爭，「每一條戰線如果大家幫到手嘅，都應該盡力而為，係不容有失」，又指「同港共政權，同中共抗爭到底」，並重申不惜否決財政預算案，是要迫使政府重啟政改、回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後在初選論壇表明，「人民力量過去係走在抗爭最前線，最早，最可靠嘅抗爭力量」，並強調議會抗爭要升級，「令政府要通過啲惡法或者係撥款嘅時候，難度越嚟越高同埋要越嚟越樣衰」，並指自己曾到「前線」及承諾協助流亡者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳志全曾發起眾籌，以支持他在議會戰線繼續抗爭，並與譚得志受訪，稱35+重要性在反對預算案，「乜嘢惡法都可以反對反對反對，大白象工程又反對反對反對，跟住反對埋財政預算案，解散立法會，特首都要下台」。陳被捕後，警方搜得他準備初選的筆記簿，提及「點解要簽“自殺聯署聲明” 攬炒面對強權 要有『置諸死地而後生』決心」，又提及他對議會和街頭戰線互動的理解，籲在所有戰線抗爭。陳最終勝出及報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指鄒家成草擬墨落無悔聲明稱參選目的宣揚香港民族主義&quot;&gt;控方指鄒家成草擬「墨落無悔」聲明、稱參選目的宣揚香港民族主義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本土派鄒家成，控方指他與梁晃維及張可森，於2020年6月草擬「墨落無悔」聲明，顯示他們堅定承諾否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，亦協助其他參與者作出相同承諾。庭上播放3人受訪片段，解釋發起聲明原因，鄒家成指得悉不需簽署共同綱領後，「我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章」，梁晃維則指初選協議鬆散，需有確切文件證明。在張可森指簽署後「絕對唔可以反悔」時，鄒家成邊聽邊點頭，至張稱若其他參選人回應到時代要前進的方向，「其實你唔會覺得我哋係夾你嘅」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒家成同月於 Facebook 發文，表示「重光未至，我哋絕無放棄時代革命嘅本錢」，又指「我決定除低面罩投身政治，就係為咗將香港民族嘅理念散播到每一個角落，同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒在論壇宣揚「攬炒」及分離主義思想，並詆毀「一國兩制」，指議會不需「西裝骨骨的政客」議政，而是要選出「具備攬炒意思嘅抗爭者為大家衝擊體制，撕下香港政治上最後一塊畫皮」，籲投選有抗爭意志的代議士進入立會刺穿假象。他又指自己參選目的「非常之旗幟鮮明」，就是宣揚香港民族主義，指「建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒在《國安法》生效後，指控《國安法》將香港變成極權社會，承諾面對打壓仍會繼續抗爭，並指所有參選代議士都應進入議會「打交」，及「做任何手段癱瘓每一個議會進行」。鄒家成其後勝出初選，並出席抗爭派記者會及聯署抗爭派聲明，承諾否決財政預算迫使政府回應五大訴求，鄒家成會上表明許多本土派勝出，要「讓本土成為主流」。他其後報名參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指林卓廷筆記稱完全同意光時選舉延後仍稱要堅守議會戰線&quot;&gt;控方指林卓廷筆記稱完全同意「光時」、選舉延後仍稱要堅守議會戰線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任民主黨副主席，身兼立法會議員及北區區議員的林卓廷，控方指其競選單張將中共和政府標籤為對人權自由帶來前所未有威脅的「極權」，呼籲團結抗爭及對抗警暴。林並在6月的初選論壇，表示「中共粗暴制訂國安法，全方面鎮壓香港人。我哋香港人惟有用勇敢、智慧，同埋我哋嘅堅毅，去對抗呢個極權」。控方又指他散播對警察沒有根據的指控，承諾當選後會向警察報復。涉擾亂議會秩序案的他亦承諾會繼續在立會抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在林卓廷家中搜得其「初選 Debate Notes」，寫有「完全同意光復香港，時代革命呢個理念」。就會否反對財政預算案，筆記指「（民主黨主席）胡志偉一再公開回應話會『積極運用』（《基本法》權力反對）。況且，其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案。」至於為何不簽「墨落無悔」，筆記寫上「因為尊重戴教授，他的決定有他的理據」，並指「如果戴教授真係有份嘢，我哋承諾咗會簽」。筆記最後提及籲港人投票、珍惜每個表態機會，控方後播放初選論壇片段，顯示林最後同樣稱「香港人唔知道幾時我哋嘅投票權會最終被剝奪。我希望各位珍惜手上嘅一票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，林在另一份筆記表明他在議會、街頭及國際戰線抗爭的決心，及解釋三線結合能加強對抗政權的「非法目的」。林最終勝出初選並報名立法會選舉，而在選舉延後之後，控方指林持續詆毀並要求繼續堅定對抗政府， 包括2020年9月與梁晃維出席港大學生會舉辦的「立會委任惹爭議 議員去留利與弊」公開辯論，表明要堅守議會戰線，以配合街頭抗爭及國際聯繫，「延續三線相輔相成的抗爭策略」，又指「棄守議會戰線呢，係會令到我哋嚟緊大開中門，令到啲保皇黨同埋政府不斷打壓我哋香港人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放林卓廷初選論壇片段時，亦顯示其他候選人的發言，梁國雄稱「撐手足」後，任控方證人的林景楠說「撐手足，可以捐612或者支持黃色經濟圈」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指梁國雄稱奪全面否決權社民連欲組織罷工引國際支援&quot;&gt;控方指梁國雄稱奪全面否決權、社民連欲組織罷工引國際支援&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任社民連主席、前立法會議員梁國雄，其競選單張題為「五大訴求 缺一不可 抵抗惡法 您我同行」，並指他「貫徹社民連主張議會、街頭和法庭三面抗爭的策略」，決心落實「五大訴求」。梁又在6月24日的社民連街頭集會表示：「功成不必在我，但係一路我都係喺抗爭路上未缺席過嘅，冇理由而家缺席，亦都冇理由唔係同香港人一齊抵抗，抵抗，抵抗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，梁國雄同日轉發社民連聲明〈【爭奪全面否決權 持續不斷抗暴政】一 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉，表明要在議會奪「全面否決權」，否決惡法和不義撥款，制衡中共「全面管治權」及迫使政府實現「五大訴求」；又指爭取立會過半與尋求外國制裁同樣重要，社民連亦會嘗試組織更大規模的公民抗爭或總罷工，以引起國際社會支援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，在初選論壇被問到為何不簽，他解釋認為只是重複35+初衷，如「一定要否決財政預算案」，但他指自己過往任議員多年，每年均會否決財政預算，「呢個問題對我嚟講已經唔係問題」，故沒有需要簽署。他又在論壇上說：「我哋要攞個全面嘅否決權，操諸我手。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，梁國雄在初選前呼籲公眾投票，指他們不應懼怕《國安法》，要繼續堅持抗爭。他最終落選，並以社民連副主席身份發聲明，指社民連會遵守初選協議，又形容宣稱初選違法的說法是沒有根據及「有趣（amusing）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行主動提出，開案陳詞有兩處指梁國雄「無差別（indiscriminately）」否決財政預算案，惟原文無提及，會將之刪除。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒法庭內應用杯飲水只能飲凍水&quot;&gt;官提醒法庭內應用杯飲水、只能飲凍水&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉今在聆訊期間提醒，法庭內不可飲用樽裝飲料（“No one should drink directly from glass or bottle.”），着庭內人士使用杯子。法官李運騰補充，這是法庭長久以來的傳統，又指只能飲凍水。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oSSTSr0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方讀出開案陳詞中，針對柯耀林、李予信及余慧明3人的涉案言行，指時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明提倡全面否決政府議案「攬炒議會」，又倡組織大三罷「令社會停擺」，指「真攬炒」或許才會為香港帶來一線生機。至於柯耀林及李予信均於初選落選，李予信其後以「Plan B」身分出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方完成閱讀開案陳詞，明日將處理控方傳召社交媒體專家證人的申請，預料周一開始傳召4名認罪被告區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠。法官陳慶偉警告，指在座人士均知道將要傳召的證人身分，「如果任何人在證人作供時，嘗試騷擾或干預證人，會被視為藐視法庭及即時帶離法院大樓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指柯耀林稱中共為極權國家批警搜民研製白色恐怖&quot;&gt;控方指柯耀林稱中共為極權國家、批警搜民研製白色恐怖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任區政聯盟召集人、西貢區議員柯耀林是新界東候選人，控方指他簽署「墨落無悔」，並發文承諾參與初選協調，支持本土派參與「議會戰線」對抗政權。控方指，其政治宣言宣揚落實「真普選」，又散播對政權及中共沒有根據的不滿，包括指中共為「極權國家」，指極權對香港打壓加劇、嚴重破壞法治及剝奪港人自由權利、政權的暴力「猶如宣告港人治港正式死亡」，並呼籲團結對抗極權以「光復香港」。柯又表明，即使知道大機會因《國安法》被控，仍不會退縮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，柯在論壇呼籲議會和街頭戰線「雙結合」，爭取五大訴求，又美化違法的年輕人，指他們的「付出」值得被記住。柯表明會遵守初選協議，又籲支持有「抗爭意志」的候選人，並指自己是「行動派」，會身體力行參與議會和街頭戰線。他在初選前發文批評警方搜查民研辦公室，指是製造「白色恐怖」，籲公眾透過投票反抗。柯最終落敗並發文籲支持其他勝出者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放片段，柯耀林在初選論壇被主持問及，2018年民主黨新東補選出現紛爭，曾形容林卓廷「人格卑劣」，「你係咪都堅持原先嘅睇法？」，柯答「係」。庭上傳出笑聲，柯耀林轉身向林卓廷做致敬手勢，林亦回以致敬手勢。主持再問：「萬一你輸咗，阿廷贏咗，你會唔會都支持佢、成全佢？」柯則表示會服膺初選協議書，支持所有出線候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李予信堅持議會及街頭戰線以plan-b身分出選&quot;&gt;控方指李予信堅持議會及街頭戰線、以「Plan B」身分出選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任東區區議員、公民黨黨員李予信，是超級區議會候選人。控方指他於2020年3月25日出席公民黨「全面進攻 議會過半 實現五大訴求」記者會，黨魁楊岳橋曾表明，若政府不回應五大訴求，「我哋都會義無反顧咁對預算案投反對票，亦都希望能夠促成35+，一齊否決呢一個預算案」。同日李予信轉發公民黨〈【議會過半 反制政府】立法會過半的願景〉，重申相同承諾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，李予信以公民黨名義簽署「墨落無悔」，其後報名初選，亦附上認同公民黨宣言的宣傳單張，承諾動用反對權力，促請政府落實五大訴求。控方又指，李予信在7月的初選論壇，強調即使《國安法》生效，仍會堅持在議會及街頭戰線抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨初選前夕發布名為「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」的影片，稱「即使有國安法都唔會阻擋到香港人對抗極權嘅決心」，籲公眾投票，李予信並在片段解釋議會內要有不同角色和分工，望以初選決定出選人士增加勝算，令民主派奪過半議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信最終落選，他公開表示不會參選立法會，但後來因3名港島區候選人被DQ，他以「Plan B」身份報名參選。警方並在其辦公室和住處搜得其政治宣言單張，及具煽動性的卡和貼紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指余慧明倡攬炒議會組織大三罷令社會停擺&quot;&gt;控方指余慧明倡攬炒議會、組織大三罷令社會停擺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，是衞生服務界候選人，自稱本土抗爭派。控方指她在戴耀廷宣布「35+」計劃及「攬炒十步曲」後、宣布初選前，已發文及受訪表達支持。她於2020年3月在《獨媒》撰文〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提倡爭取35席後全面否決政府議案，觸發《基本法》第50條，令特首解散立法會及「制造憲政危機」，「攬炒」議會；又透過組織大三罷「令社會停擺」，「務求煞停一切暴政，達致制度性的改革，再共同建構重光後的香港」，表示「真攬炒」或許才會為香港帶來一線生機。她又籲「各路戰線定必要繼續，黃色經濟圈、國際戰線、文宣戰等缺一不可」，並指「要進行這場時代革命，就看大家對光復香港有多大耐性與決心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明4月接受《獨媒》訪問，指罷工一役讓她意識到「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變」，亦清楚立會過半目標是透過否決政府所有議案，令立法會停擺，觸發憲政危機，配合罷工等逼使政府正面回應五大訴求。余5月接受《大紀元》訪問亦指「政府提出任何議案我哋都要作出反對」，以迫使政權回應「五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明其後簽署「墨落無悔」聲明並報名初選，提名表格附上單張寫有「我若當選，必定承諾行使反對權利反對一切議案，直至香港政府全面回應五大訴求，決一不可為止」。控方指，余在《國安法》落實後，仍受訪指擁護「攬炒」及抗爭原則，堅持對抗政權直至最後，又籲選民投選會對抗政權的候選人。其帖文提到競選口號「一息尚存 抗爭到底」、「初衷毋忘 決戰無降」，初選後感謝選民的帖文亦有口號「重光香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明勝出初選後，發文指初選只是議會戰線的第一步，承諾會用盡一切方法令政權「付出代價」。她於7月13日出席抗爭派記者會，重申否決財政預算案迫使政府落實五大訴求，並承諾作為功能組別唯一代表，會盡力擴展抗爭戰線，同日簽署「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」。余慧明7月27日報名參選立會，並在8月受訪，指若未能達成35+她仍進入議會，「我要做要做嘅嘢，繼續係要做嘅啫，要全投反對議案嘅，會繼續做，反對財政預算案嘅，我會繼續做。」警方並於其家中搜得寫有「光復香港 時代革命」、「齊上齊落」的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。控辯雙方一直未能就承認事實達成共識，主控萬德豪並指，周一將會準備一份或多份承認事實。辯方大律師馬維騉望控方確認，是否完成讀出承認事實後才傳召證人，法官陳慶偉着他私下與辯方討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席被告早休後遭懲教分開&quot;&gt;列席被告早休後遭懲教分開&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，今日有6名認罪被告列席，他們早上原獲安排與不認罪被告同坐，並由懲教人員分隔。惟早休後，座位被重新分配，6人分成3行坐在被告欄內最盡頭，與所有不認罪被告分隔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉、黃之鋒和馮達浚6人亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，改由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表為資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方：何桂藍出席抗爭派記者會重申否決財案 辯方指何無發言 下周一起傳召四名認罪被告 官警告勿騷擾或干預作供</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第三日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-08-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第三日】" /><published>2023-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-08-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方繼續讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出各被告的涉案行為。其中3名不認罪獨立候選人，包括劉偉聰、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，均有簽署「墨落無悔」並落選，楊雪盈曾以「Plan B」身份報名參選。此外，何啟明被指散播對政權和警察無根據的不滿，指控警暴導致大量原因不明的死亡，又曾發文呼籲捐出 iPad 和 iPhone 等電子器材，以協助初選票站運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉和黃之鋒等亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日開始讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出各被告的涉案行為，當中誤稱鄭達鴻為「南區區議員」。今日甫開庭，控方更正鄭的身份為「東區區議員」，然後繼續作開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉發現旁聽席上有人戴白色帽，要求該人士脫帽，並提醒所有旁聽人士法庭內不得戴帽和太陽眼鏡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，公民黨於2020年7月10日在 Facebook 發布一段名為「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」的影片，稱「即使有國安法都唔會阻擋到香港人對抗極權嘅決心」及不會放棄議會戰線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在鄭的住所和電子器材中搜得他為論壇準備的「論壇天書」及競選單張，當中承諾他會否決預算案迫特首回應「五大訴求」；又搜得公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」的截圖、初選前後他向逾2千人拉票和謝票的 WhatsApp 訊息、「Michael Cheuk Ki P…」及「區兄」就初選協議的 WhatsApp 討論截圖等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱否決議案向政府問責被指錯誤指控國安法&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱否決議案向政府「問責」、被指錯誤指控國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就獨立候選人、時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈，控方指她堅定支持初選計劃，在初選競選單張中稱：「五大訴求、議會過半是我們共同呼喚的將來。」她在論壇指自己清楚知道18區區議會民主派被當局及建制派的打壓，並提倡連結民主陣營力量，以不同角色「一齊上」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，她曾在6月9日的記者會表示「35+」目標是爭取立法會控制權，透過行使《基本法》賦予的憲制權力要求政府「問責」，又承諾否決預算案逼使特首回應「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選結束後，楊在個人 Facebook 發布題為「民主路上見！」的文章，表示自己票數不足以出線，但她會遵守初選結果，承諾不參選正式立法會選舉，並呼籲她的支持者投票給民主陣營的其他候選人，以達至立會議席過半。當港島區3名民主派被「DQ」後，楊雪盈曾以「Plan B」身份報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在楊辦事處的電腦中發現「35+」立會過半港島區的協調機制草擬文件。其競選單張寫有「國安壓境 兩制已毀」，控方指她透過錯誤指控引起對《國安法》的強烈反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋稱不惜以肢體抗爭癱瘓政府以議員身分支援街頭抗爭&quot;&gt;彭卓棋稱不惜以肢體抗爭癱瘓政府、以議員身分支援街頭抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就獨立候選人、時任南區區議員彭卓棋，控方指他在論壇提倡街頭、議會及國際戰線，包括將中共標籤為「敵人」，表明面對極權及《國安法》打壓，仍會「聲討賣港派、港共派、中間派」，並全力對抗共產黨；亦會於議會「不惜以肢體抗爭」癱瘓政府並否決財政預算案，並透過於社運現場出現和與執法部門溝通，以其區議員身份和資源支援街頭抗爭。他亦同意建立「香港民族」，並展現反對《基本法》第23條的決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，他於競選宣傳品自稱「本土抗爭派」，並形容香港警察為濫權及視港人為敵的「極權劊子手」，要求改革警隊及為「手足」帶來公義，並指初選最終目標是「35+」及「攬炒」，逼使政府回應「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師一度指出，彭卓棋從沒講過「無差別」地否決財政預算案，惟控方在開案陳詞中指他聲言無差別地（indiscriminately）否決財政預算。控方表示稍後會修正開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何啟明散播對警察無根據不滿倡打倒共產黨&quot;&gt;控方指何啟明散播對警察無根據不滿、倡「打倒共產黨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任民協副主席、深水埗區議員何啟明，控方指他在論壇提倡議會及街頭戰線，包括提及2019年8月曾於深水埗警署外與「70+手足」一起「反暴政」、「食TG（催淚彈）」；控方又指他散播對政權和警察無根據的不滿，指控警暴導致大量原因不明的死亡、「極權」透過任意拘控針對年輕人，並指控中共濫用《國安法》打壓港人及導致香港「攬炒」，港人必需反抗到底、「打倒共產黨」，並透過國際線等反抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何啟明曾發文呼籲捐出 iPad 和 iPhone 等電子器材，以協助初選票站運作；並批評警方搜查香港民研辦公室，指政權會用盡一切方法打壓初選，但他仍無畏無懼。而何啟明勝出初選後，控方指他承諾於議會抗爭，又強調不會容許「犯罪集團」警隊接受任何公帑資助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方於其辦公室搜出民協2019年3月至2020年4月有關初選的會議紀錄，提及「選舉主軸」包括達至35+，及表達民協在35+的角色以游說選民支持。何的競選口號亦包括「反暴政 衛我城」、「立會過半 光復香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰稱議會戰線與前線裏應外合-批極權攻擊司法制度&quot;&gt;劉偉聰稱議會戰線與前線「裏應外合」 批極權攻擊司法制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名獨立候選人、時任深水埗區議員劉偉聰，控方指其政治宣言提及「反惡法 抗警暴 民權重光」，而他在論壇提倡議會及街頭戰線，稱透過爭取「35+」便可修訂打壓人權的惡法，又美化前線抗爭者和「暴徒」為「手足」，讚賞他們展示建制外改變歷史的力量，並指留守後方的人可參與議會戰線，與前線「裏應外合」反抗政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉亦批評政府為獨裁，指律政司司長及政府委任的代表令公眾對司法獨立嚴重失去信心，其競選單張亦表明港人公民權利被打壓，他目睹極權持續不斷打壓及攻擊香港司法制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方又搜得名為「623 Debate 要點」的筆記，載有劉擬於論壇詢問其他候選人的問題，包括：「黃碧雲：為何不簽署初選立場確認書？是否連否決財政算案，這樣制度內的抗爭都不願意承諾？」他又擬向何啟明指出，即使初選無要求他們簽署共同綱領，他亦自發簽署立場聲明書，確保抗爭陣營參選人有最基本抗爭意志，並問有簽署的何啟明如何看無簽署的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放一段九龍西初選論壇片段，劉偉聰回答何啟明質詢時提及律政司司長為司法人員推薦委員會的當然成員，所委任的法官缺乏市民信任，在法治風雨飄搖的時候，法官的質素和認受性至關重要，「當然我會知道 Sunny（張崑陽洋名）會話，法治唔值得再提，但係我唔係 Sunny，但我依然見到陽光，我見到 the sunny sky。」被告欄有人發出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休後再開庭時，法官陳慶偉表示，審訊開首時批准被告使用電腦作筆記，此為電腦的唯一用途，但若果有任何被告使用電腦作筆記以外的用途，這項權利便會被剝奪。辯方大律師石書銘一度解釋稱，早前曾向法庭申請允許下載法律文件於電腦中，以方便被告閱讀，但與懲教溝通後，已確認不准電腦連結 Wi-Fi 或數據上網。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳官強調不需受審的被告只是以列席者的身份出庭（acting simply as an observant），提醒他們不是來參與社交聚會（“You’re not attending social gathering.”），若果作出任何干擾，便會安排他們到另一處聽審，不要濫用可以列席的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方下午繼續讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出民主黨黃碧雲和民協施德來的涉案行為。其中黃碧雲沒有聯署「墨落無悔」，在初選論壇中遭質疑，她則回應稱會用盡憲制內所有權力和手段爭取「五大訴求」，若否決財政預算案能夠促成此目標，「我哋一定會做」。施德來則被指競選單張內容與「墨落無悔」相當相似（substantially similar），在論壇中聲言與中共「冇討論嘅空間、冇談判嘅餘地」，若當選會否決所有政府議案。二人最終在初選中落敗，之後遵守「35+」協議，沒有報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉和黃之鋒等亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲稱民主黨具議會國際街頭戰線技能中共獨裁需團結反抗&quot;&gt;黃碧雲稱民主黨具議會國際街頭戰線技能、中共獨裁需團結反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民主黨時任立法會議員黃碧雲，其競選口號為「反抗專權 緊抱自由」，政治宣言提及對抗極權和不公法律、追究警暴及全面改革警隊，監察教育局以抵抗白色恐怖及洗腦教育。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黃在論壇提倡議會戰線，強調透過「35+」對抗暴政和「全力抵抗惡法」，又承諾會用盡憲制所有權力和手段爭取「五大訴求」。控方又指，她形容中共為「專制獨裁」、「不公義政權」，表明要團結民主派力量抵抗，又指民主黨曾用盡各種方式反對《逃犯條例》修訂，可展現其反抗決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放九龍西選舉論壇片段，另一參選人劉澤鋒指黃碧雲沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，又質問黃碧雲：「民主黨係咪應承一齊攬炒先？」黃碧雲回應：「我哋係會用盡憲制裡面所有嘅權力同埋手段係爭取五大訴求，如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，其競選單張指控「健康碼」會將個人私隱及所在傳去中國、大灣區票站受監控，亦提及「民主黨反對國安法」，民主黨會於港人並肩對抗極權。黃亦曾撰文〈有平台 才有博奕之地〉，指民主運動包括國際、街頭和議會戰線，若在議會戰線輕言而退會「三線盡失」，留有一地才能續與威權政府博奕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最終在初選中得票不足落敗，她在 Facebook 發布一篇題為「#記者會發言 願榮光歸香港！」的文章，表示尊重初選結果和選民決定，她會為了達至「35+」而遵守協議，不報名參選立法會，並承諾全力支持其他參選的民主派。同日，黃把民主黨的新聞稿張貼在其個人 Facebook，題為「尊重初選結果 承認落敗，黃碧雲宣布不再參選立法會」。黃又在7月15日的民主黨記者會中指出，民主黨過去二十多年，具有議會、國際及街頭戰線所需的技能和經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民協主席施德來稱要有全面攬炒決心&quot;&gt;民協主席施德來稱要有「全面攬炒決心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任民協主席、黃大仙區議員施德來，控方指《立場新聞》於2020年3月刊出他所撰的文章〈議會過半 夢可成真 – 回應對民協「N+2初選方案」〉，當中提倡議會戰線及初選協調機制。施於同年6月在 Facebook 發文，表明已簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並稱若果當選立法會議員，將會按照計劃否決財政預算，迫使行政長官辭職。控方提到，原文並無「無差別」字眼，將會在開案陳詞中刪去「indiscriminately」一詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，施的競選單張內容與「墨落無悔」相當相似（substantially similar）。施並在論壇稱：「今日嘅中共，我哋冇討論嘅空間、冇談判嘅餘地，只有抗爭到底」，進入議會後「我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有議案」、「攬炒呢個政府」。他質詢民主黨胡志偉時，表明「35+」要有「全面攬炒的決心」，但民主黨創黨主席李柱銘卻稱「攬炒好幼稚」，問胡志偉：「嚟緊35+，會唔會全面攬炒政府所有議案呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，他散播對政權不滿，指控中共打壓香港且不可信、沒討論餘地，又指「真正攬炒香港」的是林鄭和中共，故港人要抗爭到底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來報名初選時附上九龍東的「共同綱領」，控方並指其 Facebook 帖文以競選口號「堅定抗爭」、「抗極權」、「衛我城」、「35＋」作「hashtag」，可見其抗爭決心。而施落選後停止選舉工程，並表示雖預計中共打壓無窮無盡，但相信港人會繼續抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）續審。控方今續讀出開案陳詞，提及戴耀廷於其中一次新界西協調會議，向與會者表示除了「五大訴求」外，協議應明確表明會無差別否決財政預算案，及落選者不應再參選。庭上播放相關片段，當中鏡頭晃動，大部分時間置於枱底下，有時舉機拍攝桌子對面戴耀廷的發言情況，疑為偷拍片段。此外，控方又指戴耀廷提出「真攬炒十步」，終引致政府停擺、外國制裁中共，當中法庭傳譯主任一度沒有譯出文中「indiscriminately（無差別）」一字，遭法官要求重譯，指為本案「重要字眼（important word）」。控方又指，戴耀廷曾表明不希望製作列表列出各候選人的承諾，以免留下證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷提真攬炒十步-官指無差別為本案重要字眼&quot;&gt;戴耀廷提「真攬炒十步」 官指「無差別」為本案重要字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨於開案陳詞提及，戴耀廷發起初選推動「攬炒」議程，透過取得立會過半議席，成為「大殺傷力憲政武器」，抗衡中國政府，及迫使政府回應特赦政治犯、追究警暴、雙普選等訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續指，為了進一步推動其抗爭的「大策略（grand strategy），戴耀廷於2020年4月28日發表〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，詳列攬炒十步的時間表和路線圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第一步（2020年7至8月）。政府廣泛取消民主派人士參選立法會資格，包括現任議員。民主派由Plan B繼續參選。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第二步（2020年9月）。因兩辦干預及DQ，刺激更多港人投票支持民主派，及配合策略投票，使民主派成功取得35席或以上。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第三步（2020年10月）。特首及律政司開展司法程序DQ民主派議員，但因法庭需時處理，故民主派繼續主導立法會。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第四步（2020年10月至2021年4月）。政府向立法會提出的所有撥款申請都被立法會否決。政府只能維持一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第五步（2021年5月）。立法會否決政府《財政預算案》，特首解散立法會，並以臨時撥款方式維持政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第六步（2021年10月）。立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第七步（2021年11月）。立法會再次否決《財政預算案》，特首辭職及特區政府停擺。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第八步（2021年12月）。全國人大常委會宣佈香港進入緊急狀態，中央政府把國家安全法直接適用於香港，解散立法會、成立臨時立法會、下屆特首由協商產生，大舉拘押民主派領袖。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第九步（2021年12月後），香港社會街頭抗爭變得更加激烈，鎮壓也非常血腥，港人發動三罷，令香港社會陷入停頓。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第十步（2022年1月後）。西方國家對中共實行政治及經濟制裁。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯主任將陳詞譯成中文時，法官陳慶偉一度打斷，指她兩度沒有譯出文中「indiscriminately（無差別）」否決財政預算一詞，指認為該字為本案的「重要字眼（important word）」，傳譯主任後再次翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方播新界西協調會議片段-鏡頭晃動疑為偷拍&quot;&gt;控方播新界西協調會議片段 鏡頭晃動、疑為偷拍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷和區諾軒舉辦的協調會議，控方指在5月8日的第二次新界西協調會議，戴耀廷向與會者表示當時只餘下「新界西」和「超級區議會」兩區尚未達成協調機制，並指除了「五大訴求」外，協議應明確表明會無差別否決財政預算案，及落選後不會參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放會議片段，似乎為其中一名與會者偷拍所得，當中鏡頭晃動，大部分時間置於枱底下，有時舉機拍攝桌子對面戴耀廷的發言情況，戴有時會被其他人影遮蓋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當中戴向與會者指，否決財政預算案是令解散立法會出現「最緊要」一步，「如果否決財政預算案呢，我哋先至會行到去下一步」，望協議能訂明「會運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」達到「五大訴求」，以爭取「特赦、懲戒警暴同埋重啟政改」。戴提議新界西跟隨新界東的協議，僅剔除「積極（運用）」的字眼，認為與會者均能同意。控方指，張可森、伍健偉、尹兆堅的代表、譚凱邦和王百羽等人有份參與該次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷召記者會交代初選安排-稱不望列出承諾免留下證據&quot;&gt;戴耀廷召記者會交代初選安排 稱不望列出承諾免留下證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年6月2日，戴耀廷將寫有初選目的及時間表的新聞稿草稿給予區諾軒、趙家賢及鍾錦麟，趙家賢並承諾進行修改。翌日，戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢決定於一星期後召記者會交代初選的時間和詳情。記者會前夕，在區諾軒提醒下，趙家賢草擬採訪邀請，戴耀廷並向其他人傳閱各個選區初選協議的最後版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月9日，戴耀廷、區諾軒，與民主動力的趙家賢和鍾錦麟召開「民主派35+ 公民投票及眾籌行動」記者會，自我介紹為初選組織者及協調者，並交代初選安排。戴確認就地區直選、超級區議會及衞生服務界別，曾召開超過10次會議，以達成35+共識，並稱有信心得到「有規範性嘅結果」，又表明不希望製作列表列出各候選人的承諾，以免留下計劃的證據。庭上播放片段，戴耀廷一度稱「大貪啲，唔係講35+，係講40+㗎啦」，何桂藍等被告發出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lobpRtR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又確認香港民意研究所會提供技術支援；趙家賢則確認戴及區委託民主動力協助統籌。戴及趙計劃為初選眾籌，戴稱預計需400萬，趙則稱需要350萬，又提醒支持者捐款勿超出1千元，才能歸類為「小額眾籌」，避過相關選舉條例。戴及區亦呼籲各區黃店及區議員協助組票站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢草擬提名表格草稿戴耀廷與區諾軒就尋找票站討論&quot;&gt;趙家賢草擬提名表格草稿、戴耀廷與區諾軒就尋找票站討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，鍾錦麟經趙家賢指示發帖，提及初選的路線圖及行動計劃、不同階段目標及所需資源。在6月11至12日，趙家賢向戴耀廷、區諾軒和鍾錦麟發出提名表格草稿，戴耀廷和區諾軒協助審閱並給予意見，戴、區和趙並就表格的提交方法和死線討論。在6月至7月期間，戴耀廷與區諾軒常就尋找合適票站作討論，戴並於6月14日向其餘3人表示已找到100個票站，目標為200個。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方民主動力很早以前已尋求外國勢力協助和關注&quot;&gt;控方：民主動力很早以前已尋求外國勢力協助和關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協助籌辦初選的民主動力，控方指它提供平台，協調初選參與者、招募義工、為眾籌宣傳，及準備器材及物流安排，包括招募逾180名義工和辦簡介會。控方又指，民主動力是成立於2002年的政治團體，根據其2019至2020年工作報告，它除作為民主派平台，亦在很早以前已尋求外國勢力和團體關注和協助香港內部事務，及散播對政府、立法和行政機關的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，案發時趙家賢為民主動力召集人，鍾錦麟為副召集人，譚文豪和尹兆堅則擔任委員。其中趙家賢、鍾錦麟和同案被捕但無被控的人權律師關尚義（John J Clancey），是民主動力銀行戶口的簽署人，透過網上眾籌平台「GoGetFunding」等為初選籌得逾348萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，款項在趙家賢和關尚義同意下可動用，以向初選提供各項服務。民動將提供的服務名為「製作及宣傳服務」，細分為「提名及核實」、「投票計劃及實行」、「傳媒論壇製作」、「宣傳：廣播軟件、網站、報章、Facebook」、「服務站運作及管理」及「結果點算及公布」，民動就服務向參選人派發收據，但他們不需繳費。警方並從趙的辦公室搜得提名表格等文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）續審。控方今續讀出開案陳詞，指初選提名表格、「共同綱領」和「墨落無悔」為本案「關鍵文件」，其中初選提名表格和保證金收據，均列明所有參選人須同意協調會議的「35+」共識；九龍東和新界西候選人額外簽署的「共同綱領」，承諾否決財政預算案以落實五大訴求，顯示被告對遵守協議的忠誠；「墨落無悔」則證被告不顧法律後果，仍堅定承諾達成本案串謀目的。控方又指，初選後15名出線被告發布「抗爭派」聲明，顯示他們堅定反抗政府。不過庭上展示「共同綱領」正本時，法官陳慶偉指，該中文原文並無提及「無差別」否決財政預算，主控周天行指會修改開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選提名表格及保證金收據列明須同意35共識&quot;&gt;初選提名表格及保證金收據列明須同意「35+」共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續讀出開案陳詞，本案第6至47名被告，於2020年6月19日至22日，向民主動力提交100個選民提名報名參選。控方指，提名表格屬「關鍵文件（key documents）」，當中要求參選人簽署聲明，確保「同意及支持戴耀廷和區諾軒所帶領的協調會議裡達成的共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，該協議確保所有參選人支持及遵守戴耀廷草擬的共同綱領，包括動用權力否決財政預算，並確保他們支持「五大訴求」及遵守各區達成的共識。參選人亦須提交1萬元保證金，並獲發收據，同樣列明須同意及支持協調會議的共識，若違反將被沒收保證金。而在選舉延後的9月7日，民主動力向被告發出退還1萬元保證金的收據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新界西及九龍東參選人簽額外共同綱領-控方顯示被告忠誠&quot;&gt;新界西及九龍東參選人簽額外「共同綱領」 控方：顯示被告忠誠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，新界西及九龍東參選人亦在提名表格附上額外簽署的「共同綱領」，承諾無差別否決財政預算迫特首回應五大訴求，並承諾若無法取得該區前5名（九龍東）或前6名（新界西），應即時停止選舉工程及籲選民支持同區的勝出者，控方同列為「關鍵文件」。控方指，該綱領顯示被告對遵守協議的忠誠，而在本案8名新界西及6名九龍東參選被告中，僅施德來一人不認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上同時展示該「共同綱領」的正本，惟法官陳慶偉指，該中文原文並無提及「無差別」否決財政預算，主控周天行指會作出修改。根據文件，綱領僅提及會「積極運用」《基本法》賦予的權力，否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，區諾軒是於6月14日通知戴耀廷、趙家賢和鍾錦麟，九龍東候選人達成共識，公開發布共同綱領，承諾爭取積極運用權力否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告簽墨落無悔-證不顧法律後果-堅定承諾達成串謀目的&quot;&gt;控方：被告簽墨落無悔 證不顧法律後果 堅定承諾達成串謀目的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同列為「關鍵文件」的，還包括由鄒家成、梁晃維及張可森發起的「墨落無悔」聲明。控方引述聲明內容，要求參選人承諾認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」，及承諾行使《基本法》權力否決財政預算案以迫使特首回應「五大訴求」，包括撤回示威者控罪、追究警暴及重啟政改；亦要求承諾若支持度「跌出各區預計可得議席範圍」，須表明停止選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及擬定原意「僅為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」，並呼籲港人「拒絕支持抗爭意志飄忽不定的參選人」。控方指，聲明證明簽署的33名被告不顧法律後果，仍堅定承諾達成本案串謀目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示鄒家成 Facebook 專頁發布的「墨落無悔」聲明時，有被告起鬨稱：「嘩」、「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒回應墨落無悔-稱即使無文件-協調協議仍實然存在&quot;&gt;區諾軒回應墨落無悔 稱即使無文件 協調協議仍實然存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;發起「墨落無悔」聲明的梁晃維、張可森和鄒家成，於6月19日重申簽署協議的重要。控方指，區諾軒發文回應，重申「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在」，並具有約束力，不公開不等於參與者沒有承諾遵守，亦「不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷屢稱初選不違國安法民研被搜仍如期舉行初選&quot;&gt;戴耀廷屢稱初選不違《國安法》、民研被搜仍如期舉行初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《國安法》於6月30日生效，戴耀廷翌日向區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟提起《國安法》下的罪行，又就他對初選會否違法的回應徵詢毛孟靜的意見。戴耀廷和區諾軒其後於7月6日，與兩名香港民意研究所職員召開記者會，解釋初選安排和投票系統，戴並稱作為法律學者，認為初選不會違反《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權及第29條勾結境外勢力。區諾軒同意，並指「35+計劃」只屬協調，並不會違反《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7月9日，時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞接受《文匯報》訪問，指初選有可能違《國安法》第20條、22條及29條，控方指即使如此，戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢仍於同日，與楊雪盈和余慧明等被告召記者會，戴表明35+目標爭取立法會控制權，行使《基本法》賦予的權力向政府「問責」，並重申初選不違《國安法》。會上朱凱廸特別指出，初選向世界展示香港人不會屈服於北京殘暴統治，籲香港人勇敢站出來揭露中共暴行。會後戴耀廷3人帶領呼喊「支持民主派 35+」等口號，候選人亦舉起「支持民主派35+公民投票」及「7月11-12齊投票」的紙牌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nkgN8c2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為初選投票提供技術支援的香港民意研究所，於7月10日被警方搜查，惟控方指，戴耀廷4名組織者討論後仍同意初選按原定計劃進行，鍾錦麟在趙家賢指示下，在民動專頁發文批搜查民研令初選籌備工作延誤，工作人員會加密保安系統。戴同日提醒提供議辦作票站的區議員，或會違反租約並有法律後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選於7月11至12日舉行，庭上播放片段，顯示戴耀廷公布初選進度和結果時，重申相信參選人會遵守協議承諾作參選決定。控方續指，中聯辦於7月14日公開譴責初選違《國安法》，但所有被告仍根據協議參選或不參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15抗爭派簽立場聲明-控方重申對政府堅定反抗&quot;&gt;15抗爭派簽立場聲明 控方：重申對政府堅定反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，13名勝出的本土派被告於7月15日召開記者會，包括袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、黃之鋒、李嘉達、馮達浚、何桂藍、劉頴匡、鄒家成、張可森、伍健偉、岑敖暉、王百羽及余慧明，重申對抗政府的立場不會動搖。翻譯讀出上述段落後，有被告起鬨。其後庭上播放片段，顯示岑敖暉指一眾抗爭派若進入議會，「會好堅定地行使《基本法》賦予畀代議士嘅權利」，「無論咩內容都會否決否財政預算案」，期間鄒家成等人望向岑敖暉，岑則笑了笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指上述13人，同日與朱凱廸和黃子悅一同發布「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，並指該聲明重申及確認被告在記者會上聲言作堅定反抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過翻查資料，朱凱廸和黃子悅當日均有出席記者會，而伍健偉並無出席，由林進代替。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方若非選舉延期-涉案計劃將實現&quot;&gt;控方：若非選舉延期 涉案計劃將實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府其後延後選舉一年，控方指稱，若非選舉延期，涉案串謀計劃會繼續執行直至實現，並會嚴重影響對維持香港運作和穩定重要的公共服務及市民的日常生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案被告於2021年1月6至7日被捕，控方指，望法庭考慮上述證據，裁定被告有罪。控方其後開始讀出附件內針對各被告的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PZxUn7e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方下午讀出開案陳詞附件，列出各被告言行，其中發起「三投三不投」聯署的吳政亨，控方指他是戴耀廷支持者，不但宣傳初選目標，亦在策劃、組織和推動串謀計劃上擔當關鍵角色。其涉案行為包括自資在《蘋果日報》頭版賣廣告，宣傳具約束力的初選；並透過提倡舉辦初選論壇、製作簡報向戴耀廷提議不同的初選機制、響應香港民研派出觀察員監察初選，協助設計及安排舉行初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放吳政亨製作的宣傳片段時，吳與馮達浚隨音樂節奏擺動身體，鄒家成忍不住發笑。播放其自拍片段時，何桂藍、馮達浚、黃之鋒等望向吳，吳做出聳肩動作。現時已剃去鬍子的吳又應鄒家成要求除下口罩，向旁聽席展示其樣貌，鄒並摸一摸其下巴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨被指為初選組織者&quot;&gt;吳政亨被指為「初選組織者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被指稱為「初選組織者」的5人中，只有吳政亨不認罪受審。控方指稱，吳是戴耀廷的支持者，曾協助戴於2016年發起的「雷動計劃」，並在案發時期以「李伯盧」名義行事，不僅宣傳戴耀廷和區諾軒提出的目標，亦在策劃、組織和推動串謀計劃上擔當關鍵角色，包括發起及宣傳「三投三不投」、提倡舉辦初選論壇，及協助策劃和安排初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方吳政亨發起三投三不投聯署-目標協調候選人爭35&quot;&gt;控方：吳政亨發起「三投三不投」聯署 目標協調候選人爭35+&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，為回應戴耀廷和區諾軒有關初選的倡議，吳政亨於2020年3月19日發起「三投三不投」聯署，呼籲選民不要投票給三類人士：不支持舉辦初選、不參與初選及拒絕遵守初選結果的人，以確保候選人遵守協議。吳並於4月9日在《獨媒》撰文〈親共派都叫停初選，民主派有無初選空間？〉，解釋「三投三不投」作為獨立民間運動幫助初選，是為了減少宣傳開支及避免招致選舉經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，吳提出聯署目標，即以設計良好的初選協調候選人，以爭取立會議席35+。吳於其「李伯盧」Facebook 專頁宣傳聯署，亦管理聯署專頁，曾形容戴「從佔中、雷動、風雲、初選，為香港，一直挑最難的路而行」，感激戴為其聯署「加持」，「我們會繼續努力，凝聚民間力量，全力支持戴教授，爭取議會過半，35+！」吳又設立 YouTube 頻道宣傳，當中有影片指責不願遵守初選結果的政黨，包括街工，又重申其聯署能令候選人遵守初選結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，吳於5月曾在《獨媒》、《立場新聞》等，發布一系列支持戴耀廷主張及批評拒絕遵守協議者的文章，吳亦於2020年7月3日自資在《蘋果日報》頭版賣廣告，宣傳其聯署及初選，又向公眾人物發信尋求對初選及其聯署的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方吳提倡舉辦初選論壇-顯示協助安排初選&quot;&gt;控方：吳提倡舉辦初選論壇 顯示協助安排初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，吳透過提倡舉辦初選論壇，協助安排初選。控方指稱，為響應戴耀廷3月在〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉一文就舉辦選舉論壇的提議，吳政亨於4月撰文〈點解要初選？臨選前退選唔好咩？（二）〉，當中稱：「初選競選時間至少需要有五至六個禮拜，曝光方面需要各友好媒體努力配合，初選辯論亦可在友好電視台或在網上直播。」控方指，其後在區諾軒的協調下，一系列的選舉論壇於2020年6月25日至7月4日期間舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾製作簡報提議不同機制-控方吳政亨協助設計及安排初選&quot;&gt;曾製作簡報提議不同機制 控方：吳政亨協助設計及安排初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，吳政亨協助策劃及安排初選。控方指，於尚未對外公佈舉辦初選的階段，戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢曾與不同人士開會作宣傳，而吳曾於2020年3月製作詳盡的宣傳簡報，提議不同的初選機制。而吳的電腦亦儲存了2020年6月題為「採訪邀請」的文件，提及吳「其實遠於推動聯署前，已開始推動初選工作。佢有份同戴（耀廷）設計初選計劃」，又指聯署運動是令初選能成功的「骨幹」，亦是提供初選「約束力」的支架，並指經過聯署後有選區由「無約束力」變成半約束力，顯示吳協助宣傳具約束力的初選，「聯署已有實際影響力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，其 YouTube 頻道發布一段影片「三投三不投全力協助初選投票」，宣傳初選票站地圖和資訊，又稱響應香港民意研究所的「觀察員運動」，派出多名義工擔任「觀察員」監察初選，包括他自己。控方指，吳透過全力支持觀察員運動，協助初選舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方初選結束後-吳政亨繼續宣傳&quot;&gt;控方：初選結束後 吳政亨繼續宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，初選投票結束後，吳政亨繼續透過不同社交媒體平台，宣傳「三投三不投」，包括在 YouTube 發布影片稱「多謝戴耀廷同區諾軒兩人牽頭，令到今次初選成事」，又承認已透過戴向所有候選人發出「三投三不投」的聲明，指不同意無約束力的初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又發文〈N以內係正選，N以外係後備，就係咁簡單〉，呼籲所有候選人遵守初選結果，並發布影片總結「三投三不投」如何促進初選進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻被指向歐洲議會游說設救生艇稱35是光復法治最好方法&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻被指向歐洲議會游說設「救生艇」、稱35+是光復法治最好方法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦讀出時任區議員、公民黨黨員鄭達鴻所涉行為，指公民黨於2020年3月召開記者會，黨魁楊岳橋承諾會無差別否決政府法案，其後所有成員均簽署「墨落無悔」，公民黨並在初選前夕發文稱《國安法》不會阻擋港人對抗極權的決心，籲公眾投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指鄭明知《國安法》將實施，仍於初選論壇稱爭取「35+」可「由制度根本改革」，亦是「光復法治」最好方法；又強調否決財政預算案可對抗「極權」，迫特首回應「五大訴求」。他又指在《國安法》陰霾下，一直代表公民黨向歐洲議會游說設立「救生艇計劃」，讓年青人有機會刪除案底。另外，開案陳詞誤稱東區區議員的鄭為「南區區議員」，惟控方並無更正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，控方將繼續讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22被告今出席-1&quot;&gt;22被告今出席&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告入庭時，吳敏兒向旁聽席揮手，又微笑做出心心手勢，岑敖暉則拉下口罩與妻子做手勢交流，有懲教人員着揮手被告「放低手」。前香港眾志黃莉莉帶同兒子到場，黃之鋒和袁嘉蔚等向他揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，改由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表為資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙至今逾23個月。其中16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）正式開審，預計審期90日。16名不認罪被告，及原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的林景楠和伍健偉應訊，於庭上正式答辯。其中伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，鄒家成逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，爭取普選無罪，對抗暴政無罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍質疑今早才收到最新的開案陳詞，發現控罪詳情已刪去指控被告「威脅使用武力」，與控罪字眼不一，說「你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬」，法官指其律師會向她解釋。此外，庭上有被告在控方發言時發出聲音，法官陳慶偉警告被告勿干擾法庭程序，否則會安排他整個審訊都坐在囚室門後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨右手紮三角繃帶-認罪6被告列席&quot;&gt;吳政亨右手紮三角繃帶 認罪6被告列席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則會自辯。而審前覆核由大律師沈仲平代表的林景楠，早前透露因沈「沒有根據我的指示向法庭傳達我要求傳達的訊息」而將他解聘，今改由大律師吳漢輝代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告，包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人，及原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的伍健偉和林景楠出席。另外，認罪的岑敖暉、馮達浚、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、毛孟靜6人亦有列席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還柙被告於約10時陸續入庭，林卓廷向獲保釋的黃碧雲揮手，梁國雄入場時有人喊「毛哥！」，法庭職員稱「唔好叫」。早前因做運動意外受傷的吳政亨，身穿西裝出席，右手紮三角繃帶，有旁聽人士讚「幾靚仔」，袁嘉蔚剪了「冬菇頭」，鄒家成則頻頻笑着向旁聽席揮手和比劃手勢。梁國雄妻子陳寶瑩、民主黨劉慧卿、社民連曾健成等均有旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;改認罪兩被告答辯-伍健偉我顛覆極權國家政權未成功我承認控罪&quot;&gt;改認罪兩被告答辯 伍健偉：我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪先表示，原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的伍健偉和林景楠，須再作答辯。法官陳慶偉指那所有被告都要答辯，萬指認為不需要，惟陳慶偉重申看不到為何部分人不需答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭書記其後向被告讀出控罪，被告逐一答辯，就改為認罪的林景楠和伍健偉，伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，林景楠則說：「我認罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成不認罪-梁國雄無罪可認對抗暴政無罪&quot;&gt;鄒家成：不！認！罪！ 梁國雄：無罪可認，對抗暴政無罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於不認罪被告，自辯的劉偉聰在律師席稱「My Lord, not guilty.」，陳志全高聲說：「不認罪！」，鄒家成亦逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，身旁被告起鬨。林卓廷面帶凝重說：「法官閣下，我不認罪」，余慧明堅定說：「我不認罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，爭取普選無罪，對抗暴政無罪」，有旁聽人士發笑。法官陳慶偉嚴肅向旁聽席說：「這是一個很莊嚴的場合，我一直都尊重每個被告及公眾，所以也希望你給予同樣的尊重，多謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍質疑控罪詳情已改你-charge-都唔清楚叫人-plea點-plea-啊大佬&quot;&gt;何桂藍質疑控罪詳情已改：你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;輪到何桂藍時，她表示，「唔好意思我有個問題，因為律政司好鍾意做 deadline fighter，我今朝先攞到最新嘅 opening」，並指剛發現控罪詳情已刪除指控被告以「threat of force（威脅使用武力）」的非法手段犯案，但剛讀出的控罪仍有相關字眼，問「我係認緊邊條？」，「咁你仲告唔告我哋威脅使用武力㗎而家？」法官陳仲衡問何的大律師 Trevor Beel 是否已向何解釋修訂，Beel 稱稍後會解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到吳政亨答辯，他指在答辯前，認為何桂藍希望發言。法官陳慶偉指他不是要求答辯，何桂藍即喊：「你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬？」陳慶偉指其代表律師會向她解釋，何桂藍重申她是不認罪，又指「我都好尊重法庭」，但「我唔明點解問人答辯嗰日條 charge 都唔清唔楚，總之我 not guilty 嘅，唔使嘥時間，多謝」。Trevor Beel 稱因控罪同時提及武力及其他非法手段，但控方在開案陳詞的指控修訂為武力以外的非法手段，故何有此混淆，會再向她解釋。吳政亨最後說：「I plead not guilty my Lord.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官稱被告不應在位上叫嚷-警告或安排審訊時坐囚室門後&quot;&gt;法官稱被告不應在位上叫嚷 警告或安排審訊時坐囚室門後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後一度指，理解何桂藍是不認罪，何桂藍即在被告欄高喊：「係啊！」官指她「不需叫嚷（no need to yell）」，何再回應自己是「正常講嘢聲量」。法官李運騰並指，法庭的慣常做法，是當被告有法律代表，便應透過律師作出指示，此時何桂藍與身旁懲教人員發生推撞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭其後討論被告在審訊期間使用電子器材及專家證人等安排，期間有被告發笑，伍健偉並在欄內嘲「too simple, sometimes naive」，此時陳慶偉指：「你可否停止？我不會容許被告打斷法庭程序，你不應在位上叫嚷」，又指法庭有規矩和程序，警告若被告再打斷法庭程序，會安排他審訊期間坐在囚室門後。陳又指，他過去曾在另一宗案件中下令被告於整個審訊期間坐在囚室門後，因該被告不斷騷擾作為控方證人的女兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭於11時20分左右休庭，法官並指已認罪的林景楠及伍健偉可先行離開，惟伍健偉代表律師指他希望繼續留下。散庭前，岑敖暉舉手欲發言，惟法官不作理會，繼續離庭，陳慶偉並說「Counsel（律師）」，着他找律師。散庭時，曾健成高喊：「大家頂住啊，阿毛！阿廷！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨申審訊遷就物理治療-官批被告用電腦做筆記&quot;&gt;吳政亨申審訊遷就物理治療 官批被告用電腦做筆記&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指，吳現時每星期約有一個早上需前往醫院做物理治療，但不希望錯過審訊，望法庭在其治療時間不會安排審訊。法官陳慶偉聞言即提議懲教安排吳於星期六或日求診，石書銘表示懲教也考慮過此做法，但公立醫院的物理治療部一般不會於星期六日辦公。陳慶偉重申，不會為了一名被告而延遲審訊，更何況物理治療的日子未定，指示律師團隊與懲教再進一步溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦應辯方申請，批准被告審訊期間使用電腦閱讀文件及做筆記，但禁止他們以電腦來與外界溝通。他又表示，知道因安全原因，懲教或不會准許被告帶電腦回到監房，但法庭不會干預懲教的決定，他亦無權如此做，籲各被告自行考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙至今逾23個月。其中16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）正式開審，預計審期90日。控方今透露，區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和林景楠4人將任控方證人，控方需時2至3日讀出開案陳詞後，將首先傳召他們作供。有辯方律師表示，直至上月及上周始分別收到1萬3千頁新文件及1,200項沒有標題的未被使用材料，望申請下周一前不會傳召控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18名被告今早正式答辯，當中伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，鄒家成逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，對抗暴政無罪，無罪可認。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方上周始交專家證人證供-官質疑會對被告不公&quot;&gt;控方上周始交專家證人證供 官質疑會對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方現時未能同意所有承認事實，控方望傳召有關社交媒體的專家證人，就 Facebook 及 YouTube 等內容作供，並指僅9名被告同意將相關內容納為承認事實（admitted facts）。主控萬德豪指於1月收到相關證供後，已盡快將證供交予辯方考慮，頭兩份證供於1月16日提交、第3份於2月3日提交，並將於今天提交第4份證供，涉警長6533。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰多次追問，控方會否認為延遲向被告提供證供會造成不公，又指若控方一直未能收到相關證供，直至控方案情完結前最後一天才交予辯方是否有問題。萬稱那會非常不公，但強調現時沒有出現此情況，因控方已盡快提交，又重申辯方有至少一至兩星期準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方將專家報告交辯方後，辯方需時找專家審視能否同意該供詞；若被告正申請法援，更需時報價決定尋找哪位專家，該專家亦需時撰寫報告以審視能否同意控方專家報告，反問該些程序是否能於兩星期內完成。萬德豪重申現時情況並非如此，李運騰反指他似乎頗「樂觀」，萬再稱控方案情共有55天，辯方會有足夠時間準備最終回應。控方其後又一度指，望能與所有被告就承認事實達成共識，惟陳慶偉指這只是妄想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱上周始收大量文件-申下周一前不傳召控方證人&quot;&gt;辯方稱上周始收大量文件 申下周一前不傳召控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文表示，直至上月才收到來自控方的1萬3千頁新文件，包括同案被告的證供，並於上周三（2月1日）才收到1,200項沒有標題的未被使用材料（unused materials）。他又引控方指，將會一邊讀出開案陳詞，一邊播放影片，預料需時2至3日才能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文指，辯方需時索取指示及調整其案情和盤問，望申請下周一前不會傳召控方證人，並指大部分被告均望下周一始傳證人。控方續指，若今午開始讀出開案陳詞，預料下周一可開始傳召證人，首4名出庭的控方證人為已認罪的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和林景楠，預料辯方需要頗長時間盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師馬維騉一度申請先處理不受爭議的議題，稍後才傳召首名證人區諾軒，因區諾軒無論對控辯雙方而言都是重要的證人，他了解案發經過所有階段，而辯方於上周才收到部分證供，需時準備盤問內容。惟申請遭陳慶偉拒絕，又指輪到他盤問時，或已餘下不多的東西需盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉申每日列席審訊-稱朱凱廸亦望列席惟不獲懲教安排&quot;&gt;岑敖暉申每日列席審訊 稱朱凱廸亦望列席惟不獲懲教安排&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的岑敖暉今日亦被帶往法庭列席，他在午休前以英語親自向法官申請審訊期間每日列席，要求法官向懲教每日簽發提犯令（body order）。岑又提到朱凱廸同樣希望審訊期間列席，但因為沒有提犯令，所以懲教今天未有把他帶往法庭。法官打斷，指岑不能代表朱凱廸作出申請，著朱自行去信法庭申請。審訊現時休庭，下午將讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vono7ad.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙逾23個月。16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）開審。控方開案陳詞指稱，由前港大法律系副教授戴耀廷所提倡的「35+」計劃旨在「攬炒」及顛覆國家政權，民主派初選為其中關鍵一步，透過取得立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，迫使政府回應訴求。控方續指，被告提倡及參與初選、承諾無差別地否決政府財政預算及其他議案，構成串謀實行犯罪計劃，當中33人簽署「墨落無悔」，而被告在《國安法》生效後仍按初選結果參選或不參選立法會，亦顯示他們遵守初選協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方以約一個半小時讀出開案陳詞首22段，明天再續，期間施德來、鄭達鴻、鄒家成等抄寫筆記，有部分被告則閉目養神。散庭前，法官陳慶偉特意提醒公眾人士有序及安靜地離開，又指不論立場如何，皆不可以騷擾控辯雙方團隊。陳表示暫無意指示庭內安裝閉路電視，但若任何人作出上述行為，便有可能干犯藐視法庭和判罰。散庭後，被告紛紛向旁聽席揮手，黃之鋒及伍健偉等說「辛苦晒！」，伍健偉則揮手說：「記得睇《一人婚禮》啊！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍上午答辯時曾表示，今早才收到控方修訂的開案陳詞，刪去指控被告「威脅使用武力」，惟控罪仍保留相關字眼，問「我係認緊邊條？」，「咁你仲告唔告我哋威脅使用武力㗎而家？」法庭翻譯今午翻譯相關段落時，仍一度讀出控罪詳情內「威脅使用武力」的字眼，有被告起鬨，法官提醒開案陳詞沒有提及暴力，翻譯稱她或與原有版本混淆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告同意以非法手段-嚴重干擾阻撓香港政權機關&quot;&gt;控方：被告同意以非法手段 嚴重干擾、阻撓香港政權機關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告今早進行答辯，控方透露區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠將任控方證人。主控周天行下午讀出2月修訂的開案陳詞。他指，本案涉及一群政治人物，與他人串謀組織、策劃、或參與以非法手段，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能的行為，旨在顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 控方代表 律政司副刑事檢控專員 周天行（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案涉及47名被告，案發時戴耀廷為法律系教授，區諾軒為前立法會議員及區議員，毛孟靜、黃碧雲、譚文豪、胡志偉、朱凱廸、郭家麒、楊岳橋及陳志全為立法會議員，尹兆堅、林卓廷為立法會議員兼區議員，梁國雄則為前立法會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、岑子杰、何啟明、劉偉聰、李嘉達、施德來、張可森、伍健偉、譚凱邦、范國威、柯耀林、岑敖暉、王百羽、李予信21人均為區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚得志、黃子悅、吳敏兒、何桂藍、劉頴匡、鄒家成、呂智恆、林景楠及余慧明13人則為政治人物、工會領袖或商人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案串謀的重要元素，是被告同意透過武力或威脅使用武力外的非法手段，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港政權機關依法履行職能的行為，即贊成無差別地否決政府提出的任何財政預算或公共開支，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，以達致顛覆國家政權的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方邀法庭就反送中事件引用司法認知&quot;&gt;控方邀法庭就「反送中」事件引用司法認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案發生的背景，控方指自2019年6月起，香港經歷由示威、暴力升級、破壞和縱火所造成的嚴重社會騷亂，暴力升級令大量財物被損壞、有人受襲擊，主要交通幹道和設施亦遭嚴重破壞和干擾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭就該段時期的政治及社會事件引用「司法認知」，即法庭毋須證據便可接納為事實，包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2019年2月，政府提出《逃犯條例》修訂草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年6月12日，立法會被示威者包圍，要求政府撤回草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年6月15日，行政長官宣布暫緩草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年7月1日，大批市民上街抗議《逃犯條例》修訂草案，其後部份示威者強行闖入立法會大樓；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年9月4日，行政長官宣布撤回《逃犯條例》修訂草案。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方將依賴同案被告證供初選文章及片段&quot;&gt;控方將依賴同案被告證供、初選文章及片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案被告均是串謀參與者，並將主要依賴同案被告（accomplice witnesses）證供、有關初選的文章、廣告和宣傳、從被告搜獲的文件和材料，以及多段記者會、訪問、遊行和選舉論壇等公開影片作檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，上述證據會顯示前港大法律系副教授戴耀廷，於約2019年12月發起「35+」計劃。他當時在《蘋果日報》首度撰文，宣揚奪取立法會大多數議席，以解散立法會迫使政府回應訴求；並在翌年1月30日，在 Facebook 呼籲民主派盡快透過初選達成共識，強調奪取過半議席的重要性，其後又與區諾軒在社交媒體發布大量文章爭取他人支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方戴耀廷稱35目標抗衡中國政府頻撰文提倡攬炒&quot;&gt;控方：戴耀廷稱35+目標抗衡中國政府、頻撰文提倡「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年3月26日，戴耀廷與區諾軒舉行記者會，解釋「35+」和初選的計劃，指取得立法會過半議席的目標，是取得足夠影響力，以抗衡中共及中國政府。庭上播放片段，戴表示雖然他或來自民主派光譜的不同部分，但「我諗大家都有一個幾強烈嘅共同理念，就係希望能夠立會過半」，取得「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，迫使政府接受其訴求，如問責警暴和重啟政改。戴指他與區諾軒正進行協調工作，強調望在5個選區分別爭取「6 6 4 4 3」議席，並呼籲市民登記做選民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同月31日，戴在《蘋果日報》發文〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，解釋無差別否決財政預算案，可觸發《基本法》機制解散立法會及迫使特首辭職，「符合這階段抗爭的大策略，就是令現有制度出現極度不穩」，而配合國際社會施壓，便有機會迫使中共在香港民主化上讓步。他並鼓勵公眾盡快取得商業登記證，以爭取功能組別議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年4月，戴耀廷再在《蘋果日報》發布題為〈攬炒的定義和時間〉和〈攬炒的時代意義〉的文章，進一步提倡攬炒議程。當中提及如何通過初選實現「攬炒」、實施「攬炒」的時間、以及如何利用攬炒作為顛覆的大策略（grand strategy）。他又指若中共解散立法會，會宣告「一國兩制」的終結，而街頭運動不足以使政權讓步，很多市民的心態已轉化，「準備來一次真正的攬炒，決心要死而後生。」同月28日，戴再發表〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，訂下「真攬炒十步」，提及要無差別否決政府財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方戴耀廷等5人為組織者-初選參選者均公開承諾盡力提倡35目標&quot;&gt;控方：戴耀廷等5人為組織者 初選參選者均公開承諾盡力提倡「35+」目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，串謀的關鍵一步是取得立法會的大多數議席，因此被告組織初選，透過在全港各區設立票站，讓選民以紙張或電子方式投票，分別在地區直選（港島、九龍東、九龍西、新界東、新界西）和功能界別（超區、衞生服務界），選出支持率最高的候選人參選立法會，以提高民主派當選機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，首5名被告：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和吳政亨，是初選的組織者，他們設立初選的框架及與參與者討論協議條款，在不同範疇上有不可或缺的角色，包括監察、安排及管理財政、後勤和宣傳初選。民主動力和香港民意研究所則獲委託執行初選，並協助後勤安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;餘下42名被告則是初選的候選人，控方指他們公開承諾及同意盡力提倡「35+」的目標及遵守初選結果，亦同意若有候選人正式參選後被「DQ」，其他候選人可以「Plan B」身份代為參選，以提高奪取立法會大多數議席的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;

It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Japan strengthen the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role of trilateral cooperation in regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), the United States is engaged in long-term strategic competition with China that is playing out with particular intensity in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing seeks to undermine the U.S. alliance system and carve out vast exemptions to the established rules-based order, including in the maritime space. China’s strategic intent highlights the need for enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies to address regional security issues, deter illegal maritime activities, and strengthen the use of international law to resolve disputes in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing assertiveness in regional waters, including its completion of artificial island bases and militarization of those features in the South China Sea, has radically altered the balance of power, both in conventional military capabilities and in the gray zone short of armed conflict. In the East China Sea, Beijing maintains almost continuous coast guard patrols around the Senkaku Islands, backed by its growing naval and militia forces. This is straining Japanese coast guard readiness and challenging Tokyo’s administrative control over the islands and their surrounding waters. In the Taiwan Strait, China’s aerial patrols are stretching the ability of the Republic of China Air Force to respond. Beijing’s support for nominally civilian actors, such as illegal dredging vessels around Kinmen and Matsu Islands, undermines Taiwan’s administrative control of its surroundings. These gray zone efforts by China all share similar goals and demand greater coordination and information sharing among the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances with Japan and the Philippines provide critical access and serve as force multipliers in the region. There is no viable strategy for countering China’s illegal behavior in the East and South China Seas without robust cooperation with Tokyo and Manila, respectively. Both governments are also crucial in thinking through responses to potential Taiwan contingencies. Japan’s emergence as a major security partner for the Philippines makes trilateral alliance coordination even more important. Tokyo has provided maritime patrol aircraft, coast guard vessels, radars, and more to the Philippines under favorable terms. Japan has begun to take part in the annual U.S.-Philippines Balikatan exercises, various bilateral naval and coast guard engagements, and talks on a status of forces agreement with Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Japan strengthen the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security. With this goal in mind, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened a trilateral U.S.-Japan-Philippines Track 2 strategic dialogue in September 2022 in Tokyo, Japan. The dialogue was intended to provide a platform for U.S., Japanese, and Filipino experts and practitioners to discuss practical issues of alliance coordination, share insights regarding each country’s respective strategic outlooks, and consider ways in which the security triangle could be operationalized in a time of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances with Japan and the Philippines provide critical access and serve as force multipliers in the region. There is no viable strategy for countering China’s illegal behavior in the East and South China Seas without robust cooperation with Tokyo and Manila, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion largely spanned three key themes: commonalities and differences in how Japan and the Philippines respond to gray zone challenges in the East and South China Seas, challenges and opportunities in bilateral and trilateral support for military modernization in the Philippines, and the growing need for all three countries to consider how a Taiwan contingency would affect not only their alliance obligations but also their respective national security priorities. The dialogue informed the findings and recommendations in this report, but all opinions presented are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the dialogue participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-japan-philippines-security-triangle&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Japan-Philippines Security Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Philippines alliance has experienced an upswing since former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s decision in 2021 to recall the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Early signs demonstrate that the administration of current president Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is less skeptical of the United States than its predecessor and views the alliance as a top priority. U.S. president Joe Biden’s meeting with President Marcos Jr. in New York in September 2022 represents a positive step forward — as well as the first time a sitting Philippine president has visited the United States since the late president Benigno Aquino III attended the Sunnylands summit in 2016. At the meeting, the United States affirmed its commitment to the defense of the Philippines. Whether these trends continue and the alliance undergoes much-needed modernization ultimately depends on both sides continuing to give high-level political and military attention to the alliance. Implementation of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) remains years behind schedule, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization plans require a considerable increase in support. Further, the long-term viability of the alliance rests on a number of agreements and new institutions currently under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States and Japan have an enduring alliance that underpins the United States’ role as a forward-deployed Indo-Pacific power. The partnership is stronger today than at any point in history, underpinned by shared values and a common strategic outlook, particularly as it relates to Chinese revisionism. Since China escalated tensions with Japan in the early 2010s over the Senkaku Islands, combined messaging and efforts by the U.S. and Japanese governments have maintained stability in the East China Sea, demonstrating the potential for robust alliance coordination to blunt the efficacy of gray zone coercion and deter escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific underscores the value of Tokyo and Washington collaborating more closely in engaging with other alliance partners, including the Philippines. Japan is uniquely suited to this role given its extensive and long-standing security partnership with the Philippines, creating a robust level of security cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. Yet, despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Japan-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion remains relatively limited on the merits of the partnership and how it might be better integrated into the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-gray-zone-activities-in-the-east-china-sea-and-us-japan-responses&quot;&gt;Chinese Gray Zone Activities in the East China Sea and U.S.-Japan Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrusions by the China Coast Guard (CCG) into the territorial waters of the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands have been ongoing for close to 14 years, presenting a major security concern for both Tokyo and the U.S.-Japan alliance. Although China’s risk tolerance has increased in recent years, Beijing seems content to maintain the status quo around the islands while steadily building up its maritime capabilities. Since 2012, China has largely abstained from any risky efforts to upend the status quo in the short term — a clear difference from its strategy in the South China Sea. Instead, the CCG patrols around the islands, with periodic intrusions into the surrounding territorial waters, incrementally normalizing China’s contestation of Japanese administrative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Japan-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion remains relatively limited on the merits of the partnership and how it might be better integrated into the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China gains greater competitive advantages in coast guard and naval power, its intrusions may ultimately prove untenable. Over time, the size of the CCG fleet has grown, enabling a presence around the islands for longer periods, and the frequency of these Chinese incursions has increased. Japan’s Ministry of Defense reported in December 2022 that a Chinese survey vessel entered Japan’s waters for the fifth time in one year, setting a new record. Beijing could take steps that would force Tokyo to choose between backing down or escalating to preserve its administrative control around the Senkakus — a medium-term threat for which Japan is actively preparing by building up coast guard infrastructure in the southern Ryukyu chain. But in the meantime, Japan has taken steps in coordination with the United States to preserve the status quo in the face of Chinese coercion for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing collaboration with Russia has compounded China’s ongoing encroachments into the East China Sea following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China has showcased its deepening relationship with Russia through joint military activities in the Indo-Pacific, including joint navigation and flights near Japanese territory. In 2022, Chinese and Russian warships conducted joint sails that circled Japan in a maritime show of force. That May, Chinese and Russian strategic bombers flew over the East China Sea following a meeting of Quad leaders (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo recognizes that to address China’s gray zone activities and other pressures on Japan, it must increase its force capabilities. In new national security and defense strategies released in December 2022, Tokyo announced plans for unprecedented increases in defense spending. This growth will shatter a long-standing informal cap on spending of 1 percent of GDP. In addition to increasing the defense budget, Tokyo will increase the budget for the coast guard by about 40 percent over the next five years. The decision to boost defense spending is borne not only of security concerns in the immediate neighborhood but also lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps to bolster defense capabilities are important, but they will not wholly address the widening quantitative gap between Japanese and Chinese naval, coast guard, and air capabilities. China’s 2022 defense budget amounted to at least $229 billion. Even with the planned growth in Japan’s defense budget, Tokyo’s annual spending by 2027 will only be about $80 billion. Japan’s capacity to respond to future gray zone challenges will be constrained by limited human capital and difficulties in recruitment for the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and coast guard. Japan’s aging population and decreasing birthrate mean that personnel recruitment continues to be a challenge. For instance, while Japan has made progress in building new ships, it has a limited pool of recruits to pull from to man these vessels. Further collaboration with the United States on unmanned technology could help supplement these gaps but is by no means a panacea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Japan cooperation in pushing back against China’s gray zone activities in the East China Sea and stabilizing the status quo around the Senkaku Islands serves as an example of a largely successful response. When tensions around the islands rose during the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama, the United States repeated and elevated long-standing U.S. declaratory policy, for the first time at the presidential level, of the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty covering the Senkakus. The allies reinforced these rhetorical steps with concrete efforts to strengthen the alliance through enhancements to force posture in Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands and deeper operational planning related to an East China Sea contingency. Subsequent administrations under former president Donald Trump and current president Biden have regularly repeated that position. The October 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy reiterates the U.S. commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and the defense of Japan, including protection of the Senkaku Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, meanwhile, bolstered its defense capabilities, including intensifying its coast guard presence around the islands and investing in new JSDF capabilities in the Southwest Islands closest to them. Tokyo also regularly released strong and consistent public condemnations of Chinese actions and regularly demonstrated its air and naval capabilities both independently and with the United States. This collective opposition to China’s coercion eventually caused it to stabilize the number of vessels patrolling around the Senkakus and lower the temperature of its relationship with Japan. Demonstrations of U.S. commitment to the defense of the islands and Japan’s enhanced posture helped to de-escalate the crisis and deepen the alliance. Since then, efforts to modernize the alliance have continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-gray-zone-activities-in-the-south-china-sea-and-us-philippines-responses&quot;&gt;Chinese Gray Zone Activities in the South China Sea and U.S.-Philippines Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, China has steadily increased its coercive behavior in the South China Sea. This includes militarizing artificial islands in the Spratlys, deploying coast guard ships to prevent the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations from accessing the resources of their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and deploying hundreds of militia vessels to loiter at Whitsun Reef and various locations within the Philippine EEZ. China relies on an array of tactics, including harassing oil and gas exploration and unsafe interactions by aircraft, which complicate Manila’s ability to respond and deter. Additionally, China has profited from the Philippines’ gaps in defense capacity and uncertainty of approach in responding to gray zone crises. In 2014, China’s maritime militia turned water cannons toward Filipino fishermen, leading to confusion in Manila on how to respond, as the incident caused damage but could not be interpreted as an act of warfare. China’s conduct in the South China Sea thus actively exploits the fact that the Philippines remains largely unprepared for crisis scenarios that fall short of conflict and involve nonconventional weapons and incursions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering gray zone activities will require strengthening the U.S.-Philippines alliance. When the Scarborough Shoal incident took place in 2012, the alliance was unprepared, and when the Philippines asked the United States for assistance, it was disappointed by the United States’ toothless affirmation of their alliance and U.S. silence regarding the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). This bred a fear of abandonment and hurt public perceptions of the partnership. Scarborough Shoal stands as a salient example of the erosion of stability in the South China Sea and the U.S.-Philippines alliance since 2012. Fear of abandonment in the face of a gray zone crisis has since been ingrained into the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of contingency planning constrains U.S.-Philippines responses to Chinese gray zone activities, and both sides need to proactively engage with each other on what their respective roles would be in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea. Decisions for the alliance occur at an operational level but not a strategic level. Unlike the U.S.-Japan alliance, which has evolved to counter gray zone activities, the U.S.-Philippines alliance has been stymied by policy and institutional deficiencies. Such deficiencies arise, in part, from a series of complementary but not identical goals in deterring gray zone activities: the United States wants to sustain free and open navigation in the region, while the Philippines aims to protect its territorial sovereignty. Additionally, while the Philippines fears abandonment by the United States, the strength of the Philippines’ own commitment to defend U.S. forces, as part of its obligations under the MDT, remains unclear. Fears of abandonment and entrapment point to the need for institutional frameworks built over multiple administrations to clarify responsibilities and reinforce mutual commitments in the alliance, similar to the U.S.-Japan alliance. An enhanced focus on contingency planning and aligning strategic outlooks will be integral to enacting a decisive and unified counterresponse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better combat gray zone activities, the Philippines and the United States need to consider new tactics to counter low-visibility influence campaigns. China’s ability to escalate tensions and then craft narratives that paint other reactive countries as aggressors gives Beijing a considerable strategic advantage. As such, when countering gray zone activities, strategic public messaging is key. Joint messaging and public release of information related to gray zone challenges — which generally remains slow given bureaucratic roadblocks in Manila — would allow the United States and the Philippines to better counter competing narratives. For mutual security cooperation to be possible in a country beholden to public opinion, foreign policy discourse in Manila must better reflect regional challenges and the Philippines’ national objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lack of contingency planning constrains U.S.-Philippines responses to Chinese gray zone activities, and both sides need to proactively engage with each other on what their respective roles would be in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to effectively deter Chinese activities in the South China Sea, the United States and the Philippines must not only deepen their defense partnership but also boost trade and investment cooperation and enhance the Philippines’ economic resilience. The United States is one of the Philippines’ closest economic partners — and its third-largest trading partner — with almost $150 million in new foreign direct investment last year. President Marcos Jr.’s visit to the New York Stock Exchange and his meetings with U.S. business leaders during his trip to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly signaled his interest in attracting more opportunities from the U.S. private sector. The Philippines is also a member of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, opening the door for both sides to expand their partnership and interests beyond the realm of defense. Deepening the U.S.-Philippines economic partnership will help alleviate some of the pressures associated with China’s perceived economic dominance in the Philippines, which in turn plays a limiting factor in determining responses to gray zone challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bilateral-and-trilateral-cooperation-in-military-modernization&quot;&gt;Bilateral and Trilateral Cooperation in Military Modernization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although military modernization in the Philippines remains sluggish, concerted cooperation with the United States and Japan — both in bilateral and trilateral settings — could help build momentum and allow Manila to better meet the challenges associated with Chinese gray zone activities. The process of military modernization requires a broad approach, one that encompasses the enhancement of both diplomatic and civilian cooperation. Military reforms must also be rooted in good governance, democratic norms, and principles of anticorruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in the region. The United States has committed over $625 million over the last five years to Philippine defense and security capabilities designed to increase capacity in the South China Sea. To promote military interoperability, the allies have recently agreed to engage in 496 bilateral defense and security engagements in 2023, 35 more than in 2022. The U.S. embassy in Manila announced that $100 million would be granted to the Philippines as compensation for its decision to renege on a military equipment deal with Russia. In the next two years, the United States will invest $70 million into cooperative defense capabilities and expand EDCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can be a potent player in this space, not least because the Japan-Philippines partnership is far less vulnerable to political shocks than the U.S.-Philippines alliance. For instance, U.S.-Philippines ties faced challenges during the Duterte administration due both to Duterte’s skepticism of the United States and to Washington’s reluctance to enhance ties amid the Philippines’ war on drugs. By contrast, Tokyo had a relatively free hand to deepen cooperation with Manila. Deepening military ties have laid the groundwork for a potential Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) between Tokyo and Manila, much like the pacts that Japan has signed with Australia and the United Kingdom. While talks on a potential RAA remain slow, renewed interest from President Marcos Jr. in enhancing ties with Japan could provide an injection of political will and reinvigorate discussions. However, any forward momentum will likely be tempered by concerns from both Manila and Tokyo on how China would respond to the signing of an RAA between the Philippines and Japan. But if past is prologue, rising tension in the region could provide enough of a push to Manila and Tokyo to progress negotiations, in the same way that challenges in the South China Sea eventually pushed the Philippines and Australia toward concluding their Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in spite of concerns about China’s response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;Implications of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in early August 2022, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and perceived parallels between that conflict and China’s behavior in the Indo-Pacific, have helped sharpen the region’s focus on the prospect of a Taiwan crisis. The Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan means that simply geography, to say nothing of the alliance with the United States, could drag Manila into any military conflict in or around Taiwan. This in turn highlights the need for Filipino strategic thinkers to consider the potential impacts of such a conflict. A cross-strait contingency could lead to both Taiwanese and Filipinos in Taiwan fleeing to the Philippines. With northern Luzon less than 200 miles from Taiwan, and the Batanes Islands even closer, a refugee crisis seems inevitable in the case of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has nearly 200,000 overseas foreign workers based in Taiwan, and if conflict were to break out across the Taiwan Strait, their evacuation — likely impossible in the face of an outright invasion of the island — would be a top priority. The Philippines also has a much smaller, but still sizeable, number of overseas foreign workers in mainland China and even more in Hong Kong. This raises the possibility that those workers could become political leverage for Beijing in a time of conflict and limit the Philippines’ flexibility in responding to a Taiwan contingency. The direction of public sentiment in such a crisis — whether demanding intervention on behalf of Filipinos in Taiwan or restraint in the name of those in China — is difficult to predict. Much would depend on the details and scale of the crisis, including the number of Filipinos killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of Philippine territory to Taiwan also makes it an attractive staging point for U.S. intervention and a possible target for Chinese retaliation. The United States and the Philippines have increasingly recognized that Washington would expect access and support in any crisis endangering the lives of U.S. service members. Filipino strategic thinkers seem to recognize this as part of the price of the more “equal” alliance with the United States that both the Duterte and Marcos Jr. governments have sought. To this end, if the Philippine government wants the United States to increase security assistance and stay committed to defending Filipino lives in the contested South China Sea, then Manila must meet matching obligations. U.S. forces will require greater access to the country to rotate forces and pre-position equipment to credibly project power over both the South China Sea and Taiwan. It is unclear the extent to which the Philippine strategic community has internalized the implications of reciprocity — meaning that the Philippines has obligations to the United States under Articles II, IV, and V of the MDT, not just vice versa. The security establishment appears more cognizant of this than the wider political and academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candid, ongoing, and at times difficult discussions on alliance obligations and their role in a Taiwan contingency between the United States and the Philippines at the Track 1.5 and Track 2 levels mirror talks currently underway between the two governments as part of the ongoing process of alliance modernization. At the ninth U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Strategic Dialogue in late 2021, interlocuters from the Biden and Duterte administrations set forth a joint vision for modernizing the alliance with important implications for contingency planning in both the South China Sea and Taiwan. Two components of that statement — new defense guidelines and expansion of the long-delayed 2014 EDCA — will provide important signals on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new defense guidelines, to be released in early 2023, are unlikely to name Taiwan but could include important language on joint responses to regional contingencies in general. EDCA allows the United States to gain access to predetermined Philippine military sites to fund upgrades, pre-position equipment, and engage in joint training and operations. In addition to implementing the agreement at the five previously agreed sites, the allies are seeking to expand it to additional locations, which has fueled speculation that new sites would include facilities in northern Luzon, less than 200 miles from Taiwan. As with the new defense guidelines, announcements on the future of EDCA are expected in early 2023. Moreover, ongoing discussions on the risks associated with a Taiwan contingency have raised expectations that the United States would look to the Philippines to, among other things, help monitor the Bashi Channel and prevent any undetected Chinese breakout from the first island chain in a crisis scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, meanwhile, could play a critical role in responding to an armed attack on Taiwan. In recent years, Japanese political leaders have publicly pointed to the impact a Taiwan crisis would have on Japan’s security. Japanese views on Taiwan are shaped by geography — a Taiwan Strait crisis could spill over into Chinese strikes on U.S. facilities in Japan or could provoke a new Senkaku Islands crisis. Japan’s clear-eyed view of the risks a Taiwan contingency poses to its own national security contrasts with how other U.S. allies and partners, including the Philippines and Australia, have tended to view such a crisis, primarily through the prism of their alliance obligations. However, Tokyo’s rhetorical acknowledgement of the implications of a Taiwan conflict does not necessarily translate into willingness to commit military resources to defend Taiwan. Given legal constraints on the JSDF, Japan’s role in a contingency scenario may be limited to defending Japanese territory and U.S. bases in the country rather than actively dispatching combatants in or around Taiwan. But even this operational role would be critical in protecting and supporting U.S. forces flowing into the region in a conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, it remains unclear to what extent the Marcos Jr. administration has thought through the impact of a Taiwan contingency. To this end, the Philippines needs to take major steps toward articulating why Taiwan matters to its foreign policy and national security interests, including, but not exclusively, through the prism of U.S. alliance commitments. In this context, Japan has a key role to play in helping expand Philippine perspectives on Taiwan, and — together with the United States — could socialize further thinking on what role the Philippines would play in a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s gray zone operations are successful because they place the burden of escalation on the U.S. partners and allies being targeted. China crafts narratives that reinforce this burden, painting its activities as peaceful and civilian in nature. The United States and its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific need to find ways to deter China’s gray zone coercion by, in most cases, imposing nonmilitary costs but, in certain cases, signaling willingness to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Philippines, and Japan need to establish a consistent and coordinated understanding of what qualifies as gray zone activity and which activities they deem unacceptable in the South and East China Seas. Messaging should be harmonized across the board and consistently aligned with international law, including the 2016 South China Sea arbitration award. The U.S.-Philippines maritime security dialogue launched in early 2022 provides a venue for the United States to share lessons learned from the U.S.-Japan responses to gray zone pressure in the East China Sea. That has been an explicit focus of the U.S.-Japan alliance since at least the unveiling of the 2015 defense guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2:&lt;/strong&gt; In line with the Quad’s nascent Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, the United States and Japan should continue to invest in the remote sensing capabilities of its Southeast Asian and Indo-Pacific partners, allowing regional states better visibility into activities occurring in their waters. The United States, Japan, and like-minded partners such as Australia should also explore avenues for unmanned data collection in the South China Sea in partnership with the Philippines. The U.S. Navy’s Task Force 59 offers one model for such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Japan, and the Philippines should strengthen mechanisms to share and publicize information on Chinese gray zone activities with non-allies, particularly Vietnam, to increase the diplomatic and informational costs on Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The Philippines’ ability to maintain a robust military and law enforcement presence in the South China Sea is vital to defend maritime security and freedom of the seas. But Manila’s resources are limited, and it cannot modernize its military capabilities at the pace required without significant assistance. China’s maritime capabilities, meanwhile, continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should accelerate capacity-building efforts for the Philippine military and law enforcement agencies. The United States and the Philippines must continue to upgrade existing EDCA sites and expand the agreement to new facilities. Both Japan and the United States should invest in the technological capabilities and infrastructure of the Philippine armed forces and law enforcement beyond the EDCA sites, preparing them to acquire, operate, and maintain more advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should encourage and facilitate Philippine acquisition of asymmetric strike capabilities to enhance deterrence. This should include anti-ship and anti-air missiles, loitering munitions, and other unmanned platforms. The United States and Japan should increase joint training and exercises focused on asymmetric capabilities, including lessons learned from Japan’s investments over the last decade in the East China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Japan, and the Philippines should open avenues for more dialogue on military modernization and contingency planning. This is especially timely as Manila considers what will come after the third and final phase of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program, which runs from 2023 to 2028. As part of the coordination process, a trilateral and quadrilateral (with Australia) component should be added to more U.S.-Philippines and U.S.-Japan military engagements and dialogues. Japan concluding an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) and RAA with the Philippines will be key to more robust multilateral alliance coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of a Taiwan contingency, China will hope to isolate the United States and its allies from each other. Some domestic actors within each country, especially the Philippines, will urge neutrality. But the political, strategic, and geographic realities mean that the Philippines and Japan will likely find themselves drawn into such a crisis. The Philippines has spent the least time planning for that eventuality and needs to build up its political, economic, and military readiness if it is to coordinate effectively in an allied response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should enhance economic support to the Philippines with a conscious goal of helping it become more resilient to Chinese coercion. Otherwise, Beijing’s economic leverage will play an outsized role in Philippine strategic calculations. Japan’s government is currently revising its official development assistance principles to align them more closely with strategic priorities. That should add impetus to invest in Philippine resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines must achieve a shared understanding of their mutual treaty obligations beyond the South China Sea. A more resilient alliance must be a more equal one, as demanded by consecutive Philippine administrations. That means not only will the United States have obligations to the Philippines, but the Philippines will have obligations to the United States as well. The new defense guidelines, expected to be announced in early 2023, will be an important step in the right direction. But reaching and institutionalizing a shared understanding of mutual obligations will be an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines need to elevate their relationship across the board. A resilient alliance needs more than military cooperation. The United States should also invest in more diplomatic and economic cooperation. This could include opening more diplomatic missions beyond Manila; enhancing support for clean energy, critical mineral supply chains, and other areas of shared economic interest; and negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement in the absence of any U.S. multilateral trade initiatives in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

The war has not diminished Russia’s core economic and security interests in the region, but it has had some impact on its military readiness there in the short term, especially in terms of ground capabilities, if not at sea or in the air. In addition, there are some preliminary indications that sanctions and export controls may diminish Russia’s ability to deploy precision munitions to the Arctic to a degree. At the same time, Russia’s use of hybrid tactics in the region seems to be increasing in both frequency and severity. The United States and NATO will need to take stock of these developments in a region they have not historically prioritized as they begin to implement their new, respective strategies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 disrupted the European security architecture and altered the risk calculus underpinning the foreign and security policies of its neighbors. This shift was also stark in the Arctic, which had for a long time been hailed by many as a highly cooperative and unusually peaceful part of international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Arctic Council ceased to function when its seven members other than Russia suspended participation in official meetings. This left the region without its main intergovernmental venue for cooperation. Next, in search of security, Finland and Sweden requested to join NATO. Furthermore, Russian “hybrid tactics” — to now possibly also include the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, as well as that of undersea cables in the Arctic and near-Arctic, among other activities — have raised the level of alarm in NATO members like Norway and nearby states. Finally, the increased security concerns are also seen in newly released policy documents, such as the U.S. Arctic Strategy. The first U.S. government-wide Arctic strategy since 2013, it states that Russia’s war in Ukraine has “raised geopolitical tensions in the Arctic” and created “new risks of unintended conflict,” a point that is also emphasized in the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS). However, the Arctic has not been a top security priority for the United States or NATO in recent years, and there are weighty arguments that this might be a problem that needs addressing as tensions rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military interests in the Arctic are ostensibly defensive: to defend its second-strike, sea-based nuclear deterrent capability operating out of the Kola Peninsula; to defend the homeland; and to protect its regional economic endeavors, especially oil and gas megaprojects like the Yamal LNG and Vostok Oil ventures, and the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which Russia views ambitiously as a future global trade thoroughfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has offensive goals. First, it seeks to use the Arctic as a staging ground for power projection, especially into the North Atlantic Ocean via the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap. Second, it may consider hybrid activities to intimidate or coerce European Arctic countries. Finally, in an unlikely — but not unthinkable — wider NATO-Russia conflict, having escalated to a war, one can imagine Moscow risking a limited incursion into Norway or Finland in a bid to protect its critical nuclear assets in the Kola Peninsula by creating greater defensive depth through, for example, the establishment of more western anti-access/area denial system systems at relatively easily defended sites west of its border. This scenario resembles Cold War-era fears. A perhaps more likely modern conflict scenario could involve long-range precision strikes of high-value assets like the Norwegian or future Finnish F-35s and the infrastructure needed to keep them flying. In addition, in accordance with basic military-strategic theory, one can also assume that command and control sites, radars, and important bases supporting key naval capabilities or anti-submarine warfare planes such as P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft would be attractive targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has not materially changed these Russian core interests. The need to protect the nuclear second-strike capability based out of the Kola Peninsula will be undiminished, and even heightened, in the likely event that Finland joins NATO. If and when this scenario plays out, critical military installations such as the Northern Fleet’s strategic submarine base at Gadzhiyevo will be less than 200 kilometers away from the border of a new NATO country. As a response, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu, after meeting with President Putin, stated in December that new military bases would be established: “Given NATO’s desire to build up military potential near the Russian borders, as well as to expand the North Atlantic Alliance at the expense of Finland and Sweden, retaliatory measures are required to create an appropriate grouping of troops in Northwest Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite the diminishing European market for Russian Arctic fossil fuels — and the evaporation of foreign investment in such projects from sanctioning countries — there is little evidence Putin intends to reduce his economic ambitions in the region: an NSR development plan including roughly 1.8 trillion rubles in funding was approved in August 2022, and work continues on oil megaprojects. It is reasonable to assume Russia will maintain its regional military posture commensurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first reviews Russia’s prewar Arctic military assets before investigating which of these assets have been used and potentially lost in the invasion of Ukraine. Taking stock of these potential war damages, as well as the impact of sanctions on Russia’s defense industry, the third section assesses the relative attractiveness of hybrid tactics for Russia to assert itself in the Arctic. The fourth section analyzes some implications of these findings for NATO and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-unit-structures&quot;&gt;Command and Unit Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command is Russia’s Arctic military command and the core of its regional presence. The fleet’s area of responsibility includes the western and central Arctic. The Eastern Military District commander is responsible for the eastern Arctic, all the way to the Bering Strait. The fleet’s primary responsibilities are to defend and ensure beneficial operational conditions for Russia’s second-strike nuclear capability, as well as the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet has five operational formations, each with several tactical units. Most are housed on the Kola Peninsula. These include three naval formations, the 45th Air and Air-Defense Forces Army (AADA), and the 14th Army Corps. The naval formations include the Northern Fleet’s Submarine Command and fleet, as well as the Kola Flotilla, which contains most naval assets intended for Arctic-specific use, including some main surface combatants. There is also the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade, which includes some reconnaissance forces among other assets, as well as special forces units in Polyarny. The 45th ADAA was formed in December 2015. Its precise tactical makeup is not publicly available, but reports indicate that it bears responsibility for anti-missile systems and distributed units on bases in the central Russian Arctic. The two main units of the 14th Army Corps are the 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, in addition to other smaller subordinated units working on tasks like command and control, among other roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Russian Arctic Military Installations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet also oversees the restoration of dozens of Soviet-era military installations that now dot the Russian Arctic, east of the Kola Peninsula. These installations vary in size and the degree to which they host troops and kinetic capabilities. Roughly, there are 3 major bases, around 13 airfields, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 emergency rescue stations. Finally, there are military assets that are not based in the Arctic but should be considered in the analysis. For example, two Russian airborne assault units are assigned to help protect the Kola Peninsula: the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 98th Guards Airborne Division. These divisions, as well as the 106th Guards Airborne Division, have trained for Arctic-specific missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-capabilities&quot;&gt;Specific Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submarines.&lt;/strong&gt; The Northern Fleet hosts eight of Russia’s ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) of the Delta IV and Borei classes. Their purpose is strategic: to maintain Russia’s retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The Delta IV submarines are each capable of carrying 16 SS-N-23 Sineva submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), as well as, reportedly, the SS-N-15 Starfish anti-submarine missile. The Borei submarines can carry 16 SS-N-32 Bulava SLBMs. The Northern Fleet is believed to have approximately 16 other active combat submarines, including six nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) of the Akula, Victor III, and Sierra II classes, five nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs) of the Severodvinsk and Oscar I/II classes, and five Kilo-class diesel submarines (SSKs). The upgraded Akula-class submarine will reportedly be armed with some variant of the Kalibr missile. The Sevorodvinsk submarines carry two variants of the Kalibr — both the land attack missile (SS-N-30) and the anti-ship variant (SS-N-27). The formidable submarine is also armed with the SS-N-26 Strobile anti-ship cruise missile, i.e. the P-800 Oniks. The Oscar II-class is armed with SS-N-19 Shipwreck and SS-N-16 Stallion anti-ship missiles. Victor III and Sierra II submarines are armed with the SS-N-21 Sampson cruise missile. One could also argue that the Northern Fleet has access to auxiliary submarines for noncombat functions, ostensibly including undersea research, but most likely also including covert tasks, even though these officially report to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research. Not all submarines are made equal, of course — some are outdated and noisy, and some have limited combat potential. Overall, anti-submarine warfare experts consider Russia’s subsurface fleet to be formidable. The deployments of the Kalibr are especially notable: it is a long-range precision missile at the high end of Russian capabilities. It gives the Russian Navy the ability to hit distant targets — between 1,500 and 2,500 kilometers — from platforms that can be difficult to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface Combatants.&lt;/strong&gt; As of 2019, the Northern Fleet officially had 37 surface vessels, including 10 operational large vessels and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier (the only one in The Russian Navy), although the latter was damaged in a pair of accidents a few years earlier and will likely not re-enter service before 2024. The Admiral Kuznetsov is armed with the SS-N-19 Shipwreck anti-ship missile and the SA-N-9 Gauntlet surface-to-air missile, among other systems. The fleet’s flagship vessel is the Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy. Kirov-class cruisers also use the Shipwreck and Gauntlet systems, as well as other surface-to-air missiles. A second Kirov-class cruiser has been under reconstruction since 1999; although The Russian Navy claims it will be back in service in 2023, work on this vessel has repeatedly been extended. There is a Slava-class guided missile destroyer (the Marshal Ustinov), which uses the SS-N-12 Sandbox anti-ship missile, as well as having surface-to-air missile systems. There are also two Gorshkov-class frigates, which are armed with both the land-attack and anti-ship variants of the Kalibr, as well as Oniks missiles, two Udaloy I/II-class anti-submarine warfare ships, and one Sovremenny-class destroyer that uses the SS-N-22 Sunburn anti-ship missile. The fleet has an estimated eight landing ships (Ropucha- and Ivan Gren-class). It also has two ice-class ships of its own and can call on 46 “civilian” icebreakers. It also has a small fleet of minesweepers. Finally, there are ice-reinforced auxiliary vessels, such as a logistics ship, a tanker, and two research vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s major ground capabilities are limited in the Arctic. According to a prewar study from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the three brigades had between them approximately 50 tanks, 450 armored personnel carriers, and an indeterminate number of “cross-country vehicles and multipurpose articulated tracker carriers,” as well as various artillery systems and some attack aviation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Combat Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; According to RUSI, Russia has four major air units in the Arctic. At Severomorsk, there are two: the 279th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with approximately 24 Su-33 fighter jets and the 100th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with 24 MiG-29K fighters. At Monchegorsk, the 98th Mixed Air Regiment has an estimated 12 MIG-31BMs, 12 Su-24Ms, and an indeterminate number of Su-24MR reconnaissance crafts. Finally, there is an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) regiment at Severomorsk, as well as maritime patrol aircraft like the Il-38N and Tu-42. Before the war in Ukraine, there were also an estimated 30 bombers under the command of the Northern Fleet, many of which were housed at Olenya under the control of the 40th Mixed Aviation Regiment. In addition, there are occasionally Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers forward deployed across the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The distinction between defensive and offensive missile capabilities is not sharp in practice, and the below capabilities can be used for multiple ends. The Northern Fleet operates a “hardened, Arctic-capable, multilayered air defence and sea denial system,” which is part of the Bastion defense concept. In addition to the key air defense capabilities on the Kola Peninsula, including the S-400 system, there are three Arctic bases most critical to this concept: Nagurskoye, on Alexandra Land Island, Franz Josef Land; Temp base on the main New Siberian Island in the east; and Rogachevo base on Novaya Zemlya. Each has some combination of long-range S-300 and S-400 anti-air systems, medium-range P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles, short-range Pantsir and Tor M2DT surface-to-air systems, and coastal defense K-300P Bastion-P and 4K51 Rubezh systems. In addition, the S-400 is deployed at Severodvinsk, and the S-300 system is deployed at Olengorsk on the Kola Peninsula and to the Tiksi air base in the eastern Russian Arctic. The latter system, it should be noted, has been reported as being used in a surface-to-surface offensive role in Ukraine. As the S-400 is a similar system, it may be similarly versatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xK6z2qQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Northern Fleet reportedly “holds 20 percent of Russia’s precision strike capability in peacetime, and possesses the launch platforms of all its air-launched Kinzhal [hypersonic] ballistic missiles.” Kinzhal missiles have reportedly been fielded on bombers and MiG-31s. In addition, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate and Sevorodvinsk submarines have tested the hypersonic Tsirkon anti-ship missile in the Arctic at least eight times since fall 2020. Both the Sevorodvinsk- and Oscar II-class submarines are able to launch both the Tsirkon and the supersonic P-800 Oniks cruise missiles, making them “increasingly lethal at long ranges.” The fleet’s largest ammunition storage for submarine-launched ballistic missiles is at Okolnaya Bay on the Kola Peninsula. The result of all this is a dense missile defense network with offensive potential in the western Russian Arctic that becomes more open as one moves eastward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain Awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia claims to have deployed its Rezonans-N radar system to bases on Novaya Zemlya, the Kanin Nos Peninsula, and at Indiga. These systems may be notable in that, according to some Russian sources, they can detect hypersonic missiles and stealth planes and possess supposedly advanced over-the-horizon capabilities. It is not clear, however, if the indication and warning they can provide against stealth aircraft can come early enough to ensure interception. There is reportedly also a “dual-use air-surveillance radar station” on Graham Bell Island. Sopka-2 radar systems are deployed at the Temp, Nagurskoye, and Rogachevo air bases. Finally, Russia has some space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities pertaining to the Arctic, including Meridian-M communications satellites and an Arktika-M weather satellite for navigation support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia reportedly maintains electronic, or electromagnetic, warfare centers at Severomorsk, Kamchatka, and Primorsky Krai. Analysts note that the systems likely deployed to centers such as these could facilitate anti-submarine warfare and interfere with maritime communications. Russia’s doctrine emphasizes electronic warfare. It may be used to jam Western communications, radars, and datalinks for one of several purposes: to confuse an adversary, to blind them, and/or to lengthen or interrupt adversary decisionmaking processes and kill chains. If used well, this can provide a battlefield advantage. This capability can also be used maliciously in peacetime, as Section Two describes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-two-impact-of-the-war-on-russias-conventional-capacity&quot;&gt;Section Two: Impact of the War on Russia’s Conventional Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-impact-of-the-war&quot;&gt;Direct Impact of the War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing credible unclassified reports of destroyed Russian assets or decimated units is challenging, but a few assertions can be made. First, relatively early in the war, some Northern Fleet naval assets were sent to the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, or Ukraine itself, including the Marshal Ustinov — which is now one of only two remaining Slava-class cruisers after the sinking of the Moskva in April — and three large landing ships. Second, the three large landing ships carry an estimated 30 tanks and 1,000 troops between them but, even though they took off from a Northern Fleet port originally, they made a port call in Kaliningrad before sailing south to the Black Sea. It is therefore highly likely that some assets the ships were transporting were not from the Northern Fleet. Third, no Northern Fleet warships or submarines have been reported destroyed in the conflict. The Marshal Ustinov left the region during the summer, and at least one of the landing ships has been seen in the Arctic as recently as September. Fourth, there are no credible reports that any of the Northern Fleet air combat capabilities identified above have been destroyed in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, and most notably, there are reports that several Russian Arctic units have been deteriorated, especially ground forces. The 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and 61st Independent Naval Brigade have been involved in the fighting in Ukraine, as has the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade and the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. What is more, there is reason to believe one battalion tactical group of the 200th has been not only involved in the fighting but effectively wiped out: an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky asserted in March that 645 of the group’s 648 soldiers had been killed. Eighteen of the tanks confirmed to be destroyed in Ukraine are T-80BVMs, a type that the 200th had at its disposal. Finally, a Northern Fleet unit of marines that reportedly “trained for reconnaissance and sabotage operations behind enemy lines,” the Special Underwater Forces unit 69068, may have been effectively eliminated. However, as the war goes on, credible independent verification of the war losses is difficult to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Impact of Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct attrition due to the war, it may be useful to consider the impact of sanctions and export controls on the Russian economy and defense industry, both with respect to forthcoming capabilities destined for the Northern Fleet and to advanced systems in the Arctic that depend on foreign technology and may be in demand for Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the first question, there is a sizeable list of assets that the Northern Fleet is supposed to receive in the coming years. Another Borei-class SSBN is due to join the fleet, as are the following submarines: three Akula SSNs undergoing refits to, it is believed, give them the ability to launch Kalibr cruise missiles; three more Severodvinsk SSGNs; and an indeterminate number of next-generation Lada-class SSKs. The ambitious Lider-class destroyer project had intended to build eight of these advanced vessels, which would have been split between the Northern and Pacific Fleets. Even before the recent round of sanctions, the project was beset by difficulties and a reported lack of funding. Its current status is not clear based on public information. As noted earlier, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is currently undergoing repairs. A second diesel-electric icebreaker may be forthcoming for the navy, as well as one new Arctic patrol icebreaker. Two more Rezonans-N complexes are expected to be constructed by the end of the year. Russia also intends to launch three more Arktika-M satellites by 2025 and has claimed that two early-warning Voronezh systems will be operational by the end of 2022. Finally, it has been speculated that Russia’s long-rumored, nuclear-enabled, autonomous torpedo drone, the Poseidon, could be based on the Kola Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall state of the Russian economy and the impact of sanctions may affect its ability to field these and other capabilities on schedule. Sanctions have already significantly impacted the Russian economy. Some analysts predict it will not return to prewar levels until the end of the decade, and the threat of secondary sanctions will only increase over time. Some sectors have been significantly affected and, as of June 2022, imports from sanctioning countries had “collapsed by 50 percent or more in comparison” to the same period in 2021. Russia has already fallen into a recession. At the same time, there are signs of resilience. Russia has shown some ability to source goods from some non-sanctioning countries, and India and China have increased oil purchases, compensating so far for the loss of the EU market. Furthermore, the Russian defense sector is relatively less dependent on imports than those of other countries. Moscow is willing to prop up the sector and divert funding to it at the expense of others, such as healthcare or education. Experts have estimated that defense spending in the first seven months of 2022 exceeded the same period in 2021 by about $20 billion, and the defense procurement budget may have increased by roughly 45 percent over the past year. Overall, there is some consensus among experts that the Russian defense industry will still be able to produce less sophisticated weapons systems, but that high-tech capabilities will be an issue, both because of export controls and because of brain drain. Despite attempts to increase its self-sufficiency in the last eight years, Russia has relied on foreign technology in its defense, especially when it comes to high-end computer chips. For example, as of June, Russia’s main armored vehicle manufacturer had ceased tank production for lack of foreign parts; tank variants like the T-90 rely on Western electronics. Even parts of Russia’s military tactical communications system reportedly depend on Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few specific findings are relevant to the Arctic theater. First, Ukrainian forces found five U.S.-made chips in a captured defense Pantsir air defense system, which has been deployed to the major bases on Alexandra Land Island, the New Siberian Islands, and Novaya Zemlya, as well as on the Kola Peninsula; it was intended for use to support the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade. Second, some precision-guided munitions also depend on Western components, including the Kalibr, Iskander-M, Kh-101, and 9M727 cruise missiles, as well as the 9M549 guided artillery rocket. The Kalibr is used — or intended for use — by the Northern Fleet’s Gorshkov frigates, Severodvinsk SSGNs, and Akula-class SSBNs, and was intended to be used by the Lider-class destroyers as well, if that project ever comes to fruition. As of September, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had used 55 percent of its stockpile of guided missiles, though these are dated numbers associated with very high uncertainty. The Ukrainians similarly assessed that Russia was down to only four dozen hypersonic missiles. Russia has in recent years often tested such missiles in the Arctic theater. It also had plans to deploy some, such as the Kinzhal missile, to the region. Without advanced and imported chips, Russia may not be able to fully build these stocks back up — though recent reporting from the New York Times indicates that the country may have some resilience in this regard. Nonetheless, given the likely shortfall at present, there may be a competition between missile needs in the Arctic and in other theaters like Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Russia’s conventional land forces in the Kola Peninsula, including naval infantry and possibly special forces, are today depleted and substantially weakened. Russia’s ability to successfully conduct a rapid conventional ground incursion toward its western neighbors in the Arctic is in the short term even more minimal than before the war. Its ability to do so in the medium and long term will depend on its ability to recruit new conscripts and train them for Arctic operations. There is also reason to think that the same issues relating to “low morale, poor execution of combined arms, subpar training, deficient logistics, [and] corruption” may bedevil Russian forces in the Arctic, as they have in Ukraine — though one should not underestimate Russia’s potential to learn from its failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the toll from the Ukraine war is not necessarily reflected in the other service branches in the Russian Arctic. The naval components of Russia’s Northern Fleet, particularly its strategic submarine fleet, continue to give Moscow a credible second-strike capability. One can also assume the same situation to be the case for Russia’s strategic air force, as well as intelligence collection capabilities, special purpose ships and submarines, and other parts of the Kremlin’s nonconventional power-projecting apparatus. As such, Russia’s ability to threaten the West in the Arctic with naval and air assets in the short term has been affected less. Its ability to do so in the medium to long term will depend on how sanctions impact its defense industry: given the assets the Northern Fleet was due to receive that are in varying stages of development or construction, it may be supposed that the fleet will be somewhat less formidable in 5–10 years than it might otherwise have been if sanctions had never been imposed. One potential weakness is that precision munitions will be harder to come by for the entire Russian armed forces, to include some Arctic capabilities. This may make certain offensive measures against Arctic NATO allies less attractive, such as the scenario discussed in section one, wherein Russia may consider, in the early stages of a wider NATO-Russia conflict, using such munitions to strike at key targets inside of Norway, Finland, or Sweden. Russia’s Arctic air defense capacity is hardly affected at all, except to the extent that the Pantsir system will become more difficult to replace. While Russia has other advanced air defense systems in the region, such as the S-300 and S-400, those are intended for long-range protection; the Pantsir is used for short-range base defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-three-hybrid-threats-in-the-arctic&quot;&gt;Section Three: Hybrid Threats in the Arctic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the conventional thus accounted for, it must be further noted that other capacities, such as Russia’s propaganda machine and “hybrid” tools of influence, also continue to work at full steam. Observations from NATO’s northern flank suggest that campaigns where hybrid instruments play a role might be on the rise in Russia’s northern neighborhood. However, as the term “hybrid” often lacks a clear definition, this conceptual aspect needs to be addressed before laying out some empirical observations of Russia’s increasing use of a hybrid playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hybrid warfare” is a problematic term to define in a scientifically satisfactory way. It is often used interchangeably with “hybrid threats” or “hybrid influence,” essentially being expressions for composite hostile activities in what has been described as the “gray” or “blurred zone” between peace and war. While it is hard to settle on a precise, commonly accepted definition, the connotation is nonetheless frequently used by policymakers, military experts, or in media when describing “gray zone events,” or threats, that do not fit the traditional dichotomy of peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Multinational Capability Development Campaign’s “Countering Hybrid warfare” project, in this publication we apply the term hybrid warfare to mean “the synchronized use of multiple instruments of power tailored to specific vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of societal functions to achieve synergistic effects.” These instruments of power are also designed to be under the threshold of what is viewed as an act of war, hence not triggering an Article 5 response from NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scrutinizing recent events in the northern parts of NATO’s area of responsibility, Norway stands out as a country where multiple hybrid threats seem to have been observed recently. During fall 2022, numerous unidentified drones have flown over or around important parts of Norwegian communication infrastructure, airports, or military facilities. In addition to these installations, large drones have also overflown oil and gas facilities, such as Kårstø, a crucial facility for processing and transporting gas out of Norway. The flying of drones also included illegal photographing on Svalbard, the remote Norwegian archipelago between the North Pole and the northernmost tip of mainland Norway. Suspicious activity also led to the arrest of no less than seven Russian citizens in a short amount of time in fall 2022 for illegal photographing across the country. At about the same time, the Norwegian Police Security Service arrested and charged an illegal Russian spy who was working under a fake identity as a researcher at University of Tromsø, Northern Norway. Of other earlier suspicious activities that have been reported by media, the Russian Orthodox Church’s friendship visit from the Russian border city of Severomorsk to Kirkenes deserves to be mentioned. As the priests arrived on the visit, they displayed an unusual interest in studying the Kirkenes’ water supply. However, the desired on-site study trip was canceled by the mayor of Kirkenes after discreet advice from the Chief of Police in Finnmark. Similarly, substantial parts of eastern Finnmark in northern Norway have for several years been affected by the jamming of GPS signals. This electronic interference originates from Russia and is affecting various nonmilitary activities in Finnmark, such as civilian aviation. As of today, Norwegian Aviation Authorities report that “the jamming from Russia is more frequent than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7CKVhg9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “Oil Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf,” Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, September 9, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic sea, Norway’s gas pipelines to Europe have been recognized as a “prime target for sabotage.” This realization comes after years of reporting on consistent suspicious Russian activities in the Norwegian littorals, where key ports and subsurface cables and pipelines have drawn a lot of interest from Russian “research” or fishing vessels. Worrying reports, such as the cutting of a subsurface fiber-optic cable stretching from mainland Norway to Svalbard, as well as the damage of fiber-optic submarine cables near the Faroe and Shetland Islands, point to a pattern fitting the traits of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Russia’s conventionally weakened capacity in the Arctic, and the high tensions between Russia and the West, it is reasonable that such hybrid campaigns might turn out to be the preferred Russian tool to target communities in its Arctic neighborhood in the future, at least for the short and medium term. While it is debated what the true intention of the abovementioned campaigns might be, the actual mapping of potential targets is one hypothesis, while other likely intentions might simply be the desire to create uncertainty and fear in the population or to signal Russian dissatisfaction with Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-four-implications-for-nato-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Section Four: Implications for NATO and the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia’s capacity to project power into the North Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic seems unchanged. This was the only threat pertaining to the Arctic, or High North, that NATO allies agreed to put in the new 2022 Strategic Concept, and so it is especially notable. It was not specifically discussed in the U.S. Arctic strategy, but it is the United States, along with Canada, whose naval assets would need to cross the North Atlantic Ocean to reinforce European allies in an Article 5 contingent. Allied plans to invest in surveillance capabilities, especially radars in the area of the GIUK gap, will help mitigate this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia’s relative incapacity to threaten a conventional military land incursion into European Arctic allies will be welcome news to the Biden administration, whose recent strategic documents do not indicate a high prioritization of the region in terms of defense. Most notably, the NSS lists the Arctic last in its overview of regional policies. The strategy is cautious about promising U.S. presence in the Arctic, saying it will only be exercised “as required, while reducing risk and preventing unnecessary escalation.” The U.S. National Defense Strategy mentions the Arctic fleetingly and is also cautious: “U.S. activities and posture in the Arctic should be calibrated, as the Department preserves its focus on the Indo-Pacific region.” Its emphasis is on stability, homeland defense, and maritime domain awareness, and there is no language in the Arctic section about deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners. This language does appear in the U.S. Arctic strategy, which states, “We will deter threats to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing the capabilities required to defend our interests in the Arctic.” The document promises needed investments in domain awareness capabilities and icebreakers. Still, it also emphasizes avoiding escalation and notably states that it “may be possible to resume cooperation under certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the three documents seem to indicate an administration that will take regional threats in the Arctic seriously and will likely continue to show occasional presence and participate in exercises, but that will prefer cautious actions so as not to threaten the relative stability of the region. Doing so allows the administration to focus on other geopolitical priorities, like China, and not excessively complicate other regional priorities like climate change research and economic development. One finding from this paper that may therefore be of interest is that there are indirect, light-touch ways to enhance Arctic security: effective imposition of the sanctions regime concerning dual-use computer chips seems to be one way to diminish the conventional Russian threat in the Arctic that does not involve deploying U.S. military assets or personnel to the region. If the administration is seeking to balance the need to protect allies and partners with a desire to not overly militarize the region, this could be notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, given the state of Russia’s conventional armed forces, Russian aggression toward Arctic European states may continue to lean heavily on hybrid tools. There have been encouraging signs of a Western response to this, such as Norway’s deployment of the Home Guard to protect critical infrastructure, and NATO allies’ assistance to help them do so via increased allied ship patrols in the North Sea. Norway also recently adopted its annual Flotex naval exercise to include a component focused on protecting oil and gas installations. Even the U.S. Arctic strategy recognizes the challenge, promising to focus on “building the resilience of critical infrastructure,” including against cyberattacks. This is a welcome recognition from the Biden administration of Russia’s penchant for using hybrid tactics in the High North — however, the administration may not yet have fully recognized that this tool is likely becoming more attractive to Russia in the Arctic, relative to conventional force. NATO allies like Norway, and future members like Sweden and Finland, may need to further impress this probability on the United States and other allies at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is probably too early to give an accurate and comprehensive estimate of the future Russian warfighting capability in the Arctic, given the impact of the Ukraine war. It would be prudent, however, given what is known and what is coming to light, to revisit assumptions that guided prewar analysis, campaign modeling, and wargaming concerning the region. Indeed, U.S. military doctrine is explicit that assumptions should be constantly reconsidered in light of new information, and NATO doctrine echoes this. As NATO’s new Supreme Allied Commander Europe starts crafting the alliance’s new regional defense plans, there is an opportunity to consider some of these preliminary findings in High North scenarios. In the meantime, the old saying, sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill, that “Russia is never as strong as she looks; Russia is never as weak as she looks,” might be a prudent approach for the West with respect to its security and defense planning in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

As demonstrated by the case of Argentina, these close ties can benefit Chinese party-state actors going overseas by providing material state support — but can also become a liability by engendering skepticism among host countries and potential business partners over Chinese firms’ motivations. To explore these elements of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, this report examines two recent projects in China-Argentina space collaboration: first, the construction of China’s first international deep space ground station, and second, the dynamics of Chinese business collaboration with Argentine satellite technology start-up Satellogic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does China’s expanding space sector reveal about the country’s state capitalist economic system? This case study examines the CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese regulators, state-owned and private financiers, technology companies, and military entities key to becoming what Chinese leader Xi Jinping has termed a “great space power” (航天强国). China’s ambitions include developing world-leading space technology and systems, pursuing deep space exploration, and shaping the norms of global space governance. Toward these goals, China continues to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with a growing number of countries. This case study examines how the complex ecosystem of Chinese party-state actors serves — and sometimes limits — Beijing’s space ambitions by investigating Chinese commercial and state-backed investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s broader state capitalist system has evolved since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) extended its control over both China’s private sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while SOEs merged and consolidated into bigger entities with more expansive networks of subsidiaries, as part of an initiative to improve efficiency. State investment has taken on increased importance as a method for steering Chinese companies toward the pursuit of strategic objectives. These developments have created a complex ecosystem in which state-owned and private-owned Chinese companies are subject to state and party influence via an array of financial, ownership, and personnel conduits — but are still able and encouraged to pursue commercial aims within the bounds of the CCP’s strategic interests. This new paradigm of Chinese state capitalism is known as the “CCP Inc.” system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, CCP Inc. benefits Chinese companies; rather than go it alone, Chinese companies enter new markets and projects as part of an ecosystem of government and commercial entities in pursuit of common economic goals. Yet CCP Inc. can also be a liability for Chinese firms, engendering skepticism overseas about their motivations; close connections with CCP and state actors make it difficult for individual Chinese firms to distance themselves fully from broader party-state aims when approaching potential partners abroad. The effectiveness of CCP Inc. varies substantially by country and industry, depending on China’s diplomatic relationships with the target state and the degree of CCP control over the sector in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study explores how CCP Inc. has enabled China’s space sector to grow its international footprint through key projects in Argentina. From the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to successful explorations on the far side of the moon and a mission to Mars, China’s national space capabilities have improved dramatically in the past three decades. Along with eye-catching interplanetary missions, China’s space sector recently underwent a less publicized structural transformation. In 2014, China opened the sector to private investment, expanding the role of commercial actors in the country’s space program. However, as this case study shows, the core of the sector remains closely linked to state agencies, SOEs, and military organizations — even more so than other industries examined in this series of CCP Inc. case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space cooperation with Argentina illustrates how state, military, and commercial entities have broadened the overseas footprint of China’s space sector. Space cooperation between China and Argentina began through diplomatic channels. In the early 2010s, amid deepening bilateral relations, Argentina agreed to host China’s first international deep space ground station: the Estación de Espacio Lejano (Spanish for “deep space station,” referred to in this report as the “Espacio Lejano Station”), which was constructed by Chinese SOEs that had track records of working on People’s Liberation Army (PLA) contracts and is now managed by a Chinese military-linked state entity. As commercialization of the Chinese space sector has grown, commercial deals by private Chinese companies have also become an increasingly important part of China-Argentina space cooperation, particularly through deals focused on satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study proceeds in three parts. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to China’s space sector and China-Argentina space cooperation. Chaper 2 examines the development of the Espacio Lejano Station, which remains a source of controversy within Argentina and internationally due to its links to the PLA. Finally, Chapter 3 explores the role of Chinese commercial space engagement in Argentina through examination of deals between Chinese companies and Argentine satellite imagery start-up Satellogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-space-program-and-china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China’s Space Program and China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the more established industrial sectors examined in previous CCP Inc. case studies on mining, financial services, energy, and telecommunications, China’s space industry is relatively new and quickly evolving. It is also tightly interwoven with government and military bodies to a degree unparalleled by market economies, even those with substantial state involvement in the space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this deep integration, one need only look at the composition of China’s space sector today, which consists of three primary groups of actors (see Figure 1): the state-owned “national team” of government agencies and major SOEs; entities linked to the PLA; and — since 2014, when deregulation opened the door for private investments — a burgeoning set of commercial actors who are interlinked with the other two groups. As a window into CCP Inc., the evolution of China’s space industry over the past decade demonstrates how China’s state capitalism can simultaneously open more opportunities for commercial development while maintaining tight state control over private sector involvement in a strategic industry. The important role of the PLA in this sector also impacts how international companies and governments engage with China’s space industry, as demonstrated by the projects in Argentina detailed in the second and third sections of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “national team” of China’s space industry is the well-established core of the national space program, compared to the country’s relatively new commercial space sector. It consists of government agencies, central SOEs, and hundreds of SOE subsidiaries. Two state agencies, the State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) and the China National Space Administration (CNSA), oversee China’s space industry as civilian administrators, while the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) plays a key role in aerospace research and technology development. Marc Julienne, head of China research at the French Institute of International Relations, has described SASTIND as the “nerve center” for the country’s space program; as the name suggests, the organization is focused on defense. According to China’s State Council, it was established to serve “the needs of national defense, military forces, national economy, and military-related organizations,” in addition to the “coordination of communications and cooperation on the use of nuclear power and space activities with countries and international organizations.” Under the purview of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council (SASAC), two SOEs — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), each with hundreds of subsidiaries — form the core of the government’s aerospace research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Chinese regulators lifted numerous restrictions on private investment in the space sector, resulting in a growing number of start-ups and new, mixed-ownership SOE subsidiaries with private investors, which together comprise China’s commercial space sector. At the time, the State Council released a statement commonly referred to as “Document 60,” which encouraged “private capital to participate in the construction of national civil space infrastructure” such as satellite launch and operations, as well as ground systems. Later, the State Council’s 2016 white paper on space highlighted efforts “to increase the level of commercialization of the space industry” by encouraging the participation of “nongovernmental capital and other social sectors” in space-related activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this government backing for commercialization, new players joined a preexisting ecosystem of government and military-linked entities. According to the white paper, “commercialization” does not require that funding come solely from nongovernment actors — rather, “commercial” entities can be funded by both government and nongovernment actors. Some analysts estimate that the number of commercial space sector companies is over 200 but note that this figure would vary based on how broadly “commercial” is defined. Commercial companies often share close institutional and personnel connections with the “national team.” For example, a 2019 study by the Institute for Defense Analyses found that many founders and executives of Chinese start-ups in the field were previously affiliated with CAS or with the major SOEs in the aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military plays a direct role in China’s space program through the PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), which assumed responsibility for space activities after its creation in 2015. A product of China’s military reorganization that year, the PLASSF was tasked with integrating the space domain more closely into China’s military operations. According to analysts of China’s space industry, the PLA — via the Strategic Support Force — works closely with SASTIND to coordinate R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing to support China’s space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-growing-space-presence-goals-and-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s Growing Space Presence: Goals and Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership has specified national space goals in authoritative documents: quinquennial State Council white papers on space; publications by top state agencies such as SASTIND and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC); and the national Five-Year Plan, a development agenda passed every five years by China’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress. The State Council’s most recent space strategy white paper, published in January 2022, emphasizes China’s continued goal to “strengthen its space presence in an all-round manner” in order to boost self-reliance in science and technology, secure its role in space governance, and enhance its national security (among other objectives). Internationally, the space sector features in China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through the Spatial Information Corridor, an initiative designed to provide comprehensive spatial information services (such as BeiDou satellite navigation) for countries along the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, China’s defense white paper officially elevated space to a military domain. The paper argued that “outer space has become a commanding height in international strategic competition” now that the “first signs of weaponization of outer space have appeared.” These publications affirm that Chinese leaders view space as a pivotal playing field in geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership encourages the array of state-owned, military-linked, and commercial actors in China’s space industry to support the state’s space goals. For example, Document 60 (which allowed for private capital in China’s space sector) promotes investment in specific space technologies such as satellites, remote-sensing data, and ground stations, specifying key areas that commercial actors are expected to support. While many countries have military aims in space, as the U.S. Space Force demonstrates, defense analysts characterize China’s military as more actively involved in the national space sector compared even to that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the state actively encourages cooperation between the military and civilian pillars of China’s space industry. A prominent aspect of China’s ational defense and military strategy is its pursuit of military-civil fusion (MCF), which involves “infrastructure and resource sharing” and “joint innovation of military and civilian science and technology,” as Xi stated in a 2018 meeting of the Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, published in 2021, emphasizes the need to deepen military-civil cooperation in space in the context of national aerospace technology development. In 2018, SASTIND outlined the requirements to apply for projects with the organization, specifying that applications should “strengthen civilian-military coordination on relevant scientific research plans [民口、军队有关科研计划的协调], [and] make proper links with defense industry scientific research projects already implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s broader efforts to promote and enhance dual-use technologies aim to encourage innovation and investment that supports both China’s economic goals and military development. While companies are not legally required to support these MCF goals for space, MCF still plays a key role in China’s space strategy and commercial space development because the state incentivizes companies to develop new technologies that support China’s military abilities in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space white papers also make clear that its leaders see the sector as a source of innovation in the country’s technology economy and view China’s growing space presence as a way to “promote high-quality economic and social development.” For example, these white papers have repeatedly stated that China aims to promote the application of its satellites and space technology in order to “serve national security and national economic and social development.” These goals contributed to decisions to allow commercial space ventures, boosting the sector’s rapid growth in recent years. Since 2014, new satellite and rocket companies have emerged with greater frequency, generating high-value jobs and enabling China to make inroads into overseas markets for Chinese space technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing private investment in China’s space sector, Chinese authorities have claimed a bigger stake in the fast-growing global commercial space economy. According to measurements by the Space Foundation, the global space economy had grown to a value of $469 billion by mid-2022, primarily due to increasing revenue in the commercial space sector. This marked a 54 percent growth in industry value over the past decade. While the United States is still by far the largest government spender on its space industry, China is now beginning to lead in other metrics, such as number of orbital launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend the reach of its space technology and tap into the growing global space economy, China has pursued global partnerships while building up its domestic space industry — which, in turn, informs understanding of China’s international space engagement. The remainder of this case study dives into China’s space engagement with Argentina, where close diplomatic ties and opportune financial circumstances facilitated frequent collaboration on both commercial and state-linked projects. The mix of state, military, and commercial entities characteristic of China’s domestic space industry is reflected in Argentina, where official diplomatic engagement and PLA actors played central roles in creating space industry ties, followed by commercial deals to deepen space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-decades-of-steadily-deepening-china-argentina-relations&quot;&gt;Two Decades of Steadily Deepening China-Argentina Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s diplomatic and economic relationship with China has deepened significantly over the past two decades. China has become one of Argentina’s major creditors, offering a source of investment during Argentina’s perennial financing challenges. According to the Inter-American Dialogue lending database, China’s policy banks have lent $17 billion for infrastructure development projects in the country since 2007 — more than China has lent to any other Latin American nation — and commercial banks have entered into 36 agreements in the country. Though China’s overseas spending and lending dropped off during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2022 China pledged support for Argentina to join the BRICS bloc of emerging market powers (made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), indicating both a continued appreciation for Argentina’s economic importance and a geopolitical interest in expanding the bloc’s footprint in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady trend of friendly relations across different Argentine and Chinese administrations deepened government-to-government ties throughout the past two decades. Current and former presidents Alberto Fernández (2019–present), Mauricio Macri (2015–19), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–15) desired varying degrees of closeness to China, but ultimately each advanced the bilateral relationship during their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dfamsgH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;President Xi has enjoyed friendly relations with the past three Argentine governments, led by Alberto Fernández (left), Mauricio Macri (center), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (right).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strong diplomatic relationship created a foundation for Chinese investment in and cooperation with Argentina across a variety of industries, including mining, agriculture, telecommunications, and energy. In addition to these more traditional areas for Chinese investment, space has become an important component of bilateral ties. Over the past two decades, the two countries signed multiple space cooperation frameworks, China offered technical and financial support for Argentine satellites, and — most critically — Argentina granted China land to construct its first deep space ground station on foreign soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to strengthen international space cooperation with Argentina can be traced back to the early 2000s. In 2004, Chinese president Hu Jintao and Argentine president Néstor Kirchner (the husband of later president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) signed a joint agreement on the “Cooperation of Peaceful Utilization of Outer Space Technology” during Hu’s visit to Argentina. During this trip, Hu also visited a space satellite manufacturing company, Investigación Aplicada S.E (INVAP), which was responsible for creating and launching satellites for Argentina’s newly formed national telecommunications company, Empresa Argentina de Soluciones Satelitales Sociedad Anónima AR-SAT (ARSAT). In 2005, China offered to sell Argentina a full satellite-launching system at a great discount in exchange for ARSAT stock — a deal that, if it had gone through, would have created a Chinese ownership stake in the state telecommunications company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkrWPuH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Argentine president Néstor Kirchner and Chinese president Hu Jintao during Hu’s 2004 visit to Argentina.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While INVAP ultimately chose a different contractor and ARSAT remained Argentine-owned, China’s engagement in Argentina’s space sector broadened and deepened in the years after Hu’s visit. Both state- and privately owned Chinese firms have supported Argentine satellite development through financing and technology provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those initial steps toward space cooperation, China and Argentina have worked together on multiple space projects led by a combination of state, military, and commercial actors. Notable ongoing projects include the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) in Argentina’s San Juan Province and the recently announced partnership between Argentine satellite manufacturer Ascentio Technologies S.A. (Ascentio) and Chinese commercial space firm Emposat (航天驭星, previously known as Satelliteherd) to develop a ground station. The CART is an example of international engagement led by the national team of China’s space sector; the project was officially approved by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology as one of the country’s major international collaborative science projects in 2010, with the Argentine provincial government of San Juan administering its construction. The Ascentio-Emposat deal, on the other hand, demonstrates how the commercial wing of China’s space industry drives growth in international engagement while still working closely with the national team. Emposat, a private company founded in 2016, frequently partners with Chinese government- and PLA-affiliated organizations such as CAS and SOEs such as CASC to pursue projects abroad. In addition to a new partnership with Argentina’s Ascentio, Emposat has contributed to the construction of ground stations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the proliferation of China-Argentina space industry business deals and infrastructure projects, the current state of space ties is outlined in official agreements between the two nations. Under the current administration of President Fernández, China and Argentina frequently include deepening space cooperation as an important part of the overall bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable achievement of China-Argentina space engagement is the construction of a PLA-run deep space ground station in Argentina’s Neuquén Province. Both the unique position of the Espacio Lejano Station in China’s space strategy and the group of CCP Inc. actors responsible for its construction merit a closer look. The following chapter examines in detail the circumstances behind the space station agreement and how different Chinese actors worked together to construct and run the secretive site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-first-international-deep-space-ground-station&quot;&gt;China’s First International Deep Space Ground Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambition to become a “great space power” involves expanding its “deep space network” (深空网路), a series of large radio dishes that provide a better understanding of deep space; more frequent telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;amp;C) capabilities; reliable communication with launched satellites; and more precise navigation. Deep space ground stations are thus critical to realizing Beijing’s goals of furthering lunar and planetary exploration and increasing TT&amp;amp;C coverage. Operation of ground stations and satellite TT&amp;amp;C functions fall under the purview of the PLASSF Space Systems Department, the military organization responsible for the bulk of the PLA’s space operations, including control over the four satellite launching sites and three TT&amp;amp;C sites that provide the infrastructure for China’s growing ambitions in space. In 2020, China launched more satellites into space than any other country, and it completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;background-on-ttc-deep-space-ground-stations-and-cltc&quot;&gt;Background on TT&amp;amp;C, Deep Space Ground Stations, and CLTC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TT&amp;amp;C systems facilitate communication between satellites and ground stations by downlinking transport data from a satellite — such as its location and overall performance — and allowing ground stations to give commands to satellites. The frequency of communication with satellites depends on the number and placement of ground stations, since connections can only be established when the satellite or space object is within range (or view) of the ground station. As a deep space ground station, the Espacio Lejano Station also allows China to have more frequent communication with and access to deep space objects, which have longer orbital periods and come into view less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Established in 1986, China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC, 中国卫星发射测控系统部) is the main organization in charge of China’s TT&amp;amp;C and space launch sectors. Verifying the chain of command above CLTC is not simple; examining public corporate registration documents, external analytical accounts, and CLTC’s subsidiary structure produces an uncertain picture. Online company registry databases show CLTC registered as a company wholly owned by the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND, 国防科工委), a civilian ministry of the State Council that was discontinued in 2008 and succeeded by SASTIND. That ownership structure would make CLTC a civilian body, but other indicators suggest that it is in fact a subordinate body of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department. China’s satellite launch centers fall under the jurisdiction of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department and are also subordinate to CLTC. Additionally, CLTC’s current and past leadership has included members of the PLASSF, with the same individual serving simultaneously as the chief of staff of the PLA General Armaments Department and the chairman of CLTC. Overseas space companies have, at times, stopped working with CLTC in preference for commercial TT&amp;amp;C companies due to CLTC’s ties to the PLA. As this evidence suggests, CLTC is intimately involved with both China’s civilian space program and the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China currently has three deep space ground stations: two within China (in Kashgar and Jiamusi) and one abroad (in Neuquén Province, Argentina). The Espacio Lejano Station thus fills a temporal gap in China’s global coverage. Adding a ground station on the other side of the globe allows China to improve the frequency of communication with its satellites. Since ground stations most easily communicate with satellites when they pass overhead, the additional deep space ground station in Neuquén gives China more continued access to them. Notably, ground stations can also gather information from other satellites that pass overhead, not just Chinese ones. Thus, more deep space ground stations allow for faster and more frequent gathering of data, which can help China understand the behavior of other countries’ satellites. The station’s official purpose is to expand deep space capabilities, with Chinese statements about it emphasizing its role in lunar exploration. For example, the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) says the Espacio Lejano Station played an important role in the 2019 Chang’e 4 mission to the far side of the moon. China’s space presence in Latin America extends beyond Argentina: CLTC constructed facilities for the Santiago Satellite Station, a ground station with three TT&amp;amp;C antennas in Chile’s Andes mountains. The station is operated by Swedish Space Corporation, which leased operation of two of the antennas to CLTC.&lt;/p&gt;

Lee, “China’s Ground Segment: Building the Pillars of a Great Space Power,” BluePath Labs for China Aerospace Studies Institute, March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement for the construction of the Espacio Lejano Station was reached in 2012, during a period of particularly strong diplomatic and economic ties between the Chinese government and the administration of Argentina’s president Christina Fernández de Kirchner. The agreement codified that the Espacio Lejano Station would be managed by CLTC and constructed with the aid of Chinese SOE contractors, subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company. Operational since 2018, the station quickly became a flashpoint within Argentina and internationally — particularly within the United States. As discussed later in this chapter, the opacity around the station’s construction, political controversy around the terms of the deal, and CLTC’s links to the PLA have fueled suspicion about China’s intentions for the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station reveals two observations about the PLA’s position in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The station agreement and its construction were facilitated by Chinese officials, state-owned construction firms, and a PLA-linked organization (CLTC) that now runs the station. Through one lens, this could be seen as a case study of how the PLA rallied other parts of the CCP Inc. ecosystem to advance China’s military interests abroad. At the same time, throughout the process, these military ties featured as key reasons for pushback against the Espacio Lejano Station and setbacks to Chinese investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-espacio-lejano-station-agreement&quot;&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework agreement for the Espacio Lejano Station was signed in 2012 by Argentina’s civil space agency, Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), CLTC, and the province of Neuquén, where the station is located. These parties then signed a further follow-on agreement in 2014. The deal granted China 50 years of full sovereignty and tax exemption over a 200-hectare (500-acre) plot of land to build the deep space ground station. China received the right to construct, establish, and operate ground tracking and data collection without needing to specify what the technology and data would be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract guaranteed CONAE the use of 10 percent of the deep space ground station’s operating time per year. However, the agreement does little to limit China’s operations there. Rather, it specifies that Argentina cannot “interfere [with] or interrupt the normal activities carried out under the Cooperation Agreement” and that if Argentina were to take any decisions that might interfere with China’s activities, it must inform China in advance and explore alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cost of the station to China remains unclear. According to records captured by the AidData database, CLTC spent $50 million (USD) in state funding for the project in 2012, while Chinese media reports in 2015 say that CLTC was expected to invest $300 million. The framework agreement also includes language about the Chinese government paying Chinese workers according to their own labor laws, suggesting that the $50 million could refer to the amount the Chinese government — via CLTC — paid its own contractors and workers for the station. Though the framework agreement was first reached in 2012, the deal did not pass Argentina’s Congress until 2015. The station has been operational since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Espacio Lejano Station agreement was reached during the administration of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–2015), a period marked by both financial troubles for Argentina and a deepening of the Sino-Argentine partnership. In 2014, China and Argentina upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and dramatically deepened their economic ties. China and Argentina signed dozens of commercial deals, China offered an $11.4 billion (RMB 70 billion) currency swap between the two countries’ central banks, and Argentina benefited from Chinese loans to upgrade its infrastructure. The bilateral relationship has since remained relatively strong, grounded in these expanding economic ties. In 2015, a new center-right government led by President Mauricio Macri initially raised concerns about transparency in dealings with China. He pledged to review — and potentially cancel — major bilateral deals with China as he attempted to deepen relations with the United States and Europe. However, Macri ultimately maintained the arc of continued alignment with China, meeting with Xi five times and accepting further financing and business deals during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station spotlights the linkages that often exist between high-level state goals (China’s aim of becoming a leading international space power) and individual projects overseas. Examining how the station was constructed and how it is now run underlines the benefit of being able to draw on party-state support for strategic projects. As the following section shows, CLTC relied on Chinese construction companies with a track record of working with the PLA to build the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;construction-and-management-in-neuquén&quot;&gt;Construction and Management in Neuquén&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the diplomatic agreement between the Chinese and Argentine governments, Chinese state-owned construction companies built the station. According to Chinese government press releases and media reports about the station, two subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC, 中国交通建设公司) — China Harbor Engineering Company (中国港湾工程有限责任公司) and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau (中交第四公路工程局有限公司) — led this process, alongside an Argentine construction firm, Electroingeniería S.A. CCCC is a majority state-owned and publicly traded company that has played a significant role in China’s island-building in the South China Sea and the military stations upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tSLCYwy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Actors Involved in Constructing and Managing the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few details regarding the selection process for contractors at the Espacio Lejano Station are publicly available, but the involvement of these firms follows a precedent set in the South China Sea and elsewhere, in which the PLA uses select construction companies to work on sensitive projects. With construction now finished, the Espacio Lejano Station is managed by CLTC and one of its sub-entities, Xi’an Satellite Control Center (XSCC), both of which are subordinate to the PLASSF Space Systems Department. After China’s military reforms in December 2015, the Space Systems Department acquired authority over China’s space-related test bases, which include XSCC and satellite-launch bases. XSCC, which is China’s largest satellite control center and the main center for China’s TT&amp;amp;C operations, was designated by CLTC as the entity responsible for “construction and operating matters” at the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooperation between CLTC and the two construction SOEs — China Harbour Engineering Company and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau — shows how connectivity with Chinese firms enables the PLA to execute international projects. Just as CCCC constructed islands in the South China Sea that proved crucial to PLA expansion there, PLA-affiliated CLTC relied on military-industrial support companies to construct the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLTC’s role has been central to accusations that the station is essentially run by the military, drawing criticism from the local community and analysts abroad. The PLA’s involvement and the secrecy that Espacio Lejano Station is able to maintain — in no small part due to the fact that China relied on its own contractors — has attracted suspicion from local residents, Argentine legislators, and international analysts alike. This suspicion reveals the drawbacks of military involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem and foreshadows hurdles for China’s space industry — and its bid for a greater international presence — going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suspicions-surrounding-ccp-inc-at-the-espacio-lejano-station&quot;&gt;Suspicions Surrounding CCP Inc. at the Espacio Lejano Station&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emanating from both local and international observers, concerns about the potential uses of the Espacio Lejano Station stem from a combination of factors: secrecy around the space station’s operations, the dual-use nature of the space technology involved, the PLA’s presence, and the impression that Argentine interests are not being served in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local level, residents living nearby have expressed concerns that the station is a military base disguised as a research facility. Horacio Quiroga, former mayor of Neuquén (the capital city of Neuquén Province), told media that, in his view, the installation is “practically Chinese territory.” On the national level, legislators have rallied for further oversight, including through a 2019 effort by Argentina’s Senate majority leader to create an independent monitor for the station. Internationally, analysts highlight that the technology used at ground stations like Espacio Lejano is inherently dual-use and could serve military or civilian purposes. U.S. military officials have also voiced concerns about the potential military use of the Espacio Lejano Station to target the space activities of the United States or its partners and spy on U.S. satellites. Any internet search in either English or Spanish turns up pages of results revealing concerns among these various actors about the Chinese military’s involvement in Neuquén.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these concerns prevented the Espacio Lejano Station from being built, they did affect its reputation. Still, the Argentine government stood by its agreement and sought to reassure the public. In 2016, Argentine minister of foreign affairs Susana Malcorra and her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, signed an additional protocol affirming that the station would be used only for peaceful purposes. Argentina’s current ambassador to Beijing, Sabino Vaca Narvaja, maintained that “China shares all information about its space program with Argentina” after the commander of the U.S. Southern Command questioned the potential military uses of the station. In a 2021 meeting with China’s vice minister of industry and information technology, Zhang Kejian, who oversees the CNSA, Vaca Narvaja underlined Argentina’s interest in deepening space cooperation and highlighted the Espacio Lejano Station’s aid to China’s Chang’e 5 lunar probe as a positive example of bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nl3cFeP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Satellite imagery of the Espacio Lejano Station shows an unusually large number of administrative and housing facilities on site given the size of the ground station itself. The vast amount of leased land around it — far more than the deep space station currently uses — could also indicate intentions to expand the installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reassurances from Argentine and Chinese officials have not changed the facts that the station remains operated by a PLA-linked administrator, official oversight by Argentina is limited, and the installation continues to house dual-use technology. Because CLTC drew on Chinese SOEs to construct the station, Argentine companies’ involvement has been limited. The degree of concern that has emerged about the Espacio Lejano Station clearly demonstrates a critical liability of the CCP Inc. ecosystem: suspicions regarding the intentions of the Chinese state and, in this case, the Chinese military are extended to each of the country’s international projects, particularly those that involve strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station shows that close ties to the military can be a reputational liability for China’s overseas space efforts, but also that the close connections between the civilian and military sides of China’s space industry benefit the PLA by enabling it to conduct international space projects. As previous CCP Inc. case studies in this series underline, engagements with one Chinese firm or institution are not carried out in a vacuum. CCP Inc. involves a web of relationships between parent and subsidiary companies, financiers, and Chinese officials, as well as personnel ties to the CCP. Within the space industry, the PLA is part of that list of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the following section shows, the close integration of the PLA into the space sector is often a factor in whether overseas investors and firms choose to engage with China’s commercial space projects. In the space industry, profit-seeking Chinese companies frequently work with the PLA or toward MCF aims. In Argentina, business dealings between Argentine satellite start-up Satellogic and multiple Chinese space companies reveal that the latter may act in pursuit of commercial aims but are never too far removed from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;satellogic-and-chinas-commercial-space-sector&quot;&gt;Satellogic and China’s Commercial Space Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine start-up Satellogic’s engagement with Chinese companies illustrates how China’s burgeoning commercial space sector is increasingly involved in international investments. Founded in 2010, Satellogic has grown into a pioneering satellite technology company valued at over $200 million on the Nasdaq, as of writing. Satellogic describes itself as operating in the commercial “NewSpace” sector, where it focuses on building more cost-effective satellites. The company’s vertically integrated structure — in which it manufactures the various parts of its satellites rather than relying on vendors — enables it to roll out new technology quickly. The company has major ambitions: it plans to launch enough satellites into orbit to provide global, high-resolution imagery, refreshed every day — a mission Satellogic says will “completely reshape the business model” for imagery data. Satellogic’s latest launch, in January 2023, brought its total fleet up to 30 operational satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic has collaborated with state-owned Chinese firms for technology support, received major investments from a private Chinese company, and entered the Chinese market through a contract with a Chinese data science company to provide imaging services. Though Satellogic’s partnerships were commercial, they still brought the Argentine start-up into the fold of the state-linked Chinese space sector. After the company set its sights on going public in the United States and gained new U.S. investors, it appears to have pivoted away from its Chinese partners, naming SpaceX as its preferred launch partner and divesting itself of any ownership stake by Chinese investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-history-of-partnership-with-chinese-firms&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s History of Partnership with Chinese Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic partnered with China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC, 中国长城工业集团) to launch its early satellites. CGWIC is a fully owned subsidiary of the SOE CASC, but it describes itself as a “commercial” organization because it is authorized by the Chinese government to provide commercial launch services. It also partners with military-affiliated organizations in China’s space industry, including CLTC. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, CGWIC signed initial agreements that helped Satellogic launch satellites into low-earth orbit and, in 2019, signed a multiple launch agreement (MLA) for 90 Satellogic spacecraft. In November 2020, CGWIC sent 10 Satellogic satellites into orbit in the company’s largest launch to date, bringing the total number of CGWIC-launched satellites to 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LEzXCE6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A Chinese rocket carrying China’s remote sensing satellites is launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province. China has ramped up its rocket launches in recent years and completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investors also played a critical role in providing seed money and follow-on investments that facilitated Satellogic’s development. Privately owned Chinese technology and media conglomerate Tencent participated in three rounds of investment in Satellogic prior to the company’s listing on the Nasdaq. Subsequently, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Satellogic (referred to in the filings as “Nettar Group Inc.”) raised a total of $40 million from Tencent, via its subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited, over six rounds of funding between January 2015 and September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ahead of Tencent’s 2019 investment, Satellogic signed a $38 million agreement with Chinese data science company Zhong Ke Guang Qi Space Information Technology Company (known in English as ABDAS, 中科光启空间信息技术有限公司) — a private company that was set up with the support of CAS — to provide ABDAS with imaging services of China’s Henan Province. This agreement granted ABDAS exclusive access to a fleet of satellites and decisionmaking authority over which specific regions to observe when passing over Henan, giving it the observational data needed to support crop yield and evaluate compliance with environmental regulations. This was Satellogic’s first deal for a “dedicated satellite constellation,” wherein customers can lease ownership over satellites when they pass over a specified geographic region. While none of the companies involved ever confirmed a link between Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS and Tencent’s investment, industry analysts have speculated that Satellogic’s relationship with Tencent may have helped it navigate its partnership with ABDAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic’s cooperation with ABDAS also extended to a project of close interest to the CCP. At the end of 2019, ABDAS and People’s Data Company (人民数据管理有限公司) jointly launched the People’s Nebula (人民星云) project, which combines satellite services with big data to “build a comprehensive aerospace data product sharing service platform” that will, in turn, facilitate China’s access to satellite imagery and data. The People’s Data Company was established under the CCP’s top newspaper, the People’s Daily, which expanded its services to include data management and cloud computing. Satellogic provided Henan Province complete control over its dedicated satellite constellation, but (if successfully completed) the People’s Nebula project will allow China to access satellite-provided data on a far larger scale, without needing to utilize a third party such as Satellogic. This project requires building and launching a series of satellites, the first of which (Renmin-1) was developed by Satellogic and launched by CGWIC. While few details are publicly available about this deal, Satellogic’s existing relationship with Tencent and CGWIC likely contributed to Satellogic developing the first satellite for People’s Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese collaboration with Satellogic demonstrates the various forms of international engagement China’s space industry takes. CGWIC, a company plugged into the state-owned and military-linked facets of this sector, played a key role in helping Satellogic get its first satellites off the ground and renewed its partnership with a multiple launch agreement in 2019. Tencent offered a source of private financing and, in addition to investing in Satellogic, has invested in other foreign space companies, including the U.S. firms Planetary Resources and Moon Express. Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS was mutually beneficial, providing utility to Henan Province and enabling Argentina to access the Chinese market — and likely led to Satellogic’s involvement in the People’s Nebula project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-shift-away-from-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s Shift Away from CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this track record of collaboration, Satellogic began shifting toward new U.S. partners in the past few years. In July 2021, Satellogic announced its plans to go public in the United States via a merger with CF Acquisition Corp. V (CFV), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a U.S. financial services firm. Cantor Fitzgerald also provided $58 million to a $100 million private investment fund, to which Liberty Strategic Capital (a private equity firm founded by former secretary of the treasury Steve Mnuchin) invested an additional $150 million in January 2022. Shortly after Satellogic received this influx of U.S. capital, it announced a MLA with SpaceX for its next 68 satellites, with CEO Emiliano Kargieman describing SpaceX as the company’s “preferred partner for rideshare missions” in “2023 and beyond,” signaling a move away from CGWIC in future launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the 2019 CGWIC MLA promised to launch 90 spacecraft, Satellogic may still be working with the Chinese SOE — but any such collaboration is no longer highlighted on either Satellogic’s or CGWIC’s websites. Additionally, Satellogic dropped Tencent as an investor after its final investment in September 2019. Documents filed with the SEC in March 2021 ahead of the company’s public listing show that Satellogic repurchased shares and promissory notes from Tencent subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited (CRIL) in exchange for owing CRIL a $40 million loan — removing any ownership stake for Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3oakyhr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Timeline of Satellogic’s Partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift away from Chinese partners is further explained in Satellogic’s F-1 SEC filing (a form required from foreign companies before listing in the United States). The document notes that a significant part of Satellogic’s growth plan relies on demand from international defense and intelligence customers and that “continued concerns regarding prior ownership of a minority interest in the Company’s shares by a Chinese entity and its minor operations in China could impact the Company’s ability to win bids from or enter into customer contracts with certain government agencies or commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the key role of Chinese partners in — quite literally — getting Satellogic’s early operations off the ground, the company seems to have decided that the business risks of continued collaboration with Chinese companies outweigh the opportunities. This decision underlines the particularly sensitive nature of the space industry. Though Satellogic is a commercial company, it is still cognizant that defense and intelligence uses of space technology remain central. Even Tencent, a private company, was impacted by Satellogic’s (or new U.S. investors’) concerns about links to the Chinese state. Satellogic repurchased Tencent’s shares to eliminate the Chinese company’s ownership stake despite its significant involvement in early funding rounds. The complex relationships and unclear boundaries in China’s space industry may dissuade international cooperation as it becomes more difficult for Chinese companies to separate themselves from the PLA and international perceptions of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-constrained-commercial-space&quot;&gt;China’s Constrained Commercial Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business agreements and investments between Satellogic and various Chinese companies show a very different side of China’s space industry compared to the state-led construction of the Espacio Lejano Station. Satellogic is a commercial actor working with Chinese space companies via business partnerships rather than bilateral agreements. It provides insight into how commercial deals factor into China’s pursuit of space industry goals and how private actors such as Tencent are investing in the sector. From looking at Satellogic and China’s domestic space sector more broadly, it is clear that private investors and Chinese businesses are able to pursue commercial ends only within a closely state-aligned environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Tencent, for example. Tencent’s investment in Satellogic could be seen as a purely private sector agreement. But at home, it has been working on its own launch of a space program in collaboration with the Chinese National Astronomical Observatories. Since China opened its space sector to private investment, the sector has seen an influx of startups and commercial space companies, but almost all of these still have a degree of state involvement and are typically only 30–50 percent privately funded. Many of the most successful “commercial” enterprises are subsidiaries of CASC or CASIC — or receive a combination of funding from large government organizations such as SASTIND or provincial governments in addition to private investment. Companies often tailor their innovation targets to support national security goals or government priorities to guarantee more funding. Meanwhile, the CCP supports these companies because they can innovate faster and work on projects that government organizations would not necessarily pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s model for the commercial space industry emphasizes the importance of centering private space ventures around national defense and security goals. In this context, the definition of “commercial” is limited, since most Chinese commercial space companies have elements of state ownership, connections to the PLA, or both. For example, it is common for prominent commercial space companies — such as ExPace, a commercial launch-vehicle maker and subsidiary of CASIC that provides services to foreign customers — to have leadership and personnel overlap with that of state-owned entities. ExPace’s chairman is simultaneously the deputy director of CASIC; in his dual roles, he has tasked the company with advancing successful commercial launch constellations and spaceplanes, which ultimately helps advance China’s broader space goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening China’s space sector to private investment has brought increased sources of funding while retaining the level of state alignment needed to ensure that this private financing continues to serve China’s strategic interests. Meanwhile, government funding in the sector allows the CCP to steer the growing array of commercial and state-owned companies. This creates a business ecosystem that is very tightly controlled — even more so than other industries in China. While financing, personnel ties, ownership structures, and political initiatives create conduits of party-state influence that are recognizable across the CCP Inc. state capitalist system, the strategic nature of the space industry and its close links to the military differentiate it from more traditional economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CCP Inc. ecosystem of China’s space sector, teasing out the motivations of individual actors is extremely difficult. Tracing the connective tissue between the parts and the whole — such as links between certain companies, state administrators, and the PLA — is feasible. But discerning to what degree Chinese space companies are motivated by profits and growth opportunities, versus dedication to state policy, is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of China-Argentina space cooperation mirrors themes evident in China’s other international engagements. Through CCP Inc., Chinese firms benefit when their commercial objectives align with state and military goals, enabling access to preferential state financing, diplomatic support, and other advantages. Additionally, by integrating state and business aims, the CCP Inc. system enhances party- state influence over commercial decisionmaking while maintaining ambiguity regarding whether certain corporate decisions are ultimately motivated by business or by state strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this complex ecosystem comes with risks for Chinese firms and, in turn, party-state goals overseas. Concern in host countries about Huawei compromising fifth-generation (5G) network security — or State Grid using its role in national electric grids to gain political leverage — centers on the strong connections between the Chinese party-state and China’s global commercial reach. The Espacio Lejano Station has been plagued by international and domestic political debates criticizing its opacity and military management. In the past few years, Argentine firm Satellogic has eschewed Chinese partnerships in favor of new investments and business deals in the United States, almost certainly due to Satellogic’s assessment that links to China could undermine its ability to compete for international defense and intelligence contracts. CCP Inc. can be a liability for Chinese actors seeking to engage commercially overseas. As the global space industry grows and China aims to build its position within it through further international partnerships, Chinese actors will face a delicate balancing act between navigating the risks of the CCP Inc. system and seeking to realize its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory. This issue brief argues that the West should offer an alternative path for Russia and outline a vision for a more liberal future. Doing so could have a powerful effect on Russia and add pressure on the Kremlin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is sapping the strength and resilience of Vladimir Putin’s regime. Russia’s continued military failures there, combined with high casualties and worsening economic deprivation, could put his regime at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has been more than a military debacle. The war has pulled back the curtain on the Kremlin and revealed an incompetent, corrupt, and poorly run state. It threatens to undermine Putin’s very legitimacy. The Kremlin prioritized modernizing its military for more than two decades, and despite substantial investment and presidential attention, the Russian military’s performance has been shambolic. Russia is perhaps now more isolated and less respected than at any other time during Putin’s 23-year reign. He is now asking more of the public than ever before. Desperate to salvage the situation in Ukraine, he has mobilized hundreds of thousand Russian men to replace the estimated 100,000 soldiers already killed or wounded in the war. There is now talk in Moscow of the war being existential. Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine continues to reverse Russia’s post-February 2022 territorial gains, it may make Putin’s position untenable in Moscow. The West, led by the United States, is supporting Ukraine with modern advanced Western weaponry, massive financial aid, a global diplomatic campaign to isolate Russia, and an unprecedented sanctions effort designed to strangle the Russian economy. The Western objectives in Ukraine, despite claims otherwise, are relatively straightforward: to weaken Russia, preserve Ukrainian democracy, and enable Ukraine to reclaim its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West does not have a strategy of regime change in Russia. However, if its overall efforts prove successful and Ukraine can end the conflict on its own terms, Putin’s regime could fall. A failed war, combined with economic deprivation and loss of prestige, makes regime collapse a possible outcome. While it is hard to see how Putin departs, it is also hard to see how his regime survives such a situation. But although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief assesses the potential for the war to prompt a transition of power in Russia, as well as the possible ramifications of this. It concludes, contrary to much of the prevailing view, that if Putin leaves power, it will likely be due to a reaction against the war and Putin’s hardline approach. The potential for Ukrainian military success to cause regime instability in Moscow has generated understandable nervousness among many Western governments about what could follow Putin. In fact, there is a growing assumption that what follows his reign could very well be worse. Such a pessimistic outlook might seem sober — but, as this issue brief argues, it could very well be wrong. This is because regime supporters and war hawks will, most likely, vigorously seek to keep Putin in power, prop up the regime, and stay the course. Thus, for a transition to occur there will need to be a strong demand for change. This will likely be driven by two interlocking factors: the Putin regime’s loss of legitimacy (with the public, the security services, elites, and the state) and the existence of a clear alternative to Russia’s current path. Ukraine and the West have created the conditions for the first, Putin’s loss of legitimacy. However, the West has not yet offered an alternative vision for Russia’s post-Putin future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear and more rational path for Moscow: end the war, reconcile with the West, and reverse Russia’s economic, diplomatic, and cultural isolation. However, while Russia can end the war on its own, reconciling with the West and reversing Russia’s isolation is ultimately up to the West. Thus, as this issue brief argues, building momentum for change inside Russia also requires signaling from the West that it is both open to future reengagement with a post-Putin Russia and that it believes such an alternative future is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European leaders could make clear to Russia — both the public and especially elites — that the West ultimately sees Russia as part of Europe. There is therefore a path out of Russia’s isolation after Putin departs. Europe could pledge to “welcome back” a post-Putin Russia that ends the war, respects its neighbors, releases dissidents, restores political freedoms, and seeks to positively reengage with the West. The goal would be to make it known that an alternative European future is possible for Russia should Russians seek it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this is possible or likely is a separate discussion. The West’s objective in offering a positive vision for Russia’s future is to put additional pressure on the regime by undermining the Kremlin narrative that the two are inevitable adversaries and by creating clear incentives for Russia to pursue a different course. This does not mean adopting a policy of “regime change,” something the West has rightly disavowed and has no means to implement in practice. Instead, it simply means leveraging the power the West does possess: its appeal. People, especially Europeans, want to be part of it; countries want to join it. There is no clearer example of this than Ukraine, where the government’s 2013 rejection of a closer relationship with the European Union spurred the Maidan Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling on Western leaders to talk about reintegrating Russia into Europe may seem utterly tone-deaf. Missiles continue to descend on Ukrainian cities, targeting playgrounds, pedestrian bridges, and civilian infrastructure. In the wake of Russia’s initial missile barrage on civilian infrastructure, Former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb assessed that “Russia is in the process of isolating itself from Europe for decades. . . . It did not have to be this way, but Putin decided otherwise.” The war in Ukraine has unleashed immense and justifiable anger not just toward the Kremlin but also toward the Russian public, with some prominent voices arguing that Russians are complicit through their support for Putin. There has been no mass protest or robust anti-war movement. Instead, the voices of dissent and criticism come from the far right, pushing Putin to increase the brutality. Because of this assumption that Russians are complicit, it is not surprising that when three civil society groups in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Ukrainian government criticized the Nobel Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as much as righteous indignation toward Russia — and therefore the Russian public — is understandable and warranted, applying collective guilt is ultimately a self-defeating strategy. Doing so will likely strengthen Putin and Russian hardliners inside the country who claim that the West is nurturing hatred toward the entire Russian nation. If there is no way back for Russians, no alternative to isolation, why not just persist with a hardline anti-Western path? Moreover, since Russia is not going to be occupied by a conquering power, the reality is that there will be no accountability or justice for war crimes or reparations unless Russia itself is a willing participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the West has not provided any clear incentive for the Russian people or elite to mobilize against the regime. Currently, the message the West is sending is that Russia will be treated like Germany was after World War I and will face crushing reparations. Such calls may be morally and legally justified, but they also bolster Putin by demobilizing those with anti-regime sentiment. The Russian public or members of the elite are unlikely to mobilize against the regime if it means inheriting continued economic ruin (never-ending sanctions plus reparations), continued diplomatic isolation, and (potentially) more territorial concessions. Instead, Russians are more likely to act if there is a clearly better path available and if they have confidence there will be clear benefits for Russia should they succeed. Moreover, knowing that the regime, not the West, is preventing a better future can lead to growing frustration, which in time can grow and boil over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West shifting its rhetorical approach toward Russia and offering a positive vision for a post-Putin future might have little to no impact. However, it could add an additional source of pressure on an increasingly brittle regime and potentially open the door to rebuilding relations. Such a shift has little cost but significant potential upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief first assesses the stability of the Putin regime, analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. It then sketches out potential trajectories of how Putin might depart. Finally, it outlines possible Western policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auditing-regime-stability&quot;&gt;Auditing Regime Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion over the fate of the Putin regime is highly speculative and may seem little more than an esoteric policy discussion — but it does have tangible policy implications. A pessimistic view about what comes after Putin or a presumption that his regime is stable could prompt Western leaders to advocate seeking a swift end to the war, pressuring Ukraine to negotiate prematurely, and seeking to return to a more “stable and predictable” relationship with the Kremlin. However, a view that Putin’s regime could be unstable and that a post-Putin Russia might seek to reconcile with the West results in a different policy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still unlikely, the potential for Putin’s departure from office can no longer be discounted. The adage that autocratic regimes look stable until they aren’t holds true. Indeed, if Putin were to leave power, historians would likely treat it as inevitable and engage in fierce debates over which of the multiple causes was most important. What is clear is that the regime is on increasingly shaky ground and is getting squeezed on four interrelated fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, Russia is suffering significant setbacks on the battlefield.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine now has a military advantage, benefiting from advanced Western weaponry and heightened morale. Kyiv has made remarkable gains around Kharkiv and retaken Kherson. If Ukraine continues to make significant battlefield advances and reclaim most or all the territory Russia has seized since February 2022, the war would become an unmitigated failure for Russia, amounting to a humiliating military defeat. This is especially the case for Putin, who has justified his tenure by pledging to restore Russian greatness and military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military defeat on the battlefield can easily upend a country’s social and political order and lead to a crisis of legitimacy for the government. Argentina’s military junta, for instance, stepped down just three days after it surrendered to the United Kingdom following its invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. Putin would need to shed blame and responsibility for military defeat to the military and other officials, but doing so could prompt a counterreaction from military and security officials who blame Putin and other political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian reliance on amassing forces and its tolerance for high casualties might also slowly undermine support for the war and the regime. If many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded over the winter and early spring, with newly mobilized soldiers rushed to the frontlines bearing the brunt of the losses, it could lead to significant blowback on the home front. This could create a situation in which Russia’s military, which tends to accept high casualties, could run directly counter to the interests of the regime. Moreover, mobilized forces are older. They are men often with prior service who are now in their late 20s and older and are more likely to have families and dependents than 18–27-year-old conscripts. These losses will be deeply felt socially and economically in their communities, especially among Russia’s ethnic minorities. If Russia loses ground on the battlefield while suffering high casualties among mobilized soldiers, the reaction could be explosive. Thus, a long attritional war might favor Russia on paper — but also sap support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization could endanger public support.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has built up a significant reservoir of public trust when it comes to use of the Russian military. The Russian public has seen the relatively successful deployment of force in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria. Moreover, little to no sacrifice was required of the public for these past military operations. Russians expected the “special military operation” in Ukraine to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the war has been brought home to the average Russian through the “partial mobilization.” As Leonid Volkov — Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff and chairman of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has been conducting polling inside of Russia since the war began — assessed, “Mobilization made them [the Russian public] aware of what’s actually going on. It reached out to almost every family in the country. It shocked those who believed in Putin’s ‘stability’ for decades.” Hundreds of thousands of Russian men have now been arbitrarily incorporated into the military to fight in a war that may have already resulted in more than 100,000 casualties. Additionally, partial mobilization has sent around 400,000 Russians, primarily men, fleeing their homeland. A September 2022 poll by the Levada Analytical Center showed that the majority of Russians experienced “anxiety, fear, and horror” or “anger” following the news on partial mobilization, while a growing number of citizens now consider the special military operation to be “rather” or “very” unsuccessful (31 percent in September 2022 versus 15 percent in May 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little sense among Russians of what the war is about. General support for the war may remain high, but there is also strong support for a peaceful negotiated settlement, reflecting an overarching desire to end the fighting. Kremlin messaging about the war has also shifted continuously throughout the conflict, adding to the confusion. Though the war was initially about “denazification,” now its messaging tends to focus on conflict with NATO. Indeed, the public was prohibited from even calling the special military operation a “war.” Overall support for Putin and the invasion may look stable, but public support can shift rapidly against wars of choice when sacrifices mount. For instance, when fighting erupted in Iraq in spring 2004, a year after the U.S. invasion, public opinion in the United States abruptly swung against the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the Russian economy is gradually being strangled by sanctions and export controls.&lt;/strong&gt; The announcement of massive sanctions by the United States, European Union, and others after the outbreak of the war led the value of the ruble to collapse, prompting a massive increase in interest rates. Yet the Russian economy has seemingly stabilized. The value of the ruble recovered, interest rates have been lowered, and the Russian economy is estimated to have contracted by only 3 percent in 2022. However, as Konstantin Sonin argues in Foreign Affairs, this is due to a drop in imports, which decreases the need for dollars or euros. Sanctions may not have affected the regime’s behavior, but there is substantial evidence that sanctions are effective at gradually strangling an economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, factories are closing and layoffs are mounting — and the effects will likely grow. Russia is transitioning to a fully fledged war economy, impacting the country’s ability to fulfill basic consumer needs. The mobilization of Russian men will also disrupt the labor market, as will the need to invest limited and shrinking resources to support the war effort. The downward economic spiral will only put more strain on the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Putin’s credibility as a leader is gravely damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin made a catastrophic error in invading Ukraine. As Mark Galleotti argues, “Putin-the-man may still cling to power for years, but Putin-the-legend is dead.” Never in the past had Putin appeared strategically weak or incompetent. His gross military miscalculation in Ukraine, which has taken the lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers and subjected the country’s citizens to long-term economic uncertainty, has damaged the president’s carefully crafted image as a formidable global player. Instead of restoring Russian greatness, Putin will have left Russia weak, isolated, and humiliated on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regime-stabilizing-factors&quot;&gt;Regime-Stabilizing Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Putin’s downfall is by no means inevitable. There are also several factors that contribute to continued support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the war has prompted greater repression.&lt;/strong&gt; Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has significantly increased its repression and effectively closed down independent political forums. Dissidents have been jailed, with many facing years-long imprisonment. Journalists, academics, and policy analysts have fled Russia to avoid arrest. Anti-war protesters have been given long jail sentences. Thus, there is almost no political space to mobilize against the regime, which makes fomenting popular unrest exceptionally difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization might succeed in achieving Russia’s more limited war aims: to hold the territory it currently occupies in Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin’s mobilization may blunt Ukraine’s military gains, as Russia will likely seek simply to defend the territory it controls, while Ukraine would need to go on the offensive to retake territory. The war might stagnate over the winter — and, come spring, Russia’s new wave of freshly trained mobilized forces could prevent Ukraine from advancing. A stalemate, a new frozen conflict, would work just fine for Putin by de facto eliminating Ukraine’s path to EU and NATO membership. The war would then shift out of public consciousness, and Putin would gain breathing space to better address the immediate needs of the Russian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, Russian propaganda has mobilized the country for war.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin failed to prepare the Russian public for a long, bloody campaign that requires sacrifice, even going so far as to prohibit calling the “special military operation” a “war.” However, in September, in preparation for partial mobilization, the Kremlin sought to build public support for more prolonged conflict. The Russian annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson created an opportunity to mobilize the Russian public, with Putin holding an elaborate ceremony and rally near the Kremlin to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is also now justifying the conflict by claiming it is fighting NATO. According to a special report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), an overarching narrative that the Kremlin employs domestically asserts NATO is using “Ukrainian Nazis” to “break” Russia. This is not a war against Ukraine but against a collective West that seeks to see the great Russian civilization stripped of its values, traditions, culture, and morale. As researchers at RUSI argue, “The decision to ideologically mobilize the Russian public for war with the use of increasingly radicalizing language was not a nationalistic response to events but was instead directed centrally . . . to put Russia on a war footing.” This message could resonate with some Russians, stabilize support for the war, and mitigate the Kremlin’s loss of legitimacy and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Kremlin elites are dependent on Putin.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has created a regime that centers around him, making it highly risky for insiders to seek his ouster. Thus, as the next section shows, supporters of the regime will likely push back strongly against efforts to remove him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-a-transition&quot;&gt;Assessing a Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict how Russia would transition to someone else or something new if the situation becomes untenable for Putin — yet the emerging consensus that Putin would likely be replaced by someone worse may be unfounded. An effort to replace Putin will probably emerge out of a movement to end the war, not to further it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses of what could come next tend to look at Putin’s court and examine who among his inner circle might be a potential successor. This has led to fears that Putin could be replaced by even more of a hardliner, such as Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Such analysis can lead to the conclusion that the West should favor stability in Russia and a face-saving end to the war for Putin because a humiliating defeat could give rise to a truly unhinged president (i.e., it is better to deal with the devil you know — Putin — than the devil you don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to see a dynamic forming in which Putin is replaced by a marginally more hawkish figure from within his inner circle. This is because Putin is already hawkish. This is, after all, his war, on which he is already doubling down. Under Putin’s “partial mobilization,” the military is bombing civilian targets, committing war crimes, pulverizing cities, and showing a willingness to take enormous battlefield losses. The Russian strategy being pursued is the hardline strategy. Moreover, Putin has also shown that he listens to hardliners. Those advocating taking the war to Ukrainian civilians and mobilizing the population have gotten what they wanted. Yet, for hardliners there is always more that can be done. A more depraved hawk could marginally dial up the atrocities or could move to use a nuclear weapon — but this is a road to ruin. In fact, the effort to move in a more hardline direction could prompt the elite and public to step in to stop such a leader from ascending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of Putin with a more hardline figure is not impossible, but neither does it help fellow hawks preserve the regime. Putin has a two-decade relationship with the Russian public and has built up an immense reservoir of trust. Although that reservoir is being depleted, any new hardline successor would likely come from within the regime’s inner circle and would have similar baggage. Why orchestrate a risky soft coup to just stick with the same hawkish approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if power transitions to a member of Putin’s court, the new administration will likely be short-lived due to infighting. In Egypt in 2011, Hosni Mubarak tried to end his 30-year reign by transferring power to his former intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, whom he abruptly made vice president. However, this was not sustainable, and the armed forces almost immediately assumed power until elections could be held. Any time a long-standing autocrat departs, it destabilizes the entire governing network they have built up over the course of their rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has created a regime that centers around him, a power-vertical, in which he is not just the key decisionmaker but also keeps all the nodes of power in balance. If he is removed, the system would likely be in danger of toppling. Putin himself has not figured out the conundrum of succession, either how to leave or who should succeed him. Instead, he has kept all options open while preventing the rise of any undisputed successor. The 2020 constitutional reforms, instead of bringing clarity on a transition, allowed him to stay in power for life. This is in part because of Putin’s ego; many politicians are reluctant to leave the stage. However, it is also because he cannot figure out how to leave without the system collapsing — and his legacy with it. If Putin surrendered his position at the top of the patronage network he has spent over two decades constructing, he would no longer be able to guarantee his personal safety, nor the security of his wealth. The same goes for Putin’s closest lieutenants, who rely on his legitimacy to defend their own positions within the country’s vertical power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore hard to see how the existing regime survives without Putin. Far from pushing Putin out, hardliners and regime stalwarts are probably incredibly reluctant to move against him. In fact, they will likely do everything they can to keep him in power. This is perhaps the most important factor protecting the regime from collapse. Thus, if Putin is replaced or loses power, it will likely be because the war in Ukraine goes very badly. It will be because there is a desperate need for change, not just for a new leader but for a new approach to the war that does not double down on but rather ends it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios-for-a-power-transition&quot;&gt;Scenarios for a Power Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which a change in power could occur in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the regime might become unable to govern and simply collapse.&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Treisman’s article in Foreign Affairs outlines how “a comprehensive meltdown of the regime” could come about, “as multiple challenges overwhelm its [the Kremlin’s] capacity to react and dysfunction drains confidence in Putin’s leadership.” He explains, “An overcentralized system can work tolerably in quiet times. The clear lines of command even help in minor crises. But the need for Putin to weigh in personally becomes a serious flaw when problems are complex and fast developing. The center is quickly overwhelmed, which can lead to cascading mistakes. . . . As the burden grows, so does the danger of loss of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureaucrats and functionaries in this scenario might quietly rebel by hesitating, delaying, and obfuscating. In doing so, they gradually stop propping up the regime. This is, after all, Putin’s experience in Dresden: When his KGB outpost was surrounded, he called for military reinforcements, but “Moscow was silent.” Instead of trying to curry favor with Moscow, regional governors might hedge and begin pushing back, as they are uncertain about which way the political winds are blowing and do not want to be caught on the wrong side. Perhaps governors in certain provinces might refuse to repress anti-war protests or deflect blame away from the Kremlin. As Treisman concludes, “Most of the regime’s enforcers are motivated by corruption rather than conviction, but they act out of faith that the system will survive. When that faith fades, the result is not a coup but foot-dragging, inaction, and ultimately desertion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, elites or insiders might initiate a coup.&lt;/strong&gt; The need to blame someone if the war goes badly could prompt the security services and the military, as well as oligarchs, to mobilize. However, Putin has worked hard to coup-proof his regime, and there are few informal connections between leaders of the security services’ various power centers. Treisman explains that “the obstacles to such a coup are formidable. Putin has rigged the system with numerous tripwires to prevent one. Multiple agencies watch over each other. . . . Those with armed men at their command lack the mutual trust to organize a conspiracy, and any attempt to do so would be hard to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But working in an intense crisis environment can also quickly build connections, relationships, and trust among officials. Moreover, if a person’s job and life are on the line, they may be more willing to take risks to plot or scheme. As one former Putin confidant in Moscow described “the atmosphere in the halls of power” to the New York Times, “We’re giving each other looks, but to say something is impossible.” However, as pressure builds, the risk calculation can shift as well, and discontented oligarchs with large reserves of cash could bribe or incentivize officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is also replete with coups led by resentful mid- and junior-level officers mobilizing against their inept senior officers and political leaders. Russian officers’ utter mismanagement of the war in Ukraine and the disregard for the well-being of their soldiers could trigger a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, regime stalwarts might move to replace Putin, not to end the regime but to save it.&lt;/strong&gt; A new leader could be appointed simply to try to relieve pressure on the regime. This might be someone from inside who could end the war and negotiate with the West, perhaps a technocrat — for example, from the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance — or a Western-friendly oligarch. As Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy and an economic adviser to Alexei Navalny, has remarked, “This may look as something resemblant of the environment which existed in the Soviet Union before 1985 and the arrival of Gorbachev: he started his ‘perestroika’ not out of the blue, but rather as a response to diminished public credibility of the Soviet system and visible bottom-up popular demand for change.” Alternatively, power could be transferred to a regime insider in a desperate effort to maintain continuity, as occurred in Egypt with Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, mass protests or movements might emerge.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, there appears to be little prospect of Russians mobilizing against the regime. Putin’s approval ratings remain high, dissidents have been jailed or exiled, and repression has been dialed up. However, outrage or discontent can emerge from unlikely places under an autocratic regime. In Argentina, it was the mothers of the disappeared who stood up to the military junta. What sparks a protest against an autocratic regime can sometimes come from seemingly nowhere, such the self-immolation of a fruit seller in Tunisia or the murder of a young woman arrested for allegedly not wearing a headscarf in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four scenarios for regime transition are not mutually exclusive. They can — and likely will — interact with and reinforce each other if a transition occurs. Protests can prompt elites to act and bureaucrats to stop working. A clear defeat in the war could lead to growing pressure on the regime from all quarters: elites, the public, and the security services. These pressures could become self-reinforcing, forming a vicious cycle for the Kremlin in which defections or protests in one part of society facilitate them in others, prompting individuals in power to take actions that would have been deemed unimaginable weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-policy&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments inside Russia will be decided by Russians. However, the West does have the ability to influence perceptions among elites and the public about what a post-Putin Russia might look like, which could both add to pressure on the regime and help shape the perceptions and ambitions of those who comes after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for this to occur, Russia would have to end the war in Ukraine, open up political space, and reengage the West and Ukraine productively. U.S. president Joe Biden could make clear that a post-Putin Russia that takes such steps would see sanctions and travel restrictions melt away. Russia would be welcomed back to global sporting competitions, from the World Cup to the Olympics. It might also regain its global status, rejoin the Group of Seven, and restart the U.S.-Russian security dialogue aimed at building trust and putting limits on conventional and nuclear forces. Biden and European leaders could even float a longer-term possibility of Russia joining the European Union and NATO — which has an open-door policy in which any country can join if all allies agree, meaning membership is potentially open to Russia, too. While this may sound fanciful and utterly implausible, there is little reason not to leave open the possibility. The strength of the West’s message comes from the fact that this is obviously a better course than doubling down on a hopeless, endless war for imperial aggrandizement that has resulted in huge human losses, economic strangulation, and international pariah status for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Kremlin has found the notion that Russia is inevitably at odds with the West useful in justifying its isolation from Europe. Putin has even attempted to construct a “Eurasian” identity for Russia, with which he has sought to contrast the increasing liberalism of the West with Russia’s traditional conservatism, such as on LGBTQ+ issues. The Kremlin’s rhetoric and propaganda has shifted perceptions; as a 2021 Levada poll found, fewer Russians think of Russia as a European country than did in 2019 or 2008. Yet Russia is a European country in that it has historically been oriented westward and been a pivotal player in European affairs. The pre-Soviet tsars were heavily orientated toward Europe, and even during the Soviet and Putin eras, Russia’s major geopolitical, economic, and culture focus has been toward Europe. In other words, Putin’s efforts to construct a Eurasian identity naturally at odds with Europe rest on shaky ground — though his narrative has been bolstered by current tensions with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future. While getting such a message to penetrate Russian society and override state propaganda is difficult, it is not impossible. Messages and narratives can and do find a way to reach Russian elites and the highly connected public. Since the partial mobilization in September, the broader Russian public is also now seeking more credible information about the war in Ukraine. Biden and European leaders could give high-profile addresses and interviews on notable outlets run by Russian expatriates, such as Meduza, TV Rain, the Moscow Times, and iStories. The Biden administration could engage the growing Russian expatriate community and empower its efforts to broadcast accurate information about the war to the Russian public. Latvia’s recent suspension of TV Rain was in this sense self-defeating. Instead of stifling these outlets, the West should be supporting and encouraging them, as they are the most effective vehicle for reaching the Russian public. The West should also be engaging Russians online, including on platforms such as Telegram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing possible futures for a post-Putin Russia could create another avenue of pressure on the Kremlin. Although such a messaging effort may have little to no impact, the cost of promoting a new narrative is virtually nothing. Meanwhile, it could have several beneficial effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it could increase public frustration with the Putin regime.&lt;/strong&gt; The West could try to make clear that Putin is the one preventing Russia from having a European future. This — combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation — might contribute to some Russians believing change is possible and help trigger popular unrest. To be clear, a new message from the West or speech from a U.S. president is not going to trigger popular unrest in Russia. But the belief that another path is possible for Russia, combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation, might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, it could undermine Putin’s war narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; Making clear to Russians that the West’s issue is with Putin and not with the average Russian also helps undercut Putin’s desperate effort to mobilize public support for the war. Putin needs to make up for lost time since he had deliberately sought to demobilize the Russian public at first by describing the war in Ukraine as a “special military operation.” In doing so, he was signaling that this was a limited, technical mission the public did not need to worry about. He even initially cracked down on anyone who dared call it a “war.” The Kremlin has not prepared the public for sacrifice or a prolonged conflict. With the war going badly, the enemy now has to be cast as more than just Ukraine — because “mighty” Russia cannot be getting ground down by “puny” Ukraine. The narrative has thus shifted to it being a fight against the West, which is out to destroy Russia. However, a message of possible Western-Russian reconciliation post-Putin would directly undercut the regime’s broader narrative of eternal struggle with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, it could mobilize those upset with the direction Putin has taken.&lt;/strong&gt; It might help shift the calculation of elites, especially as pressure builds on the regime. Instead of sitting on their hands, elites might begin to take risks and seek out like-minded figures. Additionally, if regime collapse causes a sudden power vacuum and there is competition for power, a new leader or faction could gain support by arguing they can get sanctions removed by ending the war and improving relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, it could help nudge the aftermath of regime collapse in a positive direction.&lt;/strong&gt; Laying out a Western or European vision for Russia’s future now could mitigate paranoia about the West’s intentions within Russia if the regime collapses. The West could highlight that it does not seek the country’s breakup or the destruction of the state — especially given its tremendous concerns about the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, the potential for renewed ethno-national violence, and the threat of successionist movements as a result of a geopolitical vacuum. Acknowledging that the West would be eager to reengage post-Putin Russia happens to both be entirely accurate and may reassure future Russian leaders, political operators, and influencers that they do not have to fear renewed engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path toward any potential partnership or reincorporation will entail a careful confidence-building dance in which each side, deeply skeptical of the other, gradually grows to trust the other’s intentions. This process broke down in the post–Cold War period, especially during Putin’s rise to and consolidation of power. Many nations, especially Russia’s neighbors, will be deeply skeptical of its potential rehabilitation and favor an uncompromising policy that weakens Russia or furthers its disintegration. While this skepticism may be warranted, the main U.S. objective in a post-Putin Russia would be to transform it from an anti-Western, revisionist actor into one that — even if not entirely Western-aligned — at least does not threaten its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, engaging in the rhetoric of reconciliation does not mean softening sanctions, slowing military assistance to Ukraine, or delaying pursuit of war criminals. On the contrary, the regime, the elite, and the Russian public should know that the present path is a road to economic ruin, global pariah status, and military collapse — though such rhetoric should avoid stereotyping or characterizing Russians as irredeemable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics might describe the discussion of a post Putin-Russia as the United States shifting to a policy of “regime change.” However, there is no point to pursuing regime change because the United States does not have the means to execute such a policy short of direct military intervention, which is unthinkable in the Russian context. Contrary to Putin’s vehement claims, the United States cannot cause “color revolutions.” All it and Europe can do is offer potential inclusion in the West should a country go down a democratic path. But that may be the biggest incentive of all; Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan Revolution, for instance, happened when people took to the streets to demand a European future. Since the Biden administration’s goal is to put pressure on the Putin regime, it is a logical extension to put ideological pressure on the Kremlin as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others might claim that talk of reincorporating Russia could let it off the hook for its crimes, arguing that Russia needs accountability for its actions. The problem with this argument is that bringing war criminals to trial and collecting potential reparations requires Russia’s willing participation, which will likely depend on Russia seeing a path or trajectory for cooperation with and inclusion in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-a-liberal-democratic-russia-possible&quot;&gt;Is a Liberal Democratic Russia Possible?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is good reason to doubt the potential for a liberal democratic Russia that is not hostile to the West. Putin is in many ways a reflection of the Russian public. He is popular in no small measure because hardline nationalism is popular within Russia, while democracy remains badly stained by the political chaos and economic collapse of the 1990s, which led to the development of crony capitalism instead of a strong and vibrant market economy. Much of the Russian public has also been fed anti-Western propaganda for most of the past century. Thus, any new leader or regime might revert to a hardline nationalist posture in order to maintain public support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia might not be able to survive as a state without autocratic rule, as its multiethnic polity built through imperial conquest could fall apart without Moscow wielding uncompromising authority. Even if Russian leaders seek a democratic future, the country could still unravel. Russia could descend back into the lawless chaos of the 1990s, when mafia groups, armed oligarchs, and separatist movements took advantage of the weakened state. This is undoubtedly a concern, but Russia today is very different. In the early 1990s, it faced a difficult transition from a command economy to a free-market one, and the resulting economic collapse severely weakened Russian state capacity. By contrast, a move away from Putin could bring tremendous economic benefits. A new, more liberal regime in Moscow would not face the same struggles as in the 1990s. Moreover, though there is a real potential for a new wave of secessionist movements, it is counterbalanced by broader Russian patriotism, identity, and attachment to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds are slim that Russia will choose a liberal, democratic, pro-Western path — even if the public were free to do so — but neither is it impossible. Although creating a multiethnic representative democracy in Russia, a country with a near-continuous autocratic history, seems far-fetched, similar things were said about Germany after World War II. Europe, a continent almost always at war throughout its history, came together in a federal union. While Russian NATO or EU membership currently seems implausible, the West should at least be open to the potential possibility, however slim or distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has exposed the folly of the West’s excessive optimism about the “end of history” after the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly the vision that economic engagement would inevitably lead to democratic change. But that vision, while simplistic, was not contrived out of thin air. It was borne out of lessons of the post–World War II and the post–Cold War European experience. The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy. Part of the West’s strength is the belief that, on balance, systems in which people are free to select their leaders will do a better job overall than other forms of government. The West should not forget the inherent appeal of its free democratic system, which so worries autocrats because it inspires revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the skeptics are right, which they may be, that Russia would never be incorporated into the West and is doomed to have an autocratic future, Western leaders should still convey an integrationist message to add pressure on the Putin regime and undermine its narrative about the war in Ukraine. Demonstrating that an alternative future is possible will likely do more to undermine Putin than any performative condemnations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the future of Russia will be determined by Russians, not by the West. However, it costs nothing to let Russians know that, if they pursue democracy, the West will embrace them. Such action might affect how Russians think about the Putin regime and their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as rhetoric of retribution may feel justified, just as it did toward Germany after World Wars I and II, the smarter path focused on rehabilitation and integration. The West did not offer this out of generosity but because of geopolitical competition with the Soviet Union. Similarly, encouraging and incentivizing a post-Putin Russia to drop its anti-Western outlook and its malign revisionist approach to the international order would have profound geopolitical implications for the United States vis-à-vis China, European security, and the liberal world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the Soviet Union collapsed not when Reagan or the West had an iron fist but when they had an outstretched arm. The Green Movement in Iran erupted not when the United States was threatening to bomb the country but after a newly inaugurated President Obama addressed the Iranian people in a Nowruz message, offering a “new beginning” that became impossible when, three months later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reelected president under dubious circumstances. Correlation does not equal causation, but there is never one factor that causes revolution. Offering a segment of society hope for a better, more liberal future can have a powerful effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula. It has reminded South Korea of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance as a buffer against hostility from outside powers, while also intensifying concerns about South Korea’s vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea. For North Korea, the war in Ukraine seems to have amplified the importance of nuclear weapons for its security while prompting Pyongyang to consider a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine as well as the operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons — imitating Putin’s tactics in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has also produced a favorable external environment for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent reentry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to reexamine traditional approaches to the North Korea nuclear issue and devise ways to increase the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on North Korea and regional issues align closely with those of the Biden administration, presents opportunities for the alliance to pursue new initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report presents actionable recommendations for navigating North Korea policy and strengthening U.S. extended deterrence during these uncertain times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-north-korea&quot;&gt;ON NORTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals explicated in recent speeches. Nonetheless, the allies should map out policies that prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization that include interim steps to reduce threat levels and build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy and continued readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To strengthen deterrence and defense:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Resume &lt;strong&gt;joint military exercises&lt;/strong&gt; that had been suspended or downgraded in previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support South Korea’s military improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, including the Kill Chain, early deployment of Iron Dome, directed energy possibilities, upgraded ship-based defenses, and an additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery — moving South Korea to the top of the list for its purchase, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand &lt;strong&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation&lt;/strong&gt; to strengthen reconnaissance capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do not, under current circumstances, deploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a &lt;strong&gt;broad counter-missile strategy&lt;/strong&gt; that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems that would help overcome the limitations of current systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase &lt;strong&gt;trilateral defense coordination&lt;/strong&gt; among the United States, South Korea, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lead efforts, together with Japan, to &lt;strong&gt;enforce existing North Korea sanctions&lt;/strong&gt;, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be ready to offer &lt;strong&gt;sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps&lt;/strong&gt; on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia if they do not comply with UN Security Council Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to improve conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appoint a U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;ON U.S. EXTENDED DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression, and to prevent nuclear proliferation. The commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — referring to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;framework for joint nuclear planning&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) planning group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Streamline protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplement U.S. extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a &lt;strong&gt;track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange&lt;/strong&gt; in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve U.S. national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating plans to deploy interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore funds for and continue pursuing the U.S. nuclear sea-launched cruise missile program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons at some point in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider allied tabletop planning exercises that would be explicitly pre-decisional and leave the timeline and scope of weapons deliberately ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calibrate decisionmaking to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reorienting-the-alliance-in-a-shifting-global-landscape&quot;&gt;Reorienting the Alliance in a Shifting Global Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is experiencing a number of tectonic shifts that present new challenges for the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance and reinforce its importance as a basis for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic have roiled international commercial markets and raised new questions about supply chain resilience, prompting major industries to consider fundamental changes to future plans. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s increasingly active management of China’s economy is creating new geopolitical risks for international businesses. And tightening relations between China and Russia — solidified with Xi and Vladimir Putin’s declaration at the Beijing Olympics of a partnership with “no limits” — point to a global geopolitical realignment that will be reinforced by economic trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, following Russia’s unprovoked invasion on February 24, has monumentally impacted world politics and Asia. The war has made Russia weaker militarily and economically (due to the impact of unprecedented sanctions) but also more dangerous, as a declining power willing to take on more risks. China’s support for Russia has diminished its soft power as a defender of sovereignty and territorial integrity while increasing its vulnerability to secondary sanctions it cannot afford due to its own mounting economic problems. And the United States is now focused on Europe and needs to recalibrate its global strategy even as China remains its pacing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world becomes more bifurcated between authoritarian and democratic powers, the war in Ukraine has several implications for the United States and its allies: a shifting balance of power due to Russia’s decline; complication of Xi’s designs on Taiwan given Moscow’s multiple failures and heavy sanctions; greater U.S. and Japanese attention to reinforcing deterrence in the Taiwan Strait; greater cohesion among democratic countries; heightened unity of purpose and appreciation for the liberal international order as a foundation for global peace and stability; and the undermining of the Xi-Putin narrative that the future lies with China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months. Since this group last met in early 2021, the U.S.-ROK alliance has made significant progress in tackling some of the headwinds that have previously held the relationship back from its full potential. During the early months of the Biden administration, contentious issues such as negotiations over the Special Measures Agreement were resolved, paving the way for a successful summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Moon Jae-in in May 2021 and the release of a comprehensive U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement that advocated for deeper cooperation across several dimensions of the relationship. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on Japan, North Korea, China, and Indo-Pacific strategy align closely with Washington, will enhance the alliance’s effectiveness in dealing with the region’s most pressing challenges. The successful first summit of the two leaders in May 2022 laid out an ambitious agenda for Washington and Seoul as President Yoon seeks to build South Korea’s role as a global player and supporter of the rules-based international order. Channeling these shared perspectives into concrete initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region during a period of compounding uncertainties will be the central challenge for the alliance in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-the-korean-peninsula&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for the Korean Peninsula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its broader global and regional implications, the war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula, with varied takeaways for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For South Korea, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a strong response at the societal level — with individuals and civic groups rallying to support Ukraine and condemn Russia’s actions — as well as a strengthened appreciation for the importance of liberal values in a country’s foreign policy to promote stability and security. The war has also reminded South Koreans of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, grounded in shared values as well as security guarantees that decrease the chances that South Korea will find itself in Ukraine’s situation. For alliance managers in Seoul and Washington, the war in Ukraine has validated the importance of focusing on military readiness before a threat is realized, rather than after. All of these effects should help to fortify the U.S.-ROK alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine has intensified concerns among South Koreans about their vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea, particularly given the possibility that new leadership in the United States in the coming years might, again, consider U.S. troop withdrawals as the Trump administration did. While the Yoon government will manage this concern through strengthening extended deterrence with the United States and trilateral coordination with the United States and Japan, policy discussions within South Korea are likely to continue to feature a range of suggestions to reduce South Korea’s vulnerability, such as the rotation of dual-use strategic assets, redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, and introduction of a nuclear sharing plan on the peninsula in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine seems to have underscored for North Korea the importance of nuclear weapons for its security. Whether this is the correct conclusion or not, the regime reiterated its nuclear ambitions in April 2022, thereby decreasing prospects for denuclearization. North Korea drew a similar lesson from the Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan cases. Again, whether correct or not, North Korean officials stated with conviction during the Six Party Talks in 2006 that the United States would not have attacked a nuclear-armed Iraq or Afghanistan (implying the same for a nuclear-armed North Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also noted Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons to deter NATO’s intervention in Ukraine. At a military parade on April 25, Kim Jong-un noted that “our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent” and suggested that he would consider the pre-emptive use of these weapons to deter threats from outside forces or to gain superiority in a conventional conflict. These statements seemed to reveal a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine for Pyongyang in which the threat of nuclear weapons could be used to deter the United States from intervening in any armed conflict on the Korean peninsula, mirroring Putin’s moves in Ukraine. The possibility of North Korea’s development and operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, in particular, has heightened concerns among South Koreans regarding the reliability of U.S. extended deterrence and amplified calls for the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final implication of the war in Ukraine for Korea is the favorable external environment it has produced for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. Previously, Beijing and Moscow were willing to join forces with the United States and its allies to punish North Korea following its provocations, even as they helped North Korea evade sanctions. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, however, Beijing and Moscow have refused to enforce existing sanctions and vetoed any further actions against North Korea in the UN Security Council. Given this situation, additional nuclear tests by North Korea would be unlikely to prompt a serious reaction from China and Russia. This marks a critical juncture in regional dynamics — with Beijing and Moscow now viewing Pyongyang’s provocations more as a means to gain advantages over Washington than a concerning threat to regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to (1) reexamine traditional approaches to the nuclear issue in the diplomatic and military realms and (2) devise ways to enhance the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in order to reduce South Korea’s (and Japan’s) sense of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-koreas-actions-and-objectives&quot;&gt;North Korea’s Actions and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang was relatively quiet during the first year of the Biden administration. This could be a result of severe internal difficulties due to its strict Covid-19 lockdown and ongoing economic challenges or because it wanted to find out if the Biden administration might consider lifting the sanctions that Pyongyang had aimed to negotiate an end to during the failed 2019 Hanoi summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2022, however, North Korea has embarked on an extensive missile testing campaign, conducting missile launches on 22 separate occasions, ranging from short-range hypersonic missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These tests have helped North Korea make significant advances toward its aim of achieving a reliable capability to penetrate U.S. missile defenses and strike the U.S. homeland. Pyongyang could then use this capability to deter a U.S. attack on North Korea while generating doubts among U.S. allies in the region that Washington would put one of its own cities at risk by responding to a North Korean attack on an ally. North Korea also likely aspires to employ tactical nuclear weapons as an asymmetric capability to fundamentally change the balance of power on the Korean peninsula in its favor, enabling Pyongyang to dictate the terms of interaction with South Korea in the economic, security, and political spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un laid out his weapons development objectives in unusual detail in his January 2021 remarks at the Eighth Party Congress of the Workers Party of Korea (see Box 1). At the April 25 military parade, Kim reiterated his determination to improve the country’s nuclear capabilities “in terms of both quality and scale.” His ultimate goal is to achieve credible, albeit rudimentary capabilities to build three legs of a potential nuclear triad, as well as a tactical nuclear weapons capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Excerpts from Summary of Kim Jong-un’s Remarks on Weapons Development during the January 2021 Eighth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recalling that the Party Central Committee decided to develop a global strike rocket with more powerful warheads and an improved warhead control system and carried out this historic task by relying on the patriotism and loyalty of national defence scientists, the report affirmed that the new-type gigantic rocket on an 11-axis self-propelled launcher displayed during the military parade in celebration of the 75th founding anniversary of the Party fully demonstrated the ultra-modernity and great striking capability of our nuclear force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The national defence science sector developed the super-large MLRS, a super-power attack weapon the world’s weaponry field had never known, and proceeded to develop ultra-modern tactical nuclear weapons including new-type tactical rockets and intermediate-range cruise missiles whose conventional warheads are the most powerful in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also noted that in the period under review the sector of national defence scientific research was conducting research into perfecting the guidance technology for [a] multi-warhead rocket at the final stage, finished research into developing warheads of different combat missions including the hypersonic gliding flight warheads for new-type ballistic rockets and was making preparations for their test manufacture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report made public with pride that the standard of the goal in the modernization of medium-sized submarine was set correctly and it was remodeled experimentally to open up a bright prospect for remarkably enhancing the existing subsurface operational capabilities of our navy, that the design of new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination and the designing of various electronic weapons, unmanned striking equipment, means of reconnaissance and detection and military reconnaissance satellite were completed, and that other achievements were made in national defence research of gigantic significance in developing the People’s Army into a powerful one with the strongest military muscle in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is necessary to develop the nuclear technology to a higher level and make nuclear weapons smaller and lighter for more tactical uses. This will make it possible to develop tactical nuclear weapons to be used as various means according to the purposes of operational duty and targets of strike in modern warfare, and continuously push ahead with the production of super-sized nuclear warheads.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also set a goal of attaining an advanced capability for making a preemptive and retaliatory nuclear strike by further raising the rate of precision good enough to strike and annihilate any strategic targets within a range of 15,000 kilometres with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;And the tasks were brought up to develop and introduce hypersonic gliding flight warheads in a short period, push ahead with the development of solid-fuel engine-propelled inter- continental underwater and ground ballistic rockets as scheduled, and possess a nuclear- powered submarine and an underwater-launch nuclear strategic weapon which will be of great importance in raising the long-range nuclear striking capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also referred to the need to secure the ability of reconnaissance and information gathering based on operation of a military reconnaissance satellite in the near future, and conduct in real earnest the most important research to develop reconnaissance drones and other means of reconnaissance capable of precisely reconnoitering up to 500 km deep into the front.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Making the military equipment intelligent, precise, unmanned, high-performance and light should be set as the priority target of the munitions industry, and research and development be oriented to this end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean behavior and rhetoric suggest that missile and nuclear tests will continue in the coming weeks and months. Externally, as noted above, North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations. China and Russia are also as amenable as ever to facilitating North Korea’s evasion of sanctions so that Pyongyang can acquire necessary components for its weapons programs. The intensification of U.S.-China competition also benefits North Korea, as China is more willing to support North Korea, regardless of its behavior, in order to secure Pyongyang’s allegiance against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, North Korea is dealing with a deepening economic crisis and poor health conditions, made more severe by the outbreak of Covid-19. These hardships also incentivize continued testing because displays of military prowess can help the regime boost loyalty and morale among the population during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, North Korea’s continued military provocations serve to increase the possibility of drawing the newly elected Yoon administration and the alliance into a crisis that could lead to sanctions relief or other concessions desired by North Korea. Even absent a crisis, continued testing will increase North Korea’s potential bargaining leverage for an eventual return to diplomacy. Most experts agree that Pyongyang is not likely to return to diplomacy anytime soon. However, after North Korea is satisfied with its capability advancements, it may attempt to negotiate a testing moratorium in exchange for sanctions relief. Ending sanctions likely remains the top aim for Pyongyang. Among other things, it would relieve pressure on the regime following its ill-fated efforts to rebuild the economy through a path of “self-reliance,” which remains unlikely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific capabilities to watch for in upcoming tests include continued nuclear testing (perhaps of a smaller, lighter weapon that could fit on top of a missile); multiple independent reentry vehicles (key to frustrating the missile defense systems of opponents); additional tests of submarine-launched ballistic missiles; and development of air-launched cruise missiles (an additional leg of a potential North Korean triad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-core-strategic-principles-to-guide-north-korea-policy&quot;&gt;Building Core Strategic Principles to Guide North Korea Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike President Biden’s China strategy, as elucidated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on May 26, 2022, the administration has not provided a full public explication of its North Korea strategy. The classified policy review by the government completed in spring 2021 has not yet been presented in a speech or document. Nevertheless, some of the core tenets of the policy can be gleaned from statements by administration officials. First, the United States seeks complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Second, the basis of any policy is a position of strength based on enhanced military readiness and improved defense and deterrence capabilities. Third, the United States is not opposed to diplomacy; on the contrary, it is willing to engage “any time, any place, anywhere” with North Korea, without preconditions. The focus of diplomacy is not an “everything for everything” deal of the type sought by former president Donald Trump, though the United States is willing to pick up the themes laid out in the first Trump-Kim summit and the Singapore Declaration of 2018 (i.e., denuclearization, peace regime, normalization of political relations, and return of prisoners of war/missing in action [POW/MIA] remains). The administration is not continuing the “strategic patience” policies of non-dialogue during the Obama years. Instead, officials describe their policy as a pragmatic, calibrated approach based on substantive negotiations aimed at denuclearization. The current state of non-dialogue in the negotiations, resembling the Obama years, is not for lack of U.S. efforts but stems from the absence of interest from North Korea (reportedly, nearly 20 attempts have been made by the Biden administration). Fourth, Biden has not ruled out a meeting with the North Korean leader provided that it would cap a serious and substantive negotiation and deliverable. Fifth, the United States is open to humanitarian assistance that would help North Koreans, and this assistance would not be tied to progress on denuclearization. Sixth, the United States supports Japan’s desire for a satisfactory resolution of the abduction issue and a return to the Pyongyang Declaration of September 17, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assumed office only in May 2022, the newly elected Yoon administration outlined its “audacious” plan (담대한 구상/damdaehan gusang) for denuclearization in August 2022. First, the goal is the complete and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. Second, South Korea seeks stronger military readiness with the United States and a bolstering of extended deterrence capabilities. Third, in achieving denuclearization, the government will undertake a “principled” approach that involves employing pressure for denuclearization and nonproliferation, as well as sanctions for human rights abuses in North Korea, but also offering North Korea economic benefits and political normalization. Related to the latter point, the fourth tenet is that South Korea supports a peace regime, but only as the exit point to diplomacy, not the entry point. Fifth, South Korea supports humanitarian engagement and a “green” détente in inter-Korean environment and ecology issues, separate from denuclearization negotiations. This includes the provision of food and medicine in return for minerals purchases, as well as support for transportation and energy infrastructure development in North Korea, with a firm commitment from Pyongyang to denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though offered in different frames, the Biden and Yoon approaches to North Korea share many similarities — more than between Biden and the previous South Korean government — in terms of the core goals of denuclearization, sanctions pressure, and bolstered defense and deterrence capabilities. At the May 2022 summit meeting, the two leaders demonstrated the overlap in their policies. As President Yoon noted in his opening remarks at the joint press conference following the summit meeting, “We, as the leaders of the two countries, reiterated our common goal of the complete denuclearization of the DPRK. There is no compromise for security. Under this shared belief, we concurred that strong deterrence against North Korea is paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s disinterest in engagement should not discourage allied action. Whether diplomacy returns tomorrow or one year from now, the allies should internalize key strategic principles and map out policies going forward. With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-north-korea&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on North Korea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-principles&quot;&gt;Strategic Principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following strategic principles should guide allied policies with respect to North Korea. Agreement on and internalization of these principles will ensure that, amid the coming unexpected twists and turns of diplomacy, crises, and even conflict, the two allies will remain focused on key common goals and preservation of a strong, united alliance. Straying from these principles for short-term gains is not in the mutual interests of Seoul and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate policy objective is to achieve complete and irreversible denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While there may be interim steps along the way, the two allies should work toward this final goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There should be no surprises between the allies.&lt;/strong&gt; The temptation to engage in and attain marginal benefits from secret bilateral negotiations with North Korea (part of Pyongyang’s tactics to split the U.S.-ROK alliance) should be weighed against the damage done to trust in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither ally should be willing to trade away alliance equities (e.g., cessation of military exercises) for short-term steps by North Korea. Strong U.S.-Korea-Japan trilateral policy coordination is an integral part of defense and deterrence capabilities. The allies should devise a range of actions to maintain the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence under shifting conditions (detailed further in the following section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support inter-Korean engagement that is accomplished in conjunction with steps on denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While South Korea should have some leeway to pursue engagement with North Korea, both allies must internalize that there will be no true peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula without the removal of the nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support humanitarian assistance and improved human rights in North Korea separate from denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; Such assistance, monitored by the international community, helps improve the human condition and conveys compassion and non-hostile intent on the part of the United States to the North Korean people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Korean nuclear threat is a regional and global security problem.&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States and South Korea are key interlocutors, the nuclear threat engages the interests of all actors in the region, as well as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations. The allies should seek to engage new partners in the region and beyond who have the means and will to increase pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is a critical player on denuclearization, but the United States and South Korea should not depend on Beijing’s cooperation or cave to Chinese pressure tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; Given that China’s interests with respect to North Korea have increasingly diverged from those of the United States and South Korea, Chinese pushback should be anticipated and Beijing should not be expected to act with regard to anything but short-term self-interest and transactional politics. Allied actions to strengthen deterrence vis-à-vis North Korea will complicate China’s regional ambitions, potentially prompting Beijing to reconsider its permissive attitude toward Pyongyang’s provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-north-korea-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC NORTH KOREA POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals, the United States and South Korea should pursue policies along three tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance defense and deterrence capabilities and sanctions enforcement to both protect against North Korea’s growing threats and negotiate from a position of strength, if and when Pyongyang returns to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In pursuit of the goal of denuclearization, parties should consider interim steps that reduce the threat and build confidence among distrustful counterparts in the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These interim steps could start with a missile (including long- and short-range options) and nuclear weapons test ban in return for partial sanctions lifting (with snapback clauses) and interim energy provision.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While reaching an agreement on a test ban will not be easy, this interim goal is more achievable than other possible measures, such as a freeze on fissile material production that would require North Korean cooperation for verification.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a testing freeze is achieved, a separate but parallel political dialogue channel should be opened to address issues outside of the denuclearization negotiation, including mutual threat reduction, political normalization, the return of POW/MIA remains, and a peace regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The denuclearization channel should focus on next steps after the freeze, including the phased, verified shutdown and eventual disablement and dismantlement of key fissile material and nuclear weapons production facilities. This would be followed by declaration of fissile material and warheads in preparation for disablement, dismantlement, and removal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A separate negotiation should be instituted that focuses on missile technology control and inspection of undeclared North Korean missile bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider a Nunn-Lugar-type program for scientific talent in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should require China to carry its fair share of the costs associated with any energy assistance incorporated in a shutdown of North Korea’s programs and facilities, ensuring that China’s financial and reputational well-being are at stake with any North Korean noncompliance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should appoint a full-time special representative for North Korea. Even in the absence of negotiations, the envoy could work to coordinate potential roadmaps for North Korea’s denuclearization among key stakeholders in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should continue to express a willingness to engage with North Korea. This could involve sending joint communications from senior envoys indicating a readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen defense and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should resume joint military exercises to enhance military readiness. These have been suspended or downgraded as part of previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider expansion of the scope and nature of exercises, particularly those elements that improve the extended deterrence commitment for dealing with a nuclear North Korea. These improvements need not be publicized.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should not trade a cessation of military exercises for a reversible test ban by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support South Korea’s military improvements, including the “Kill Chain,” early deployment of Iron Dome, an additional Korean Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, directed energy possibilities, and upgraded ship-based defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should include South Korea in its efforts to develop an “all-in-one” sensor that would integrate listening, communicating, jamming, and injecting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should move South Korea to the top of the list for purchase of a THAAD battery, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also consider potentially allowing South Korea to station some of its assets on U.S. bases, such as allowing South Korea to acquire and deploy dual-capable fighters in Guam, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should update their wartime operation plans, establishing new military directives to incorporate broader conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation should be expanded in order to enhance reconnaissance capabilities to detect and deter North Korean threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should not under current circumstances redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea (the latter comports with the policy of the allied government).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Support for these policy options within South Korea is driven, in part, by doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. This can be addressed through alternative policy initiatives that avoid the downsides of these options (detailed in the following section).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance counter-missile strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop a broad counter-missile strategy that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an element of this strategy, the allies should strengthen missile defense coordination. This is essential given North Korea’s advances in its missile defense evasion capabilities and the legacy technologies that the United States currently relies on to counter the North Korean ICBM threat to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should work to harden potential targets of North Korean missile strikes in South Korea, including critical infrastructure and other facilities in the greater Seoul metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should also investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems, in their nascent phases, which would help to overcome the limitations of current U.S. missile defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase trilateral defense cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three allies should consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter a nuclear North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises to develop and demonstrate combined capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The three countries’ recent agreement to resume joint missile early warning exercises, which could include the interception of a dummy North Korean missile, is a step in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve transparency, South Korea and Japan should engage in trilateral briefings about their respective defense improvement plans as well as developments related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea, together with Japan, should lead efforts to enforce existing sanctions on North Korea, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers by North Korea and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should be ready to offer sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea must step up pressures on China and Russia to enforce UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) sanctions against North Korea, including trigger clauses in those resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should China and Russia not comply with UNSCRs, the United States should expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase support for humanitarian assistance and human rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to help improve the conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Covid-19 vaccines, cold-chain storage, personal protective equipment, and test kits are necessary to mitigate the current spread of Covid-19 inside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The border lockdown, which has been in place for 33 months, has generated the need for additional assistance in food and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support the South Korean government’s proposal for a “green détente” dialogue with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must appoint a special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should jointly advocate for North Korean human rights by co-sponsoring North Korean human rights resolutions in the United Nations and taking every available opportunity to speak up on this issue there and at other fora.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The two governments should also support NGO initiatives to increase the North Korean population’s access to outside information and enforce the implementation of existing human rights-related sanctions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on U.S. Extended Deterrence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-present-and-future-of-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Present and Future of Extended Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea refers to Washington’s pledge to devote the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter and, if necessary, defeat an external attack on South Korea. It involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression in all of its forms, and to prevent nuclear proliferation by providing South Korea with an alternative to developing its own nuclear weapons to meet its security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Acquiring and demonstrating the military capabilities the United States needs to protect South Korea from North Korean threats is critical but insufficient. For extended deterrence to be effective, North and South Korea must also believe that the United States is willing to use these capabilities to defend its allies — even if it means risking Washington, D.C., or New York to save Seoul or Tokyo. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent re-entry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in recent years.&lt;/strong&gt; In general, doubts regarding the credibility of extended deterrence can be expected to grow whenever North Korea’s capability or will to attack South Korea or the U.S. homeland exceeds the United States’ (actual or perceived) capability or will to defend South Korea from an external attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future developments could further heighten doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, if a &lt;strong&gt;new U.S. administration&lt;/strong&gt; comes to power &lt;strong&gt;that does not place alliances at the center of its regional strategy&lt;/strong&gt; (similar to the Trump administration’s approach in questioning the need for U.S. troops in South Korea) &lt;strong&gt;or returns to a policy of strategic patience&lt;/strong&gt;, questions about the will of the United States to uphold its extended deterrence commitments will proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s growing military capabilities also loom in the background of this picture.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s military modernization efforts in recent decades have been a focus of U.S. regional policy writ large but not a target for U.S.-ROK deterrence policies on the Korean peninsula. This is because the perceived risk of China using its military to either invade South Korea directly or support a second North Korean invasion has been deemed to be low since the end of the Korean War. After all, an outbreak of militarized hostilities on the peninsula would significantly increase the chances of two destabilizing developments that Beijing seeks to avoid: U.S. troops mobilizing near the North Korea–China border and a severe humanitarian crisis on its doorstep. Even considering China’s increasingly unhelpful behavior with respect to North Korea since the start of the war in Ukraine, these general assumptions regarding China’s aversion to militarized hostilities on the Korean peninsula remain sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this could change if China perceived that renewed conflict on the peninsula had a good chance of severing, rather than unifying, the alliance. This would decrease the likelihood of U.S. troops on its border and open new possibilities for China to increase its influence on the peninsula. These types of hypothetical scenarios are on the minds of South Koreans as they consider the possibility that future U.S. administrations could downgrade the importance of alliances, thereby increasing the chance that South Korea will be left to fend for itself against North Korea and China. The relevance of Chinese military capabilities for South Korea’s security has also increased in recent years in light of Beijing’s increasing tendency to view Seoul’s defensive postures vis-à-vis North Korea as directed at China, showcased in its actions to punish South Korea for the THAAD battery deployment in 2017. There is a strong possibility that Beijing will use similar logic to argue that any future U.S. moves to improve U.S. national missile defenses against North Korea are actually efforts to deter China, thereby injecting broader concerns about strategic stability into the picture. These scenarios — both hypothetical and real — point to the need to factor the evolving significance of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula into discussions about the future of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-principles-1&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be guided by an acknowledgement of its dual purpose (deterrence and nonproliferation) and nature (physical and psychological), as well as a firm understanding of the conditions that have caused, or are likely to cause, South Koreans or others to question its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives. After all, the issue that has perhaps the highest potential to divide the allies in the coming months — whether to redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula — is driven more by psychological than by physical factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that policies designed to enhance credibility respond directly to the specific factors undermining credibility at that time and do not create new military dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New extended deterrence policies should not lose sight of the fact that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” is and will remain at the heart of U.S. security commitments to South Korea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “community of fate” refers to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically, ensuring that North Korea cannot use nuclear weapons or attack South Korea conventionally without killing Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This community of fate links events on the ground to the U.S. nuclear umbrella and makes it credible, thereby forming the core of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything the allies do to enhance extended deterrence should aim to build on the community of fate, not displace it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-extended-deterrence-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC EXTENDED DETERRENCE POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be pursued along six general tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joint planning and execution;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trilateral discussions and operations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. military adjustments and improvements;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-decisional groundwork to prepare for the possible future deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinating positions on China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these efforts will help to bolster the psychological or physical aspects of extended deterrence, often simultaneously, by showcasing U.S. capabilities and will to uphold its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue to broadcast at the highest levels its commitment to provide extended deterrence to South Korea using “the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities,” as President Biden did in the May 2022 U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When referencing the “full range of U.S. defense capabilities,” the United States should emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — anchored in the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops on the peninsula — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications should acknowledge quiet alliance conversations about the potential redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons and possible preliminary measures (see point 5 below) while stressing that the allies would not commit to deployment without careful consideration of the downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should take a number of steps to improve joint planning and the execution of various aspects of extended deterrence, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a framework for joint nuclear planning. This would be similar to a NATO planning group for nuclear weapons use, with planning conducted bilaterally and trilaterally (with Japan) and control remaining in the hands of the United States. Experts see this as one of the most critical steps to developing stronger bonds of trust between the allies in the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command. This practice began a few years ago and gives South Korea a presence inside the key headquarters that plans for and executes any use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) as soon as possible. This will help in generating combined assessments of the risk of strategic deterrence failure and in setting policies that mobilize specific responses to these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Streamline the protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Revive track 1.5 unclassified dialogues in parallel with EDSCG meetings to incorporate a broader range of perspectives and potentially involve participants from Japan and other strategic partners, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Potentially explore the prospects for multilateral nuclear umbrella guarantees by engaging other like-minded partners, such as the United Kingdom and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expand trilateral operations and discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should welcome new opportunities to bring together U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea discussions and exercises related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even though the state of the debate in Japan on options for strengthening extended deterrence is in a different place than in South Korea, the two countries should take advantage of the fact that they share concerns about the credibility of extended deterrence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplement the two extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should look for ways to trilateralize operational activity that involves strategic assets, such as along the lines of Blue Lightning missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider undertaking a nuclear planning exercise trilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should consider changing its regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Specifically, this could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regarding the relative value of different strategic assets, relying primarily on sea-based systems makes the most sense from an operational standpoint, while rotational deployments of dual-capable aircraft would have more political reassurance value than operational military significance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should improve its national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating its plans to deploy 20 additional interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology, currently slated for 2028, and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both of these initiatives would enhance the United States’ capacity to deflect a North Korean attack on the U.S. homeland with nuclear-tipped missiles (deterrence by denial) while avoiding an unviable “numbers game” — involving a scramble to produce enough U.S. interceptors to match increasing numbers of North Korean launchers — that would ensue from continued reliance on old technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue its nuclear modernization efforts, including the Long Range Stand Off Weapon and B-21, and should not include the “no first use” or “sole purpose” clause in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also restore funds for and continue pursuing its nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These efforts would help to reassure South Koreans — and convince North Koreans — of U.S. capabilities to fight and win a war against North Korea, thereby upholding deterrence by punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider tabletop planning exercises for the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. This planning should be explicitly pre-decisional. The timeline and scope of weapons, such as low-yield nuclear SLCMs or gravity bombs, should be left deliberately ambiguous. Decisionmaking would be calibrated to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such planning exercises could entail cumulative phases, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Studies of the environmental impacts of redeployment;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mapping of possible locations for facilities for storage;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joint training on nuclear safety and security, including storage security, incident response, and recovery operations;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certifying Korea-based U.S. F-16 units or F-35 replacements for combined exercises and nuclear missions; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More committal physical steps toward redeployment, such as building storage facilities — a process that could take a few years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The committal, physical steps would only be pursued if North Korean threat levels continued to escalate after other options to strengthen extended deterrence were exhausted (e.g., if North Korea intensifies its provocations even after the United States deploys nuclear SLCMs to the region, creates a joint nuclear planning framework, and ramps up its nuclear modernization efforts).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons could heighten tensions on the peninsula despite its intended deterrent effect. This type of pre-decisional preparatory framework would signal commitment to the allies and resolve to North Korea while not yet crossing the proliferation threshold. It would also create new pressure on North Korea to stop ratcheting up threat levels if it does not want to see U.S. tactical nuclear weapons return to the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinate positions on China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should establish a bilateral consultative mechanism to share assessments of the implications of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula and coordinate potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop plans to jointly respond to Chinese pressure tactics aiming to derail allied deterrence initiatives directed toward North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should respond to any Chinese complaints about Washington’s efforts to strengthen its missile defenses against North Korea by highlighting the degree to which the U.S. homeland missile defense system is neither intended to nor capable of defending against ICBM capabilities as large and sophisticated as China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China returns to a more helpful posture on North Korea issues, the United States and South Korea should consider incorporating Beijing into multilateral talks to secure China’s responsibility as a major stakeholder in North Korea’s denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea policy is famously known as the “land of lousy options.” Currently, North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs look unstoppable. Decades of failed denuclearization diplomacy, however, cannot deter the allies from seeking new avenues of engagement with the modest goal of slowing down the program’s growth. Failing that objective, the United States must be cognizant that contingency planning, enhanced military readiness, and strengthened extended deterrence measures with South Korea and Japan serve to make U.S. alliances in Asia stronger, which in turn impose costs on North Korea for its proliferation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers were senior UK and Estonian government officials with significant experience in foreign and defence policy, alongside experts on Russian foreign and military policy. The first session considered lessons identified at the political, strategic, operational and tactical levels of warfare. The second session focused on options for better managing Russia in the future and what changes to the European security architecture might be required (see Annex for discussion points). This report contains a non-attributable summary of the discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-roundtable-themes&quot;&gt;Summary of Roundtable Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that much of the future of European security is dependent on how the war on the ground in Ukraine ends. There was a general sense that Russia was likely ultimately to lose the war and must incur significant costs for deterrence to be re-established. The best-case scenario was that a future Russia would wish to buy into a rebuilt collective security system. The worst-case scenario was that Russia turns inwards and continues an aggressive and isolated path, and a North Korea-type scenario develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been significantly conventionally weakened by the war thus far and will need a further period of defence modernisation and doctrine development into the future. However, this does not mean that Russia will become a less dangerous defence and security actor. Therefore, Russia is likely to use unconventional and hybrid means more prominently in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confrontation with Russia remains a long-term struggle. All NATO nations, individually and collectively, need to understand that there is no return even to the 23 February 2022 security relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity of purpose is the Western centre of gravity and must be maintained and protected at all costs. Moreover, the war has also highlighted NATO weaknesses and there must be a mutual recognition of these if the Alliance is to address them to be strong enough to guarantee the security of its member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-estonianuk-defence-and-security-relationship&quot;&gt;The Estonian–UK Defence and Security Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Estonian–UK relationship and current levels of defence and security cooperation were described as ‘exemplary’ in terms of the bilateral relationship, multinationally through NATO and minilaterally through the Joint Expeditionary Force and other initiatives. The level of strategic integration is unprecedented. Each side could not wish for more from the relationship, with very few countries seeing eye to eye in the defence and security sphere to the same extent as Tallinn and London. However, there is still scope to build on this relationship – an example provided was the Estonian (as well as other Baltic and Nordic countries’) operation of a ‘total defence model’ that the UK could learn from in terms of building its own resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-joint-strategic-assessment-on-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;A Joint Strategic Assessment on the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has already changed the fundamentals of European security. Russia has not only attacked Ukraine, but the very principles of European security itself – national sovereignty, the inviolability of national borders and the use of aggression as a tool of statecraft, particularly directed at the civilian population. Moreover, the war has animated a common threat assessment for Europeans across all the defence and security dimensions – conventional, hybrid, nuclear, energy, protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI), emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs), and food. As the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) have been exposed as poor compared with perceptions of them prior to the conflict, participants unanimously agreed that it is likely that President Vladimir Putin will ‘double down’ on non-conventional threats, such as nuclear and hybrid, as Russia does not delineate between conventional and unconventional levers or war and peace as separate constructs, and will always prioritise its defence and security policy over domestic considerations. Conversely, NATO’s significant challenges have also been exposed to its potential adversaries and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for international norms for years. Conference speakers agreed that the current war, while ultimately Putin’s decision, should be considered as ‘Russia’s war’. Strategically, this is a war between Russia and the West, and it will not be won, or ended, kinetically on the battlefield in Ukraine. However, what happens on the battlefield will determine the foundations for the architecture which will follow. Despite multiple operational and tactical setbacks, Russia is not yet facing strategic defeat, although it is paying a heavier price than anticipated, both domestically and externally. Russia is still progressing its strategic intent. Its forces currently occupy approximately 20% of Ukraine and Moscow has established greater control over Belarus. Sanctions, while having an impact, are unlikely to bring Russia to its knees in the near future – Iran and North Korea were offered by one of the Estonian speakers as examples of states still functioning following decades of sanctions, capable still of developing advanced weaponry and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonian and UK officials agreed that Russia will likely be strategically weakened in the short term if Ukraine comes out of this war without concessions on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Should Russia gain any territory as a result of the war, it is the West and rules-based order that will be strategically weakened, not Russia. The poor Russian military performance presents opportunities for the Euro-Atlantic community. Yet, there needs to be a conscious understanding and effort if NATO is to take full advantage of the AFRF’s current weakness and the valuable insights on Russian vulnerabilities that the war has produced. Merely taking the additional time afforded to NATO to rectify weaknesses is insufficient and will not produce genuine strategic advantage. Moreover, NATO has been strengthened through unity and the adoption of its New Strategic Concept, and the imminent accession of two new members – Finland and Sweden. However, NATO must also be wary of the global context. While Ukraine has gained significant support through its informational campaigns in the West, the picture is more mixed elsewhere, such as in the Global South (broadly, the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania). It is important that the West recognises this and that the Russian narrative and propaganda gains traction outside English-speaking and other Western nations, which are actively targeted through its global network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must be resilient. Ukraine fatigue must not set in among the electorate or political leaderships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is likely using the winter and the shift of the ‘Special Military Operation’ to a stalemate on the ground to buy time to recover and enable ‘Ukraine fatigue’, as Western governments grapple with other political imperatives such as inflation, recession, and energy and other cost of living pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-identified-from-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Lessons Identified from the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has challenged the strength of the AFRF and exposed its rigid command structures and culture, in direct contrast to Ukraine’s adaptability, flexibility and innovation. Despite a poor tactical and operational performance by the AFRF, however, Russia will continue to be a direct military threat. Previous underperformance of the AFRF, such as in Georgia in 2008, did not sufficiently prompt the requirement for change, but the strategic shock of its performance in 2022 may finally provide the recognition, and acceptance, of the necessity for wider cultural changes throughout the Russian defence and security community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that the Western assessment community had previously overestimated Russian capabilities and underestimated Ukraine and there is a risk that the reverse may now occur. It was also noted that this was also true in assessments of the relative strengths of the Taliban and Afghan National Security Forces and could reflect a strategic weakness in how NATO assesses its adversaries and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a debate on the timeframes for NATO transformation and when the AFRF will pose a legitimate and credible conventional threat to Europe again. There was a warning that future credibility, for example, between 2030 and 2035, relied on decisions being made now and therefore there was actually not much time for action. The earliest assessments were that Russia could recover conventionally by 2023, with the caveat that additional personnel and equipment would be ‘operationally useful by Russian standards’ as its industry had retained industrial capacity and was able to secure components through illicit procurement and Iranian networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a serious risk that Ukraine runs out of ammunition, due to expenditure rates and limited stocks of NATO states, as well as a lack of spare industrial capacity to ramp up production in the short term. However, it was noted that ‘Ukrainians are good at sustaining momentum’ and were receiving more military aid before winter 2022 and continue to win the hearts and minds of Western media, people and thus governments to act on the relevant demand signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day as the conference, RUSI published a report, ‘Preliminary Lessons in Conventional Warfighting from Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine: February–July 2022’ which one of the authors discussed in detail. The main findings pertinent to NATO defence planners are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no sanctuary in modern warfare. The enemy can strike throughout operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighting demands large initial stockpiles and significant slack capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unmanned aerial systems and counter-UAS are essential across all branches and at all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The force must fight for the right to precision. Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the pervasive ISTAR on the modern battlefield and the layering of multiple sensors at the tactical level make concealment exceedingly difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-nato&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO, thus far, has responded well and in unity to a war which has been a real test for the Alliance. While not directly involved militarily, NATO is a critical actor and it was noted that the Russian pre-war proposals of December 2021 were primarily concerned with the US and NATO, not Ukraine. Words and non-military means did not deter Russia from launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and NATO, or its membership, must not self-deter and allow Russia the initiative to manage escalation. There was a recognition among the speakers that NATO did not do enough to deter Russia from its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, all NATO members need to understand, both individually and collectively, that there is no return to the relations with Russia that existed on 23 February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s New Strategic Concept, unveiled at the June 2022 Madrid Summit, drastically altered the NATO defence and deterrence posture in Europe and rebalanced away from the other core tasks of crisis management and cooperative security. The priority is now implementation and the delivery of the Madrid commitments quickly and fully to ensure credibility. Defence and reinforcement plans need to be resourced, with fighting formations stocked, trained, equipped and ringfenced for their mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants agreed that the unity demonstrated at Madrid is the Alliance’s centre of gravity and must prevail, as it would be naive to think Russia will not test Europe again. But Madrid is only the starting point and increased investments in defence and security should become the norm, not just in financial terms but also in manufacturing capabilities to obtain better outputs and therefore outcomes. The demand signal is there, and contracts need to be signed for long-term requirements to bring industry on board and ensure European strategic advantage. Increased defence spending and investment is predicated on political will and Allies have a duty to help. The transformation that NATO requires is not just process driven but one of mindset and culture. It needs to jettison the counterinsurgency mindset that has dominated the past 20 years of Alliance activity and get back to preparing for conventional warfighting as the requirements are very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that the NATO Vilnius Summit in June 2023 would be critical and hoped its outcome would be increased resilience and full implementation of the Madrid vision for the future of the Alliance. NATO plans need to be approved, the defence investment pledge revised and Finland and Sweden need to be welcomed as full members. NATO cannot and should not be scared of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-russia-as-a-european-security-actor&quot;&gt;The Future of Russia as a European Security Actor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 70 years of general peace that Europe has experienced since the end of the Second World War was built on the presence of the US and its security umbrella and transatlanticism – an assessment that participants from both Estonia and the UK shared. By 1945 appeasement and the use of aggression were discredited on the European continent, but now appear again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine is pivotal, due to its scale, how it will change Ukraine as a nation, and how it will establish new norms of European security and reinforce the principle that larger states do not get a veto over smaller ones. Putin’s aggression cannot pay off, in any way, as other authoritarian states, especially China, are watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was reinforced that Russia has no intention of losing its war in Ukraine and has identified Western unity as a centre of gravity which must be attacked, through producing economic pain, scaring the West into paralysis through nuclear and hybrid escalation, and providing false-hope narratives as traps to damage unity. Russia’s national strategy has been to deter responses by NATO while taking slices out of its neighbourhood, and the war has now changed attitudes and beliefs in Russia’s neighbourhood. Participants agreed that the status of Crimea is fundamental to the security future of both Russia and Ukraine and cannot be treated separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was further noted that the West must also learn from its past mistakes to manage Russia better in the future – both the strategic failure to deter Russian designs on Ukraine from 2014 to 2022 and the grand strategic failure to deal with Russia adequately since the end of the Cold War and understanding the realistic military threat it poses. There must be a recognition that the West is stuck with Putin or ‘Putinism’ for some time. It would be a mistake to think that democratising Russia, such as the manner of Western engagement in the 1990s, will be possible. The imperialistic mindset is entrenched in Russian society that the West has only a very limited ability to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-what-comes-next&quot;&gt;Managing What Comes Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were unanimous in agreeing that managing what comes next depends on how this phase of the war ends. However, regardless of the ultimate outcome, it was agreed that existing security frameworks need to be rethought and what can be salvaged and built upon needs to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference participants disagreed as to how the war on the ground would play out in 2023 and beyond but were steadfast in their belief that Russia must be defeated. Regardless of how the war ends, the European security order has transformed as Russia has flagrantly violated European and international norms by brutally invading a neighbouring country entirely unprovoked. Also, the significant write down in Russian combat power due to poor AFRF performance, with only modest investment from NATO Allies (primarily the US), has provided time and space for Europe to undergo its own military transformation as demanded by NATO’s Strategic Concept. Yet this investment to date has already strained Allied military capability and readiness, exposing NATO weaknesses, which must be urgently rectified. The multitude of Russian weaknesses on the battlefield must be decoupled with assessing the change in relationship between Russia and its partners, including Belarus, Iran and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aspect raised was that it is currently difficult to assess what has genuinely changed in Russia as a result of the war. The strategic intent – to occupy the whole of Ukraine and disrupt the European and international order – remains. Moreover, the values, world view and approach that Putin incarnates are likely to endure beyond Putin himself. Most of the criticism in Moscow is about not going hard and fast in the war, rather than the legitimacy of the war itself. The speakers agreed that while Russia might experience some destabilisation, there would be no ‘colour revolutions’ and that any challenge to Putin’s power would likely come from the right and not the liberal centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked to this was a sense among participants of a growing disconnect between Russian capabilities and the country’s ambitions and self-identity as a great power, which is fundamental to national identity. The foundations are built on Russia’s permanent seat at the UN Security Council and its nuclear status, its military might and its ability to act as a regional hegemon. Following the war, the last two are now under threat, which could cause Russia to act more aggressively and in an unpredictable manner, especially to compel its neighbours to act in certain ways and influence behaviours. In this context, it is likely that Russia will continue to exploit differences among NATO, and EU, members. Frozen conflicts are Russia’s comfort zone and their manipulation is key to Moscow’s exercise of power; therefore anything that is pushed on Ukraine towards that status is counterproductive, will look like a win for Russia and will therefore be unacceptable to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-european-structural-relationship-with-russia&quot;&gt;Assessing the European Structural Relationship with Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions highlighted that European security, and the architecture underpinning it, must now be rethought. In terms of arms control, the war in Ukraine feels like the closing of an era, akin to the end of the Cold War. Certain components, such as the OSCE, especially the Vienna Document, endure, and New START is robust and remains critical. However, participants agreed that the era of cooperative security agreements that have characterised the previous 30 years do not feel like tomorrow’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was emphasised that Estonia and the UK are part of a community of democracies which take longer to make decisions, but make stronger decisions collectively, with legitimacy, transparency and accountability. Estonia and the UK want the war to end as soon as practically possible, but no concessions can be given to Putin. Therefore, these decisions must be made with a rational and coherent strategy which will benefit European security. There was doubt that this is moving quickly enough as Western countries are experiencing economic pain (inflation in Europe is currently highest in Estonia). A strategic breaking point of unity is approaching and some speakers believed it to be unsustainable, giving a particular warning about the pain of next winter for Europe, in addition to the current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers all agreed that security guarantees must be provided to the future Ukrainian state, including a capable and integrated Ukrainian military, linked to industry, that can match Russia. However, there was no consensus on the form those guarantees should take. It should not be the uncertain assurance of NATO’s 2008 Budapest Summit commitment to eventual Alliance membership for Ukraine but must include an honest and realistic assessment of what kind of assistance Allies can supply to Ukraine in the long term, including force modernisation and NATO standardisation, and resupply for a future crisis. Strengthening Ukrainian deterrence of future Russian threats is critical and can be done through intelligence support, sanctions, military technical assistance and training programmes, which are all measures that would support Ukraine on its journey to join NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

The political and defence ties between Belarus and Russia have gained new prominence as a result of the war in Ukraine. But a nuanced understanding of this relationship suggests that Russia’s dependence on Belarus for logistical support and training could become a weakness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper examines Belarus’s military role as the provider of fundamental logistical and practical support for the Russian armed forces, without which the Russian army would struggle to function, particularly during wartime. It identifies some of the ideological, practical and political points of contention in the two countries’ security relationship and seeks to challenge prevailing wisdom that casts Belarus as the only dependent party. For now, Russia’s and Belarus’s occasionally differing threat perceptions may be temporarily consolidated around the Ukraine war, with Western sanctions – including those specifically targeting Belarus for its role as co-aggressor – obliging President Alexander Lukashenko to turn to Russia to guarantee his political future and prop up the economy. But Russia’s dependence on Belarus as a defence manufacturer and logistical provider could one day become a critical vulnerability, particularly in the event of significant political or economic change in Belarus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;KEY FINDINGS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of the Belarus–Russia relationship tends to focus on Belarus’s political and financial dependence on Russia, but in defence, Russia’s reliance on Belarus for military-grade components, as well as logistical services in war and peacetime, could be an area of critical weakness for Russia, particularly in the longer-term event of regime change in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia cooperate military and politically through several platforms and agreements, of which the Union State and the Regional Group of Forces are the most significant. The Ukraine war may have aligned Lukashenko’s and Putin’s threat perceptions of NATO for now, but while defence is often framed as their closest area of cooperation, significant frictions remain between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of interoperability between the armies at a strategic, operational and tactical level, but Belarus is not a mere military district of Russia. Belarus’s most important role in the current Ukraine war is acting as the tyl (rear) of the Russian army. Belarus performs vital functions as a logistical supplier; hosting and offering medical and practical support to Russian troops stationed on Belarusian territory and facilitating the transfer of troops and hardware around the country and into Ukrainian territory through its rail network. But frictions remain in defence, among them Belarus’s frustrations at receiving secondhand Russian weapons, Russian attempts to take over Belarusian defence-industrial manufacturers, and periodic disagreements over military-ideological training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are links at numerous levels, including between the Belarusian and Russian senior military command, with many officers having received training at Russian institutions, which makes the political loyalties of the Belarusian armed forces difficult to gauge. These close links are particularly stark in the defence-industrial complex. Belarus is one of the few manufacturers of some military-grade components and repair services suitable for Russian army equipment, and Russia has failed to fully replace these industries domestically – hence its decades-long efforts at ‘integrating’ the Belarusian military-industrial complex into its own, which have been resisted so far. Belarus has long been pigeonholed as a defence exporter of unfinished components, which it sells to a limited range of clients abroad, but mostly to Russia. This mutual dependence also has a great impact on Russia, aspects of which would function less efficiently without Belarus’s machine parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic pressure on Belarus, including sanctions that are isolating Belarus from the international supply chain, could have implications for Russia’s defence industry. Unless Russia gives greater support to the Belarusian economy, particularly its industrial sector, reliable supplies of components will be difficult to acquire, and are likely to impact on Russia’s ability to rearm, as well as deliver on its existing contracts as a global weapons supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Belarus was used as a launchpad for the offensive on Kyiv in February 2022, the Russia–Belarus relationship was given renewed impetus in the West for research. The war highlighted the importance of understanding Russia’s strategic security thinking on Belarus, to determine how Russia perceives its closest military and political ally, unpack the extent of defence coordination between them, and identify what the frictions in this relationship could mean for the West. This paper ultimately seeks to determine whether the Belarusian armed forces are a strategic asset to the Russian armed forces, a key vulnerability, or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the paper seeks to answer two key questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does Russia conceive of its security relationship with Belarus, and how has this shifted in the light of major events such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the start of the Ukraine war in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How coordinated are the two countries’ military forces, and where are the frictions between them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is based on a review of public statements from both countries’ senior political leadership, official strategic planning documents produced by Russian and Belarusian government bodies, Russian-language media reports, and articles published by Russian think tanks and military journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from historical documents required for background notes, this research primarily focused on strategic documents published after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, at which point Belarus was forced into taking a public stance on Russia’s annexation. A closed research event featuring experts on Russian and Belarusian politics and defence was organised by RUSI, which aimed to challenge and discuss some of the hypotheses raised during the course of this research. Access to Russian-language military journals has been provided with the assistance of the Russian Military Studies Centre, a research facility based at the UK Defence Academy in Shrivenham. Due to the fast-moving nature of the conflict, important questions, such as the likelihood that Belarus would enter the Ukraine war more actively, are not fully unpacked here, nor is there a comprehensive analysis of the Belarus–Ukraine dynamic, as this stillevolving relationship is beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of this paper outlines Russia’s strategic military and political approach to Belarus. It offers some background on how this has evolved since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, identifying key events that have impacted on the relationship. It also examines Russian conceptions of Belarus to understand why the country is of such significance to President Vladimir Putin. The second section discusses the military, defence-industrial and ideological cooperation between the two countries in more detail, including Belarus’s role as the tyl (rear) of the Russian armed forces. Given the importance of the Belarus–Russia relationship, the final section highlights some of the potential challenges on the horizon for NATO Allies, and why understanding the dynamics of this relationship can have an important impact on regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-russia-conceives-of-its-political-and-security-relationship-with-belarus&quot;&gt;HOW RUSSIA CONCEIVES OF ITS POLITICAL AND SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH BELARUS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Belarus (along with Ukraine) have a shared security, historical, cultural and linguistic heritage dating back centuries. Belarus has variously been called Russia’s ‘client state’, part of Russia’s Soviet sphere of influence, and Russia’s strategic security partner. But for contemporary Russia, Belarus is more than that. It is, for Putin at least, conceptually an extension of Russia’s own strategic security space. Given the geo-economic imbalance between the two countries, and this Russian understanding of Belarus, the relationship can never be one of equal partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Putin’s most recent statements on the triumvirate of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia epitomise this conceptual approach. In July 2021, amid rising tensions with the West, Putin penned an article in which he rehashed – with a dose of revanchism – the historical relationship between the three countries. Some months later and a few days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he gave a speech at the Kremlin in which he recognised the independence of the so-called People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk and gave his justification for the coming war. Then, in April 2022, during a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Russia’s Far East, Putin maintained that he did not distinguish between where Belarus ended and Russia began, claiming that Ukraine, Belarus and Russia had always been one people. In each of these examples, there is a common refrain in which Belarus, Ukraine and Russia are the ‘heirs of Ancient Rus’ – historical lands that include the territory of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine, ruled from Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian leadership’s linguistic framing of Belarus is also revealing – the country is often referred to as ‘Byelorussia’, rather than Belarus. Byelorussia is a historical-empirical term for lands that included parts of Belarus (literally ‘White Russia’), and the use of this form suggests a view of Belarus as a district of Russia, rather than a separate country. These linguistic nuances reflect sentiments that have been echoed by important figures sent to Belarus to negotiate on the Kremlin’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most potentially damaging incidents for the relationship involved Mikhail Babich, Russia’s former ambassador to Belarus. He was recalled in 2019 after openly engaging with Belarus’s political opposition, which Lukashenko viewed as an attempt to promote regime change. Babich was a former KGB officer, and Ukraine had refused to accept him as ambassador two years before. He overstepped his diplomatic boundaries throughout his tenure in Belarus, to Minsk’s increasing concern. In comments to the media, Babich described Belarus as a ‘district’ of Russia, causing a diplomatic incident, and eventually, at Lukashenko’s request, he was recalled.10 This slight concession to Belarus indicated that Russia understood Lukashenko was only to be pushed so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babich was replaced by Dmitry Mezentsev, who is now secretary of the Union State – a loose bilateral framework agreement formulated in 1999 between Belarus and Russia to deepen their political, economic and military integration, which has become increasingly formalised in recent years. Unlike Babich, Mezentsev is a moderate and a career diplomat, who has described Belarus and Russia as unified not by pressure from the West, but by a desire for deeper economic integration and common historical understandings. But while Russia is Belarus’s closest ally, the relationship is beset by personal tensions, practical problems and conceptual divergences that make it difficult for true integration to take place. These divergences were particularly seen in Russia’s displeasure at Belarus’s attempts to court the West over the past eight years, attempts prompted by its desire to ease the sanctions that had been introduced in response to Belarusian human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-agenda&quot;&gt;RUSSIA’S AGENDA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia work together across several platforms and agreements, but the most relevant for the security relationship is the Union State. It envisages a single economic, social and legal space, a joint budget, and coordinated foreign and defence policies. But until 2018, when Putin resumed the Russian presidency for a fourth term, it was given only scant public attention, although the defence relationship that it facilitates was ongoing throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral security relationship between Belarus and Russia features in numerous official Russian documents including its Military Doctrine (2014), National Security Strategy (NSS 2015, updated in 2021) and Foreign Policy Concept (2016), with the NSS forming the basis around which the most important documents are framed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the updated NSS makes little reference to Belarus. In comparison with the 2015 document, which focused on strategic partnerships with other countries based on a principle of equality, the 2021 NSS removes references to ‘equality’ or interest in cooperation with the West, instead promoting the importance of protecting Russia’s values, politics and sovereignty (although it is unclear what makes these values unique to Russia). Indeed, there is more focus on concerns about Russian traditional values than on the Eurasian Economic Union (of which Belarus is a founding member too), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russia-led security alliance established formally in 2002, or the Union State, vehicles through which Russia cooperates with Belarus. Belarus is not mentioned as a strategic partner, whereas China and India are specifically. This could suggest that Belarus is not a priority, although it is more likely that Russia considers Belarus to be already so well integrated that plans for a deeper relationship need not be rehashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there have been disagreements in the bilateral relationship for years, including over the prices of milk and oil, new tax laws, and Lukashenko’s longstanding resistance to the construction of a permanent Russian military base in Belarus. Lukashenko and Putin’s poor personal relationship is well documented, and while they meet frequently, Putin has never considered him a personal confidante. There are also frictions between Lukashenko and former Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev – an important figure as deputy leader of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev has in the past publicly called for the ‘modernisation’ of Belarus’s election processes, much to Lukashenko’s chagrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Union State was only publicly resurrected in 2018, when Putin resumed the presidency. Numerous meetings in 2018 between Putin and Lukashenko manifested little, while conversations in Russia increasingly framed Belarus as a drain on Russia’s financial resources, until then-prime minister Medvedev issued an ultimatum that integration should go ahead in earnest, and that any significant cooperation between Belarus and Western security and economic structures such as the EU, the US and NATO would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s intention to rein in Belarus’s forays into the West were clear. At the meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in June 2018, he pointedly remarked that common approaches to foreign policy were to be a priority. These sentiments were echoed and amplified by Medvedev and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who was that same month forced to deny intense media speculation that Putin intended to unify Belarus and Russia, perhaps with the presidency of the Union State as a possible retirement option. But this did not mean that Belarus and Russia’s understandings of security were the same. While the Ukraine war may have temporarily forced Lukashenko into paying lip service to aspects of Putin’s worldview, this is a fickle alignment, predicated on Moscow’s continued economic support for Belarus, and political support for Lukashenko’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;divergent-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;DIVERGENT THREAT PERCEPTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2022, Russia’s security doctrines and official statements made it clear that it viewed NATO as its main strategic threat, while Belarus took a more measured view. Belarus’s long-serving minister of foreign affairs Vladimir Makei, who died unexpectedly in late 2022, often stated that he did not view NATO deployments on its eastern flank as threatening Belarus’s security environment. In 2020 the Belarusian military even conducted a small-scale exercise with NATO Allies – a group of UK Marines – although at a strategic and operational level its forces only train with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus had taken an ostensibly neutral stance over Crimea, going as far as criticising the annexation as a bad precedent and hosting the Minsk peace agreements, to Russia’s irritation. This diplomatic manoeuvring had the aim (successful at the time) of removing Western sanctions on Belarus, introduced in 2010 following the Belarusian security services’ crackdown on protesters. Russia’s concerns that Belarus might drift closer to Western political structures was a major factor in propelling the Union State forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises have increased in frequency and coordination over the past few years, but the Zapad (West) 2017 exercises demonstrated Russia and Belarus’s divergent threat perceptions most clearly. Zapad is their largest joint military exercise, held quadrennially in Russia’s Western Military District since 1999. This alternates with Union Shield (Shchit Soyuza), which also takes place every four years in Russia. One of the Zapad 2017 scenarios was to test how Belarus could host Russia’s military forces, should a foreignsponsored attack require it. At the time, Belarus was keen to maintain cordial relations with NATO, as part of its security and political balancing act with the West, while ensuring its allyship with Russia. Russia’s actions, such as suggesting that the test launch of a tactical ballistic Iskander-M missile was part of the exercises, when they were unconnected, undermined Belarus’s diplomatic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise was beset by problems. Russia attempted to increase the agreed-upon number of soldiers, which Lukashenko refused, mindful of how this would be received in the West. Belarus offered Western media access to the exercises (Russia did not) and invited Western observers, including the OSCE, NATO, the Helsinki Commission and the International Red Cross, to observe parts of Zapad, as well as providing briefings at NATO headquarters, in an attempt at transparency and to assuage Western concerns that the exercises were a foil for a Russian incursion into Belarus. Against this backdrop, such were their differing views of security that Lukashenko and Putin did not undertake a joint tour of the battlefield, as is traditional, and went their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turning-points&quot;&gt;TURNING POINTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two events – the domestic turmoil of 2020 in Belarus, and the Ukraine war – did, however, shift Lukashenko’s priorities. The 2020 protests against Lukashenko’s re-election to the presidency – in a vote that had been viewed as a foregone conclusion – and the resultant violent repression, with allegations of torture perpetrated by the Belarusian security services, turned Belarus into an international pariah. Greater security cooperation with Russia followed, including mutual training for the security services to maintain public order, likely aimed at suppressing future demonstrations, particularly against the Ukraine war and Lukashenko personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the prospects of a political relationship and accompanying economic investment from the West dwindled to nil, Lukashenko recalibrated, and a flurry of meetings with Putin took place throughout 2021, with promises of significant loans from Russia to prop up the ailing Belarusian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lukashenko’s resistance crumbled, so too did his political resolve. In a November 2021 Russian television interview, he abruptly recognised Crimea’s annexation for the first time. While in a sense this meant little, as he has yet to visit the peninsula, it was a political manoeuvre, aligning him with Putin’s view of the world. Lukashenko’s signature in that same month on a joint security doctrine with Russia sealed his public commitment to security alignment. Although the full text of the new doctrine was not published until February 2022, its removal of language on Belarus’s neutrality that had prevented Russia from moving nuclear weapons onto its territory sparked concern among NATO Allies. This, and Belarus’s February 2022 constitutional referendum that allowed the country to break its neutrality pledge and non-nuclear status, were viewed as concessions to Putin, in exchange for ongoing support to Belarus amid its international isolation. The new doctrine laid some of the groundwork for Russia to use Belarus as a launchpad for the offensive on Kyiv, with Belarus cast by the West as the ‘co-aggressor’ in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts amid the Ukraine war by Makei to urge the West, in particular the EU, to engage in dialogue, preventing Belarus’s complete diplomatic isolation, and suggesting a foreign policy course for Belarus not entirely aligned with Russia’s, came to naught and his suggestions were rebuffed. The regime is now under wide-ranging international sanctions, cut off from most international supply chains and reliant on Russia for deeper economic cooperation, including significant loans and the restructuring of its existing debt repayments to Moscow, to prevent economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko’s accompanying rhetoric has also changed. In an apparent about face, in October 2021 he remarked that Belarus should establish a joint military base with Russia in case of attack – in contrast to his years of resistance to hosting Russian military infrastructure. He has also parroted conspiracy theories asserting that NATO was attempting to annex parts of western Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change of official rhetoric has been accompanied by greater defence cooperation with Russia. However, much of this has been confined to symbolic gestures, rather than investment. Following a request from Lukashenko in November 2021, Russian strategic bombers escorted by Belarusian fighter jets conducted exercises over Belarus for the first time. Here Lukashenko emphasised the importance of joint air patrols to protect Belarus’s borders, indicating that he was framing NATO as a threat to the country – in accordance with Russia’s official views and increasingly hardline approach to the West. By May 2022, Belarus’s defence minister Viktor Khrenin was talking in terms of a possible war against Belarus, and the need to upgrade its special forces to counter NATO reconnaissance planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while it appeared the transformation of Belarus’s defence community’s rhetoric was complete, as the war has continued, officials such as Khrenin have made clear that alongside their staunch anti-Western rhetoric remains an apparently sincere desire for some engagement with the West, in the interests of Belarus’s own national security. Although Belarus’s role in the Ukraine war has cemented the Western view of Belarus as a co-aggressor whose worldview entirely aligns with Russia’s, it appears that some parts of the Belarusian defence and foreign policy community remain hopeful that Belarus can continue its balancing act between Russia and the West, however unlikely this may be in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-integration-and-the-tyl&quot;&gt;MILITARY INTEGRATION AND THE TYL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section does not attempt to determine whether Belarusian forces will officially enter the war in Ukraine, as there are many factors that could influence this that are beyond the scope of this paper. It looks at the integration between the Russian and Belarusian armed forces and determines whether this could be a key weakness for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically and operationally, the two forces are well integrated; there is a high degree of educational and ideological exchanges, and their special operations and airborne forces are closely linked across all levels. Belarus does not unilaterally conduct large exercises, always operating within the framework of joint exercises. There is a high degree of interoperability between them, supported by longstanding legislation, but underlying frictions mean full integration remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This closeness has led the neighbouring Baltic states and Poland to refer to Belarus as Russia’s ‘Belarus Military District’ – a reference to Russia’s division of its armed forces into geographically focused military districts. But although this framing is consistent with the Russian leadership’s framing of Belarus as a mere Russian backwater, calling Belarus a military district of Russia is something of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, for political purposes, this might not matter: since the Ukraine war escalated, Belarus and Russia have been viewed by the West as one and the same militarily. In a practical sense, Belarus has always played and is increasingly playing an important role as the tyl of Russia’s armed forces, providing logistical support, without which some of the Russian military’s key functions would be impeded. Much analysis has focused on Belarus’s political and economic dependence on Russia, but Russia’s own reliance on Belarus for military-grade components and logistical services in both war and peacetime could turn out to be a critical weakness for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has made some attempts to improve, and reduce its reliance on Moscow for training, the Belarusian army is small, under-equipped and under-trained. Despite pledges from Lukashenko to conduct joint deployments with Russian soldiers, the Belarusian armed forces also appear to lack any motivation to fight Ukraine, presenting a challenge for Russia, which may not be able to call on them if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-cooperation&quot;&gt;MILITARY COOPERATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia have cooperated militarily in some form since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. This includes field and combat training, regular livefire exercises in Russia, and cooperation through the CSTO. Central to bilateral cooperation are the Unified Regional Air Defence System and the Regional Group of Forces (RGF), an agreement established in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RGF consists mainly of Belarusian armed forces and a few Russian units, such as the 1st Guards Tank Army. The written agreement now appears rather outdated. It emphasises defence coordination without naming a specific adversary and underscores the need for a balanced approach to NATO and Europe, as well as resolution through diplomatic means – much of which appears unthinkable in the current political climate. This document will likely be revised in the coming years to reflect a more unified view of emerging security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSTO’s Eastern European Group of Forces also comprises Russian and Belarusian units but, as the May 2022 CSTO summit highlighted, these forces have never been deployed in a unified manner to a combat zone, mostly due to reluctance of other member states to allow Russia-led CSTO forces to be deployed for fighting civil unrest. It was only during the 2022 protests in Kazakhstan that the alliance, fearing regime change, agreed to a limited mobilisation of peacekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the Russian and Belarusian armies operated separately, but changes to Belarus’s command-and-control structure and the dissolution of the Ground Forces Command in 2011–12, alongside numerous joint exercises, meant that over time, the Belarusian forces were subsumed into the RGF. On paper, both Moscow and Minsk have veto power over ground operations. But it is clear who has ultimate control over the joint operations. Indeed, there is a practical reason for this – the two countries have been conducting joint combat alert duty through their regional air defence systems since 2016, but it is likely that in the event of a conflict, Russia would assume control over Belarus’s air defence systems, as Belarus does not have modern air defence systems of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the war, the security debate centred around whether Belarus would host a permanent Russian military base, an argument that may now be less pressing. Russia currently leases two military installations in Belarus from the government, a Soviet hangover: a naval communication transmission station near the town of Vileyka, used to link up with submarines, and a long-range radar station near Baranovichi, which Russia leases for free. The installations are mostly symbolic – the radar station is not of particular significance to the Russian military – as the more modern Pionersky earlywarning station constructed in Kaliningrad in 2019 is much closer to NATO borders. Neither government understands these installations as military bases (voennaya baza), instead referring to them as military objects (voenniy obyekt). ‘Objects’ do not have the same status as bases, which offer a military advantage in a conflict through their use or destruction. Russia argues that the objects in Belarus do not offer such an advantage. The legal status of the objects has in the past allowed Belarus, insisting upon its neutrality, to assert that Russia does not have a permanent military presence in its country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of an airbase is far less important than consistent cooperation in defence through the exchange of weapons and infrastructure. As the war in Ukraine since February 2022 has demonstrated, Russia is able to deploy troops to Belarus quickly when required, a smooth relationship facilitated by years of cooperation and Lukashenko’s reduced room for manoeuvre. As Russian military stationing in Belarus has been a fait accompli since the last joint exercises in February, with Russian fighter jets using both military and civilian airfields in Belarus to conduct strikes on Ukraine, the signing of a formal agreement regarding the construction of a physical base may no longer be a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tyl&quot;&gt;THE TYL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s most important function for the Russian armed forces is not as a belligerent – low defence spending has meant that the capabilities of the country’s armed forces have waned over the last 30 years and would make little material difference on the battlefield – but as the ‘tyl’, providing the logistical, operational and technical support that Russian armed forces receive during both peace and wartime. The Russian phrase ‘bez tyla, net pobedi’ (‘there is no victory without the rear’) was commonly used during the Second World War, highlighting the behind-the-scenes importance of the logistical corps. Having a trustworthy logistical base is vital for Russia to ensure its own deterrence, and the tyl, as provided by the Belarusian army in the current Ukraine war, is a fundamental part of Russia’s military logistics to ensure that its forces can deploy to the operational theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarusian territory has been used in the Ukraine war for three key purposes. First, as a stationing point for Russian troops, of which around 30,000 remained in Belarus following joint exercises held in 2021. Second, as a launch for air and missile strikes on Ukraine, and third, as a logistical base, not only using Belarus’s road and rail transport, but also providing important public services for Russian soldiers such as medical facilities, food supplies and morgues. Russia has also been reliant on Belarus’s railway network to launch the assault on Kyiv, and earlier in the war there were several reports of sabotage of these tracks, which caused trains to run slowly, delaying important freight deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belarusian army’s role has always been to transport Russia’s military formations and provide storage facilities, particularly during exercises in Belarusian territory. In one of the first of its kind between countries, an agreement on joint logistical support was signed in 2004 as part of the RGF, giving the Russian army the right to use Belarus’s infrastructure and resources during a ‘threat’ or war. That agreement is the basis on which joint exercises and Belarus’s support to Russia in the current Ukraine war have been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Union State has a specific budget for military-technological cooperation to upgrade military facilities and infrastructure that the RGF uses, including financing regional railway systems. Just before Zapad 2017 began, exercises on the RGF’s tyl were held to deploy pipelines and fuel to war theatres, as well as establishing rail crossings for Russian units in Belarusian territory. Speed of mobilisation is vital for the Russian military, given the ground forces’ reliance on rail, and the Belarusian and Russian defence ministries have improved Belarus’s rail network to this end: in 2020, around 260 km of track were upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belarusian Transport Troops (part of the Ministry of Defence) have a tight relationship with the Russian Railway Troops: they transport military units and materiel within Belarus, as well as maintaining facilities and constructing rail lines and crossings within the country. The Railway Troops are a vital part of the Russian armed forces, as road and rail remain the most effective ways of mobilising Russian military units, which facilitated their fast deployment to the front during the initial stages of the Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the 2021 Zapad exercises, it was clear that the military interdependence between the two countries was approaching its zenith. Zapad 2021 featured around 200,000 personnel, focused on Kaliningrad and the Ukraine border, and involved all Russian military districts. This training scenario, in which NATO states attempted to conduct regime change in Belarus, including strikes against Russia, highlighted the two countries’ political and military alignment and mutual threat perceptions. The size of the exercises, in comparison with previous years, demonstrated Minsk’s abandonment of previous decisions to refuse to host such large exercises. It also showed Russia’s willingness to defend its political interests in Belarus, including assisting Lukashenko in the event of a threat to his authority, which offered him some reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Belarus’s own low military prowess might suggest that in any given conflict – such as the Ukraine war – it would automatically follow Russia’s lead, this has not proven the case thus far. Indeed, Lukashenko’s reluctance to send Belarusian troops to Ukraine and his public comments indicate a desire to keep a distance from a protracted war. There may be other issues at play – Lukashenko could be intentionally delaying military improvements to his own forces to avoid deeper integration with Russia, which would bring Belarus more actively into the Ukraine war. Thus far, Lukashenko has been able to be evasive on Belarus’s deeper practical involvement, as the Belarusian army’s participation in the war would be of little battlefield use. Low popular support within Belarus for greater involvement in Ukraine could also risk internal destabilisation – and Russia is not prepared to run the risk of a politically unstable Belarus on its borders. Delays of full interoperability between Russia and Belarus could frustrate not only Russia’s goals in the Ukraine war, but also Russia’s more strategic military goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ideology-and-education&quot;&gt;IDEOLOGY AND EDUCATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared military training and ideological propaganda with Russia has over the years helped to engender a mutual threat perception, particularly among senior officers, but gauging the Belarusian military’s loyalty is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia remained the main training destination for senior Belarusian military specialists, particularly for missile, infantry and air defence troops. Many senior Belarusian officers received their military education and training through the Soviet and then Russian system. This is reflected in Belarus’s senior military command: Alexander Volfovich, Chief of General Staff until 2021 and now State Secretary of the Security Council, studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School and the Russian General Staff Military Academy. Andrei Burdyko, Deputy Minister of Defence for Logistics since 2017, studied at the Military Academy of Logistics and Transport of the Russian Ministry of Defence. However, it should not be presumed that Belarusian soldiers automatically assume the political positions of Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko has over the years attempted to improve Belarus’s own military education offer to reduce its reliance on Russia, with more junior officers training domestically, but Russia is still the main destination for specialised training. These links make it challenging to determine the loyalties of the Belarusian forces – although Lukashenko has occasionally deliberately purged them of their most pro-Russian elements in the past. The topdown nature of both militaries, disempowering junior officers from making decisions or taking initiative, means that senior officers continue to dictate the ideological and political culture of the armed forces, as well as key decisions in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minsk Suvorov Military School is one of the main military education programmes for cadets, named after Russian General Alexander Suvorov, a renowned military commander. The Suvorov schools were set up in Russia and Belarus in the 1940s to train young cadets across the USSR and were designed to instil ideas among school-age children about the honour of defending the ‘motherland’, modelling Suvorov’s early experiences with battle. Suvorov’s methods and philosophical ideas about patriotism emphasised the importance of education, maintaining that tactics and good morale among soldiers is only part of the picture for victory, and that good training is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is telling that the Minsk school, set up in 1952, retains Suvorov’s name, indicating a common military mindset, even though one of Suvorov’s key achievements was his contribution to Russia’s seizure of Belarusian lands. Many senior Belarusian officers are graduates of the Suvorov institution, including Stanislav Zas, a former secretary of the Security Council and current chair of the CSTO, and Andrey Ravkov, minister for defence from 2014 to 2020, and current secretary of the Security Council. The Suvorov school does not name a specific adversary in its training manuals, but it is evident from the description of its ideologies and guiding ethos that they are pitted against the West. Even where training is localised in Belarus, it remains heavily influenced by Russia’s concept of threat and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political tensions between Russia and Belarus are reflected in changes to Belarus’s military staff. After the annexation of Crimea and Belarus’s criticism of Russia, the Belarusian Security Council was thought to have held back promotions for Russia-born and Russia-trained officers. Officially, Russia remained Belarus’s key ally, but the fissures in the relationship had a topdown effect. Before, Russia-trained senior officers had been favoured, and played a significant role in military policy. Nevertheless, although Crimea may have had an impact, the most senior positions are still occupied by officers who trained in Russia. In the event of a Russian victory in Ukraine – whatever that may look like – this effect could be inverted, with Belarusian officers who distinguish themselves as part of the tyl being accorded with honours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on joint military education goes beyond the armed forces into academia. Belarus has a regional branch of Russia’s Academy of Military Science (FAS), a research organisation that teaches on war and strategy, and deepens military research ties and technical expertise with Russia. This is psychologically important, as it contributes to common understandings of concepts of war and the enemy. While its actual impact on the broader psychology of the Belarusian military is difficult to determine, one of the academy’s tasks is to work with all other military institutions in Belarus on research and ideology. No other post-Soviet country has a branch of FAS that functions in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-industrial-ties&quot;&gt;DEFENCE-INDUSTRIAL TIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence is often cited as the area of deepest coordination between Belarus and Russia, but the Ukraine war could exacerbate existing practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Soviet times, Belarus has depended on Russia as a supplier of military hardware and as the main market for Belarusian manufacturing. Its products are cheaper and of better quality than their Russian counterparts, and when ties between Russian and Ukrainian defence-industrial contracts were severed after Russia annexed Crimea, Belarusian manufacturers moved into the vacuum to fulfil these defence contracts. This has further entrenched Belarus’s longstanding role as defence supplier to Russia – Belarus exports around US$250–300 million of military products to Russia each year. While financially beneficial to Belarus, this interdependence between Russia and Belarus’s military-industrial complexes could complicate Russia’s military activities and ability to rearm in Ukraine, as Belarusian plants maintain and repair Soviet- and Russia-made equipment such as tanks and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orsha Aircraft Repair Plant (in which Motor Sich, a Ukrainian manufacturer that builds engines for aeroplanes and helicopters, previously held a controlling stake) services Russia’s helicopters, and the 140 Repair Plant in Borisov produces transport and armoured vehicles both for Russia and for internal use in Belarus. The 558 Aircraft Repair Plant in Baranovichi is used to repair Russia’s aircraft and train personnel to operate complex aviation materiel for the war in Ukraine. All these entities are currently on the international sanctions lists. Companies such as KB Radar, which supplies radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, and the 558 Aircraft Repair Plant, also supply parts and offer repairs to aircraft to numerous countries, particularly in Africa (Nigeria and Kenya) and Latin America – clients include Venezuela and Colombia. It remains to be seen whether these countries will prefer to take their business elsewhere out of concern over falling foul of these sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attempts to ‘de-industrialise’ by reducing the number of Soviet-era heavy industry plants, alongside a series of bankruptcies and corruption scandals in its own defence production companies, have meant that Belarus is one of the few producers of military-grade components still exporting to Russia. The Russian army is reliant on sensors and the wheeled chassis produced by the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), which is used as a transport and launching platform for missiles such as the Topol-M. The Minsk Automobile Plant produces trucks and tractor trailers used for towing and installing Russian systems such as the Iskander-M missiles and S-400 air defence systems. Russia has struggled to identify a replacement for these services domestically; there are two factories that can potentially construct the chassis – one in Bryansk and another in Naberezhnye Chelny – but their products are much more expensive and have been criticised for their poor quality, so are rarely used by the military. While some of this low-tech material is unlikely to fundamentally frustrate Russia’s overall military aims, the provision of aviation training, as well as transportation vehicles, could slow down Russia’s efforts in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s defence-industrial complexes are heavily export-oriented: of the 25 companies that are controlled by the State Committee on Military Industry (Goskomvoenprom), only 10 are designed to fulfil Belarus’s domestic defence procurement. Although there are plans to increase it, Minsk’s own defence spending is around 1% of its GDP: lower than its internal security spend, revealing Lukashenko’s perception of threat sources. The Belarusian army is underfunded, mostly using Russian cast-offs for equipment (a common complaint of Lukashenko’s) that are more than 20 years old. Russia is also frustrated by this outsourcing of manpower and production to Belarus, and has long attempted to persuade Belarus to allow its dual use and key defence factories to be opened to Russian investors, which Minsk has successfully resisted, charging exorbitant prices for controlling stakes. This form of integration does not portray two armies operating seamlessly together, but rather a producer–exporter and client relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s struggling economy, under pressure from Western sanctions, may cause problems for Russia’s military supply chain down the line. MZKT (a manufacturer of military trucks) and its senior management have been under UK and European sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, since December 2020, for their role in supporting the repression of civil society in Belarus by providing equipment to the police and security services, and they were sanctioned by the US in February 2022 for contributing to Russia’s defence and transport sectors. In 2021, MZKT published its financial results, which showed its revenue shrinking from US$152 million in 2019 to US$115 million in 2020, a fall of almost a quarter. Other international sanctions, including from Norway and Japan, are isolating Belarus from the international supply chain, and most major Belarusian banks are also under restrictions, which could put pressure on Belarus’s ability to finance the manufacturing of these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has adopted a critical approach in examining whether Russia’s framing of its defence relationship with Belarus can be cast as one of its potential vulnerabilities. As the paper has highlighted, the deep integration between the Belarusian and Russian armies and Moscow’s ultimate command of the strategic level firmly casts Belarus as the junior and subservient partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s understanding of Belarus – and the military functions it provides – as an extension of Russian territory, an idea reinforced by analysis that describes Belarus as a mere Russian military district – may mean that the Kremlin does not yet recognise the dependent relationship as a problem. The Russian security community may not view the outsourcing of its provision of important military functions as a fundamental weakness, but it is increasingly clear that without the tyl, Russia may not be able to achieve some of its strategic security goals. It cannot be assumed that the Belarusian military would unquestioningly fight – or supply – the Russian military in pursuit of Russia’s political goals, particularly if attaining those goals would weaken Lukashenko’s personal power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s deepening involvement in the Ukraine war, and a potentially unfavourable outcome for Russia and Belarus, could seriously impact Lukashenko’s domestic stability. The relationship may be stable for now, but economic issues in Belarus that could delay supplies, or instigate political changes in the country – especially regime change – could impact on Russia’s practical ability to rearm. NATO Allies should not overlook Belarus’s role as an important regional player, whether Lukashenko is disrupting Russia’s actions intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that an understanding of the potential frictions between Belarus and Russia should be informing NATO’s defence planning. While the two countries’ close links make it challenging to decouple them, determining where disagreements are would be useful when attempting to plan future scenarios, particularly relating to the outcome of the Ukraine war. Notwithstanding that the Ukraine war may have temporarily aligned their rhetoric, the bilateral relationship is not immune to change, and there are already numerous divergences in their threat perceptions and prioritisation of interests. There are also several risks on the horizon that could impact on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia to ensure a smooth supply chain in future, it would have to apportion finances, domestic training and practical expertise to replace its reliance on Belarus for military-grade components. Economic issues in Belarus will mean that unless Russia continues to prop up the Belarusian economy, reliable supplies of military-grade components could be difficult to acquire. Reluctant to return to heavy manufacturing, Russia will be forced to offer Belarus significant loans, a challenge for a Russia under economic pressure itself. Although it may not be decisive, this could have implications for the course of the Ukraine war, as well as impacting on Russia’s supply chain delivery of its existing contracts as a weapons exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although unlikely at this stage, this risk would be exacerbated by any regime change in Belarus in the coming years that may seek to revise those defence contracts. Many of Russia’s defence relationships, such as with India, Latin America and Africa, depend on its ability to fulfil contracts, which it partly outsources to Belarusian maintenance and repair plants. Disruption to these relationships could affect Russia’s status as a global security actor, leaving a vacuum for other countries, such as China, to step in. Russia’s key defence weaknesses may lie not in personnel, weaponry or doctrine, but in third-party outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political environment in Belarus could also be uncertain. The Kremlin has made it clear that it would like to see some alternative political groups emerge in Belarus, and perhaps ultimately a controlled transfer of power to another figure, but the closer Belarus’s defence ties with Russia, the less likely it is for democratic forces to influence the domestic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, while unified doctrines, military interoperability, and ideology place Belarus firmly within Russia’s security orbit for now, prospects for change are not beyond view. The Belarusian tyl as the soft underbelly of the Russian armed forces may have been partially recognised by Russia’s senior leadership, but the few practical steps taken to address it have not yet succeeded in reducing Russia’s reliance on Belarus for machine parts, vehicles and specialist training. The deeper that military integration with Belarus grows, the more pressing this issue will become for Russia in future.&lt;/p&gt;

CSIS developed a wargame for a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan and ran it 24 times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;In most scenarios, the United States/Taiwan/Japan defeated a conventional amphibious invasion by China and maintained an autonomous Taiwan. However, this defense came at high cost. The United States and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers. Taiwan saw its economy devastated. Further, the high losses damaged the U.S. global position for many years. China also lost heavily, and failure to occupy Taiwan might destabilize Chinese Communist Party rule. Victory is therefore not enough. The United States needs to strengthen deterrence immediately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders have become increasingly strident about unifying Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Senior U.S. officials and civilian experts alike have expressed concern about Chinese intentions and the possibility of conflict. Although Chinese plans are unclear, a military invasion is not out of the question and would constitute China’s most dangerous solution to its “Taiwan problem”; it has therefore justly become a focus of U.S. national security discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because “a Taiwan contingency is the pacing scenario” for the U.S. military, it is critical to have a shared, rigorous, and transparent understanding of the operational dynamics of such an invasion. Just as such an understanding was developed concerning the Cold War’s Fulda Gap, so too must analysts consider the Taiwan invasion scenario. This understanding is important because U.S. policy would be radically different if the defense were hopeless than if successful defense were achievable. If Taiwan can defend itself from China without U.S. assistance, then there is no reason to tailor U.S. strategy to such a contingency. At the other extreme, if no amount of U.S. assistance can save Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, then the United States should not mount a quixotic effort to defend the island. However, if U.S. intervention can thwart an invasion under certain conditions and by relying on certain key capabilities, then U.S. policy should be shaped accordingly. In this way, China would also be more likely to be deterred from an invasion in the first place. However, such shaping of U.S. strategy requires policymakers to have a shared understanding of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there is no rigorous, open-source analysis of the operational dynamics and outcomes of an invasion despite its critical nature. Previous unclassified analyses either focus on one aspect of an invasion, are not rigorously structured, or do not focus on military operations. Classified wargames are not transparent to the public. Without a suitable analysis, public debate will remain unanchored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this CSIS project designed a wargame using historical data and operations research to model a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan in 2026. Some rules were designed using analogies with past military operations; for example, the Chinese amphibious lift was based on analysis of Normandy, Okinawa, and the Falklands. Other rules were based on theoretical weapons performance data, such as determining the number of ballistic missiles required to cover an airport. Most rules combined these two methods. In this way, the results of combat in the wargame were determined by analytically based rules instead of by personal judgment. The same set of rules applied to the first iteration and to the last iteration, ensuring consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviews and a literature review, the project posited a “base scenario” that incorporated the most likely values for key assumptions. The project team ran that base scenario three times. A variety of excursion cases then explored the effects of varying assumptions. The impact of these varying assumptions on the likely outcome is depicted in a Taiwan Invasion Scorecard (see Figure 8). In all, 24 iterations of the game mapped the contours of the conflict and produced a coherent and rigorously derived picture of a major threat facing the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion always starts the same way: an opening bombardment destroys most of Taiwan’s navy and air force in the first hours of hostilities. Augmented by a powerful rocket force, the Chinese navy encircles Taiwan and interdicts any attempts to get ships and aircraft to the besieged island. Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers cross the strait in a mix of military amphibious craft and civilian roll-on, roll-off ships, while air assault and airborne troops land behind the beachheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the most likely “base scenario,” the Chinese invasion quickly founders. Despite massive Chinese bombardment, Taiwanese ground forces stream to the beachhead, where the invaders struggle to build up supplies and move inland. Meanwhile U.S. submarines, bombers, and fighter/attack aircraft, often reinforced by Japan Self-Defense Forces, rapidly cripple the Chinese amphibious fleet. China’s strikes on Japanese bases and U.S. surface ships cannot change the result: Taiwan remains autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major assumption here: Taiwan must resist and not capitulate. If Taiwan surrenders before U.S. forces can be brought to bear, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defense comes at a high cost. The United States and Japan lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of servicemembers. Such losses would damage the U.S. global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China also suffers heavily. Its navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and tens of thousands of soldiers are prisoners of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conditions-for-success&quot;&gt;Conditions for Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the 24 game iterations showed four necessary conditions to defeat a Chinese invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-taiwanese-forces-must-hold-the-line&quot;&gt;1. Taiwanese forces must hold the line.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Because some Chinese forces will always land on the island, Taiwanese ground forces must be able to contain any beachhead and then counterattack forcefully as Chinese logistics weaken. However, the Taiwanese ground forces have severe weaknesses. Therefore, Taiwan must fill its ranks and conduct rigorous, combined arms training. Ground forces must become the center of Taiwan’s defense effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-there-is-no-ukraine-model-for-taiwan&quot;&gt;2. There is no “Ukraine model” for Taiwan.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: In peacetime, the United States and Taiwan must work together to provide Taiwan with the weapons it needs; in wartime, if the United States decides to defend Taiwan, U.S. forces must quickly engage in direct combat.&lt;/strong&gt; In the Ukraine war, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have not sent troops directly into combat but have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies to Ukraine. Russia has been unable to interdict this overland flow. However, the “Ukraine model” cannot be replicated in Taiwan because China can isolate the island for weeks or even months. Taiwan must start the war with everything it needs. Further, delays and half measures by the United States would make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, allow China to create a stronger lodgment, and raise the risk of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-use-its-bases-in-japan-for-combat-operations&quot;&gt;3. The United States must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Deepen diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; While other allies (e.g., Australia and South Korea) are important in the broader competition with China and may play some role in the defense of Taiwan, Japan is the linchpin. Without the use of U.S. bases in Japan, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft cannot effectively participate in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-strike-the-chinese-fleet-rapidly-and-en-masse-from-outside-the-chinese-defensive-zone&quot;&gt;4. The United States must be able to strike the Chinese fleet rapidly and en masse from outside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Increase the arsenal of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles.&lt;/strong&gt; Bombers capable of launching standoff, anti-ship ordnance offer the fastest way to defeat the invasion with the least amount of U.S. losses. Procuring such missiles and upgrading existing missiles with this anti-ship capability needs to be the top procurement priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-pyrrhic-victory&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Pyrrhic Victory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory is not everything. The United States might win a pyrrhic victory, suffering more in the long run than the “defeated” Chinese. Furthermore, the perception of high costs might undermine deterrence: if China believes that the United States would be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan, then China might risk an invasion. The United States should therefore institute policies and programs to make winning less costly in the event of conflict. Such measures would include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy&quot;&gt;POLITICS AND STRATEGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions. There is a seeming gap between war plans, which assume prewar deployments to Taiwan and neutral countries, and political realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland. The National Command Authority might withhold permission because of the grave risks of escalation with a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties. In three weeks, the United States will suffer about half as many casualties as it did in 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry. Despite rhetoric about adopting a “porcupine strategy,” Taiwan still spends most of its defense budget on expensive ships and aircraft that China will quickly destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture&quot;&gt;DOCTRINE AND POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortify and expand air bases in Japan and Guam. Dispersion and hardening dilute the effects of missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revise U.S. Air Force doctrine and restructure procurement to increase aircraft survivability on the ground. Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland. Chinese air defense is too strong, the targets take a long time to produce operational results, and the air missions around Taiwan take priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers. These units are designed to counter China and do provide some value, but political and operational difficulties put limits on their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities. Military doctrine calls for forward deployments to enhance deterrence during a crisis, but these forces make tempting targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms&quot;&gt;WEAPONS AND PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships and develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings. Surface ships are extremely vulnerable, with the United States typically losing two carriers and 10 to 20 large surface combatants in game iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms. Submarines were able to enter the Chinese defensive zone and wreak havoc with the Chinese fleet, but numbers were inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are niche weapons. Their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the immense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters. The range, missile standoff distance, and high carrying capacity of bombers presented the People’s Liberation Army with daunting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce more, cheaper fighters and balance the acquisition of stealth aircraft with production of non-stealth aircraft. With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of fighter/attack aircraft and becoming a secondary player in the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project and its recommendations need some caveats. Modeling an invasion does not imply that it is inevitable or even probable. The Chinese leadership might adopt a strategy of diplomatic isolation, gray zone pressure, or economic coercion against Taiwan; even if China opts for military force, this might take the form of a blockade rather than an outright invasion. However, the risk of invasion is real enough and potentially so destructive that analysis is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the benefits of defending Taiwan outweigh the prospective costs, or how to weigh those costs and benefits. Instead, the purpose is to enhance the public debate and thus allow the nation to make better-informed decisions on this critical national security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-project&quot;&gt;Why This Project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Need for Transparent Analysis of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once unthinkable — direct conflict between the United States and China — has now become a commonplace discussion in the national security community. The rise of China as an economic and military power, Beijing’s coercive policies directed against Taiwan and other U.S. regional partners in Asia, and growing U.S. bipartisan support for balancing Chinese economic and military power have created an intensifying competition. A direct clash would constitute the first between nuclear powers and also the first in which both sides possessed the full spectrum of modern military capabilities, such as stealth aircraft, long-range precision munitions, and space surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high stakes involved, there is little publicly available material on how such a conflict might play out. Much is classified and unavailable to the public. Unclassified material is either incomplete or too narrow for policymaking. By investigating many scenarios with a wargame based on analysis and running the wargame 24 times, this project fills a critical gap and furthers the public discussion of three key questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-economic-and-military-rise&quot;&gt;China’s Economic and Military Rise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International relations scholars have long highlighted the dangerous dynamics between a rising power and an existing hegemon. In 1958, Abramo Organski first developed the notion that war becomes more likely as the capabilities of weaker, dissatisfied states approach those of the established, advantaged states. This theory provides the basis for a natural cycle of the rise and fall of hegemonic powers as unsatisfied and rising challengers defeat them. Graham Allison’s 2018 book about the “Thucydides trap” popularized this notion. The concern is that this theory applies to today, where a rising China challenges the hegemonic status that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception that China and the United States are strategic competitors, once debated, has gained widespread currency in both Washington and Beijing. In the United States, the sentiment has become bipartisan as hope has faded that China will become “a responsible member of the international community.” China’s attitude is hardening also. The two highest-grossing movies in Chinese history both featured the Chinese military taking on and defeating Americans (Wolf Warrior II and The Battle of Lake Changjin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view has been building over time. Andrew Marshall, the legendary head of the Office of Net Assessment, began warning about China in the late 1980s. Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon launched the Third Offset Strategy to counter China’s growing capabilities, and in 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter observed a “return to great power competition” in Asia. The Trump administration’s National Defense Strategy continued this view: “China is a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing features in the South China Sea.” Most recently, the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy identifies China as the primary global competitor to the United States: “The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has embarked on a concerted, long-term military modernization program. From its inception until the late 1990s, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was mainly land-focused, filled with masses of poorly trained conscripts, and unable to exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by U.S. naval forces. This has changed. As an annual assessment by the Department of Defense (DOD) notes: “The PRC has marshaled the resources, technology, and political will over the past two decades to strengthen and modernize the PLA in nearly every respect.” These capabilities have focused on air, naval, and missile systems that can target China’s periphery in a so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships. China began launching series production of fourth-generation fighter aircraft in the 2000s and now has more than 1,000 such aircraft in service. Series production of large modern warships (e.g., destroyers and frigates) did not begin until the mid-2010s, but progress since then has been even more striking. Between 2014 and mid-2020, China launched 25 Luyang III (Type 052Ds) destroyers and 8 Renhai cruisers. It is currently building its third aircraft carrier, which, at 80,000 tons, will be much larger than its first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2021 annual report to Congress found that decades of improvements by China’s armed forces “have fundamentally transformed the strategic environment,” weakening military deterrence across the Taiwan Strait and diminishing the position of the United States. The commission concluded, “Today, the [PLA] either has or is close to achieving an initial capability to invade Taiwan — one that remains under development but that China’s leaders may employ at high risk — while deterring, delaying, or defeating U.S. military intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive gains, China’s air and naval capabilities still lag behind aggregate U.S. capabilities in quality and breadth of capability. The fifth-generation aircraft of the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) suffer from the lack of a suitable domestically produced engine and have, therefore, only been produced in limited numbers. The PLA Navy (PLAN) lacks an adequate fighter for its carriers, and its submarine quieting technology remains immature. Despite recent growth, the sustainability and support capabilities of air-to-air refueling aircraft and amphibious warfare ships are limited. Perhaps most importantly, the PLA’s “software” (e.g., training, joint operations, and other human elements) is only beginning to adapt to the requirements of modern high-intensity warfare. PLA leaders are aware of and addressing all the organization’s weaknesses, and China watchers expect improvement in virtually all areas over time. Indeed, President Xi Jinping called for improving military readiness in his speech to the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, wars are not decided solely by aggregate or abstract capabilities. Geography generally favors China in the relevant scenarios. Taiwan’s coast is about 160 km (100 miles) from the Chinese mainland but more than 8,000 km from Honolulu and 11,000 km from San Diego. Flowing forces into the immediate theater would take far longer for the United States than for China. China also enjoys continental scale and strategic depth across which it can deploy or protect aircraft as battlefield needs dictate. The United States would be limited to a handful of air bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the United States benefits from maritime strategic depth, with the ability to operate from the more open spaces of the Western Pacific. Chinese naval forces would be more susceptible to detection in the confined seas adjacent to its territory. Perhaps most important, conducting an opposed amphibious assault is a hazardous and unforgiving undertaking under even the best of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-is-the-most-dangerous-us-china-flashpoint&quot;&gt;Taiwan Is the Most Dangerous U.S.-China Flashpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is widely regarded as the most dangerous potential flashpoint for conflict between the United States and China. In 1949, the nationalist government of China (under the Kuomintang party, or KMT) established an autonomous government on the island after being pushed off the mainland. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) thus regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no legitimate claim to autonomy or independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China and severing diplomatic relations with Taipei is a precondition for any country to establish diplomatic relations with China. As leaders and officials in Beijing are fond of repeating, China has never foresworn the use of force against Taiwan. To make the point, China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law outlines the circumstances under which China might employ force. A recent white paper by the Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council laid out the policy: “We are one China, and Taiwan is part of China. . . . We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert our utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification. But we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping’s report to the 20th Party Congress reiterated this policy: “Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this increasingly assertive attitude has been a practice of provocative military exercises. China increasingly flies masses of aircraft into the Taiwanese air defense identification zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese leaders have said they will not allow reunification to be postponed indefinitely, it is unclear what that means in practice. Much clearer is China’s commitment to demonstrating resolve when unwelcome events appear to move Taiwan further from unification — as China did with missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui visited the United States in June 1995 and recently with the military demonstrations during House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in the summer of 2022. The linkage of both events to the United States indicates the degree of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. . . . we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. — Xi Jingping&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity to discourage China from attacking Taiwan while also discouraging Taipei from taking actions that might incentivize such an attack. This is also called dual deterrence, as it aims to deter China from invading Taiwan and deter Taiwan from declaring independence. In accordance with the Three Communiqués with China, in 1972, 1979, and 1982, and the U.S. “One China” policy, the United States maintains formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, not Taipei. Nevertheless, it nurtures historically deep cultural and economic ties with Taipei. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States provides weapons that Taiwan needs to defend itself, although the United States has no formal obligation to defend Taiwan directly. A variety of additional agreements, laws, and documents link the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical relationship with Taiwan (now formally limited to economic and cultural engagement) creates a perception of obligation among many, a perception enhanced by Taiwan’s transition to vibrant democracy during the 1990s. Recently, President Joe Biden has sent clear deterrence signals to China without formally changing policy. When asked whether the United States was “willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that,” President Biden replied, “Yes, that’s the commitment we made.” President Biden has made such statements repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress, wanting to strengthen U.S. support of Taiwan, have proposed the Taiwan Policy Act, which would provide direct military aid and enhance Taiwan’s diplomatic status. Although the act did not pass, it did show strong congressional support for Taiwan. As evidence of a closer military relationship, reports have emerged that the United States has military planning cells on Taiwan. Although these appear to be limited, they constitute a direct military relationship that has not existed since 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing these leanings are official statements that U.S. policy has not changed. Indeed, the National Security Strategy reiterated the “One China” policy, as did a State Department statement. Further, there is a range of opinions within the United States on the wisdom of defending Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project does not take a position about whether the United States would or should become involved militarily in a conflict over Taiwan. It is enough to believe that, under certain conditions, the United States might intervene. An assessment of the outcomes of such an intervention is therefore valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasing-worries-about-an-imminent-chinese-attack&quot;&gt;Increasing Worries about an Imminent Chinese Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem — or preparing that capability in case called upon to act. Admiral Philip S. Davidson, commander of Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) until April 2021, testified that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” Current INDOPACOM commander Admiral John C. Aquilino, when asked for his opinion, stated that “this problem is much closer to us than most think.” Other military and civilian officials — for example, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Admiral Michael M. Gilday, chief of naval operations, and Admiral Charles Richard, head of Strategic Command — have expressed similar concerns. This is a broad narrative in the national security community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem. . . . Others are more cautious . . . The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian writers echo these concerns. Recent articles in the New York Times, Foreign Affairs, and the defense trade press have highlighted Chinese assertiveness about Taiwan and the risks of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Chinese specialist at Stanford University, observed, “In recent months there have been disturbing signs that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach [to Taiwan] and contemplating armed unification. . . . Whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility.” Lonnie Henley, a retired defense intelligence officer for East Asia at the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated before Congress that, “if the political leadership turned to the [PLA] today and said, can you invade right now, it’s my assessment that the answer would be a firm yes.” Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow go further: “China is now in a prewar tempo of political and military preparations. We do not mean that we know that China is about to embark on a war. We simply observe that the Chinese government is taking actions that a country would do if it were moving into a prewar mode.” Taiwan itself has entered the debate, with its defense minister saying that China would be able to launch a “full-scale invasion” by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others are more cautious and stress that it is difficult to impute intentions from improving capabilities. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed the statements made by other military leaders: “What Davidson and Aquilino and others have said is that Chinese capability to invade and seize the island of Taiwan is being accelerated to 2027, six years from now. I don’t dismiss that at all. . . but I don’t see it happening right out of the blue.” Christopher Johnson, a China scholar at CSIS, was more emphatic, saying that at the 2022 party congress Xi “held fast to the judgment that stability and economic growth continued to be dominant global trends” and that portrayals of Xi as “itching for war” were “overhyped.” Lonnie Henley qualified his own congressional testimony, writing separately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not think they [the Chinese] will attack Taiwan as long as they believe unification without war remains a viable course of action. They will attack, however, despite the enormous cost and despite any doubts about their own military capabilities, if they judge that peaceful unification is no longer possible, that military force is the only remaining option. That in turn is driven by their assessment of political developments in Taipei and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Heath similarly argues that “There is no evidence that the [Chinese] government is seriously contemplating abandoning its peaceful unification strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict. A CSIS study on surprise in war concluded that “wars happen” despite the dangers, uncertainty, and potential economic ruin. Nations miscalculate the military balance, get swept along in a crisis, feel that the balance of power is moving against them, or make national security choices based on domestic politics. As Colin Kahl, DOD undersecretary for policy, said: “I don’t think in the next couple of years that they’re likely to invade Taiwan, but you never know.” Although there is an ongoing debate about both Chinese capabilities and intentions, China’s determination to develop military options for use against Taiwan is widely accepted. A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parallels-and-differences-with-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Parallels and Differences with the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked a renewed interest in international conflict. The focus for the last generation has been on gray zone conflict and insurgency. The possibility of one country invading another to acquire territory seemed antiquated. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has reminded the world that cross-border invasions are possible. Speculation about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear parallels between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Russia and China believe that the target is not a sovereign state but a part of their country and should be reunited. Both are authoritarian (though of very different forms), and the target is democratic. In both cases, the United States and many global partners would support the potential victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also significant differences, including two that pertain directly to military deterrence. First, the United States has a longer and deeper history with Taiwan. It seems more committed to Taiwan’s defense than to that of Ukraine and, as discussed earlier, more likely to intervene directly. Second, the challenge to the Chinese military is much greater. It is harder to cross 160 km of water than to cross a land border, as Russia has done. Moreover, once a landing has begun, there is no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. Early on, the concern was that Russia’s success in Ukraine would embolden China. More recently, Russia’s military failure and the strong diplomatic reaction may discourage China. Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-currently-available-models-assessments-and-wargames&quot;&gt;Limitations of Currently Available Models, Assessments, and Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a building sense of crisis about the Taiwan Strait, the ability of Chinese forces to achieve operational objectives has not been adequately studied in the public domain. Previous analyses largely include unclassified models focusing on one aspect of an invasion, seminar-type games that educate players but do not provide an adequate analytic foundation for policy recommendations, political-military games that primarily investigate diplomatic and political issues, or classified wargames whose assumptions and even results are not transparent to the public. All of these analytical efforts have value, but none can answer the central question of this project: can China conquer Taiwan in a military invasion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. . . . Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-unclassified-analyses-and-assessments&quot;&gt;Existing Unclassified Analyses and Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars of military affairs and China have conducted several analyses and assessments that have contributed to understanding the military balance. These efforts have been invaluable resources for developing the project’s wargame. However, they do not purport to convert the data or insights into a wargame that would provide operational insights in a dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution and a long-time military analyst produced an assessment of China’s prospects for invasion in 2000. The assessment was detailed and analytical, concluding that an invasion was not possible at that time. However, as detailed above, much has changed in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian Easton’s 2019 book on the subject, The Chinese Invasion Threat, contains detailed information about geography and orders of battle but does not convert those into a model or wargame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael A. Glosny (2004), Bradley Martin et al. (2022), and O’Hanlon (2022) looked at a Chinese blockade of Taiwan rather than an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Biddle and Ivan Oelrich (2016) argue that surface ships will not be able to survive within 400 to 600 km of hostile coasts due to advances in A2/AD, but they do not go on to model an invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Military Scorecard (2015), published by RAND, assessed many elements of a potential invasion over time and in depth, though without aggregating them into a unified analysis. One of its conclusions was the need for a wargame: “Perhaps the most direct follow-on to this study would be the creation of a unified model to assess the interrelationships between the different scorecards.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wargames&quot;&gt;WARGAMES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organizations have conducted wargames that examine a possible U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. However, their focus has been on escalation dynamics and politics rather than analysis of military operational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) worked with NBC’s Meet the Press to broadcast a wargame on a notational 2027 Chinese invasion of Taiwan and, in June, published a corresponding report, Dangerous Straits. These provided compelling and insightful examinations of the political and military issues related to such a conflict, especially prewar deterrence, alliance management, nuclear signaling, political messaging, and escalation management. However, these games were not focused on operational outcomes. Furthermore, the structure of the CNAS game restricted the exercise to a single iteration with a single set of assumptions and a single set of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNAS conducted another game, described in a report, entitled The Poison Frog Strategy, developed from an earlier game exploring a Chinese seizure of Pratas Island/Dongsha Atoll and its international fallout. A game sponsored by Germany’s Körber Foundation, in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s Chatham House, examined the potential European response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The two games — CNAS and Körber — were similar in that they were single-instance seminar games that focused heavily on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters published an investigative report that was termed a wargame. The report presented several policy and governmental scenarios to describe possible escalatory paths for China and Taiwan. While this report was not a game in the customary sense, it did present several plausible scenarios based on expert opinions and illustrated its findings with excellent graphics. The report was also a good example of how broadly the term “wargame” is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these games provided useful policy insights. However, wargames specifically about military operational outcomes are needed as a complement. Unfortunately, all such wargames hitherto have been in the classified realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-transparency-from-classified-wargames&quot;&gt;Lack of Transparency from Classified Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has done much internal wargaming on a U.S.-China conflict, but the results are classified, with only a few details leaking out. These details hint at heavy casualties and unfavorable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a widely cited commentary, David Ochmanek, a senior RAND analyst, noted, “In our games, when we fight Russia and China, [the United States] gets its ass handed to it.” Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, similarly stated, “The Pentagon’s own war games reportedly show that current force plans would leave the military unable to deter and defeat Chinese aggression in the future.” Another report noted that a “secret wargame” showed that the United States could prevail in the conflict with China, but at the risk of causing nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding another wargame, General John E. Hyten, then-vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “[The U.S. warfighting concept] failed miserably. An aggressive China team that had been studying the United States for the last 20 years just ran rings around us.” This happened, at least in part, because “the blue team lost access to its networks almost immediately.” Unclear was what sort of cyberattack caused this loss of capability or what the China team did to “run circles” around the U.S. team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, Lieutenant General S. Clinton Hinote, the deputy chief of staff, strategy, integration, and requirements, headquarters, said that for over a decade, U.S. Air Force wargames had indicated that the Chinese were investing in military capabilities that would make the Air Force’s preferred model of expeditionary warfare “increasingly difficult.” “The trend in our wargames was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,” he said. He told reporters, “The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples indicate, these hints from the classified world do not specify the parameters of the games, including basic information such as when the war occurs, or the conditions and assumptions incorporated into the game. Many DOD wargames are set far in the future — not infrequently 20 years in the future — to grapple with future acquisition questions that often play out over decades. References to losses or challenges may not refer to operational outcomes, such as which side achieved its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising since those wargames are classified, and the restrictions are intended to keep sensitive data from potential adversaries. However, restrictions on describing game parameters make it impossible for outsiders to judge why the outcomes occurred, whether the game assumptions were reasonable, and whether alternative assumptions might produce different outcomes. Further, many of the reported results appear self-serving, as they support programs favored by the wargaming agency. Classified wargames also often focus on challenging cases, even if those cases are not particularly likely, to test the limits of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without transparency and independent assessment of the assumptions, it is impossible to judge a game’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-wargame-examining-operational-outcomes&quot;&gt;The Need for a Wargame Examining Operational Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan. This is important for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is disagreement about whether a defense of Taiwan could be successful. Any policy discussion must begin with baseline assumptions and resulting outcomes against which to measure change. The nature of the policy discussion depends heavily on the baseline. If China can take Taiwan in a day, that produces a different discussion than if Taiwan can hold out for weeks while the United States and its partners deploy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by examining a wide variety of scenarios, the project can provide insights into the most important conditions for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project provides the necessary descriptions and data for the broader national security community to discuss these critical issues of war and peace, deterrence, and national commitment. The Pentagon’s classified wargames do not help this broader discussion. Decisions relating to the defense of Taiwan are not just technical but involve judgments about values, priorities, and trade-offs. This project facilitates that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-project-does-not-do&quot;&gt;What the Project Does Not Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the project assesses the prospects of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan, it does not investigate other strategies that might be attractive. For example, China might blockade Taiwan and try to achieve its goals without an amphibious assault and all the attendant risks. Similarly, the United States might avoid a direct military confrontation but instead blockade China, intending the long-term pain to force the Chinese government to relinquish its gains. In some instances, the players might want to use nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China might bombard Taiwan for an extended period before launching an attack. This would allow China to isolate Taiwan, grind down Taiwan’s air and naval forces, and assemble a fleet of merchant ships to act as decoys and “missile sponges” in an attack. The historical analogy would be German air attacks on Great Britain in the summer of 1940. Even though the ocean barrier was narrow, Germany recognized that risks were great if opposing air and naval assets still operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each alternative approach has strengths and weaknesses. All entail less military risk and might be more attractive to a cautious Chinese leadership. The project does not take a position on what action is most likely. Indeed, there is no certainty that China will undertake any military action at all. However, invasion is the most dangerous threat to Taiwan and is thus the first course of action that needs to be analyzed, hence the relevance and importance of the current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams play as military command authorities rather than civilian commanders in chief. Thus, there is no political and nuclear decisionmaking within each game iteration by the teams. However, varying the structure of scenarios allows analysis of some alternative approaches in these areas. (The variables are discussed in detail in Chapter 5). For example, in some scenarios, concerns about nuclear escalation led to rules of engagement prohibiting the United States from attacking the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. This project assessed the potential costs of maintaining Taiwan’s autonomy but does not examine the benefits. Many commentators note the moral value of preserving a democracy of 23 million people and that a China-controlled Taiwan would complicate the defense of regional allies, including Japan and South Korea. An evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how the current analysis fits into a broader assessment of U.S.-Chinese relations. It is an important element but only one aspect of such an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. . . . [Such an] evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wargaming-as-a-method&quot;&gt;Wargaming as a Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project sought to produce a wargame that was transparent and analytically sound, such that decisionmakers and the public could use it to make decisions about policy. This chapter discusses the design decisions intended to produce such a game. A list of relevant terms and their definitions is in Appendix B, which details relevant wargaming lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analyzing military affairs, there has been a historical tension between quantitative modeling and qualitative judgments. Wargaming offers one tool to combine these two approaches. For a wargame aimed at analysis (instead of participant education or other purposes), quantitative models provide the best tools to base adjudications on because of their transparency and rigor. The decisionmaking of players adds human judgment to the interaction of these quantitative models, allowing for plausible sequences of events to be explored. To aggregate models and human decisionmaking in a structured way that addresses uncertain assumptions, analytic wargames should be varied and iterated. The results of a series of wargames thus constructed offer insights into the distribution of outcomes for a future conflict and how key variables impact this distribution. While it is not predictive, it provides data on plausible outcomes and facilitates informed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantitative-models-vs-qualitative-judgments&quot;&gt;Quantitative Models vs. Qualitative Judgments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision in beginning an assessment of a hypothetical future conflict is whether to use quantitative models, qualitative judgments, or some combination of the two. To assess the complex set of operations that would constitute an invasion of Taiwan, wargaming offers a good mix of rigor and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to analyze the future relies on judgments about uncertainty. This is especially true for warfare, which is chaotic and contingent on chance. For example, although there have been amphibious landings before, they are too few to generate quantitative models allowing for statistical confidence. Even issues of weapon performance, which should be the most amenable to analysis based on testing and modeling, require some judgment because such testing is conducted under peacetime conditions; there is, for example, no real-world data on the performance of a Chinese YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missile against an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. This uncertainty is only magnified when trying to appraise key factors such as the relative morale and training of forces. Every analysis of future war must therefore approach the problem with humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty aside, there are more basic analytic faults or pitfalls to be avoided. First are physically impossible faults: a prediction about a U.S.-China war that has 30 Ford-class carriers in the 2026 U.S. order of battle (OOB) is not factual. Second are faults that are physically possible but that overlook operational history, such as by having all 11 Ford-class carriers show up in a U.S.-China war without factoring some of them being in deep maintenance. While it is physically possible for the United States to have all 11 Ford-class carriers ready, such an analysis is less plausible than an analysis that accounts for historical factors, such as maintenance cycles and operational readiness. Most reasonable analytic disagreements occur in this space. Third is inflexibility about variation in assumptions: for example, ignoring the amount of warning available to the United States would miss important variation in how many carriers show up, where, and when. Any analysis based on one model or wargame would have difficulty addressing this problem. Fourth, analysis might restrict variables to quantifiable factors without exploring human decisionmaking: a model that has all carriers charge into the fight without concern for losses or changing tactics would ignore the human decisionmaking critical in warfare. Finally, analysis that is not transparent is impossible to dissect and debate. When considering methods of analysis and comparing them, all these factors must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways in which future conflicts are analyzed involves unstructured or loosely structured judgments. Unstructured judgments usually refer to sources about the relative strength of the concerned militaries and postulate a course of events, possibly based on analogy to an episode from military history. Loosely structured judgments may follow from simple quantitative comparisons (e.g., the total size of the contending militaries or the number of combat aircraft) that lack a structured assessment of how forces might interact dynamically over relevant time and space. While such judgments are easy to make, they allow little basis for discussion and lack replicability. When one person’s judgment conflicts with another’s, there is little ground for resolution. This leads to the requirement for methods of structured judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods of structured judgment, such as net assessment or the mission planning process, are helpful because they ensure that critical variables are not overlooked, and they allow for debate and scrutiny. For mission planning, junior officers in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are taught the METT-TC mnemonic (Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops, Time, Civilians) to avoid forgetting critical factors. There are many similar and more complicated planning processes across the services that all aim to structure judgment about a military situation. Net assessment, although usually used for strategic and longer-term evaluations, represents another methodology that is less rigid than military mission planning but still structured. For example, Eliot Cohen describes net assessment as “the appraisal of military balances” that operates through examining five critical questions. Cohen contrasts net assessment with quantitatively oriented methods of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military forces can also be analyzed with quantitative models. A model is “a mathematical or otherwise logically rigorous representation of a system or a system’s behavior.” While even loosely structured judgments may use numbers to support their argument, modeling adds rigor and transparency to these numbers and their interactions. Former secretary of defense Robert McNamara formalized the use of systems analysis in the DOD, principally to better inform the acquisitions process. During the Cold War, unified models (e.g., TACWAR and CEM) were developed to assess entire theater campaigns. These employed representations of ground attrition and movement, supplemented by simple calculations about the support provided by airpower. Some current campaign models (for example, JICM and STORM) incorporate sophisticated interactions and can employ imposing wills. However, all their results are classified and only run once, thus rendering them unsuitable for public discussion and sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While modeling of future conflicts can be done under the umbrella of systems analysis, in the scholarly community it is usually conducted in the framework of campaign analysis. Campaign analysis is “a method that involves the use of a model and techniques for managing uncertainty to answer questions about military operations.” While campaign analysis has been practiced by many scholars over the last several decades, it has recently been formalized by Rachel Tecott and Andrew Halterman. The essence of campaign analysis is specifying a scenario, building a model based on historical data, running that model, and analyzing the model for sensitivity to variation. Campaign analysis is particularly suited to studying questions of sufficiency, such as the adequacy of certain force postures to succeed in a particular military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, this difficulty contributed to debate between Cohen, who supported a broader framework of net assessment to address these and other uncertainties, and John Mearsheimer and Barry Posen, who supported using campaign analysis to evaluate specific operations analysis. Ideally, conflict analysis would combine the rigor and transparency of campaign analysis with human decisionmaking. One way to do this is with wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-wargames-for-different-purposes&quot;&gt;Different Wargames for Different Purposes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wargaming has a long history, its relationship to analysis and military decisionmaking is still unsettled. Wargames are increasingly used as pedagogic and research tools at universities, think tanks, and government agencies to examine security questions from crisis stability to regional conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite calls to increase the use of wargaming in policy analysis, it is often unclear what such usage should look like and how it best aids the national security debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current debate on the utility of wargames centers around their purpose. Experimental wargames aim to better understand human decisionmaking in a specific context. Educational wargames aim to foster decisionmaking simulations for military and political elites. Finally, analytic wargaming aims to analyze a military problem to better inform policy. Each of these represents a path that this project might have followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental wargaming aims to aid political scientists in the study of decisionmaking processes, particularly in international relations. Political science’s emphasis on experimentation and the desire to understand the micro-level processes of international wargames have led to the exploration of experimental wargaming. For example, Erik Lin-Greenberg conducted a series of wargames while varying whether a drone or a manned aircraft were shot down and, if a manned aircraft were shot down, what happened to the pilot. By manipulating a key variable and recording the discussions that ensued, the experimental wargame shed light on the ways that losses of drones might affect escalation risk differently than the losses of manned aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational wargaming aims to prepare leaders for decisionmaking in war. In the words of Peter Perla, “The choice of the best weapons and the men who will skillfully employ them is a major concern for the military and the nation. Wargames and wargaming are important tools for helping to sort through such choices.” In another formulation, Perla and McGrady write that wargaming’s strength is “its ability to enable individual participants to transform themselves by making them more open to internalizing their experiences in a game.” Francis J. McHugh argued for a subdivision between wargames that provide military commanders with decisionmaking experience and those that provide decisionmaking information. For example, playing a game about Napoleonic warfare might give contemporary military commanders decisionmaking experience, without giving them decisionmaking information about the war that they might have to fight in the future. Educational wargaming might therefore be subdivided into “experiential,” focusing on providing decisionmaking experience, and “current operations-oriented” games that focus on decisionmaking information. Regardless, educational wargames broadly favor the development of players over the use of wargames as analytic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analytic wargames exist to provide data about a specific problem that can be analyzed. Jon Compton has been the main proponent of this approach, calling for wargamers to take analytical ownership of national security problems. To do this, he argues for an analytic architecture that builds models based on evidence, which then feed into a wargame design that is vetted by subject matter experts; this game is then played iteratively by a small group of people to facilitate analysis. The use of quantitative models (in the sense of those used in campaign analysis) in wargames has not been a feature of many DOD wargames, causing some debate within the DOD wargaming community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of contemporary debate on wargaming centers on whether educational wargames are more helpful than analytic wargames for the national security enterprise. While both sides decry wargames that are a “bunch of guys sitting around a table,” they disagree on how to move forward. Perla advanced the idea of a “cycle of research” that integrates wargaming, analysis, and military exercises to illuminate the decisions, data, and actions relevant to contemporary warfighting. That is, wargames raise questions which are then to be explored through military exercises and mathematical analysis. Perla and co-authors reiterated the belief that wargaming could not take analytical ownership of a problem but that it should be mutually constitutive with exercises and analysis in informing policymakers, who would themselves own the problem. In line with Perla, McGrady argues that wargames function best as a storytelling device and not as a method of analysis. In riposte, Compton has written a fictional juxtaposition of his method with seminar-style educational wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of this report’s authors, different wargame purposes are not better or worse than others; the problem arises when a wargame is designed for one purpose but employed for another. When a wargame is designed to educate participants but is used as a basis of analysis, it results in wasted effort and faulty conclusions. The debate is not entirely a matter of misperception; some wargamers believe that wargames cannot serve certain purposes. Despite these disagreements, all agree that aligning the structure of a wargame to the purpose of a project is a key step in any wargaming effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-of-analytic-wargaming&quot;&gt;Principles of Analytic Wargaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project — to analyze the dynamics of a conventional invasion of Taiwan by China — led CSIS’s efforts to follow Compton’s analytical wargaming approach. The project does not purport to predict the future with certainty. However, the large number of game iterations, the variation of scenarios, and the adjudication based on evidence-based rules mean that policymakers and the public can reasonably use the range of outputs for making judgments about warfighting dynamics and policy choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating methods of campaign analysis with Compton’s suggestions for analytic wargaming, this wargame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used a variety of methods to create evidence-based models that determined adjudication;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated several models across domains to examine a campaign;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducted many iterations with varied strategies by both sides;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Varied key assumptions to examine their impacts on the outcome;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used players to account for human decisionmaking, explore many plausible pathways, and to inject variation into scenario outcomes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nested the wargame in broader analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-method-of-history-and-the-method-of-pks-to-create-evidence-based-rules&quot;&gt;Using the Method of History and the Method of Pks to Create Evidence-based Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in making an analytic wargame generate plausible outcomes is for the rules to be based on empirical data. The rules of educational wargames do not have to conform to reality in order to teach students about strategy. However, rules are how analytic wargames model reality. As mentioned above, it is impossible for the rules to be entirely certain because of the paucity of real-life cases of twenty-first century warfare. However, wargames based on rigorous modeling that recognizes physical constraints and operational realities will generate analytically valid insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two broad approaches to creating models: the method of history and the method of Pks. This project used both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history models the results of future military operations by making analogies with past military operations at the appropriate level of analysis. For example, this may include using the sorties per day of aircraft from Desert Storm to project the sortie rate per day of aircraft in a future conflict or allowing players to move land forces based on historical advance rates. This approach is popular both in campaign analysis and in commercial wargaming. Dunnigan, in a foreword to Perla, argues: “Basically, you obtain good games by paying attention to past experience (history) and letting the chips fall where they may.” However, history is not self-explanatory, and analogies can be misleading. A key question is one posed by Barry Posen: “What is this a case of?” For example, modeling the rate of advance for an infantry unit in urban terrain during heavy combat on a historical breakthrough operation by a mechanized force across plains would be inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pks method models the results of future military operations by assigning probabilities and values to the weapons systems and aggregating these capabilities up to the appropriate level. “Pks” means the probability of kill, a common measure of theoretical weapon efficacy. Every military operation is the result of an infinite number of micro-level interactions, such as the detection of enemies, the employment of weapons, and the result of a hit. While every interaction cannot be modeled, the method of Pks tries to model the likely effects of major weapons and their effects. This is more suited for air, naval, and missile combat than for ground combat. Data about the probabilities of detection, weapon hits, and weapons effects can be taken from historical data or weapons testing data. In the absence of better evidence, values can be taken from subject matter experts. These probabilities can be calculated separately or aggregated into a cumulative “probability of kill,” or Pk. With these values in hand, researchers model individual interactions, then aggregate the results of these interactions to the appropriate level for the analysis (e.g., individual dogfights, meetings between two aircraft flights, or even squadron-on-squadron engagements). Games conducted during the interwar period at the Naval War College addressed this problem by modeling “hit probabilities,” derived from real-world tests with bomber aircraft and warship guns, and then embedding those models into the larger operational wargames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history and the method of Pks both have strengths and weaknesses. The method of history does a good job of ensuring that models account for operational realities: allowing a tank battalion to advance according to the maximum speed of a tank, for example, ignores the operational reality that it is much harder to organize and direct an armored force. The method of history deals with problems of aggregation and unknown factors by getting plausible values at the appropriate level of analysis. In contrast, the method of Pks struggles to deal with these operational factors and cannot account for unquantifiable factors such as morale and friction. However, the method of history is not as good at accounting for changes in weaponry and technology or situations that lack good analogies; in contrast, the method of Pks excels here. For example, there is no historical precedent for mass precision-guided tactical ballistic missile attacks against defended targets that would allow the method of history to work. The method of Pks can be used to extrapolate upward from historical cases of single ballistic missile launches and from testing data on interceptors. The mixed virtues and vices of these methods means that researchers must be aware of and use each as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-ship-missile-interception&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anti-ship Missile Interception&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How frequently do anti-ship cruise missiles hit their targets? This project combines the methods of history and Pks to generate rules that are rigorous and evidence based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, based on missile attacks in Desert Storm, the project team estimates that 15 percent of missiles either fail to launch or otherwise malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team assumes that defenders will have sufficient warning to launch interceptors. The curvature of the earth restricts a radar on a 15-meter mast from seeing a missile skimming 5 meters above the sea until the missile is 20 kilometers from the ship. Depending on the tactical situation, the defending ships might also have airborne early warning (AEW) or organic helicopters to aid in initial detection. This project judges that this initial detection is sufficient to alert the crew, but that the defenders only have one engagement opportunity against a supersonic cruise missile traveling at approximately 2,400 km/hr. They would launch two interceptors in a salvo against each incoming missile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team further estimates that each interceptor launched by the defender has a 70 percent chance of hitting an incoming anti-ship cruise missile. While this number is supported in a variety of sources, it does strike the authors as optimistic. One excursion case explores what would happen if missile interception were not as effective. With two interceptors launched at each supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, there is therefore a 91 percent chance that at least one interceptor will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next, the project estimates that 10 percent of anti-ship missiles will experience terminal guidance failures. This 10 percent miss rate is taken from the historical record showing that 8.7 percent of anti-ship cruise missiles have missed undefended civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, terminal interception and electronic warfare will have a combined 70 percent effectiveness, based on historic attacks against military ships without interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project aggregates these probabilities into a table for game play. This combines the 15 percent failure to launch, 91 percent chance of success with interceptors, 70 percent effectiveness of terminal defense and electronic warfare, and 10 percent miss rate. The team further adds on two “fat-tails”: a 5 percent chance that the attacker has made a catastrophic error (e.g., gross target location error) and a 5 percent chance that the defender has made a catastrophic error (e.g., no AEW is overhead, or the crew does not react in time). This generates the table below. For each salvo of 25 incoming supersonic cruise missiles, a 20-sided dice is rolled against the table to determine the number of “leakers,” or missiles that hit ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IIvm8gk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Interception of Supersonic Anti-ship Cruise Missiles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a simple demonstration, 24 Chinese H-6 bombers launch a total of 96 YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles (grouped into four missile “salvoes” of 25 missiles each) at a U.S. surface action group of two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and a Ticonderoga-class cruiser. Rolling four 20-sided dice (one for each salvo) shows: 13, 3, 15, and 2. Referencing the table, three missiles leak through and hit U.S. ships. The project team assigns the hits randomly, this time getting that one missile hits each ship. This U.S. surface action group is now combat ineffective with all its ships either sunk or not mission capable. This serves as a good illustration how, even using optimistic assumptions, it is very hard to defend surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the method of Pks or history is used, these models can provide a grounding for plausible rules about combat. For example, a model of the result of two squadrons of aircraft can be used to generate a table of possible outcomes for such a combat in the game. A table of probable outcomes is preferable to a deterministic result because of the fat-tailed nature of combat results throughout history. Throughout this paper are examples of models and how they determined rules in the wargame. Most models for campaign analysis need only be aggregated (or disaggregated) to a level appropriate for a wargame. In that form, the wargame can serve to interact these models in an appropriate way for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;model-interactions&quot;&gt;MODEL INTERACTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transparency of modeling enables observers to review and vet models but requires a certain degree of simplification. This is easier to achieve when modeling a single domain (e.g., a ground campaign or air campaign) or when the variety of engagement types is limited (e.g., a submarine campaign involving passage through an acoustic barrier followed by ship hunting). As the variety of engagement types increases, the complexity of models may increase geometrically, and the difficulty of clear exposition and vetting will grow proportionately. This is true even when strategy, or the allocation of assets to particular tasks, is held constant throughout the model “run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the number of sub-routines increase when modeling a menu of operations within a single campaign, but decision rules also increase. When modeling a single type of interaction, there may be no need for the model to reallocate resources to new tasks. When modeling an air superiority campaign, for example, combat aircraft will remain allocated to the air superiority task (e.g., through offensive counter-air) for the duration of the model “run.” In cases where two tasks might be possible, a model can apply simple algorithms. So, in the preceding example, a model might assume that when a greater than 2:1 superiority is achieved in the number of aircraft “on station” in the air superiority fight, any additional aircraft will be dedicated to another task, such as ground support. However, such algorithms can quickly add complexity when they become numerous, which may ultimately undermine transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these issues, most campaign analyses have addressed the critical portions of larger campaigns. While it is possible to model operations down to the size of boots worn by each soldier, such a level of complication would be unlikely to shed light on the course of the wider campaign. However, precision is not the same as accuracy. The modeler relies on their judgment and the literature to identify which areas demand precision, and which can be treated abstractly. With these areas identified, they can be modeled in turn. RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard, for example, contains chapters that address 10 critical aspects of the larger U.S. China competition, but it does not attempt to knit them together into an overarching whole. In the academic domain, too, there have been several attempts to model individual aspects of conflict in Asia but no attempts to model an entire conflict, despite the fact that China is the so-called “pacing threat” for the United States. Wargaming can help with this holistic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, wargames do not inherently require different models. A basic wargame might have players control only one type of force, such as aircraft. All aircraft need not be similar, but they need to operate within the framework of the same model, which would specify an attrition rate that occurs when different types of aircraft meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such a basic wargame is appropriate only if the chosen pieces are the only significant parts of a conflict. Surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) are a critical element of contemporary air combat; a wargame or model of air combat that failed to account for SAMs would be incomplete. The same is true of major surface combatants, which largely function as floating SAMs. But if surface combatants are included, then the major ways in which they can be attrited must also be included: other surface ships, submarines, and anti-ship missiles. This produces a complex system wherein dozens of models must interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargaming allows models to interact in an intelligent way. The models-based rules create grounds for adjudicating the results of various interactions, from what happens when an aircraft squadron flies into an SAM to the likelihood that a submarine sinks a surface ship. The specific events that generate scenarios for adjudication come from intelligent decisionmaking from human players. An attempt to simulate an entire war as an ensemble of models would likely see extreme results from actions that humans would recognize as blunders. For example, one could model aircraft attacking ships with the longest-range munition they have, while ships defend themselves with their longest-range munition. At some point, the aircraft run out of their longest-range missiles, while a significant inventory of the ship’s longest-range missiles remains. The merciless logic of the model drives the aircraft into the ships to be completely annihilated; an intelligent player on a wargame would redirect the aircraft to a different target. A wargame allows for some check on these interactions. Furthermore, analytic wargaming allows for flexibility with an inherently modular approach to modeling conflict. Depending on the operations research that shapes the game rules, more models can be created for elements that the literature finds to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these interactions between models provide data for analysts to form qualitative judgments. For example, the air-to-air fight impacts anti-submarine warfare (ASW) by determining what level of risk maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) face in various geographic areas. If the air-to-air fight is going poorly for one side, their ASW efforts might suffer accordingly because of less MPA coverage. The quantitative results provide the basis for qualitative judgments about the effects of one domain on another. By providing a way for rigorous and transparent models to interact in an intelligent way, wargames provide a valuable aid to analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iteration-to-examine-a-variety-of-strategies&quot;&gt;Iteration to Examine a Variety of Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite often being overlooked in modeling, no discussion of combat outcomes can ignore the strategies of the respective commanders. For example, in 1939–40, the French outnumbered the Germans in troops and equipment, including tanks. However, the best Anglo-French formations moved north as Germany struck through the Ardennes to the south. The result was an encirclement of the French army and ultimately French defeat. Generalship matters. Months after the fall of France, Germany’s own plans fell short during the Battle of Britain. Although the Luftwaffe outnumbered the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe leaders failed to appreciate the significance of British radar stations and aerial command and control. As a result, they were unable to translate their superiority in matériel into air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor are recent examples lacking. In the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia enjoyed many initial advantages, including larger and more modernized forces. Nevertheless, Russia’s initial plan for the invasion, to include the occupation of Kiev, greatly exceeded the capacity of its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing a comprehensive set of possible results is impossible, focusing on the most likely and plausible interactions can produce an analytically sound and useful set of outcomes. With so many models interacting, there is no way to exhaustively explore all the possible decision points short of a massive computing effort. Even chess has a lower bound of 10120 possible games, despite only having 32 pieces and 64 legal positions. The ability to exhaustively analyze a series of models by exploring all possible decisions to see the distribution of possible outcomes likely lies in the distant future. Similarly, there are promising efforts to train computers to play games through millions of iterations, such as AlphaStar. While more plausible in the near term, these efforts still require large teams of expert programmers. Short of a focused government effort, this is not feasible for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, iteration allows some of the most plausible lines of play to be explored. The project generated these plausible lines of play by having many different players participate in game iterations. To continue with the example of chess, there may be 10120 possible games, but most of those follow nonsensical decisions, such as allowing a queen to be taken by a pawn. Moreover, while there are many possible openings, almost all competitive openings follow the movement of the d- or e-pawn and efforts to control the center. The goal of iterative wargaming should not be seen as an effort to exhaustively explore all possible outcomes but rather as a way to assess the major lines of play that result from intelligent decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying strategies over multiple iterations of a wargame generates data on the likely interactions between plausible strategies. One wargame may not be illustrative of the overall contours of the problem due to an a priori reasonable strategy being chosen that turns out to be suboptimal. For example, in one iteration of this project’s wargame, the Chinese invasion fleet was destroyed in one turn after the Chinese player chose a strategy of defending their coastline while simultaneously invading Taiwan. If that was the first and only wargame that was played, a highly erroneous conclusion would be reached. Repeated play of the scenario using different Chinese strategies showed that the Chinese invasion fleet being destroyed on the first turn is an outlier. Many other strategies that China could choose would lead to outcomes much more favorable to China. This case illustrated the importance of iteration to try multiple strategies, lest the insights from a single scenario are misguidedly based on a particular strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of having outside players participate is that they will try novel strategies that did not occur to the principal investigators. It is easy for the wargame creators to try a few strategies and then settle into a local optimum that they believe represents best play of the scenario. Outside players inject mutation into the play of the game with their own ideas about how to play. Like genetic mutation, most of these new ideas are maladaptive. However, some are successful and represent advances on best play. Some required additional research and the design of new scenarios to test (in a way suggested by J. Peter Scoblic and Philip E. Tetlock). This process of mutation, iteration, and refinement helps to explore the seams of the possible and plausible outcomes of the wargame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variation-of-key-assumptions-to-explore-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Variation of Key Assumptions to Explore Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the future must explore how sensitive results are to variations in assumptions. For example, wars begin in different ways. While most wars are preceded by a state of crisis, if a defender is surprised and has not mobilized their forces, this will have a dramatic effect on the subsequent campaign. Political factors are often unclear before the clash of forces and could lead in multiple directions, such as whether the British would intervene when the Germans invaded Belgium in World War I. Weapon systems might perform far differently in combat than expected, such as the Mark 14 torpedo in World War II. An analysis that does not explore key uncertainties risks building a detailed argument on a foundation of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating wargames in different scenarios with different assumptions for key variables allows for sensitivity analysis. A variable is a condition likely to have an impact on the analysis about which the analysis must make an informed assumption. In the same way that campaign analysis begins by specifying a scenario, this study refers to each bundle of assumptions for each variable as a scenario. For example, an invasion of Taiwan where China achieves operational surprise is one scenario; an invasion wherein operational surprise is not achieved is another. A new scenario is created when any assumption about a variable is changed: operational surprise with missile defense working is a different scenario than operational surprise without missile defense working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables should reflect the purpose of the game. For example, in the services’ “Futures Wargame,” designed to test alternative force structures against one another, two iterations of the same scenario, one incorporating force structure from the so-called DOD program of record and one reflecting an alternative set of forces, were selected by experts and officers over a period of months. Thus, in the “Futures Wargame,” all elements of the game that are not related to order of battle should, to the extent possible, be kept equal. However, analytic wargames exploring other research questions require varying other assumptions between scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change. The project team does not claim that this leads to a causally identified finding, which is the goal of experimental wargamers. However, it is possible to observe the impact of changing the assumptions about certain variables: for example, if Japan allows U.S. basing, then the outcome is likely to be more favorable for the United States than if basing is denied. More importantly, it allows for researchers to develop better judgments about the relative importance of these uncertainties: is Japanese basing more or less impactful on the outcome than Philippine basing? (Yes, as discussed in Chapter 8.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to model all potential values of all variations. With 25 variables eventually identified by the project team that could take on binary values, that leads to 225 possible combinations, or approximately 33.5 million scenarios. Obviously, this is beyond the capability of human analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables can be informed by previous literature or from insights generated during play. The question of which variables to include is the same problem that confronts efforts to make historical analogies. While no historical case is ever 100 percent analogous to another, it is possible to make inferences as long as they are similar enough in the most relevant variables.107 The variables of study must therefore both be uncertain and likely to have a high impact on the outcome. For example, in this project it became clear that the effectiveness of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) against moving ships was a critical factor in the outcome of the game after playing several iterations. A close review of the literature showed that this effectiveness was unclear. The project team therefore decided that the effectiveness of the JASSM was an important variable to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional variables came from players who participated in game iterations. They surfaced some of former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s “unknown unknowns,” factors that the game designers had not anticipated. Wargaming can help explore these “unknown unknowns” by facilitating brainstorming about key variables among players who then help to shape future scenarios by including important variables that the researchers did not think of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-participants-make-intelligent-decisions-generate-mutation-and-shape-assumptions&quot;&gt;Human Participants Make Intelligent Decisions, Generate Mutation, and Shape Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of having human participants is to focus on the most plausible lines of play. As discussed above, the number of models, variables, and decisions in play make it impossible even for the most powerful computers to examine all possible lines of play for a game. Players of a game must choose the most promising courses of action. They can choose these lines based on knowledge of the actual countries’ doctrines, historically similar campaigns, and their own strategic intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to have a core group of players who have been involved in the game design. First, they are most familiar with the weapons systems and capabilities that go into the wargame, helping them to avoid blunders. The actual participants in a real-life conflict would be similarly familiar with their capabilities, so this allows for more plausible play. Second, the core group of players will know what broad courses of action have been used before and how they interact. This allows iterations to focus on lines of play that have been found to be more promising, rather than redoing earlier attempts at lines that have been found lacking. Finally, a core group of players can cycle through iterations much quicker than outside players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, outside participants are helpful in two ways. First, as discussed above, new players can inject mutation into strategies used by the core team. After several iterations, it is common for the core team to settle into a local optimum of strategies that they believe is best for both sides. New players can try new strategies that the core team finds unintuitive, shaking the game from its local optimum toward a global optimum. To integrate their intent with the game mechanics, the project provided each team with an “operations officer” from the staff. Second, outside participants can bring their knowledge into the game to refine the models underlying the rules. This is particularly the case when the number of outside participants in each game iteration is low (two to four). That allows each player to give in- depth feedback on any subject in which they have expertise. Several participants with experience in Pacific operations pointed out that current policy is to keep a continuous submarine presence in the Philippine Sea. The project, therefore, adjusted its order of battle to reflect this insight. This feedback means that there are slight changes that occur to the rules throughout the life of the project; however, this is compensated for by the increased fidelity of the project’s models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nesting-wargame-results-into-analysis&quot;&gt;Nesting Wargame Results into Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers of missiles fired and aircraft destroyed in any iteration are descriptive data, not analytic outcomes. The results of any of these runs are contingent on a multitude of factors beyond the underlying models, including the makeup of players and previous decisions in that game. For example, take two iterations whose scenarios were the same except for the assumption about Taiwanese ground force competence. The players in one iteration decided to use their missile inventory as quickly as possible, but the players in the other iteration decided to conserve their inventory. This difference had nothing to do with the changing assumption about the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence: the difference was produced solely by differences in the participants, or it could even have been the same participants wanting to try something different. It would be a mistake to conclude that the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence has a significant effect on the rate of missile expenditures. Thus, the quantitative data out of each iteration should not be seen as statistically significant projections about the future but as illustrative of the corpus of wargames that a project creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargames produce qualitative insights among the investigators, which must then be situated in an analytic framework. This framework should focus on not only the ebb and flow of events generally but also a description of how differing assumptions about variables impact the likely outcome of a conflict. Two factors make variables relatively more or less important: their impact on the outcome and the degree of confidence in their values. The analysis thus comments on the general impact of variables rather than the specific outcomes of games. To paraphrase President Dwight D. Eisenhower, “Wargames are worthless, but wargaming is indispensable” — the specific outcome of each iteration is not predictive of the future, but the process of wargaming is indispensable to analyzing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analytic wargames must be careful not to make assertions outside of their scopes or to confuse the insights of the wargame with the insights of their modelling. A wargame about the outcome of an invasion of Taiwan cannot claim to grant insights about the operational impacts that Chinese control over Taiwan would have on the defense of Japan; such speculation is outside of the scope of analysis. Separately, an insight such as that China likely has enough ballistic missiles to cover the tarmac of all the military airfields in Japan does not come from the wargame: it comes from the modeling and the assumptions that went into the modelling. While the analytic insights of wargames are valuable, they must be appropriately scoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;Building the Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the methodological principles developed in Chapter 2 in mind, the project set out to develop a wargame to answer the questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision was whether to adapt an existing system for this project. As mentioned earlier, CNAS and the Körber Foundation have run similar wargames. Both games featured adversarial play between two teams of experts in conflicts with China. However, their focus on escalation dynamics and political decisionmaking made them unsuited for adaptation to this project’s methodology, which deals with political decisionmaking by varying scenarios across iterations. The different purposes of the projects meant that this study could not adapt their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several commercial wargames are more operationally focused and have either a Taiwan invasion at the center of the game (Next War: Taiwan) or a Taiwan scenario as part of a larger conflict (Breaking the Chains). Although designed primarily for entertainment, these games are often the product of deep research and thoughtful mechanics. As a result, they have been used in professional military education (PME).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several elements inherent to commercial games rendered them unsuitable for this project. First, commercial games, as a rule, balance playability and analytic rigor. This means that an important part of commercial wargame design is ensuring that both sides of the game have a path to victory, even if the balance of forces means that one side realistically does not have a way to win if both players are equally skilled (and lucky). The purpose of this project was to test outcomes of a notational invasion of Taiwan by China using the project team’s best estimate of forces available, national policies, equipment capabilities, and combat results. That may or may not produce a balanced result (in fact, it did not). For players, it can be deeply unsatisfactory to participate in a game if the prospects for victory are remote. However, that might be the correct analytic outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, commercial wargames do not reveal the assumptions and calculations for their force lay down and combat interactions. Although these are often sophisticated, the lack of transparency makes relying on them problematic. Is a particular outcome the result of analysis or a desire to balance play? Are calculations based on historical data, test data, or the developer’s judgment? At the same time, the project team’s review of the available commercial games suggested that important elements, especially air combat and attacks on air bases, were not represented rigorously. Next War: Taiwan focuses primarily on the ground campaign on the island, and Breaking the Chains focuses primarily on naval combat, generally between relatively small forces. Because of these issues, the project team needed a game where it understood and could stand behind every one of the game elements and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar difficulties exist with adapting semi-official wargames, such as Assassin’s Mace, an operational-level wargame designed to simulate future war in the Western Pacific between 2025 and 2050. It uses the sophisticated Operational Wargame System developed by Tim Barrick and Mark Gelston. An invasion of Taiwan is one of the several scenarios available. The game integrates multiple warfare domains, including those outside of traditional military operations such as cyber and satellite intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Assassin’s Mace is intended to provide PME to field-grade officers and, to this end, requires a significant amount of professional knowledge in participants. Given the audience and purpose, this game is granular in design. It is very well designed for its purpose, and it has entered wide use in U.S. War Colleges as a tool for teaching joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like commercial board games, Assassin’s Mace was unsuited to this project’s purposes because of discrepancies between its rules and the project team’s modelling. For example, within the Assassin’s Mace game rules, the F-35 and J-20 both attack at 12 and defend at 7, meaning that both aircraft roll a 12-sided die to attack and must score a 7 or greater to destroy the other. This means that there is a 50 percent chance that an attack will destroy the other, or a 50 percent attrition rate. Given that the historical attrition rate per sortie in most conflicts is less than 1 percent, and only 2 percent for the particularly intense Battle of Britain, the project team would use a lower attrition rate. This is not to disparage the Operational Wargame System but to demonstrate how its rules produce different operational outcomes than the project team’s research would suggest. However, given the official nature of the Operational Wargame System, it might be reasonable to wonder if it (or any government wargame) is inherently superior to civilian wargames due to the possession of non-public information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-question-of-classified-data&quot;&gt;The Question of Classified Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used only unclassified data so that its results can inform public debate. Some observers, particularly within the government, might argue that accurate modeling is impossible without access to classified data. However, classified data is not necessary for the construction of a credible wargame. Although classified data might help tweak certain parameters (e.g., missile ranges, intercept probabilities, and submarine detection capabilities), they would not change the fundamental structure of the game or the outcomes. The reasons are threefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, much information that was previously classified is now available from open sources. For example, The Military Balance by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) provides detailed equipment numbers, while Jane’s databases provide detailed information about equipment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Earth provides information about facilities that required U-2 flights during the Cold War. The team used Google Earth to determine the number and location of Chinese underground airfields, the size of parking ramps, and other parameters of air bases. Although classified imagery might refine this information, unclassified information is more detailed and accurate than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, classified data is not necessarily correct data. It is vulnerable to a lack of probing and testing because of restricted access. Indeed, bureaucratic and political forces may require government actors to accept weapons testing data that does not account for the friction that can greatly diminish weapons effectiveness in the real world. For example, classified Air Force testing projected a 92 percent hit rate for the AIM-9J missile before its fielding in Vietnam; analysis after the war found that its actual hit rate was 13 percent. A similar result was obtained in the infamous U.S. torpedo scandal of World War II. These mistakes were possible because projections of future conflicts require making assumptions about events that have never happened and classification prevented the usual vetting of these projections. No squadron of F-35s has ever engaged a squadron of J-20s; predicting the result of such an engagement relies on assumptions, regardless of classification level. Most of the parameters in the project’s wargame are based on historical data; classified information might help refine these assumptions but would not replace the importance of historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the appropriate use of historical data can sometimes be more accurate in modeling future conflicts than classified information about specific weapons systems. Before Desert Storm, classified models using accurate weapons performance data predicted 20,000 to 30,000 casualties. However, private commentators predicted fewer casualties, based on data from Israel’s Six-Day War. Although the classified models had more accurate weapons capability data, they modeled the Iraqis as fighting as competently as the Soviets. The open-source models accounted for the poorer operational competence of Arab militaries, which more than made up for their deficiencies in classified weapons performance data. Thus, open-source models have value beyond their intrinsic transparency and public accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philosophy-of-the-base-model&quot;&gt;Philosophy of the Base Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section lays out the key design choices that the project made and explains the reasons for the choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use rules rather than judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed in Chapter 2, models for analytic wargaming must be built in a rigorous manner on the best available open-source information. These models can be based either on the method of history or the method of Pks (see previous chapter). However, they must create a comprehensive set of rules that minimizes the influence of judgment. Of course, sometimes players will create situations that are plausible but unanticipated. In these cases, some judgment by the umpires is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate only demonstrated capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The game is based on capabilities that the countries involved have demonstrated or have concrete plans to field. Players often had imaginative initiatives for cyber, special operations, and new systems, but the game did not include these unless the relevant country had demonstrated those capabilities. The relatively near time horizon of the game (2026) limits how many new capabilities might be fielded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are classified programs that might produce relevant capabilities. Some details about these programs have leaked out and have been incorporated into the game. Most elements would be fielded and operationally significant numbers after 2026, if fielded it all. However, this uncertainty is present in all discussions of national security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume China has decided to invade.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the purpose of the game is to assess the outcome of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the game assumes that the CCP has made the decision to launch such an attack. The Chinese government could reach such a decision for a variety of reasons related to domestic politics, faulty intelligence, inaccurate military assessments, and international pressure that would not align with an outsider’s military or political assessment. External factors might also drive the decision. For example, Taiwan could move toward a declaration of independence, or the United States might begin permanently stationing troops on the island. The premise that China decides to invade is not a prediction but rather a tool that sets up the research question about whether such an invasion might succeed. However, the scenario is plausible given the concerns about such a Chinese course of action, as described in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use base and excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; The project developed a base scenario wherein all variables took their most likely values. Excursion scenarios explored key parameters about which there were plausible alternative assumptions. For example, the base case for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) employability was that it could target ships at sea. An excursion scenario restricted JASSM-ER employability to stationary land targets. This approach allowed the project to explore the sensitivity of wargame results to changes in assumptions. (The next chapter discusses the base scenario and excursion cases in detail.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore diplomatic and political conditions with excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the game play was primarily concerned with operational factors that affect military outcomes, the project accounted for political inputs as variables that were manipulated by control between iterations. It is possible to either model the political behavior of states through expert discussions during game play or to employ stochastic models (e.g., rolling a die to determine if a neutral country joins the conflict). However, such modeling is problematic. More important from the perspective of the project was the need to maintain a degree of control over game inputs so that a range of conditions could be examined. Rather than integrating these factors into the rules, this project explores them with excursion scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these political factors, the project identifies the most plausible outcomes, binned into a few meaningful categories. For example, consider the Japanese decision to enter the war. Discussions with experts led the project team to believe that the base case was that Japan would most likely enter the war only if Japanese bases or U.S. bases in Japan were attacked. This base case assumption was therefore used for most games. Certain excursion scenarios explored what would happen if Japan joined the United States from the first day of China’s invasion or if Japan never joined the war. Although there are in reality an infinite number of permutations on this critical factor, creating a few meaningfully different categories for assumptions and playing iterations with different assumptions allows the project to explore the effects of these highly uncertain yet important factors. Additionally, there are some plausible political decisions — such as the decision to surrender — that are possible but that cannot be usefully wargamed; those lie outside the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; The game focuses on combat around Taiwan and in the Western Pacific region that could affect such combat on the island. It abstracted operations in the South China Sea to maintain focus on Taiwan. These battles would unfold as the East Coast units of the U.S. Navy arrived in the region, having traveled via the Suez Canal. Chinese forces would attempt to block these U.S. forces from approaching Taiwan. Some Chinese forces are not available for the invasion of Taiwan, being stationed in the south to guard against such actions. As U.S. forces arrive, China must withdraw forces from other regions, including those attacking Taiwan, to maintain defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;The Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains specific design parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;time-scale&quot;&gt;TIME SCALE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn in the game is 3.5 days — the time increment needed to simulate enough real-world time to produce an estimate of the result of the battle and be playable in a single day. Multi-day games would take too long to run 24 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the invasion of Okinawa, a much smaller island than Taiwan, took two months and three weeks, the time scale had to allow exploration of several weeks of combat. This also gave insights into how depleting munition stockpiles affected the conflict: both sides had enough high-end missiles to launch continuously for several days, but what happens when those are gone? The 3.5-day turns allowed the project to get further into the battle than games with smaller time increments, which was critical for the study’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time scale required trade-offs to get through weeks of combat in a timely manner. First, it required some amount of aggregation: instead of modeling every aircraft, the game modeled aircraft squadrons. Second, it does not allow for as granular decisionmaking: players have to give general instructions for half of a week and cannot adjust their orders for day two based on the results of day one. Third, it required a specific sequencing in resolution for accuracy: for example, a surface ship traveling 30 knots could cover the entire game board in 3.5 days, but an enemy would almost certainly detect and react to such a charge within that time period. Sequencing combat resolution in a specific way allowed such interactions. However, weighed against the analytic benefits of the longer time scale, these disadvantages were judged to be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-map&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL MAP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air and naval combat in the Taiwan Operational Wargame (TOW) unfolds on an operational map of the Western Pacific. Hexes on the map are approximately 600 km (roughly 370 miles) from side to side. Each hex is colored according to its distance from Taiwan and numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each map hex lists the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can park on military and dual-use airport tarmac;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can be housed in underground hangars and hardened aircraft shelters (HASs); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of SAM battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placed on the map are counters representing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aircraft squadrons (representing 24 tactical aircraft and 12 large aircraft);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ground forces that have been moved between hexes;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surface ship task forces; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squadrons of four submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-launched-missiles&quot;&gt;Ground-Launched Missiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is a formidable force. Thus, each game turn begins with ground-based missile attacks. These missiles primarily target U.S. and Japanese surface ships and air bases. To speed up play, China’s war-opening joint fires strike on Taiwan was modeled and pre-adjudicated in every iteration. This strike employs much of China’s short-range ballistic missile inventory and would largely destroy Taiwan’s navy and cripple its air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground-launched anti-ship missiles are also a key element in the fight. Besides indigenous Hsiung Feng II and III missiles, Taiwan is procuring 100 Harpoon launchers and 400 Harpoons. These have the potential to inflict significant attrition on China’s amphibious force. Rather than having players specify an attack for these, the project models their likely use and effects on China’s fleet in each turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-amphibious-lift&quot;&gt;Chinese Amphibious Lift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key output of the operational fight is the number of units that China can place on Taiwan in a 3.5-day turn. Rather than modeling specific waves of landings, the project models lift as the thousands of tons that China can transport across the strait over 3.5 days. Each battalion requires a certain number of tons, depending on whether it is leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, or engineer. Once China moves troops onto Taiwan, it must also keep them supplied, which progressively reduces the number of new formations that can be transported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four ways China moves troops onto Taiwan: amphibious landing, air assault, airborne, and via captured facilities. Amphibious landing over suitable beaches constitutes the primary way that China moves forces in an initial assault. The amount of amphibious lift decreases as major ships are sunk. Air assault with helicopters is limited to the extreme west of Taiwan due to range considerations, while airborne landings with paratroopers can occur anywhere on the island. Both methods are slowly attrited by anti-air artillery and man-portable SAMs, but attrition increases greatly if China’s air superiority is degraded. Ports and airfields enable the use of more varied ships and aircraft to accelerate the transport of troops ashore. The United States may attack these facilities to deny their use after Chinese capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-naval-combat&quot;&gt;Air and Naval Combat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players issue orders for their air and naval forces. These orders unfold over the course of the 3.5-day turn. These orders therefore must allow aircraft and ships to execute missions not only once but as frequently as they can over the course of the turn. For example, orders to fly combat air patrol (CAP) result in coverage as frequently as aircraft can sortie, ASW sweeps reflect the coverage of a hex that can be achieved through constant searching over 3.5 days, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;air-forces&quot;&gt;AIR FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft are represented by counters. For fighter/attack aircraft, there are three categories: fourth generation (non-stealthy, no Active Electronically Scanned Array [AESA] radar), 4.5 generation (non-stealthy, AESA radar), and fifth generation (stealthy, AESA radar). Fighter/attack counters represent standardized squadrons of 24 aircraft. Most of Taiwan’s aircraft would be destroyed in the initial bombardment by China, but some would survive in their underground hangars on the eastern side of the island. Bombers are grouped into legacy and stealth bombers, and counters represent a standardized 12-aircraft squadron. Tankers and airlift are also tracked in squadrons of 12. Testing showed that categorizing aircraft by generation greatly facilitated game play at only slight cost in terms of fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighter/attack aircraft and bombers perform four missions in the game. First, they can try to establish air superiority with CAP, patrolling over the battlefield 24/7. Proximity to the battlefield is critical to establishing continuous CAP, as an hour spent flying to and from the battle area is an hour when an aircraft is not on station conducting the mission. Therefore, the distance between a squadron’s base and its target hex (usually Taiwan) and the amount of tanking available are key determinants in the time on station for fighter/attack squadrons performing CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, aircraft can perform strike missions by attacking air bases, surface ships, ground units, and critical infrastructure. If there is adversary CAP over the target, then escorts are needed to defend the attackers. The choice of munitions for aircraft conducting these missions is critical. In the early stages of the war, sophisticated and long-distance cruise missiles are available, but as these inventories are depleted, aircraft must use shorter-range munitions and accept more risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, aircraft can perform ground support. This is divided between close air support near the front line of troops and interdiction at a distance from the front line to slow enemy movement. Both missions require flying over enemy ground troops and therefore involve risk from SAMs. They also require longer loiter times over the ground than strike missions, meaning that they can only be conducted when there is friendly air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, aircraft can rebase to different hexes. All reinforcements arriving in theater must initially rebase. Units in theater can also rebase. Based on peacetime exercise reports, the game assumed that it takes approximately a game turn to set up operations and maintenance facilities at new bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-surface-forces&quot;&gt;NAVAL SURFACE FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval surface forces are represented in surface action groups (SAGs), carrier strike groups (CSGs), lightning carrier groups (LCGs), and amphibious groups. The size and composition of these forces vary by nation, as the United States, China, and Japan all have different fleet compositions (as mentioned above, the Taiwanese surface fleet would be largely destroyed in the initial phases of a conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGs can launch anti-ship missiles at enemy surface ships, launch cruise missiles at ground targets, or conduct ASW; however, their primary value is in intercepting enemy missiles and aircraft. (China’s large surface fleet has several potent SAMs, which pose a threat to U.S. and Japanese aircraft. U.S. and Japanese SAGs can similarly threaten Chinese aircraft while also potentially intercepting some of China’s tactical ballistic missiles, or TBMs.) However, after their missiles are depleted, ships must return to port and rearm, during which time they are vulnerable. All SAGs can also conduct ASW, which is a particular specialty of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JMSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;submarines&quot;&gt;SUBMARINES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are grouped into squadrons of four submarines. Diesel submarines, due to their shorter endurance compared with nuclear submarines, generally 30 to 45 days, must constantly rotate back to port for refueling and resupplying. Both Chinese and Japanese diesel submarine squadrons on the board therefore represent four submarines actively hunting and four submarines transiting back and forth from the hunting ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines can hunt other submarines. The United States and Japan begin with some submarines forming a barrier on the first island chain, intercepting Chinese submarines and inflicting attrition on them. They are aided by U.S. and Japanese MPA. Conversely, China can assign some submarines to intercept U.S. nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) approaching the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are potent threats to surface ships and can engage them with torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). The speed of SSNs makes them much more effective at searching the open ocean. U.S. SSNs can hunt Chinese amphibious shipping in the Taiwan Strait (JMSDF submarines would not be able to concurrently hunt in the strait due to battlespace management issues). Their effectiveness there is diminished by Chinese corvettes and MPA actively conducting ASW, as well as a barrier at the entrance/exits to the strait comprised of Chinese submarines and minefields that China plants over the course of the opening weeks. Chinese submarines would not enter the strait itself in order to make it a free fire zone for these ASW forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;CYBER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game included cyber at the operational level. Both sides have cyber exploits they can use against the other. These exploits are modeled as system penetrations that passively grant intelligence while they are undetected. However, teams can activate these exploits to conduct cyberattacks, thereby generating one-time effects. Once these active effects are used, the exploit is assumed to be identified and patched. The previously discussed restriction of the game to proven capabilities means that these effects, while potent, are not magic wands. For example, power can be shut down at some ports to degrade Chinese amphibious lift, but there is no ability to destroy all of China’s electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game did not include strategic cyber affects that might affect the U.S. homeland or military command and control systems. These effects might have operational impact in the Western Pacific but lie beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-combat-map&quot;&gt;Ground Combat Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground combat occurs on a different scale than the air and missile combat that dominates the operational map. While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire. Thus, the ground map of Taiwan uses hexes measuring 30 kilometers (19 miles) across and uses the same 3.5-day turns. Within each hex, there is movement of the forward edge of the battle area. Ground forces include leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, and attack helicopters, each of which have different movement speeds and combat values. These combat values can be enhanced by combat air support provided by friendly aircraft. A key element of ground combat is the interdiction provided by Chinese aircraft, which slows Taiwanese movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players alternated between the operational map and the ground map, moving forces and initiating combat on each map during a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensitivity-analysis&quot;&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each iteration (run of the game) was set in a specific scenario with plausible assumptions about each variable. A scenario refers to the specific combination of assumptions used for one iteration. The scenario where all variables are set to their most plausible values is called the base scenario. As discussed earlier, varying the assumptions from iteration to iteration allowed the investigators to develop judgments about the effects of those variables on the likely outcome. The next chapter explains these most likely base case assumptions and the excursion cases that the project tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assumptions--base-cases-and-excursion-cases&quot;&gt;Assumptions — Base Cases and Excursion Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every wargame requires assumptions about dozens of variables, from the grand strategic and political context, through the strategic military situation, down to minute details about operations and weapons. This chapter describes the assumptions underpinning the wargame’s base scenario and the alternative assumptions (called “excursion cases”) that the project explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “base case” in the project’s terminology is the most likely value of a given variable. “Most likely” does not mean certain but simply more likely than other possibilities. The base scenario is a game iteration wherein all the variables are set to their base case (so that no variables take on a less likely value). The project ran three iterations of this base scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An “excursion case” is a less likely but plausible value of a given variable. Given the limitations of time and resources, the project selected excursion cases based on two criteria: (1) those variables that might have the greatest impact on the outcome of a scenario, and (2) those base case elements that were most uncertain. The project ran a total of 24 game iterations: three base scenarios and 21 scenarios with alternative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing iterations of the game with excursion cases, the project team was able to assess the sensitivity of the findings to alternative assumptions. An “excursion scenario” is a game iteration that used one or more excursion cases. Some excursion scenarios varied a single assumption. Most varied several assumptions; as noted above, varying assumptions one by one would have required playing over 33.5 million games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the major assumptions, their base case, and the excursion cases explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grand-strategic-assumptions-political-context-and-decision&quot;&gt;Grand Strategic Assumptions: Political Context and Decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the base case assumptions about the grand strategic context of the conflict, particularly the conditions under which each state decides to join the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-principal-combatants-china-taiwan-the-united-states-and-japan&quot;&gt;THE PRINCIPAL COMBATANTS: CHINA, TAIWAN, THE UNITED STATES, AND JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, the project assumes that China has decided to launch an invasion. They have the advantage of deciding when the war starts and use that flexibility to attack preemptively taking advantage of tactical surprise. They will have created uncertainty about the timing of the attack by gradually expanding military exercises in the preceding years, making it difficult for other countries to know that this time is the real attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumes that Taiwan resists vigorously. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Taiwan’s military spending as a percentage of GDP is 4.4 percent, China’s is 1.7 percent, and U.S. spending is 2.3 percent. Taiwan’s relatively high level of peacetime spending represents serious social commitment. Further, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly stated their intention to defend the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, morale is hard to predict. While many countries have fought fiercely despite long odds (e.g., Finland in the Winter War and contemporary Ukraine), others have surrendered soon after invasions (e.g., Thailand and Denmark in World War II). When faced with a Chinese assault, Taiwan might capitulate rather than fight. There have been worrying reports about CCP penetration of the Taiwanese military. The base case assumes that Taiwan resists to the maximum extent of its capabilities. However, the project recognizes that this is an assumption. As immediate Taiwanese capitulation would mean that there is no war, it is impossible to analytically wargame. Taiwanese morale is therefore outside the scope conditions of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Entry into the War:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention. For reasons discussed at the outset of this report, such intervention seems more likely than not despite the lack of a formal treaty. The United States has deep historical ties to Taiwan, and U.S. policy opposes unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The United States defended Kuwait’s autonomy in 1991 and defended Ukraine in 2022, albeit with weapons only in Ukraine’s case. The United States has never foresworn the possibility of using force to defend Taiwan, and the Taiwan Relations Act stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” This language has been regularly echoed by administrations from both parties, including the present one, for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan stands alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention, there may be circumstances under which the United States does not engage. Each time President Biden states that the United States would respond to Chinese attack, other administration stipulate that U.S. policy has not changed. Moreover, Biden may not be president in 2026. Actual decisions would depend heavily on the personality of the president and on the domestic and international circumstances of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Important international circumstances would include whether actions by Taiwan were seen as contributing to crisis (e.g., passing a referendum on formal independence); the reaction of other important actors (not least Japan); and the existence (or absence) of concurrent crises or events. Domestic circumstances in the United States (e.g., war weariness or economic downturn) might also act against U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The “Taiwan stands alone” excursion case assumes no direct U.S. intervention. The United States commits no U.S. combat units of any kind to the conflict. Furthermore, without the direct involvement of the United States, Tokyo and other regional governments would view their own intervention as excessively risky and would therefore remain neutral. The United States and possibly other partners might allow weapons and ammunition resupply. However, unlike the situation in Ukraine, the Chinese defensive zone makes this essentially impossible (described below in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays authorization for combat operations one or two days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case assumes the possibility of a minor delay of one or two days before the commencement of U.S. combat operations. Even when attacked, nations sometimes hesitate to respond militarily as they seek to understand what has happened. Sometimes this produces devastating results (for example, Clark Airfield in the Philippines at the beginning of World War II). Given that the initial Chinese landing force unloads over several days, such a delay would affect the conflict by precluding U.S. bomber strikes (originating from Alaska and Hawaii) on the first turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays combat operations for 14 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There might be a more substantial, two-week delay. In this excursion case, the U.S. national command authority attempts to preserve Taiwanese autonomy without paying the price of direct conflict by engaging Beijing through diplomacy to halt the invasion. This effort lasts for a week while the invasion unfolds. When diplomacy fails, the United States declares a no-fly zone over Taiwan, which China vigorously opposes. The United States gets drawn into direct conflict when this “low-cost” approach fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Troops on Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case has no substantial U.S. presence on Taiwan when the conflict begins. The United States has not stationed significant forces on Taiwan since the 1970s. A recent increase in 2021 raised the U.S. troop level on the island from 20 to 39; however, this force could do little beyond liaise. Although stationing more U.S. troops would be military advantageous, it would provide a clear cassus belli for China. If the United States deployed troops to Taiwan in response to every Chinese exercise that could be serving as cover for an invasion, then the United States would quickly shut down many roads to peaceful resolution. Even if the United States knew when the invasion was coming and deployed troops to Taiwan only then, China could still seize on that deployment to justify their already planned invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. forces deploy to Taiwan before conflict begins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although unlikely, it is theoretically possible that the United States would station forces on Taiwan before conflict begins. This could happen in two ways. First, concerns about Taiwanese security might drive the United States to position some forces there in peacetime despite vehement Chinese opposition. Second, Chinese mobilization might generate enough U.S. concern that it is willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces on Taiwan. In this excursion case, a Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) deploys from Okinawa to Taiwan with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan can influence the conflict in two major ways: (1) by allowing the United States to operate its forces from bases in Japan, and (2) with the direct intervention of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). Japan hosts more U.S. bases and servicemembers than any other state in the world. The United States operates these bases despite their being on sovereign Japanese territory. The proximity of these bases to Taiwan and the lack of nearby alternatives means that a major part of the U.S. response to a Chinese invasion operates out of Japanese bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan and China are not on friendly diplomatic terms and the United States and Japan are allied, Japanese intervention against China is not assured. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States binds the two countries in a limited defensive alliance. Article V states that, “Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes.” As Japan analyst Jeffrey Hornung observes, none of the critical decisions about Japanese assistance to U.S. operations are “legally automatic. . . . All these decisions are political, resting with the prime minister at any given moment.” Despite these caveats, recent activities point to mutually coordinated action in the event of a war with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are recent suggestions that Japan would participate to some degree in the defense of Taiwan. Japan has built a formidable military. Japanese military spending is significantly greater than that of any other Asian state other than China or South Korea. The JSDF began deploying overseas for disaster relief and humanitarian relief early in the Heisei era. Japan’s new Defense White Paper warns that China’s growing military muscle, overflights, and naval incursions “have become a matter of grave concern to the region including Japan and the international community.” A commission from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed increasing Japan’s “counterattack capability.” The 2015 update to the “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation” outlined an expanded set of roles for Japan in the event of “an armed attack against a country other than Japan” that “threatens Japan’s survival.” However, it would be a mistake to read these movements as definitive proof of whole-hearted and immediate Japanese participation in the defense of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the U.S.-Japanese treaty and these recent (admittedly non-definitive) political developments in Japan, the base case assumes that Tokyo: (1) allows the United States access to U.S. bases in Japan freely from the outset; (2) directs the JSDF to engage Chinese forces only in response to a Chinese attack on Japanese territory (to include U.S. military bases in Japan); and (3) allows the JSDF, after entering the war, to conduct offensive operations away from Japanese territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also Japan’s path of least resistance because it avoids a difficult internal decision and a potential confrontation with the United States. Furthermore, refusing the United States use of the bases would risk undoing the long-standing U.S.-Japanese alliance, which has underpinned Japanese security policy for 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan participates from the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One excursion case assumes that Japanese forces participated actively from the beginning of the conflict. The events leading up to war could involve explicit threats to Japan or some other form of sharply exacerbated tensions between Beijing and Tokyo. Japanese officials have stipulated that preemptive attacks on adversary systems are constitutionally permissible if it appears that preparations are under way for attacks against Japan. A brewing Taiwan war might provide the circumstances that would justify preemptive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While obtaining the approval to enter the war could be cumbersome, the specific nature of the evidence of a triggering attack is not stipulated by law. It is plausible that a government might, under emergency conditions and with the advantage of a majority in the Diet, obtain such a declaration and begin to operate against Chinese forces. Having obtained a Diet declaration, the JSDF or civilian defense officials would likely be empowered to determine what adversary assets constituted a threat to Japan. This might result in Japan joining the war at the outset alongside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan is completely neutral.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Japan might seek to prevent all U.S. military activities from its soil. Although mutual defense treaties give the United States the right to use its bases, the Japanese might balk. There is often a disconnect between peacetime expectations of military access and what is given in a crisis. In a study of historical patterns in the granting or withholding of access during U.S. military operations, Stacie Pettyjohn and Jennifer Kavanagh write, “peacetime and contingency access decisions are driven by fundamentally different dynamics.” And despite strong public support for the U.S.-Japan alliance, public discussions of concrete issues, such as a Taiwan conflict, often lack clear or realistic appraisals of potential consequences — topics that would become acute when facing large-scale violence by China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The JSDF is limited to defensive operations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the JSDF might be limited to defensive operations over Japanese territory even after entering the war. In this scenario, legal or political constraints prevent the JSDF from conducting operations away from Japanese territory. The only extraterritorial operation this excursion case allows Japan to conduct is ASW on its eastern approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-allies-partners-and-adversaries&quot;&gt;Other Allies, Partners, and Adversaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S.-China conflict would not happen in a vacuum. The stakes involved would be so great and the economic disruption so widespread that every country on the planet would react. This section lays out the base case and excursion cases for other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would put all countries in the region in a dilemma. On the one hand, they are more likely to fear the close power of Beijing than the distant power of Washington. All have reasons to be wary of the strengthening of China’s position that might result from a conquest of Taiwan; furthermore, all have reasons to be friendly to the United States, which would be clamoring for access, basing, and overflight rights. On the other hand are the dangers that would result from participation, either active (e.g., directing forces against China) or passive (e.g., granting the United States basing rights). The safest course of action for most countries would be to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian scholars are relatively unified in assessing that most countries would remain neutral. In congressional testimony, Bonny Lin, an Asia scholar at CSIS, argued that “India, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam . . . may try to stay neutral or provide limited, less conspicuous forms of assistance.” John Culver was more forthright:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think you’d get a chilling set of answers if you approached authoritative people in our treaty allies — Australia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea and our partners like Singapore and important other countries in the region like Vietnam — and ask them in the event that China attacks Taiwan, will you back our military alliance? Will you assist in preventing Chinese conquest? With maybe one or two exceptions, I think the answer we would get is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more optimistic assessment by Zack Cooper and Sheena Chestnut Greitens posits some basing access granted by the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, although this would only happen under “certain circumstances” and “would likely come with severe limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these analyses, the project decided on the following as the base case for particular countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam:&lt;/strong&gt; All would be concerned about Chinese encroachment but also fear Chinese power. They would be sympathetic to the United States and Taiwan but reluctant to expose themselves to Chinese attack. Thus, they would take a passive approach, allowing U.S. overflight and transit but not participating themselves or allowing operations from their territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea would not only fear Chinese power but would also worry about hostile actions by North Korea, whether driven by the North Korean leadership or incentivized by China to distract the United States and Japan. Indeed, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol has said that in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, North Korea would likely stage a provocation that would draw South Korea’s focus. The project assumed that because of the pressing nature of the conflict with China the United States would release two of its four squadrons in South Korea. However, because of the continuing threat from North Korea, the other two squadrons would remain in South Korea for deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; Because of its close relationship with the United States and the stationing of U.S. forces there in peacetime, Australia would give access, basing, and overflight. Australian forces would participate in the South China Sea fight but be unavailable as a result for operations around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the Philippines remains neutral. This assumption was driven first by the relative weakness of the Philippine military compared with the Chinese military. For example, whereas China has a large and modern navy, the Philippines has a small coastal navy with only four ships over 1,000 tons. Its air force focuses on counterinsurgency, with only a small number of modern jet aircraft. This imbalance in relative strength was illustrated by the Philippines reaction when a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Filipino fishing vessel in the vicinity of Recto Bank in the West Philippine Sea. President Rodrigo Duterte refused to take a strong stand against the Chinese incursion, later stating in public “I am powerless there.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption of Philippine neutrality was also based on Duterte’s general diplomatic shift away from being a close partner of the United States and attempting to balance between U.S. and Chinese interests in the region. This move was driven by both personal animus toward the United States and the promise of Chinese investment into the Philippines. As part of this shift, there was a move away from security cooperation with the United States, with the notice of cancellation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows the United States to temporarily station forces on Philippine bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The Philippines allows U.S. basing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case allows the United States to base aircraft out of Philippine military airports. What seemed like a sharp rupture with the United States during the Duterte era is now less clear. Between the failure of Chinese investment to materialize and Chinese actions in the South China Sea, the Philippines have had a partial reproachment with the United States. The Philippines withdrawal from the VFA was postponed, then replaced by a recommitment to the VFA and other defense pacts. Further, there is no clear assessment of what Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s position is, despite the overall favorability of the United States in the Philippines. Since being elected, Marcos Jr. has made statements strongly affirming Philippine rights in disputed areas of the South China Sea while simultaneously insisting that Philippine-China relations are “set to shift into higher gear,” indicating a continued desire for closer ties with China. With these mixed signals, it is possible that the Philippines would allow U.S. basing and overflight during a war against China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe has been wary about becoming involved in the U.S.-China competition. China’s immense economic power and the Europeans’ lack of territory in the Pacific drives Europe to maintain good relations with China. None of these countries are so closely involved in Pacific affairs that they regard China as a direct threat that would warrant automatic participation in what could be World War III with potential nuclear consequences. However, Europe is also wary of Chinese authoritarianism and desires to maintain the liberal international order. The United States has engaged NATO and the European Union in its efforts to contain China and has had some success. Despite these engagements, it is likely that most European countries would limit themselves to economic sanctions on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom and France might be exceptions since they have sent military forces to the Pacific in the past and possess expeditionary forces. However, those forces are not permanently stationed in the Pacific and would take a long time to arrive. The governments would likely take longer than the United States to decide about intervention, and the forces would not have used the warning time to increase readiness for deployment. When they do get there, the arrival of one or two small aircraft carriers and nuclear attack submarines would be useful but not decisive. The ability of other European countries to provide military aid to the United States in the Pacific is extremely limited even if these countries wanted to help. Therefore, the project assumed that Europe would not be a factor in the initial stages of the conflict that the wargame simulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Aggressors:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, North Korea, Iran, or others might take advantage of U.S. distraction to launch aggressive action in their own spheres and attempt to settle long-standing territorial claims. Opportunistic aggression would still be risky for the aggressor if its local opponents are powerful. For example, if North Korea stages a provocation, that might bring other combatants into the conflict against China, such as South Korea, NATO, or the Gulf states, if it looked like the military operations were connected. To have an effect during the short timelines of the game, opportunist aggression would require close coordination between China and the other state before the conflict breaks out so that the opportunistic aggression takes place simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with the Chinese attack. These preparations would likely be detected ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is historical experience. During the 2000s, when the United States was deeply involved in conflicts in the Middle East, other nations did not take advantage of U.S. distraction, nor was there opportunistic aggression during the period of the Korean or Vietnam Wars. Thus, the base case assumes that other adversaries would not launch their own military operations and that the United States could focus on the conflict in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There are simultaneous crises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, China itself might launch the invasion in response to U.S. distraction by a crisis elsewhere or might itself instigate others, particularly North Korea, to take advantage of the situation despite the risks. Therefore, an excursion case considers what might happen if the United States faced simultaneous crises. This excursion case reduces the U.S. order of battle and delays the reinforcement schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-assumptions-orders-of-battle-mobilization-and-rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;Strategic Assumptions: Orders of Battle, Mobilization, and Rules of Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next set of assumptions covers the strategic context, namely the force structure, mobilization, and doctrine of combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;order-of-battle&quot;&gt;ORDER OF BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orders of battle (OOBs) are “the identification, strength, command structure, and disposition of the personnel, units, and equipment of any military force.” OOBs are critical for designing wargames because they specify what units participate, their location, and their strength. However, OOBs are often not published in detail for security reasons, and the project therefore had to deduce them from publicly available documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese OOB is derived from best estimates in open-source intelligence, principally from IISS, Jane’s weapons descriptions, and the annual report by DOD to Congress about the Chinese military. The lack of documents corresponding to the U.S. Future Years Defense Program and reports on Programs of Record means that some educated guesswork about Chinese aircraft and ship production is required. However, there is less uncertainty in projecting a 2026 scenario than one in the 2030s or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese missile inventory is particularly important. In the base case, all Chinese conventional ballistic missiles are available within the timescale of the game (generally three to four weeks) and have warheads that are appropriately matched to whatever land-attack mission they are tasked to perform. For example, warheads used against aircraft parked on U.S. and Japanese air bases are optimized for such attacks by using 3-pound bomblet submunitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese missile inventories, their warhead types, and their availability are highly uncertain because of the lack of Chinese published material. Because missiles account for so many of the U.S. air and naval losses across all scenarios, the project explored two Chinese missile-related excursion cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has increased TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case explores the effect of additional TBMs (beyond the base case) in China’s inventory by 2026. China has stopped adding short-range ballistic missiles to its ballistic missile inventory (and may be reducing such inventories) in favor of other forms of firepower for short-range missions (particularly strike aircraft and long-range Multiple Launch Rocket Systems) and longer-range missile systems, particularly the DF-26. China could shift additional force structure toward longer-range TBMs, particularly those with boost-glide hypersonic missiles. In this excursion case, the Chinese inventory of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and boost-glide missiles is 50 percent larger than that stipulated in the base case, both for land-attack and anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conversely, China’s TBM inventory might be reduced if more TBMs are withheld for nuclear missions or as a hedge against other conflicts. Despite the PLA’s new emphasis on joint operations and jointness, PLARF assets have only partially been integrated into the Theater Command (TC) structures, which are designed to facilitate joint operations. Unlike the other services, there is, for example, no PLARF deputy commander within the TC staffs. The PLA or its political overseers might opt to withhold some DF-26 launchers, with their interchangeable nuclear and conventional warheads, for an enhanced nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, China’s TBMs may not have an optimal warhead to target match. The base case assumes that China has analyzed and built the ratio of unitary to submunition warheads that maximizes their impact in each iteration played. However, it is possible that China’s targeting plans are either wrong or that they are forced to change them in the war. This would force China to use less-efficient unitary warheads against aircraft in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given possible missile holdouts and a less than ideal mix of warhead types, an excursion case reduces the number of Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and IRBMs by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, the sheer volume of Chinese missiles makes Taiwan’s air and naval forces almost irrelevant; besides a few squadrons that are isolated in Taiwan’s underground shelter until they are dug out, these forces are destroyed in the first few days of an invasion. However, the same is not true of Taiwan’s ground forces, which become critical to the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OOB for active units of the Taiwanese military comes from Ian Easton and the IISS 2022 Military Balance. For the ground forces, two tweaks were required. First, Easton provides very specific brigade and battalion numbers for the whole force, and the ostensible force structure has remained relatively stable since his book was published. However, the botched transition to an all-volunteer force has caused personnel numbers to drop significantly and units to be undermanned. To an extent, this could be offset by having reservists backfill into active units, but Easton’s numbers are still inflated. The base scenario therefore reduced the number of maneuver battalions in each brigade by one. These resulting notional battalions are still small by U.S. standards but comparable to their Chinese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the division between heavy and light mechanized infantry in the table is somewhat arbitrary. On the one hand, Taiwan’s M-60 tanks (and M-1 tanks, if they arrive by 2026) are much heavier than the light armored vehicles associated with Chinese marine and airborne units. On the other hand, Taiwan’s mechanized infantry is mounted in old M-113s with 20-mm guns, and Taiwan still has many M-41 and M-48 tanks, which date from the 1950s and early 1960s. Furthermore, China’s ZTL-05 amphibious assault gun is a derivative of the British 105-mm L7 gun that is likely able to penetrate Taiwan’s M-60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major sources for the Taiwanese reserves were Easton et al., IISS’s 2021 Military Balance, and GlobalSecurity.org. Information on Taiwan’s reserve brigades is thin, but a few things are known. They are large but not well prepared. There is, however, some variation in quality and readiness. There are several levels. A-level brigades are the best prepared and reportedly include one battalion of active cadre per brigade as well as an artillery battalion. Other levels are less well defined. Some sources suggest a second level includes military personnel affiliated with military educational institutions and that the brigades include artillery. Beyond 21 or 24 “first-line” reserve brigades, there are coastal defense units and a very large but even less well-equipped force of local reserves or militia. The project models the “first-line” reserve battalion as having half the lethality of an active-duty battalion. For artillery, IISS lists 2,093 artillery pieces in the inventory. Most are probably old, and many may not be serviceable but could be used to field 60 artillery battalions in the active and reserve forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has not received ground-launched Harpoons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the PLA must come to Taiwan and land on one of a few suitable beaches, the invasion is vulnerable to short-range ASCMs. Indeed, the original article prescribing a “porcupine strategy” for Taiwan described mobile coastal-defense cruise missiles as “at the top of this list” of systems for Taiwan to acquire. There is currently a deal for the United States to sell 100 ground-based Harpoon launchers and 400 missiles to Taiwan. If that sale goes through, those missiles would have a large impact on a Chinese invasion. However, there have been reports of a possible delay. Furthermore, the United States sent some Harpoons to Ukraine, which may delay the Harpoon delivery to Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that these Harpoons are not on Taiwan at the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Many budget documents and official statements fed into the U.S. OOB, with some extrapolations to 2026 required. These included the Department of Defense’s FY 2023 budget overview, the service budget highlight books, the Navy’s 30-year shipbuilding plan, and, for the Army and Air Force, force structure projections contained in their operations and maintenance budget justification books. Location of individual units, where needed, came from the websites of individual military bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement schedule assumes global sourcing: U.S. forces from around the world would be sent to the Pacific. Some U.S. forces head to Taiwan from the north and east. These appear on the game’s operational map. Other forces would head there via the Indian Ocean. As noted in Chapter 3, these latter forces engage the Chinese in abstracted battles around the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been seen during the conflict in Ukraine, modern militaries expend munitions at a high rate. The game, therefore, tracks the most important munitions, especially those with limited inventories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. munitions inventories were estimated from budget documents and allowed for production lead times, generally two years. Some munitions, such as the Army’s Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Navy’s JASSM, are not expected to be available in large numbers in 2026 and were therefore not included. Other munitions not specifically tracked, such as air-to-air, were assumed to be available in sufficient numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inventory is distributed globally. Although large elements are in the Pacific already and in the United States, available for shipment overseas, other elements are in Europe and the Middle East. The base case assumes that all these munitions would be available for the conflict against China. The OOB has a decrement to strategic airlift to redistribute these munitions and other supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach accepts risk in other theaters, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. However, this would likely be the U.S. approach, given the immediacy of the conflict against China. Other regions would still have access to alternative munitions such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, which are available in large numbers. Using these short-range munitions would increase risk to U.S. forces if conflict occurred, but given the lower capability of regional air defenses, this risk would likely be judged acceptable. Further, allies and partners could provide some standoff capabilities in these other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Submarines are withheld for other missions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although they would likely be effective hunters of a Chinese amphibious force, U.S. SSNs have several other missions with which they are tasked. Most notably, they trail adversary ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to hold at risk the nuclear capability of hostile countries. The base case assumed that all available SSNs are reassigned to either defeating the invasion of Taiwan or clearing the South China Sea since a conflict with China is an immediate and grave demand. However, some SSNs might be withheld for these other missions and therefore not be available for operations near Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that two fewer submarine squadrons (eight SSNs total) are available to the U.S. player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the U.S. case, Japanese defense holdings and deployments are relatively transparent, allowing the game OOB to be built from a variety of documents. The baseline for 2022 was established using IISS’s Military Balance and cross-checked with information in Japan’s annual Defense of Japan white paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Medium-Term Defense Program outlines broad future plans every five years. For production and acquisition rates and other specifics, the OOB used data from annual military budgets, published in English in abbreviated detail and in full detail in Japanese. Japanese defense spending has been trending upward since 2013, increasing 26 percent through 2021, with the declared intention of increasing spending further in the future. Within Japan’s proposed 2023 budget, the acquisition of additional standoff strike capability is listed as the number one priority for strengthening defense capability, and this project assumes that it will have acquired a small inventory of Joint Strike Missiles (JSMs), among others, by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;warning-and-mobilization&quot;&gt;WARNING AND MOBILIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in all scenarios conflict was assumed to occur after a period of crisis, China’s attack was still able to achieve tactical surprise. (See next section for discussion of mobilization.) The reason is the precedent of Ukraine, where adversary forces freely relocated without triggering conflict, though the other side made precautionary moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case, China takes measures to minimize warning time by, for example, using a large exercise to mask its preparation and delaying measures that would provide unambiguous warning, such as requisitioning large numbers of civilian lift ships, until late in the process. The project team postulates that these unambiguous signals would begin at D minus 30. Although the United States and Taiwan would see these preparations, there would likely be considerable uncertainty about Chinese motivation and intentions. Thus, the base case assumes that Taiwan and the United States would have unambiguous warning at D minus 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this warning, the United States alerts its forces and moves some forward in an effort to deter China. The United States frequently moves forces forward to signal its resolve during periods of crisis in accordance with doctrine about “Phase 0.” If deterrence fails, then under this concept forward-based forces would strengthen the US military response. In the base case, these deployments consist of a CSG sent to the Ryukyus (in addition to the CSG in Japan) and two bomber squadrons sent to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There is no U.S. “show of force.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although forward deployed forces might strengthen deterrence, they become highly vulnerable when inside the Chinese defensive bubble. Thus, if the United States were reasonably certain that China could not be deterred, it would be prudent to keep forces far from the Chinese mainland before D-Day. In this excursion case, the CSG stays outside of the second island chain, while the bomber squadrons stay in the contiguous United States until D-day. The effect is that China cannot destroy them in a surprise attack with TBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, even after unambiguous strategic warning from the intelligence community, there would be some hesitation. Residual uncertainty about Chinese intentions, fears of escalating the crisis, and concerns about alarming the public would mitigate against aggressive action. Thus, the base case assumes that the United States surges some but not all its forces. However, the alert allows forces to move more quickly once the conflict begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Culver, a former national intelligence officer for East Asia and now an Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Chinese preparations to invade Taiwan would be seen months or even years ahead of time. It is certainly true that China would need to prepare, and many of these actions would be visible. However, it is not clear how quickly these preparations would be interpreted as signaling an invasion and how quickly military action would be taken in response. Leaders in target or allied states may also fear that defensive preparations would prompt or provoke attacks that might not otherwise occur or, alternatively, might cause self-inflicted harm from damage to economic markets or panic buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States mobilizes late.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a Taiwan crisis, U.S. leaders might misinterpret Chinese preparations, wish to avoid exacerbating tensions, or be ambivalent about accepting the risks of direct conflict with a nuclear-armed power. The “late U.S. reaction” excursion case eliminates the two-week reaction period prior to hostilities and delays the arrival of U.S. forces by two weeks relative to the base case. Thus, no U.S. air elements reinforce peacetime presence in Japan or Guam, and U.S. naval forces arrive later than in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that Taiwan responds quickly to invasion. This means that there is no hesitation or delay caused by political indecision or Chinese actions such as propaganda, sabotage, or special forces attacks. Furthermore, Taiwanese command and control has dispersed or taken cover, so they are not vulnerable to a decapitating Chinese first strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has a delayed reaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case examines what might happen if the Taiwanese response were delayed because of Chinese action or Taiwanese political hesitation. In this excursion case, military forces in the threatened zone an operate, but other forces are frozen for one turn (one half week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;RULES OF ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules of engagement are “directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered.” They are important for wargames because they govern the actions that players can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Strikes against the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Because the United States will be striking the Chinese homeland, the base case assumes that the U.S. homeland is not a sanctuary. However, the ability of the Chinese to conduct strikes against the U.S. homeland and thereby affect operations in the Western Pacific is extremely limited. A few special forces might infiltrate and attack a small number of high-value targets but not enough to materially affect military operations in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the Chinese might send a submarine to the U.S. West Coast to attack cities and maritime facilities. In the play of the game, the Chinese submarine fleet was fully occupied fending off U.S. and Japanese warships in the Western Pacific. Even if the Chinese decided to divert a few submarines to such attacks, their effect on military operations would be small. Their psychological effect on the U.S. population might be large, but this would take time to affect military operations. Some game participants hypothesized that the Chinese would mine U.S. ports, thereby preventing the exit of Navy ships. Such an attack might, in theory, be done stealthily. However, prewar surveillance during a time of heightened crisis would identify any Chinese military forces operating near the West Coast, and the Chinese have not demonstrated an ability to do such operations from merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese might launch economic, information, and diplomatic initiatives to isolate the United States and undermine popular support for the conflict. However, the effects of such efforts would not be manifest in the short time duration of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Strikes against Mainland China:&lt;/strong&gt; There is ongoing debate about whether the United States would strike targets on mainland China during a conflict. On the one hand, striking a nuclear power’s territory threatens nuclear escalation. State adversaries have been extremely careful about attacking the homeland of a nuclear power. In providing HIMARS to Ukraine, for example, the United States reportedly attached the condition that no attacks on undisputed Russian territory be conducted with them. Similarly, the United States has refused to supply Ukraine with ATACMS because it could strike deep into Russian territory. In the case of the Korean War, which occurred before China had acquired nuclear weapons but after the Soviet Union had, the United States refrained from striking bases in both China and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, military advantage would come from attacks on the Chinese mainland. U.S. airpower could attack Chinese aircraft on the ground when they are most vulnerable and sink Chinese amphibious ships in port. The United States has built a large inventory of JASSM-ERs for this purpose. Additionally, there will be a desire for revenge against China: China will have killed thousands of Americans and, if it strikes Guam, attacked U.S. territory. In World War II, the United States struck the Japanese homeland through the Doolittle raid as soon as it was able, not for military advantage but to achieve propaganda value for striking back at an aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts have speculated about the United States striking the first blow and attacking the Chinese fleet in port when unambiguous warning has been received. This would inhibit or even prevent the Chinese from establishing a beachhead in the first place. However, it would initiate a war with the United States as the aggressor, provoking all the adverse political consequences related to such an action. Further, arguments for striking on unambiguous warning would run into the memories of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in 2003, when unambiguous strategic warning turned out to be erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes limited, non-preemptive attacks on the Chinese mainland. The United States can attack Chinese air bases and ports that are directly involved in Chinese strikes on Taiwanese and U.S. forces. It rules out a broader air campaign aimed at destroying Chinese infrastructure, industry, leadership, and command and control as being too provocative. This appears to be a middle course between a preemptive strike or broad attack on Chinese society and a prohibition against any homeland strikes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on mainland China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what U.S. military planners may assume during peacetime about the most efficient application of U.S. military force in a Taiwan scenario, major rules of engagement and especially questions related to mainland strikes will ultimately be decided by the president, who will weigh a wide variety of military, political, and diplomatic considerations. The president may judge that the risk of escalation is too high given the potential benefits. The president might also believe that the United States could prevail without strikes against the mainland. Thus, this excursion case assumes a presidential prohibition against any mainland strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-and-tactical-assumptions-competence-weapons-and-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Operational and Tactical Assumptions: Competence, Weapons, and Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that U.S., Chinese, and Taiwanese forces have equivalent levels of operational competence. Unless there was strong evidence to the contrary, the project assumed that they would maintain operational competence. For capabilities where some doubt existed, excursion scenarios investigated what would happen if forces were not able to match their announced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of conflicts between the United States and potential opponents (including China), this assumption tends to bias against the United States since its training standards are higher than most. Taking all sides’ capabilities at face value may give a modest boost to China since it has more unproven capabilities than the United States — from the ability to execute an anti-ship ballistic missile strike to simply moving troops from ship to shore in an amphibious landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to assess capabilities at face value also recognizes the great uncertainty in such judgments, given the dynamic condition of China’s military capabilities. Chris Dougherty, a wargaming expert at CNAS, made this argument in cautioning against downgrading estimates about the PLA because of overestimates about the Russian military. He noted that “Chinese military reforms over the last 20 years, combined with President Xi Jinping’s counter-corruption policies, had created a more professional and accountable force” and “built advanced weaponry at a scale far exceeding that of Russia.” Equivalency also incorporates continued Chinese advances in operational competence over the next four years, particularly as they conduct exercises of increasing size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-competence&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL COMPETENCE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted by the recent Russo-Ukrainian war, different militaries conduct operations with varying degrees of competence. These variations are often unclear a priori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Amphibious Competence:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes a high level of Chinese amphibious competence. This requires that the Chinese military increases the scale, intensity, and realism of landing exercises between now and 2026, that they are astute in evaluating and codifying lessons learned and in formulating and diffusing doctrine, and that they can execute doctrine in combat. In calculating the ability of a Chinese amphibious fleet to get troops and materials ashore, the base case employs offload rates similar to those associated with late-World War II U.S. operations, including Operation Neptune (for the D-Day landings) and Operation Iceberg (the invasion of Okinawa). These rates reflect hard won wartime experience that the Chinese do not have. On the other hand, modern technologies like helicopters and widely available amphibious infantry fighting vehicles facilitate more rapid offload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced amphibious offload rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While high competence is possible and useful to assume as the base case, it is entirely plausible that China’s actual performance may be less skillful. Even if China continues to expand its amphibious training and exercises, it will lack the practical combat experience of the United States in World War II. The U.S. Marine Corps focused on amphibious attack prior to the war, conducting annual landing exercises of increasing scale between 1932 and 1941 and systematically developing procedures. Many of the operations conducted earlier in the war, such as Operation Watchtower (Guadalcanal) and the Torch landings in North Africa, were less smooth but provided valuable experience. Only after addressing those issues were the high offload rates (from D-Day and Okinawa) achieved. Although China may benefit from and build upon the documented lessons learned by the historical experiences of others, only large-scale experimentation and the codification of lessons learned from exercises can create practical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the Falklands War of 1982, for example, the lack of recent experience with amphibious operations and the impact of Argentine air and missile attack produced lower British offload rates than those achieved by Allied forces almost four decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case reduces Chinese amphibious lift by 30 percent to match the offload rate of the British in the Falklands instead of the Americans in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwanese Army Training:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumed the Taiwanese units were as effective as similarly sized and equipped Chinese units. The project team recognizes that there is a vigorous debate about the quality of the Taiwanese armed forces. Some argue that its training is stylized and unimaginative, the readiness of units is poor, and conscripts acquire few useful military skills. On the other hand, the Taiwanese would be defending their homeland and might show the tenacity and ingenuity that the Ukrainians have shown in their struggle against Russia. Nevertheless, even with high morale, the lack of training and top-tier equipment means that Taiwanese reserve forces operate at half strength in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwanese ground units are understrength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground forces may not be as ready and competent, unit-for-unit and type-for-type, as China’s. Taiwan’s military, and especially its army, was identified with the authoritarian politics of KMT rule, and the transition to democracy during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought suspicion of the institution. The attempted transition to an all-volunteer force, which originally aimed to phase out all conscription by 2013, has failed to produce the intended results. Recruiting shortfalls have required the continued use of conscription but with terms of service reduced from one year to four months. Moreover, even with continued conscription, the army has been unable to fill its ranks, with just 81 percent of its positions filled in 2020 (and personnel levels of between 60 and 80 percent in many combat arms units). Potentially disruptive reductions in force structure have also been undertaken, and the combination of those reductions and the failure to fully staff units has reduced the army’s size from 200,000 in 2011 to 94,000 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reserve personnel may fill vacancies in active-duty units during wartime, and Taiwan is exploring a variety of ways to increase numbers and improve the realism of its training. Nevertheless, 2026 is just a few years away, so Taiwan is running out of time to overcome these shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case sets the combat power of Taiwan’s active-duty army units at 75 percent that of similar Chinese units (i.e., the combat power of a Taiwanese light mechanized battalion is set at 75 percent that of a Chinese light mechanized unit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s reserve forces, already set at 50 percent of the combat power of corresponding active-duty units, are reduced to 75 percent of that strength, giving them combat power equal to 38 percent (0.5 x 0.75 = 0.38) of a corresponding Chinese active-duty unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAAF Parity:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that each “generation” of aircraft has equal capability, regardless of nationality. While the U.S. Air Force has hitherto undoubtedly been superior to the PLAAF, Air Force leaders and defense scholars warn that this superiority is eroding. The Air Force’s greater experience with large air campaigns and stealth aircraft is counterbalanced by Chinese superiority in air-to-air missiles and their geographic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. air planners have run large air campaigns in recent decades, their Chinese counterparts lack such experience. The last wartime employment of large formations of Chinese aircraft was during the Korean War, and the last time that a Chinese combat aircraft shot down a manned aircraft of any type was in 1967, when a U.S. Navy F-4 was downed in southern China. During China’s incursion into Vietnam in 1979, Central Military Commission directives prevented PLAAF combat missions beyond the border, and air units operating within Chinese airspace achieved sortie rates averaging only one flight every five days. Doctrinally, Chinese air practice has historically placed heavy emphasis on centralized control in both planning and execution and a heavy degree of ground control over flying units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been working to address this shortfall in aerial planning and execution. In recent years, as new airframes have been brought into service, the PLAAF and People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) have sought to adopt more flexible Western methods, such as giving authority to flight leaders, conducting unscripted and competitive exercises, and holding “golden helmet” competitions in air-to-air combat. However, given the magnitude of the cultural adjustments required, doctrinal change is very much a work in progress. Moreover, flight training continues to have stovepiped career progression with little movement of pilots between training and combat billets. Perhaps most importantly, there is no Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Air Weapons School (“Red Flag”) or U.S. Navy’s Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (“Top Gun”), schools designed to train selected pilots who then return to line units to become training planners and instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the United States’ superiority in doctrine and training are the advantages brought by China’s long-range air-to-air missiles and geographic advantage. The Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missile outranges most Air Force Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) variants, meaning that the Chinese will often get the first shot in combat beyond visual range. Furthermore, the proximity of Taiwan to Chinese bases on the mainland will give China several advantages. First, Chinese pilots will be fresher during air combat than U.S. pilots, who will often have had to fly long distances from bases in Japan. Second, although Chinese SAMs could not effectively target U.S. fighter/attack aircraft over Taiwan, these SAMs give Chinese pilots a sanctuary from U.S. pursuit while ensuring that U.S. pilots must keep one eye on the ground during air combat. U.S. pilots will also need to watch for Chinese surface ships that push east of Taiwan. Third, Chinese AEW platforms will be more survivable because they can quickly retreat under the SAM umbrella of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The U.S. Air Force is more competent than the PLAAF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is possible that the United States’ superiority in training and planning outweighs the technology and basing advantages that China has. As Baron von Richthofen, the World War I ace, observed, “the quality of the box matters little. Success depends upon the man who sits in it.” Therefore, an excursion case explores the impact of U.S. air-to-air lethality that is 30 percent greater than that of the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the general strengths and weaknesses of the PLAAF and Air Force is the specific question about the relative quality of both sides’ fifth-generation fighters. As a result of the U.S. aviation industry’s more established and competitive position, the United States has operated stealth aircraft for longer and has more mature fifth-generation designs. U.S. combat experience with stealth dates back to 1989 when two stealthy F-117As delivered ordinance against an airfield in Panama. Desert Storm in 1991 saw widespread stealth use. After thorough vetting, the F-22 achieved initial operational capability as the world’s first fifth-generation aircraft in December 2005. It remains the only aircraft to have supercruise capability (i.e., the ability to maintain flight at supersonic speeds without the use of afterburners). The Air Force declared the F-35A combat capable in 2016 after prolonged development problems. It was designed without supercruise but has an extremely low radar cross-section and unparalleled sensor fusion, providing pilots with excellent situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far less is known about the Chinese J-20 than U.S. stealth aircraft. However, although the J-20 first flew in 2011, China’s defense industry has not yet been able to produce the WS-15 engines that were intended to provide the J-20 with supercruise. It is equipped with canards and, with the latest WS-10C engines, thrust vectoring, which will give it high maneuverability, perhaps similar to the F-22. However, most analysts believe that it will also have a higher radar cross-section (i.e., less stealth) than either the F-22 or F-35. Little is known of the J-20’s electronics. While the sensors will certainly have range and electronic warfare capability, the system is unlikely to incorporate the same degree of sensor fusion as the F-35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are superior to Chinese counterparts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case explores the possibility that U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are more capable than Chinese fifth-generation aircraft. Although the J-20 will likely evolve into a fully capable fifth-generation fighter, it may not reach that stage within the 2026 timeframe of the game and thus may not be equal to the F-22 or F-35 in direct combat. This excursion case reduces the lethality of the J-20 to 4.5-generation standards while maintaining benefits that accrue to stealthy aircraft (e.g., reduced vulnerability to naval or ground-based SAMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-effectiveness&quot;&gt;WEAPONS EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the project generally accepted weapons effectiveness at face value. However, two particularly consequential cases vary this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JASSM-ER vs. Ships:&lt;/strong&gt; The JASSM, a conventional, stealthy, air-launched ground-attack cruise missile, is a special case. Its long-range precision guidance and stealthy characteristics make it an important munition for the United States. The basic version is designed for ground attack. A critical judgment is whether the extended-range version, the JASSM-ER can strike naval targets. Although there is an anti-ship variant, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), relatively few of the latter will be available in 2026 (roughly 450 LRASMs vs. 3,650 JASSM-ERs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly available information about the capabilities of the JASSM-ER is unclear. There are hints that it could have some anti-ship capability. In its FY 2022 budget request, the Navy introduced the AGM-158B JASSM-ER to “enhance long range strike and existing OASuW [offensive anti-surface warfare] capability.” The document suggests that it will be possible to “convert JASSM-ER software to a C++ software baseline, similar to LRASM, and focus on combining JASSM-ER strike capability and LRASM OASuW capability into a merged Navy JASSM baseline. Future efforts will expand both Navy strike and OASuW capabilities within Navy JASSM.” The Air Force also continues to upgrade variants of the JASSM-ER. Depending on the adjustments required to make the missile capable of anti-ship operations, it is possible that the capability could be retrofitted onto existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the JASSM-ER’s infrared target recognition seeker has even modest capability against moving ships at sea, the impact would be enormous. By mixing JASSM-ERs with salvos of LRASMs, Chinese ships would have to expend interceptors engaging incoming salvos of JASSM-ERs, allowing more LRASMs to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that the JASSM-ER has some limited capability to strike ships at sea. High numbers of these munitions allows a much greater volume of fire against the Chinese fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: No Maritime Strike JASSM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of uncertainty about whether the JASSM-ER will have anti-ship capability by 2026. Because the United States will have many JASSM-ERs, and the ability of the Chinese amphibious ships to survive is central to the success of an invasion, this assumption would make a large difference in the game outcome. Hence, this excursion case assumes that the JASSM-ER does not have anti-ship capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Defenses:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the missile defenses of both sides work as described in publicly available documents. This produces a single-shot probability of intercept of 0.70 and, with a shot doctrine of two interceptors per incoming missile, a combined intercept probability of 0.91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few publicly available Pk figures for interceptors against missiles, but the 0.70 figure is roughly consistent with modeling work in the public domain. A 2017 thesis for the Naval War College, for example, cites a Pk of between 0.60 and 0.80 for the Standard Missile-2. The author of that study stipulates that the values given are not “actual figures” but “are within reasonable magnitude of the actual to produce valid and applicable results.” In the context of national missile defense, longtime analyst Dean Wilkening writes that “BMD designers apparently expect interceptor SSPKs around 0.80 to 0.85,” though he suggests that such probabilities “may be difficult to achieve in the presence of countermeasures.” The Missile Defense Advisory Alliance reports that 79 of 97 hit-to-kill intercept attempts have been successful across all programs since 2001, a rate of 0.81. Similar figures recur throughout the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Chinese and U.S. ship defenses do not work as well as expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The history of modern warfare is replete with examples of systems, particularly missile systems, that underperform in combat. Missile tests are frequently conducted under ideal conditions that begin with checks to ensure that all systems are in working order. There are many points where the fog and friction of combat could dramatically degrade a weapon’s effectiveness. Even after combat, the effectiveness of systems is unclear. There was a lengthy (and still unresolved) debate about the effectiveness of missile defense against Scud missiles in Desert Storm. This difference between peacetime testing and wartime employment could mean that ship-based cruise missile defense is much less effective than assumed in the project’s base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By how much could ship-based cruise missile defense be degraded? A 2020 study of all cruise missile attacks on warships since 1967 concluded that 60 of the 162 missiles launched (or 37 percent) struck the target. Of the 63 percent that did not, some fell victim to missile failures or soft kill, which are handled separately within this project’s model. Against ships that were on high alert and defended against the attack, 124 missiles scored 34 hits (or 27 percent). This contrasts with the base case, wherein multiple independently adjudicated intercept attempts result in an average of only 5.6 percent of subsonic and 7.4 percent of supersonic cruise missiles hitting their target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excursion case increases the effectiveness of anti-ship missiles by postulating that 25 percent of missiles fired hit their target. Although this higher Pk is applied against both sides’ ships, this change affects the Chinese more because they have far more ships exposed to missile attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and ASAT:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the lack of historical evidence on the effectiveness of cyber and ASAT tools in operational warfare, the project credited each with being moderately effective. As discussed in Chapter 3, each side possesses cyber exploits that give passive benefits and could be used for one-time active effects. These effects are significant but not magical. For example, the United States can shut down power to some Chinese ports and reduce their lift by 20 percent that turn but cannot shut down all power in eastern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ASAT warfare, the project assumes (1) that both sides possess moderately effective dazzling and electronic warfare capabilities, (2) that they use these immediately and consistently to degrade each other’s ISR, (3) that co-orbital interference will take longer than the length of a game iteration (i.e., a month), (4) that both China and the United States possess some direct-ascent capabilities, and (5) that the United States is politically constrained from being the first to use direct-ascent weapons, but also (6) that if China uses its direct-ascent ASAT weapons, the United States can respond in kind, and (7) that ASAT use would greatly degrade adversary ISR capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardened Aircraft Shelters:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that neither the United States nor Japan builds additional HASs prior to war. During the 1980s, the United States and its allies constructed roughly 1,000 HASs in Europe, South Korea, and northern Japan. Against Chinese ballistic missiles, HASs would reduce aircraft losses by forcing China to target individual shelters with unitary warheads and deny it the ability to destroy multiple aircraft with a single missile equipped with submunitions (cluster munitions). Analysts have, therefore, long encouraged the construction of additional shelters in areas under Chinese missile threat today, though little has happened since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan has more HASs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are signs that both the United States and Japan are recommitting to hardening as part of an effort to improve operational resilience. This excursion case assumes that the United States and Japan build 400 additional shelters, for an estimated cost of $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Civilian Airfields:&lt;/strong&gt; Attacks against aircraft parked in the open is effectively a density problem, with the probability of kill for each aircraft in target areas being determined by total missile coverage (the numerator) divided by the total potential parking area (the denominator). The base case assumes minimal dispersion to civilian airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan grants increased access to civilian airports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dispersing Air Force aircraft to civilian airports could greatly expand the parking area that China must attack and thereby reduce US and Japanese losses. There is likely a decrease in operational efficiency that comes from stretching maintenance and support personnel across multiple sites. However, with the alternative being operating from damaged military fields, this efficiency loss is probably acceptable. Each Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) base seems to be paired with a regional civilian airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case therefore expands access to civilian airports. If the United States and Japan can space aircraft on the ground farther apart than the submunitions of a Chinese missile can cover, then China would have to expend one missile per aircraft. This would quickly deplete China’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes the results of the iterations. They are grouped in five categories of scenarios: base, pessimistic, optimistic, “Taiwan stands alone,” and “Ragnarok” (highly pessimistic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall finding is that China is unlikely to succeed in an invasion of Taiwan in 2026 if four conditions hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan must vigorously resist. If it does not, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must join hostilities within days and with the full range of its capabilities. Delays and half measures make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, and raise the risk of the Chinese creating an irreducible lodgment on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must have use of its bases in Japan. Without them, the United States cannot use its numerous fighter/attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States must possess enough air-launched, long-range ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even a successful defense of Taiwan comes at great cost. The United States and its allies lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of personnel. The high losses would damage the United States’ global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a badly damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China’s navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and thousands of soldiers are taken as prisoners or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-outcome-taiwanese-autonomy&quot;&gt;Key Outcome: Taiwanese Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key condition for judging outcomes was the continued autonomy of Taiwan as a political entity. This condition excludes consideration of damage to the Taiwanese economy or the extent of U.S. losses. While these factors remain relevant and the concluding chapter of this report considers them in the context of the military outcome, the stated U.S. and Taiwanese policy goal is autonomy, without a discussion of cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most iterations lasted around six turns, representing three weeks of combat, though some iterations went longer. If results were uncertain when game play ended for outside players, the project staff would sometimes play a few more turns to clarify the outcome. The project staff made a judgment at the end about how to score the outcome. It is important to note that the full campaign, taken to its conclusion, would generally take months. The game investigates the first three or four weeks, which are the most intense for air and maritime operations. The most intense ground operations would happen later, as ground forces sought a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese amphibious, airborne, and air assault capabilities gradually deteriorate under U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attack, so China cannot rely on them indefinitely. If China can secure ports and airfields and keep them operational, they will ultimately win. If they cannot, Chinese forces will eventually crumble. In optimistic scenarios, Chinese amphibious capabilities would be destroyed in a week. In pessimistic scenarios, the Chinese amphibious fleet might survive to the end of a month. The status of Chinese-held ports and airfields on Taiwan was therefore the critical factor in determining the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of each iteration was scored as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Victory:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese ground forces outnumber Taiwanese forces on the island. Once that happens, and the Chinese control enough airports and ports to bring the bulk of their ground forces over, they will eventually prevail, though the complete conquest of an island the size of Taiwan would take many months, barring a capitulation. Two iterations continued until total conquest; most iterations were ended when Chinese victory appeared inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stalemate:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces have a significant lodgment ashore, and neither side can make rapid gains. Chinese forces have captured a handful of ports and airports. The United States is striking those facilities to make or keep them fully unusable, while China is attempting to repair them and make them fully functional. This outcome typically occurred when China was able to secure the southern part of the island and the facilities there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending toward China:&lt;/strong&gt; China has a solid beachhead that is not in danger of being eliminated. They have more than three ports or airports on Taiwan, although these may be damaged. To defeat the invasion, the United States and its allies would have to keep these ports and airports suppressed, resupply Taiwan, and, possibly, commit ground forces to rescue the Taiwanese position. China would have to clear ports or airports with the engineers landed, possibly while under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, indeterminate:&lt;/strong&gt; An ambiguous situation, often involving the loss of the entire Chinese amphibious fleet, but with Chinese forces securely ashore and having occupied several damaged port or airport facilities. Resolution depends on whether China can restore the captured facilities to supply and expand its forces before Taiwanese forces counterattack in strength. The campaign would take an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending against China:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the Chinese have a significant beachhead, they do not possess a favorable enough force ratio to make quick gains against opposing Taiwanese ground forces. The Chinese amphibious fleet has suffered high attrition, and they have no working ports and airports on Taiwan. China is trying to substitute small civilian craft for the large amphibious carriers that it has lost, but as the British found at Gallipoli, this results in a dramatically lower supply throughput. An important question on the Taiwan side would include the state of its ammunition stocks and the ability to resupply. Whatever the eventual outcome, it is not where the Chinese would want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Defeat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese amphibious fleet is mostly destroyed, and the Chinese have not taken sufficient ports or airports such that major landing operations can continue. Relatively small Chinese forces are confined to a small landing area, and they are only receiving small amounts of supplies from airdrops and small civilian boats. At this point, it would be a matter of time for the Taiwanese forces to mop up Chinese survivors. The main challenge for the United States would not be in eliminating the remaining invaders but finding an acceptable off-ramp for hostilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams played five types of scenarios: base scenarios, pessimistic scenarios, optimistic scenarios, the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, and “Ragnarok” scenarios. The latter four examined the impact of adjusting critical assumptions from their most likely base case to less likely excursion cases (discussed above in Chapter 4). This section summarizes the design of the scenarios run, the operational outcomes, the losses incurred, and which variables appeared to be critical. The discussion provides specific numbers and detailed descriptions. However, these are not intended to imply that these are precise predictions but rather to share the raw data on which the authors formed their judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;base-scenario&quot;&gt;BASE SCENARIO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The project team conducted three iterations of the base scenario (using only base case assumptions without any of the excursion cases described in Chapter 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Two out of three of these iterations were decided quickly, with the Chinese forces ashore unable to capture major cities and out of supplies within 10 days. In one iteration, PLA forces landed in the south and captured the port at Tainan. However, U.S. air strikes prevented its use, and the Chinese position was untenable by D plus 21. This was the only iteration of the base scenario that was not judged to be a decisive Chinese defeat, instead scoring as “Stalemate, trending against China.” In all cases, at least 90 percent of the Chinese amphibious fleet was destroyed, leaving the forces ashore supported only by air drops and heliborne supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5c286Cg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Operational Results: Base Case Scenario, Range, and Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese teams attempted different strategies that affected outcomes in all scenarios, including the base scenario. However, even with a sound Chinese strategy, the combination of challenges facing PLA invasion forces was too great to overcome. Despite the base cases assumption about a large but plausible number of civilian ships incorporated into the Chinese amphibious fleet, the buildup of PLA forces ashore is slow. Throughout the duration of the buildup and until ports and airports are captured and repaired, amphibious ships will be anchored off the invasion beaches, with ships shuttling between Taiwan and the Chinese ports as they empty. This is particularly true after the initial supply of amphibious assault vehicles is expended. In every iteration of the base scenario, U.S., allied, and partner forces were able to destroy shipping before the forces ashore were large enough to conduct sustained offensive action against defending forces flowing toward the beachhead. Anti-ship missiles delivered by Taiwanese shore batteries, U.S. aircraft, and U.S. and Japanese submarines all took a heavy and rapid toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound Chinese strategy could mitigate, but not stop, this attrition of the amphibious fleet. China has a substantial fleet of modern warships, and most Chinese teams placed SAGs, comprised of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates, to the east of Taiwan to serve as air and missile defense pickets. They also dispatched submarines further into the Western Pacific to keep U.S. surface forces at bay. These slowed attrition to the amphibious fleet while making the surface combatants themselves more vulnerable to attack. At the same time, Chinese missile forces were capable of suppressing Taiwanese air power and severely limiting (and attriting) the buildup of U.S. land-based tactical air capabilities in Japan. During the initial stage of the conflict, China’s air forces enjoyed substantial air superiority over Taiwan and were able to employ ground-attack aircraft and bombers to obstruct the movement of Taiwanese reinforcements to the battle area. These strengths, however, were unable to offset the challenges of getting Chinese ground forces ashore in Taiwan and keeping them supplied once there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case iterations, China was able to land a total of 37 battalions. With losses deducted, China’s strength at the end of the iteration averaged 30 battalions, or 30,000 personnel (including non-combat elements). On average, the size of the Chinese beachhead ashore measured roughly 2,600 km2 (or 7 percent) of the total Taiwanese territory of roughly 36,000 km2 by the end of game play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Iteration, Base Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Balanced against Chinese failure to achieve operational objectives in the base scenario were the large losses suffered by all the combatants. Considering the short period of time, U.S. air losses were greater than any witnessed since the Vietnam War. Naval losses were greater than anything experienced since World War II. Japan also suffered heavily: two out of the three base iterations saw strikes against airfields across the length of the archipelago. Taiwanese losses in personnel and infrastructural damage were great. China’s losses were also staggering and included large numbers of aircraft, virtually its entire fleet, and thousands of personnel. Although losses were high for both sides, the speed with which the base scenario ends (often decided by the sinking of China’s amphibious fleet after 10 days) limits losses in the ground campaign for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RP8lkmA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Base Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of U.S. and Chinese air-to-air capability was unimportant because most aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The lack of U.S. and allied air bases within practical range of Taiwan led to crowding at the few bases available. Furthermore, most of those bases lack any HASs to mitigate damage. Thus, Chinese missiles destroyed many aircraft — about 90 percent of total U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses — on the ground, despite the large number of U.S. and Japanese air and missile defenses on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost between 168 and 372 aircraft in the three base scenario iterations. Subtracting the 96 Navy fighter/attack aircraft lost on U.S. aircraft carriers in all base scenario iterations, the Air Force suffered losses between 70 and 274 aircraft, mostly on the ground. In one of the base scenario iterations, the Chinese team did not attack bases in Japan, but China did strike Andersen Air Force Base in Guam in every iteration, producing losses there. Japanese air losses were also high in two out of three iterations, averaging 122 aircraft, and were also largely incurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers). These losses were partly an artifact of U.S. forward deployment aimed at deterring China, as the scenario begins with two carriers and an additional SAG positioned in vulnerable positions off Okinawa. It also reflects the vulnerability of surface ships to large salvos of modern anti-ship missiles. These salvos exhausted the ships’ magazines of interceptors; even with the base case assumption that shipborne missile defense works very well, there are simply too many attacking missiles to intercept. The JMSDF suffered even more heavily, as all its assets fall within the range of Chinese anti-ship missile systems, which include anti-ship ballistic missiles and long-range ASCMs as well as submarines and shorter-range munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s air losses included roughly half of its operational air force, the majority lost on the ground to missile strikes. Even within the scope of the these relatively short iterations, the 26 ships of Taiwan’s navy (22 frigates and 4 destroyers) were destroyed by a combination of China’s joint fire strikes and aggressive hunting by China’s second-tier naval ships. The land battles were fierce but limited in scale, with Taiwanese army casualties averaging about 3,500, with about a third of those killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s losses in the base scenario were also high. In all iterations, PLAN ships around Taiwan were the primary focus of attack, and China’s naval losses averaged 138 major ships in the three iterations of the base scenario. On average, these included 86 amphibious ships (90 percent of the total) and 52 other major surface warships. Chinese aircraft losses, averaging 161 fixed-wing combat aircraft per iteration, were smaller than those for the United States. But in the base iterations, the United States never attacked Chinese bases (though they were permitted to do so according to the scenario assumptions), so all of China’s air losses were suffered in the air. Therefore, China would have lost many aircrews but had no losses to ground crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s overall personnel losses were high. In ground combat, China suffered an average of 7 battalion-equivalents destroyed, equal to Taiwan’s ground losses. This would translate to about 7,000 casualties, roughly a third of whom are assumed killed. Another roughly 15,000 soldiers were lost at sea, with half assumed killed. Finally, many (and probably an overwhelming majority) of the 30,000-plus Chinese survivors on Taiwan would likely become prisoners at the end of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; The LRASM was particularly useful because of its ability to strike Chinese naval forces and directly reduce Chinese invasion capabilities. In every iteration, the United States expended its entire global inventory of LRASMs (about 450 missiles) within the first week of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because LRASM inventories were so limited, the base case assumption about the effectiveness of the JASSM-ER against ships played a critical role in the speed and effectiveness of that attrition campaign. In the base scenario, the inventory of several hundred LRASMs, with a range of 600 km, combined with thousands of JASSM-ERs, with even greater range and modest anti-ship capability, allowing U.S. bombers and tactical aircraft to rapidly attrite the Chinese fleet from beyond the range of its anti-aircraft defenses. Thus, the large inventory of JASSM-ERs provided the numbers necessary to conduct the anti-ship campaign quickly and at standoff distances (the implications of this are discussed in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the large JASSM-ER inventory and the uncertainty of its ability to strike ships, varying that assumption became a critical part of the research agenda. Long-range missiles were critical because Chinese air defenses were initially so formidable that no aircraft could get close enough to drop short-range munitions. Even stealth aircraft were at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pessimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Pessimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nineteen iterations were run with pessimistic scenarios that incorporated excursion cases more favorable to China. The extreme “Taiwan stands alone” or “Ragnarok” scenarios are discussed separately. The large number of pessimistic iterations was driven by the operational results of the base scenario and the desire to examine how robust the base scenario outcomes would be in the face of plausible changes to assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; All 19 pessimistic iterations included the assumption that the JASSM-ER missile possesses no capability against ships at sea. As noted in the discussion of the base scenario, the JASSM had a decisive impact on outcomes, but its actual anti-ship capabilities are not well established. The first four pessimistic iterations used only the “No maritime strike JASSM” excursion case. The remaining 15 iterations included at least three additional pessimistic excursion case assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve of the iterations included delayed U.S. mobilization, late engagement, or larger U.S. holdouts for other ongoing contingencies. Twelve of the iterations included pessimistic assumptions about Taiwanese operational competence or ability to react to the invasion quickly. Three included U.S. rules of engagement that prohibited strikes on mainland China. One iteration included an increased number of Chinese IRBMs, and one included Japanese prohibition of JSDF offensive action outside of Japanese water or airspace, even after attacks on Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The results of the pessimistic scenarios were significantly better for China than the base scenarios. Nevertheless, none resulted in a clear Chinese success (i.e., a Chinese occupation of Taipei or even more than a quarter of the island). Three of the 18 iterations resulted in a clear and decisive Chinese defeat, and the remainder had not produced decisive results at end of play, some 14 to 35 days into the campaign. Of those 13 cases of stalemate, 3 were judged to end “stalemate, trending toward China,” 7 were judged to end “stalemate, trending against China,” and 2 were “stalemate, indeterminate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jd77msD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stalemates judged to be trending toward China, the PLA controlled (or were soon to complete occupation of) Kaoshiung, Tainan, and much of the southern third of the island. In those cases, areas under Chinese control included several ports and airports; the United States had to devote many airstrikes against these facilities, while the Chinese raced to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the stalemated iterations been continued, the result would have been decided by the relative ability of the two sides to supply themselves from existing stocks or from new shipments to the island. For Taiwan, the United States, and its partners, this would have required running convoys to the island under air and missile attack. In China’s case, it would have required repairing logistical infrastructure while under air and missile attack. The United States was attempting to flow whatever tactical aircraft remained into the theater, while the PLA had used all of its ground-launched conventional ballistic missiles and had only a third of the long-range cruise missile inventory remaining to counter these final U.S. squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more pessimistic assumptions used in a scenario, the worse the outcome for the United States The three iterations run with only one pessimistic assumption (the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case) produced one decisive Chinese defeat and two that were trending against China. Those scenarios with additional pessimistic assumptions produced a wider range of results — with an average result significantly worse for the United States and its partners than the three more moderately pessimistic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the pessimistic iterations, the PLA was able to land an average of 60 battalions. The final strength of PLA forces ashore, after losses, averaged 43 battalions, or 43,000 combat soldiers and accompanying support personnel. At the end of game play, the PLA controlled an average of 6,240 km2 (or 17 percent) of Taiwan’s 36,000 km2, though, as noted, there was considerable variation between games. Finally, it should be noted that the games lasted an average of six turns (or 21 days of campaign time). Although the result was often clear at that point, getting to final resolution would require many additional weeks of combat. In the case of stalemate, the war might have continued for many months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, Pessimistic Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Losses in the pessimistic scenarios (i.e., those more favorable to China) were again heavy, with average air and ground force losses higher for the United States, Japan, and China than in the base scenario and ship losses that were roughly comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6A4MQfC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Pessimistic Case Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost an average of 484 aircraft, roughly 70 percent higher than in the base iterations, with the Air Force losing almost twice as many as it did in the base iterations. Greater U.S. air losses were primarily a function of campaigns that were generally longer than the relatively quick Chinese defeats experienced in the base scenario iterations. The longer time horizons allowed the United States to bring more aircraft into theater — and to lose a significant portion of them on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, with the “no maritime strike JASSM” assumption in effect, the United States relied relatively more on tactical aircraft to launch shorter-range munitions (JSMs and Joint Standoff Weapons, or JSOWs) against the Chinese fleet. This resulted in additional losses in the air as well as higher incentives for the Chinese to seek their destruction on the ground — often entirely exhausting the Chinese inventory of air- and ground-launched standoff missiles in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air losses varied greatly from game to game, from a low of 90 to a high of 774 in these iterations. Variation was primarily a function of U.S. strategy, with some particularly aggressive teams bringing in reinforcements as quickly as possible, basing them close to Taiwan, and losing them in enormous numbers; other teams took a more cautious approach. Japanese losses averaged a third higher than in the base scenario iterations and were relatively consistent across iterations. China struck bases in Japan in every one of the pessimistic iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China lost an average of 327 aircraft per iteration, ranging from a low of 48 to a high of 826. These air losses were roughly twice as high as in the base scenario. In half of the iterations, the U.S. team attacked Chinese air bases with JASSM-ERs. These attacks destroyed between 66 and 748 aircraft, depending on the extent, scale, and target of attacks. Losses in the air were fewer than ground losses but similarly varied according to whether the U.S. team challenged the Chinese CAP over Taiwan and how aggressively the Chinese team sought to extend air operations beyond Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ship losses for the United States and Japan were similar to the base scenario. The pessimistic scenarios often provided fewer naval reinforcements during the first several weeks of the conflict. The greater surviving Chinese capabilities tended to make the U.S./Japanese player more cautious with the use of surface forces. Any surface ship that approached Taiwan was destroyed in both scenarios, and the remainder were often not a high priority for China since they posed only a limited threat to the Chinese operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese naval losses (120 ships) were 14 percent lower than in the base scenario, despite iterations that often lasted more than twice as long. Several of the assumptions in these scenarios, particularly the lack of open-ocean maritime capability for the JASSM-ER and slower or reduced U.S. reinforcements, pushed the U.S. teams to concepts of operation that required more time to bring to fruition. Nevertheless, Chinese ship losses were severe. In most of those cases where the amphibious fleet had not been destroyed outright by the end of the iteration, picket ships east of Taiwan were sufficiently attrited that the final destruction of the amphibious fleet would have occurred within days or a week thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses from ground combat — an average of 17,000 PLA casualties and 22,000 Taiwanese — were significantly higher in pessimistic scenarios than in the base scenario because more Chinese units got onto Taiwan and could fight more intensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical Variables: Some variables had greater impacts than others. As mentioned above, the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case was especially difficult for the United States. In all scenarios, the clearest, fastest, and most direct way to defeat the invasion is to attack the amphibious fleet off Taiwan using standoff munitions. Without JASSM-ER’s anti-ship capability, the ability of the United States to pursue this strategy is limited by a shortage of appropriate missiles. However, even without the ability to attack ships at sea, the JASSM-ER can contribute to defeating invasion. In the pessimistic scenarios, U.S. teams used the JASSM-ER to attack Chinese air bases and ports. The former can attrite Chinese combat aircraft and disrupt Chinese air support for operations on Taiwan, while the latter can disrupt the loading of amphibious ships or destroy them at the pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the U.S. rules of engagement prohibit strikes on China’s mainland, perhaps because of concerns over escalation, the assumption about the JASSM’s lack of open-ocean anti-ship capability becomes more consequential. The missile still has a role, but a much-circumscribed role. The JASSM can be used to attack captured ports and air bases on Taiwan to prevent their use by the PLA. It can also be used for strikes against Chinese ground forces on Taiwan, though it is not well suited for that role because of its unitary warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another impactful excursion case was delayed U.S. mobilization until D-Day. In scenarios wherein the United States only begins mobilization after the start of the war and does not engage in combat operations until after the first week, China’s amphibious fleet suffered less early attrition and was, therefore, able to get far more forces ashore, putting China in a better position to make rapid gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second condition with a large impact was diminished Taiwanese ground force effectiveness and, especially, diminished reaction speed. Under conditions in which Taiwan was delayed in transferring forces from one army area to another, China was better able to make gains on the ground and consolidate its position. That was especially significant when China made its primary landing in the southern Taiwan, where the defending forces are relatively sparse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, two conditions produced a larger impact when incorporated into the scenario together than they did separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Optimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumptions could just as plausibly prove incorrect in ways that might advantage the United States and its coalition. Running iterations with optimistic assumptions illustrated under what circumstances U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses might be lower than the base scenario. Two such iterations were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the iterations run with optimistic assumptions incorporated four optimistic assumptions, including expanded U.S. access to dual-use facilities in Japan, Chinese missile holdbacks, reduced ship defense effectiveness, and a resilient force posture on Turn 1 (i.e., no bombers on Guam or aircraft carriers forward of Guam). The second iteration incorporated seven optimistic assumptions, including: additional HASs, expanded access to Japanese dual-use facilities, Japanese authorization to use force from Turn 1, lower Chinese amphibious operational competence, superior U.S. fifth-generation aircraft, superior U.S. pilot training, and less effective ship defenses for all combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Both optimistic iterations produced decisive Chinese defeats (or U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese victories). The Chinese fleet was heavily damaged in the first three days and was unable to land more than three amphibious brigades ashore during the critical first three days, supplemented by one to two brigades of airborne and air assault forces. Follow-on waves consisted of individual battalions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, the PLA was able to land a total of 25 battalions, with a final strength of 22 battalions after losses. The force was unable to gain more than a small foothold ashore, amounting to less than a single game hex (780 km2). With the amphibious fleet effectively destroyed after the first two turns, the game was declared finished, though some combat might have sputtered along for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although escalation decisions were not part of the game, participants in the optimistic scenarios suggested that escalation might have been least likely in these scenarios since defeat was quick and there were relatively few forces ashore to rescue or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qGecbMA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 7: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, Optimistic Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the brevity of combat operations, the optimistic scenarios produced lower losses for all combatants than other scenarios. Nevertheless, losses to the Chinese fleet were crippling, and China was still able to inflict significant losses on coalition air and naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QKViIt9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 8: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Optimistic Case Scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Chinese amphibious ships at sea and most of the picket force were sunk. Missiles from shore batteries on Taiwan, U.S. submarines, bombers, and tactical aircraft all contributed to these sinkings. The excursion case of reduced ship-based defenses greatly accelerated the rate at which Chinese ships were sunk. With Chinese forces ashore not posing a pressing threat to Taiwanese cities or ports, the United States did not feel pressured to attack Chinese aircraft on the mainland: the relatively light Chinese aircraft losses were therefore mostly due to ground fire over Taiwan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China team, confronted with the prospect of extremely high and rapid losses to its amphibious fleet, sought to mitigate those losses by attacking air bases in Japan and Guam from the first days of the conflict. Despite the brevity of the campaign, China exhausted all of its long-range missile inventories against those targets, destroying many of the aircraft in Japan. However, because the United States did not have the time to flow as many aircraft into theater as in other scenarios, there were fewer aircraft for China to destroy. US air losses were only 74 percent of what they were in the base scenario and 54 percent what they were in the pessimistic scenarios. Japanese air losses were 80 percent and 70 percent of the base and pessimistic cases, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ground combat, casualties to ground forces on Taiwan were similarly light. On the Chinese side, these amounted to 3 battalions rendered combat ineffective, with perhaps 3,000 Chinese casualties (including 1,000 fatalities). Casualties on the Taiwanese side were roughly twice as high, many of which were caused by Chinese aircraft conducting ground support operations. Barring a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of stranded Chinese soldiers, roughly 24,000 Chinese soldiers associated with units ashore would have been taken prisoner, in addition to the survivors from sunken ships who might have been taken prisoner after swimming to shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; To the extent that Chinese losses were lighter in this set of scenarios than in others, the outcome was a function of the shorter scenario combined with U.S. and partner priorities that were affected by the conditions of the scenario, as described above. If no off-ramp to peace were found, Chinese naval and air losses would continue to climb (in the former case limited by the size of the fleet and in the latter probably more dramatically as the United States turned its attention to attacking aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three factors significantly reduced U.S. losses in both iterations: dispersion across more locations (including civilian airports), reduced missile coverage on the part of China (due to missile holdouts and less-well-optimized warheads), and early attacks on Japanese air bases. The latter was motivated by the increased danger to the Chinese fleet posed by tactical aircraft and resulted in fewer aircraft being at the bases when attacked since fewer reinforcements had flowed in from other U.S. bases around the world. Additionally, the building of new HASs reduced aircraft losses in one of the iterations, while not placing bombers in Guam or aircraft carriers forward deployed reduced aircraft losses in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two optimistic assumptions had little impact: superior U.S. pilot training and superior fifth-generation aircraft. There was little air-to-air combat in the optimistic scenarios, largely because of the employment of long-range standoff munitions. Had a mix of pessimistic and optimistic assumptions been in play, it is possible that superiority of U.S. air-to-air combat capability might have been more significant. However, it probably would not have factored among the most important variables due to most U.S. air losses occurring on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-stands-alone&quot;&gt;Taiwan Stands Alone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario was designed to examine how Taiwan might fare with no direct material assistance from the United States. This provides a baseline against which to measure the U.S. and partner contribution to the defense of Taiwan. The project team conducted one iteration of this scenario. Because the United States remained on the sidelines, the assumption was that no other country would intervene because the risks would be too high for any second-tier power. None of the excursion cases run in the other scenarios were incorporated into this scenario, but this scenario did have two unique assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Taiwan’s operations would be weakened by a long-term shortage in ammunition. The scenario assumed that after two months of operations, ammunition shortages would force Taiwan to fire half as frequently, with a corresponding reduction in effectiveness. After three months, ammunition exhaustion forces artillery crews to be reformed into infantry units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to withhold some aircraft to deter U.S. and Japanese intervention, even if that intervention was ultimately not forthcoming. This had the effect of limiting the number of aircraft supporting Chinese ground forces on Taiwan. After withholding squadrons for deterrence, China was left with 14 squadrons for ground support, with 6 additional squadrons to replace losses as they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xi3bdw0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario resulted in a PLA victory. The outcome was never in doubt, with the PLA making slow but steady progress throughout the operation. PLA commanders landed forces in the south, took Tainan and Gaoshiung after three weeks, and occupied Taichung (halfway up the coast) by the end of the sixth week. Frustrated with slow progress up the west side of the island and with ground forces to spare, PLA commanders then opened a second front at Hualian. PLA armor occupied the president’s palace in Taipei after 10 weeks. In the actual event of a Chinese invasion without third-party intervention, the Taiwanese government might capitulate before the bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the iteration, Taiwan’s commander flowed forces to meet the attack and defended successive river lines. To dislodge those positions, China brought up heavy armor, engineering support, and artillery. However, transporting these units to the island required substantial time. To dislodge particularly stubborn positions, the PLA also dispatched light infantry forces to work around the flanks in the foothills of Taiwan’s steep mountains. Once defenses were broken or flanks were turned, Taiwanese forces retreated to the next river line and continued the fight. A close parallel to the scenario is the Allied campaign in Italy in World War II, where the Germans withdrew slowly, defending each river and mountain ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the two-and-a-half-month campaign, the PLA landed a total of 230 battalions on Taiwan. Despite Taiwanese shore-based ASCMs, the amphibious fleet remained viable throughout the campaign. PLA commanders were able to transport the engineers necessary to repair damage to ports and airports as they were captured. When Taipei fell, 165 Chinese battalions were on the island (another 65 battalions having been rendered combat ineffective). This force was more than four times the number present at the end of the base scenario iterations involving U.S. intervention. Including personnel not associated with combat battalions, this force might number 300,000, a number comparable to the invasion force considered for Operation Causeway, the planned U.S. 1945 invasion of Taiwan that was never launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MDPEkTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 9: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, “Taiwan Stands Alone”.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the results are sobering, the campaign was also enlightening in other ways. If Taiwanese forces are willing to fight, Chinese forces would require a prolonged period of combat before occupying Taiwan’s major cities. This buys time for a delayed U.S. intervention or international diplomacy. Regardless, the results show how much damage resilient Taiwanese armed forces can inflict. Increasing their lethality and survivability would also likely enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties were high in this campaign because of the protracted and intensive nature of ground combat. However, the composition of losses was very different from other scenarios. PLA ground forces suffered roughly 70,000 casualties in ground combat, including 23,100 killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the first 10 days of combat, Taiwanese anti-ship shore batteries sank 17 amphibious ships and the same number of escort ships (roughly 16 percent of PLA totals in both categories) before being destroyed or running out of missiles. With Taiwan’s navy having been defeated by missile, air, submarine, and surface attack, and the surviving elements of Taiwan’s air force struggling to survive, no additional losses were inflicted on China’s fleet. However, the PLAAF suffered attrition from ground fire and SAMs throughout the campaign, losing a total of 240 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with every scenario, Taiwan lost its entire navy. The Taiwanese air force squadrons that survived China’s joint fires strike were eventually destroyed in air-to-air combat. Its army suffered 85,000 casualties, with perhaps 28,000 killed. Casualties amounted to roughly half of its total mobilized army strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ragnarok&quot;&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Ragnarok” scenario was designed to ascertain what conditions would be necessary for China to be victorious in the face of Taiwanese resistance and U.S. intervention. The need for a special scenario became clear after China failed to secure a total victory in a range of pessimistic scenarios. This scenario should therefore not be taken as a likely future but rather as a tool to illustrate what would be necessary to invalidate the project’s main result (that China is unlikely to succeed if Taiwan resists and the United States intervenes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be victorious, China must negate U.S. airpower, both fighter attack and bombers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. fighter/attack aircraft could not effectively participate in operations if Tokyo remained strictly neutral and did not allow the United States to operate from its bases in Japan. While it is possible to use tankers with aircraft based on Guam, this would (1) be vulnerable on the ground to Chinese ballistic missiles, (2) be vulnerable in the air if tankers were intercepted, and (3) be unable to generate enough sorties over Taiwan to significantly affect the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to negate U.S. bombers. This is hard to do because bombers can be based beyond the range of most Chinese ground-attack missiles, approach the theater from several angles, and launch standoff missiles beyond the range of defending SAMs. If China attempted to interdict U.S. bombers with its surface ships, then the United States could attrite these ships down until it had created a path to the amphibious fleet (not unlike most other scenarios, wherein the United States must attrite the pickets east of Taiwan). An extreme-range SAM would be limited by the curvature of the Earth and therefore be unable to intercept U.S. bombers before they fired their missiles. However, without U.S. fighters based in Japan for escorts, U.S. bombers would be vulnerable to Chinese fighters armed with extreme-range air-to-air missiles. Alternatively, if China either did not have these missiles or could not complete a kill chain with them, the United States could negate its own bombers by failing to procure sufficient long-range, air-launched ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; As expected, Ragnarok ended in a PLA victory. Without having to worry about U.S. forces in Japan, the PLA was able to focus its land-attack missiles on Guam, negating it as a base. Despite the absence of U.S. bombers, the Chinese amphibious fleet still took a large number of casualties from ASCMs on Taiwan and U.S. SSNs infiltrating into the straits. By the time these attackers were out of ammunition or attrited, they had reduced the amphibious fleet to one-third of its beginning strength. However, the absence of U.S. fighter/attack aircraft allowed the Chinese to focus their aircraft on supporting the ground invasion. This allowed the PLA to make steady progress ashore and eventually compensate for destroyed amphibious ships with captured ports and airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last serious challenge to the invasion came from an unsuccessful attack by the massed U.S. fleet. After three weeks of conflict, a U.S. fleet of 29 cruisers and destroyers, two carriers, and 10 SSNs approached Taiwan. Under withering fire from Chinese submarines, air-launched ASCMs, and surface ships, the US fleet was largely destroyed without relieving Taiwan. At this point, the game was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties in this scenario were very different from other scenarios. The only U.S. aircraft that were destroyed were either on Guam initially or flew from carriers. The reliance on SSNs meant that 10 SSNs were lost even before the climactic naval showdown. In total, the United States lost four carriers, 43 cruisers and destroyers, and 15 SSNs. If Taiwan continued to fight to the end, their casualties would be similar to those in the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario demonstrated the centrality of two variables: basing in Japan and the ability of the United States to deliver ASCMs en masse. Without the ability of U.S. aircraft to operate out of Japan, the PLAAF can concentrate against targets in Taiwan while the PLA delivers more troops ashore. While U.S. bombers could hypothetically still deliver a decisive amount of ordnance, the outcome would rest on their effectiveness. This could be neutralized either by PLA advances in anti-air missiles or by insufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship missiles. Without U.S. airpower, Taiwanese ground-launched ASCMs and U.S. SSNs are insufficient to defeat a Chinese invasion; furthermore, the vulnerability of surface ships prevents the U.S. surface fleet from being effective. While it must be emphasized that this was an unlikely scenario, it is analytically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the excursion assumptions noted in Chapter 4 (“Assumptions and Excursions”) were included in some subset of the scenarios. Based on outcomes and analysis of game play, it is apparent that some of these had a larger impact than others (see Figure 8 below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those that worked to China’s advantage, two had a particularly pronounced impact. First was “Taiwan stands alone,” in which Taiwan had no support from the United States or other allies and fell to China’s inexorable advance. Second was “Japan neutral,” in which Japan does not permit U.S. basing, limiting U.S. operations to those that could be sustained from Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, or at-sea naval forces. Three others had significant and notable effects. The “U.S. combat starts D plus 14” excursion case saw late intervention by the United States and allowed China to establish more forces ashore before suffering major attrition to its amphibious fleet. The “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case slowed attrition of the Chinese fleet. The “Taiwanese forces paralyzed to D plus 4” excursion case prevented Taiwan from rapidly reinforcing the beachhead and enabled Chinese forces ashore to expand the beachhead during the first days after landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those excursion assumptions that favored the United States and its partners, two were particularly important in affecting operational outcomes. First, the “ship defenses poor” excursion case resulted in the rapid sinking of amphibious ships and their escorts and further diminished China’s prospects. Second, the “reduced PLA amphibious competence” excursion case similarly diminished the already limited number of troops that China can land on beaches during a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two excursion cases diminished U.S. losses during the campaign while maintaining Taiwanese autonomy. The “U.S., Japan can use large Japanese airports” excursion case permits the dispersion of U.S. and Japanese aircraft over more facilities and reduces the impact of Chinese missile attacks against allied airpower. The “no U.S. show of force” excursion case allows the U.S. team to start its carriers, bombers, and tankers outside of China’s primary threat rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 summarizes in graphic form the impact of changing assumptions. The direction of arrows indicates whether the change benefits the Chinese invasion (to the left) or the Taiwanese defense (to the right). The significance of the assumption is denoted by the length of the arrow and its color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base scenario produced relatively rapid and clear Chinese defeat, a result produced largely by the ability of U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese anti-ship missiles to destroy the Chinese amphibius fleet before the PLA forces ashore can capture ports and airports to increase the force flow across the strait. Optimistic scenarios (favoring the United States and its partners) produced the same results but more quickly and with lower casualties. Pessimistic scenarios (favoring China) produced more protracted fighting and a wider range of operational outcomes, ranging from decisive Chinese defeat to stalemates in which China controlled damaged ports and airports. The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario produced inexorable Chinese advance, concluding with the Chinese occupation of the entire island — an unambiguous PLA victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses in all iterations were high and sobering for both sides. In all but the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, China lost the large preponderance of its surface fleet, including amphibious ships, surface combatants, and carriers as well as a portion of its submarine fleet. In most iterations, the U.S. Navy lost two carriers and more than a dozen surface ships as well as four submarines. It was only able to avoid that outcome in optimistic scenarios because the United States did not push its fleet forward as a deterrent signal prior to the start of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air losses varied greatly for both sides. On the U.S. side, they numbered in the hundreds under all scenarios and averaged 283 in the base scenario, 484 in pessimistic scenarios, and 200 in optimistic scenarios. Across all iterations, U.S. aircraft losses ranged from a low of 90 to a high of 774. Japan also lost more than 100 aircraft in most iterations, and Taiwan lost its entire air force. Chinese aircraft losses varied greatly, as the United States only attacked Chinese air bases in iterations run under pessimistic assumptions — and in only half of those. Chinese air losses averaged 161 under the base scenario, 327 under pessimistic assumptions, and 290 under optimistic scenarios. Chinese air losses varied from a low of dozens to a high of 748.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground losses varied primarily according to the duration of the campaign and the number of forces landed on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-these-results-different-from-classified-dod-games&quot;&gt;Why Are These Results Different from Classified DOD Games?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this project find that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be difficult and fail under most conditions when the purported results of classified wargames indicate much higher chances of Chinese success, as do the intuitive views of many commentators who see the large disparity of forces in the Western Pacific between China and Taiwan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in Chapter 2, publicly available information on the results of classified wargames indicates high U.S. casualties and unfavorable outcomes. The amount of information is limited, however, because of the restrictions regarding classified information. Nevertheless, examination of public descriptions of classified wargames and what is known about the conduct of wargames in general allows the project to make informed guesses about why results differ between the classified games and this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasions Are Difficult to Model with the Method of Pks:&lt;/strong&gt; Classified models tend to prioritize the method of Pks over the method of history because of the richness of data on individual systems that is available at the classified level. However, this might lead classified wargames to overestimate the quickness at which amphibious invasions would proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of loading and transporting troops, landing on a hostile shore, building up forces, and then moving inland is inherently difficult. In 1944, the United States considered an invasion of Taiwan as the next step in the Pacific campaign. The move was rejected because of the difficulty. As Ben Jensen, a CSIS expert on wargaming, noted: “Crossing a contested sea only to fight on complex, canalized terrain against a deliberate defense-in-depth makes amphibious assault in Taiwan a more complex operation than even the famed 1944 Operation Overlord — the D-Day landings. Taiwan is a particularly difficult target because it has only about a dozen suitable landing beaches and the terrain inland is highly defensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another insight comes from the naval author and historian C.S. Forrester in his thought piece “If Hitler Had Invaded England.” In it, he considered how a German invasion of Britain in the summer of 1940 might have played out. Germany faced a problem like that of China — a powerful army facing a contested air and naval environment that made crossing even a narrow strip of water difficult. There was an invasion plan, called Operation Sealion, which the Germans prepared for but ultimately did not execute because it lacked the air and naval supremacy needed. In his counterfactual history, Forrester gives the Germans every advantage. The Germans can land successfully with paratroopers and amphibious forces, but the British response in the air and on the sea throttled sustainment and reinforcement. British army counterattacks defeated the now isolated German troops on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many successful Allied amphibious operations of World War II made opposed landings look easy. They are not. The allies were successful because of many years spent refining doctrine and building specialized capabilities. Learning steps such as the catastrophic raid on Dieppe in 1943 were part of that learning process. The Chinese will not have those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Purposes:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in Chapter 2, wargames have different purposes, not all of which are intended to simulate the most likely course of events. For example, some games test concepts and are not intended to represent likely futures. Such a game might assume that Chinese forces land in the Philippines to see whether U.S. forces could use mobility, anti-air capabilities, and anti-ship missiles to contest the invasion. Other games might hypothesize U.S. forces being on islands in the South China Sea or the Philippines and attempting to prevent the breakout of Chinese naval forces from the first island chain. (These are actual scenarios for the game, Littoral Commander: The Indo-Pacific.) These games are useful to test concepts about weapons capabilities and force structure. Because the scenarios are improbable, however, they are not particularly helpful in trying to ascertain the course of future events. To use the Philippines example, it is hard to imagine a set of circumstances where Chinese amphibious forces would land on the main islands of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many U.S.-China wargames have short time increments, which allows detailed assessment of forces and weapons but means that game play covers only the first few days of a conflict. This is the time of greatest U.S. and partner weakness, after initial Chinese attacks but before substantial reinforcements begin to flow. Thus, results can give a skewed sense of what the whole campaign might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the notion of testing concepts is the notion that wargames can be designed to “stress test” for potential weaknesses in new operational concepts. David Ochmanek, a senior analyst at RAND and experienced wargamer, noted this purpose: “Even the games that the United States loses are not necessarily reflective of how a war would unfold in real life; the main purpose is to evaluate American vulnerabilities. We learn a lot from these.” This is a reasonable approach when evaluating risk or exploring policy boundaries. However, the results of particularly pessimistic scenarios do not constitute the most likely results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games are intended primarily to educate the players. Game designers often want to challenge the players and counteract complacency. This is a reasonable approach for educating an officer corps about what future conflict might entail, especially since the officer corps has been accustomed to having military superiority for generations. However, the outcomes of these games do not necessarily represent a full spectrum of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjudication by Judgment vs. Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Another difference might be the adjudication mechanism. Many classified wargames are conducted as seminars, where two sides discuss a scenario and a “white team” adjudicates the results of moves by the two teams. Results, therefore, are heavily dependent on the personal perspectives of the white team members. To combat this source of possible bias, the project developed explicit adjudication mechanisms based on historical experience. (This is described in detail in Chapter 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Assumptions about Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Another possibility is attributing a high level of capabilities and abilities to the Chinese while decrementing U.S. capabilities because of known limitations. This might be done as a hedging mechanism to avoid underestimating a potential adversary. Some analyses, reflected in the fictional speculation of 2034 and Ghost Fleet, hypothesize powerful and previously unknown Chinese capabilities, such as cyber in one case and space weapons in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution of high capabilities to adversaries has a long history. A classic example occurred before the Persian Gulf War of 1991. There was an intensive period of wargaming prior to the war, with the gaming of scenarios related to an attack on Kuwait occurring more than a year before the actual attack and the first planning scenarios for the counterattack commencing the same day as the Iraqi invasion. Gaming was also used to develop several aspects of the final operations plan. However, results depended heavily on whether Iraq’s military was viewed as “war hardened” or “war weary” as a result of its recently concluded eight-year war with Iran. A war-hardened military would fight fiercely and skillfully. Comparison was often made to the North Vietnamese. A war-weary military might collapse quickly. Modeling took Iraqi forces at face value. This was a reasonable hedge, but models produced predictions for U.S. casualties several orders of magnitude higher than the actual casualty figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 provides a more recent example. At the beginning of the conflict, many commentators suggested that the campaign would result in a decisive Russian victory. This analysis was founded on the perceived increase in military effectiveness following what was purported to be an extensive modernization of the Russian military. However, this modernization did not translate to battlefield effectiveness, with warfighting shortcomings becoming apparent following the invasion, new systems not performing as assessed, and forces not fighting as expected. There was an expectation of technical and tactical competency built into assessments that have not been in evidence following the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception:&lt;/strong&gt; During the Soviet period, the United States routinely overestimated Soviet strategic nuclear capabilities. This occurred in part because the Soviets were actively trying to deceive Western intelligence agencies and in part because of Western concerns about avoiding complacency and surprise. Thus, the United States hypothesized a “bomber gap” when the Soviets flew the same bombers repeatedly over reviewing stands during a May Day celebration, thus giving the impression of having more long-range strike aircraft than they in fact had. Looking back on this incident, John Pardos concluded in his study of U.S. intelligence estimates of the Soviet strategic forces, “where organizational interests impinge or turn upon certain conclusions, objective analysis of intelligence is likely to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-the-war-play-out&quot;&gt;How Does the War Play Out?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out the broad features of the conflict, as it played out over the 24 game iterations. It also discusses some of the strategies pursued before moving, in Chapter 7, to the conclusions and recommendations derived from the course of these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-situation-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Situation on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the conflict starts, Chinese air and naval units surrounded the island. The resulting Chinese defensive zone was so dense that no cargo ships could get through, and the danger to airlift aircraft was extreme. In one iteration, an attempt to insert a U.S. Army brigade onto Taiwan by air resulted in two of the three battalions (roughly 2,000 soldiers) being destroyed in the air. The U.S. Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) squadron, which is designed to rapidly deploy large ground formations, could not get through. Taiwan as isolated. The United States could not move any significant forces onto Taiwan within the month that the game covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese were always able to get troops onto Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait is so narrow, the Chinese forces so numerous, and Taiwanese defenses so limited that defeating the invasion at sea was not possible. The Chinese challenge is sustaining the forces landed on the island while bringing in new forces before the Taiwanese can contain the beachhead and counterattack in strength. The steady attrition inflicted by U.S. attacks on China’s amphibious shipping imposes a time constraint on the Chinese invasion. However, once China captures an operational port or airfield, it can use civilian merchant ships and cargo planes to supply its invasion, easing demands on the amphibious fleet. The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese supplemented the beach assault with airborne forces. When these attempted to seize airfields, they generally failed because of the weak combat power that airborne forces possess. This record is consistent with the mixed results of German attempts to employ airborne troops in seizing airfields during the invasion of Crete and Russians in Hostomel. When airborne forces attempted to isolate the battle area, they were more successful and assisted Chinese amphibious forces in establishing a significant beachhead ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ability to land substantial firepower during the early days of conflict, China’s ability to advance off the beaches and establish a larger lodgment depended heavily on airpower. One role was to provide close air support to attacking forces. More important was the interdiction role, destroying bridges and overpasses that might be used by Taiwanese reinforcements moving to reinforce defenses around the beachhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. airpower, for its part, had a limited ability to influence ground combat directly. China’s naval and air forces restricted U.S. strikes to standoff weapons, such as the JASSM-ER. Their unitary warheads were effective against ports and airfields but not against troops in the field because of their dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese players considered attacking the northern part of the island where Taipei, the capital, is located. In this, they sought to replay Germany’s amphibious and airborne assault on Norway’s capital of Oslo in 1940 or Russia’s attack on Kyiv in 2022. However, the Chinese players were generally dissuaded by the strength of defending Taiwanese forces deployed in the north around Taipei. About 46 percent of Taiwan’s total battalions are in the northern third of the island, including half of Taiwan’s mechanized forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter. This made it easier to get ashore and establish a beachhead or airhead but meant that the Chinese forces had to fight their way up the entire island to capture the capital and achieve a decisive result. The nature of the terrain is not, however, propitious for such an advance. The central parts of Taiwan are mountainous and difficult to traverse. The coastal plains are narrow, with rivers and cities that provide good defensive positions. Even capturing the large southern city of Kaohsiung was often a difficult and time-consuming task. Nevertheless, the southern landings met with greater success than did the few attempts at direct attack on the north. Interestingly, when U.S. planners considered invading Taiwan in 1944, they also planned to land in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this campaign would not be a close parallel to that confronting German commanders at Normandy on the so-called “longest day.” Then, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel believed that the coming Allied invasion of France had to be defeated on the beaches during the first 24 hours. If the invasion became established ashore, Allied air and naval power could sustain it. In 1944, that proved correct, but it does not apply to the challenge facing Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be different because the Chinese invasion fleet, though numerous, is not nearly as large as the fleet that supported the D-Day invasion. For that operation, the Allies had 229 amphibious ships (LSTs) and 345 troop ships and cargo ships for a total of 547 ships, serviced by more than 3,000 smaller landing craft (LCIs, LCMs, LCTs, and LCVs). The anticipated Chinese amphibious fleet of 2026 includes 28 LSTs, 18 LHD/LPDs, 20 LSMs, and 30 large civilian RO-ROs, for a total of 96 ships, serviced by 305 landing craft. At Normandy, the Allies put 90,000 troops ashore on the first day, whereas the Chinese can put about 8,000 ashore on D-day/Taiwan (or 16,000 in 3.5 days). Thus, Chinese capabilities are much less than Allied capabilities on D-Day, and a successful initial lodgment does not guarantee eventual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Allied forces had a virtual air and naval monopoly in 1944. The Luftwaffe had been diverted to operations over the homeland and in the east. The U-boat fleet, the only significant remaining German naval force, could not penetrate Allied screens. The Allies could build up forces ashore without serious opposition. If Taiwan faced China alone, the Chinese would have the same air and naval dominance. U.S. participation means that the airspace and seas around Taiwan would be vigorously contested, and the proliferation of long-range precision strike assets means that U.S. airpower could inflict steady losses on the Chinese fleet from long distances. Thus, establishing a beachhead is not enough to ensure a Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, the Japanese faced this same choice: defend on the beach or inland. Initially, they tried to defeat amphibious assaults on the beaches but found that impossible. They then shifted to a defense in depth, forcing the invader to take heavy casualties by attacking prepared fortifications inland. Thus, the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa involved prolonged and bloody campaigns ashore. For Taiwan, a prolonged campaign would allow time for U.S. intervention or a diplomatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three iterations, the Chinese captured the island of Penghu off the west coast of Taiwan, planning to use the island as a staging base for an attack on the main island. Although they defeated Taiwanese forces there, their dwindling amphibious capabilities prevented a successful invasion of the main island. Thus, occupying Penghu during a campaign to invade Taiwan proper was an operational dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project did not examine whether capturing Penghu would succeed as a limited attack for intimidation and bargaining or as part of a longer-term strategy in which Penghu was used as a base of operations to stage forces for an attack on mainland Taiwan several years later. Penghu is politically important because, unlike the other offshore islands closer to the Chinese coast, it was explicitly included in the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and Republic of China (Taiwan). The islands were also included in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Thus, the fallout from a limited Chinese operation to seize Penghu bears separate investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy. Almost all Chinese players launched massive interdiction strikes against transportation infrastructure to prevent Taiwanese forces from moving to the beachhead invasion sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3hV1PgV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Penghu Province.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element was the major battles in port cities and around airfields as the Chinese sought to capture a facility to increase the flow of forces and supplies. The Taiwanese player sometimes sabotaged civilian airfields and ports to prevent them from falling into Chinese hands. Indeed, a few players employed a “scorched earth” strategy that preemptively destroyed the most vulnerable ports and airfields. In these cases, the Taiwanese player judged that the existential threat to Taiwan justified such destruction. As a military tactic, it was highly successful. However, because a port or airfield that is unusable for military purposes is also unusable for civilian purposes, this strategy did immense damage to the transportation hubs on which the Taiwanese economy depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles for cities near invasion beaches would inevitably cause heavy damage and loss of life in residential or commercial areas. Several players also argued that destroying Taiwanese industry and infrastructure would disrupt global supply chains and have effects far beyond the region. Taiwanese manufacturers account for 61 percent of global revenue in semiconductor manufacturing for 16-nm or smaller chips, and it is even more dominant in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors. As a result, every nation on the planet would feel the effects of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bloody-air-and-maritime-battle&quot;&gt;THE BLOODY AIR AND MARITIME BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the wargame’s larger operational map, air and sea missions are plotted over hundreds and often thousands of kilometers. Despite the distances involved, proximity matters, especially when persistence around the battle area is required. For example, U.S. bases on Okinawa are the closest U.S. bases to Taiwan, and air units flying air superiority missions from Okinawa can remain “on station” around Taiwan for longer periods of time than aircraft flying from more distant bases. However, proximity puts assets deep inside adversary threat rings and increases vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce exposure, players often exploited the full range of their systems. They launched air strikes, which require less persistence than air superiority missions, from extreme ranges. U.S. aircraft sortied from bases in northern Japan or even Guam and, with the assistance of tankers, struck targets in the Taiwan Strait or on mainland China. China, for its part, husbanded bombers in its inland bases and launched strikes from those deep bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the geographic scope of the “outer” air and naval battle, these operations nevertheless had a strategic center, revolving around the centrality of tasks on or near Taiwan. The focus of most teams remained squarely on the primary tasks at hand. For U.S. teams, this was the destruction of China’s amphibious fleet, without which China cannot achieve victory. For China, this involved protecting the amphibious fleet, landing as many troops ashore as possible and supporting them, to the maximum extent possible, with airpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Strategies to Attack and Defend the Invasion Fleet:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s success or failure hinges largely on its ability to defend the amphibious fleet long enough to achieve its objectives ashore. Much of the maritime and air battle therefore revolves around the U.S. effort to sink that fleet, and China’s effort to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and partner forces have many potent assets they can bring to bear in this fight. Taiwan’s ground-based anti-ship missiles can engage from the outset and impose modest attrition on the fleet until those that are not destroyed by Chinese air and missile strikes are expended, which generally occurs in the second week of the conflict. Submarines are inherently stealthy and can also reliably inflict attrition on the Chinese fleet. However, submarines carry a limited number of munitions, so while they can impose steady attrition, submarines must periodically return to port to rearm, and their effect therefore plays out over an extended period of time. Given the high carrying capacity and rapid rearm times of aircraft, bombers and fighters equipped with long-range anti-ship missiles provide the most potent threat to Chinese shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Chinese players adopted a two-pronged strategy to blunt these attacks. Defensively, the Chinese teams established a layered presence between the amphibious fleet and threats to it. They deployed some SAGs around the immediate perimeter of the amphibious fleet. Most sent SAGs to serve as air- and missile-defense pickets east of Taiwan and, beyond that, dispatched submarines into the Philippine Sea and Western Pacific to intercept and attack U.S. surface fleets. At the same time, Chinese teams employed offensive operations to strike U.S. (and often Japanese) naval forces whenever they could be located, and most teams attacked U.S. air bases throughout Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s more strictly defensive activities followed a predictable path. The Chinese picket forces, when deployed, successfully blunted U.S. attacks on the amphibious fleet for a while. However, in most iterations, the United States eventually overwhelmed the picket force with massive air and missile strikes of their own because the Chinese did not have enough combat aircraft and tankers both to provide CAP for these ships and conduct other high-priority operations (strikes and ground support over Taiwan). The use of the PLAN as a kind of “ablative” armor for the amphibious ships, while effective, resulted in heavy Chinese casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the approach outlined above represents a sound Chinese approach, the results were mixed. Chinese submarines inflicted some attrition on U.S. naval forces, though the large expanse to be patrolled, the prevalence of diesel boats in the Chinese fleet, and anti-submarine operations by the United States and Japan generally limited damage. More potent were Chinese long-range missile strikes and massed missiles strikes, which almost always succeeded in overcoming U.S. naval defenses. Typically, the United States lost both forward-deployed carriers within the first turn or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s high-end anti-ship missiles were often exhausted relatively early. If the games had continued for additional weeks, it is likely that subsequent attacks (if they had taken place) would have been less lethal. By then, however, the battle on Taiwan might have been largely decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Devastates U.S. Air Bases:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in previous chapters, the base case assumes that Japan remains neutral but allows U.S. forces to conduct combat operations from U.S. bases in Japan, including from Kadena, Iwakuni, Yokota, and Misawa. These bases are of tremendous value for the United States. Aircraft based in Japan can strike Chinese ships around Taiwan and escort bombers coming from Alaska or Hawaii. Aircraft flying from Kadena or southern Japan can also spend more time over Taiwan conducting air superiority operations and do not need as much aerial refueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PLARF has many TBMs and ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) that can range Japan. These highly accurate missiles, many of whose warheads are equipped with submunitions, could blanket all of the military air bases in Japan. The PLAAF’s air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) supplement these ground-launched systems. Thus, China can conduct devastating attacks on air bases in Japan, sometimes including the element of surprise, despite the risk that such an attack would draw the JSDF into the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether to attack Japan was a critical decision for the Chinese player. As the chart below shows, the Chinese player usually did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tjv0hlF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Chinese Attacks against Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, the Chinese player did not attack immediately, being cautious about bringing Japan into the conflict and wanting to conserve the large but still finite inventory of missiles until they might have maximum effect. However, as the United States built up forces on Japanese bases and used these as sanctuaries to attack Chinese air and naval forces, the Chinese player then decided to attack. This delayed attack was highly effective, destroying hundreds of massed U.S. and Japanese aircraft on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Chinese players attacked U.S. forces in Japan, they attacked Japanese forces also, destroying many Japanese aircraft and surface ships. Surviving JSDF fought back, despite the initial losses caused by Chinese TBMs. Most valuable were the Japanese submarines, which could strike Chinese amphibious ships and the Chinese picket line around Taiwan. Also valuable were surviving Japanese aircraft and the country’s significant ASW capabilities. JASDF aircraft added to the CAP over Taiwan and strikes on the Chinese amphibious fleet. Japan’s extensive fleet of MPA and its network of undersea sensors played an important role in attriting China’s fleet of submarines. Like the U.S. surface fleet, the Japanese surface fleet had to maintain a cautious distance from Taiwan until the Chinese missile threat eased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those situations where Japan entered the war, its submarines stayed east or north of Taiwan to avoid fratricide with U.S. submarines. East of Taiwan, JMSDF submarines attacked the Chinese picket line to allow U.S. and Japanese airpower to strike more easily at the amphibious ships; north of Taiwan, they attacked Chinese amphibious ships departing ports outside of the Taiwan Strait. One caution in assessing these results is that these Japanese actions reflect the preferences of U.S. players. They may not reflect the actions of the Japanese government, which might hold substantial forces back for defense of the homeland or put other restrictions on the use of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of attacking Japan worked for China in an operational sense. The benefit of eliminating air bases near Taiwan exceeded the negative effects of having the JSDF join the United States. The results of those games in which China did not attack were poorer for China than those in which it did. This judgment, however, does not consider long-term political and diplomatic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-for-resource-constraints-priorities-and-risk&quot;&gt;Strategies for Resource Constraints, Priorities, and Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final observation about the course of conflict was that both sides often had to make trade-offs and balance risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major area of trade-offs was that both sides wanted to undertake more activities than they had the forces to execute. For example, many China teams discussed placing air patrols east of Taiwan to protect the fleet or even over the Ryukyu Islands to disrupt U.S. and Japanese air strikes. However, the distances involved and the lack of Chinese tankers would have made the missions unwise in view of the other heavy demands on airpower. Most China teams therefore focused the air effort on maintaining air superiority over Taiwan itself and providing air support to ground forces ashore on Taiwan. Chinese players who tried to pursue multiple goals, such as protecting the homeland while invading Taiwan, quickly failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Japanese teams were confronted with similar dilemmas. While most saw value in contesting China’s air presence over Taiwan with fighter sweeps and CAP, the top priority was conducting strikes against the amphibious fleet. Periodic Chinese missile against U.S. and Japanese air bases often left the U.S.-Japan alliance with insufficient aircraft to conduct both air superiority operations and strikes simultaneously. In cases where Chinese ground forces took ports and airports, the need to strike and damage those facilities lest they be used to facilitate additional lift heightened the U.S. dilemma. Similar choices confronted players on those infrequent occasions when U.S. players sought to escort transport aircraft into Taiwan, as forming escort groups would reduce commitments to other forms of missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to dilemmas driven by having more tasks than resources, the teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives. This was especially true of the U.S. team, which begins the conflict on its back foot and in possession of a brittle force posture. Initial Chinese missile strikes destroy much of the U.S. forward-deployed aircraft and naval strength. Although the United States receives a steady stream of air and naval reinforcements, it takes time to build up powerful capabilities in theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States takes a defensive stance until these reinforcements arrive, China can seize ports and airports and establish a secure position on the island. Delay cedes the opportunity to attack Chinese forces before they can build forces ashore on Taiwan. On the other hand, massing forward too aggressively to maximize striking power leads to crippling losses from Chinese missile attacks. The game records suggest that extreme answers to this dilemma are punished. The two iterations in which airpower was thrust forward most aggressively (#12 and #13) resulted in very high U.S. air losses (774 and 750 aircraft, respectively) and stalemated outcomes, while the most cautious strategy (#18) produced lower aircraft losses (392 aircraft) but also failed to produce a favorable operational outcome. Iterations in which players adopted more mixed strategies (#4 and #16) appeared to fare relatively better. This dilemma was most severe in pessimistic scenarios, and all the examples mentioned here are drawn from those cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Domains Are Important but not Decisive:&lt;/strong&gt; No players used direct-ascent weapons against adversary satellite constellations because of concerns about losing their own capabilities. It was a classic case of mutual deterrence. In counterspace operations, both sides contented themselves with electronic warfare and dazzling. They also launched co-orbital attacks that would only unfold beyond the time scale of a Taiwan operation. While space is a critical warfighting domain, it was relatively static in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides employed offensive cyber actions, but again without decisive effect. One excursion case explored a delayed Taiwanese reaction to invasion, partially based on posited cyber disruptions. This delay had a serious impact on Taiwan’s ability to contain Chinese forces on their initial beachhead. However, while cyber operations were useful for gaining temporary advantage, they were not by themselves war-winning tools. This is consistent with recent experience in the Ukraine war but not with the more imaginative effects proposed by some advocates and futurists. An important caution is that the game did not explore either of these domains with classified information. These are two domains where classified information might have an impact. A broader and more nuanced set of capabilities in both domains might produce different results, at least at the strategic or national level if not at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out recommendations arising from analysis of the results and the picture of the war developed above. The purpose is to help policymakers as they consider how the United States should respond to China’s increasing ability to invade Taiwan. Whether the decision is made to defend Taiwan or not, following these recommendations would provide flexibility to decisionmakers. Although these recommendations do not address every aspect of U.S.-China competition (which involves many other factors), these recommendations are worth pursuing because invasion is the most dangerous scenario. Further, many of the recommendations would apply to other scenarios, for example, a blockade of Taiwan or a conflict in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are organized in three categories: (1) politics and strategy, (2) doctrine and posture, and (3) weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy-1&quot;&gt;Politics and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game revolves around military operations, several political and strategic insights emerged with clear policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize deepening diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to operate from U.S. bases in Japan is so critical to U.S. success that it should be considered a sine qua non for intervention. Without Japanese basing, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft had to come from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, which was then generally crippled by Chinese missile strikes. This enables China to mass its airpower forward and concentrate on support of ground forces on Taiwan. Furthermore, the non-participation of the JSDF improves the balance of forces in China’s favor. The United States in Japan has had close security ties for 70 years. These linkages need to be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several game participants who had experience with the Japanese military recommended closer operational coordination between the U.S. and Japanese military establishments. Although the two militaries conduct many peacetime exercises together, the current interpretation of Japan’s constitution prohibits the establishment of a combined (or joint) command with the United States. Moreover, the lack of a standing joint command within the JSDF and the existence of inconsistent geographic command boundaries among the different Japanese services inhibit effective alliance coordination at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching U.S.-Japanese wartime coordination, it became apparent that there may be a disconnect in the interpretation of bilateral treaties. The Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan refers to a requirement for “consultation” between Japan and the United States, but both it and the original defensive alliance are vague about what this requires. Many Japanese officials interpret this as requiring the United States to obtain permission before flying combat missions from Japanese soil for any purpose other than the defense of Japan. However, U.S. officials tended to view “consultation” as notifying Japan of U.S. intentions. This disconnect must be remedied immediately, lest it leads to delays or disruption of war plans during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military planning appears to assume that U.S. forces will be able to deploy onto the sovereign territory of other countries during a crisis. In particular, the Army and Marine Corps seem to assume that the MLRs and Army MDTFs will be pre-positioned in the Philippines, Taiwan, or on forward Japanese islands before conflict begins. This is militarily desirable because it allows the units to get close enough to Chinese naval forces to engage with anti-ship missiles. China’s ability to interdict U.S. force movement after D-Day makes prewar deployments critical to the functioning of many U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would a simple one-time crisis deployment be sufficient. Any U.S. forces on the island would need to have all their logistical sustainment in place before conflict begins because it is so hard to get shipments through once China establishes its defensive zone over the island. This sustainment would need to include hundreds of missiles. A single strike by a squadron of 12 bombers launches over 200 missiles. To be a significant factor in a conflict, forward-deployed ground forces would need to provide comparable levels of missile strikes repeatedly over the course of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such permissions for forward deployments en masse do not seem likely. As noted in the chapter on assumptions, most countries in the region (with the exceptions of Australia and Japan) are cool to the idea of becoming involved in a U.S.-China war due to the immense destruction it would cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan would welcome forward deployments, they would be politically fraught. The base case of this project did not allow such deployments because of current U.S. Taiwan policy, which follows from agreements made with China under the Three Communiqués and has historically prohibited the presence of uniformed U.S. military personnel on Taiwan. As noted in Chapter 4, stationing forces on Taiwan either in peacetime or during a crisis would elicit a strong, possibly even violent reaction from China. Many experts argue that such moves would trigger the conflict it was intended to deter. In 2020, Taiwanese authorities revealed the presence of elements of a rotational training detachment from the Marine Raider Regiment on Taiwan, but the stationing of combat elements would constitute a significant change to established U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities. The Army and Marine Corps could assume they can move forward in a crisis to threaten the Chinese fleet, while the State Department might oppose the moves as provocative, and the White House prohibits deployment. The U.S. government needs to reach a clear internal consensus before a crisis occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore imperative to clarify assumptions about war plans during peacetime and not as the crisis unfolds. The National Security Council would be the natural place to work the issue out because it can integrate perspectives from across the government. Senior civilian decisionmakers do not want to be in the position of Bethmann Hollweg, German chancellor who had to justify Germany violating Belgian neutrality in 1914 because that is what the war plans (over which he had no control) called for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if stationing ground forces on Taiwan is not politically practical, it is important to improve inter-military coordination. This might include creating liaison groups to develop joint procedures, practicing procedures in joint tabletop exercises, expanding Taiwanese participation in U.S. military PME programs, and forming cross-national planning groups to develop concepts for joint defensive operations. All these peacetime activities would smooth wartime operations. Such activities are particularly urgent in the case of Taiwan if the United States believes that conflict is possible in the near or medium term. The United States might also consider pre-positioning equipment and munitions on Taiwan without stationing troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight. Although the United States has enough advantages that it can still prevail in most scenarios, delay means more Chinese forces ashore on Taiwan, higher casualties, and more infrastructure destruction for all parties. Hence, it not only makes the U.S. task more difficult, it may also make off-ramps more difficult to find at the end of conflict. War plans for a Taiwan contingency will have to envision a quick U.S. response; civilian leaders must recognize this need for speed when the time for decision comes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian decisionmakers must recognize that the decision to defend Taiwan during an invasion would result in heavy casualties. If civilian leaders decided to begin the defense, then change their mind after initial casualties, it would incur the worst consequences of intervention and non-intervention: the United States would effectively be at war with China without the benefit of having maintained Taiwan’s autonomy. Again, this project does not argue whether these costs are worth the benefits, but that such an evaluation must be made with open eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conflict with China would be fundamentally unlike the regional conflicts and counterinsurgencies that the United States has experienced since World War II, with casualties exceeding anything in recent memory. Further, the casualty calculations shown in this report, as high as they are, do not encompass the full scope of the war. They cover only the first three or four weeks of the conflict and exclude casualties arising from the battles in the South China Sea, which the wargame abstracted. Thus, numbers presented here represent a floor, not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game mechanics did not track personnel losses directly, these could be estimated from equipment losses (e.g., ships and aircraft). The level of personnel losses is fortunately relatively low relative to the losses in equipment. Nevertheless, personnel casualties averaged 6,960, of which about 3,200 would be killed in action, in the base case even without adding losses from combat in the South China Sea, which the project did not model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/52Vnd4r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Total U.S. Personnel Casualties, Killed, and Total (killed, wounded, or missing).&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Calculations of losses excluded two iterations (#5 and #6) because they were so short. Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States sustained about three killed per day. At the height of the Vietnam War, in 1968, the United States lost 30 killed per day. The loss rate here, about 140 per day in the base case, approaches that of World War II, 300 killed per day. Deaths (vs. casualties, which includes wounded) in three weeks of combat around Taiwan (about 3,200) are about half the total from 20 years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan (5,474).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shocking the U.S. public, the scale of casualties and equipment loss would stagger a U.S. military that has dominated battlefields for a generation. These losses would be particularly difficult for the Air Force and Navy, which have essentially operated in sanctuary since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an Air Force illustration, late-deploying units to Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa will land at a base that has entire squadrons of wrecked U.S. and Japanese aircraft bulldozed to the side of the runway, hundreds of wounded in the base hospital, and temporary cemeteries to handle the many dead. Missile attacks and air combat will have wiped out squadrons that arrived only a few days earlier. Newly arriving personnel will be required to immediately conduct operations against the powerful Chinese forces that have caused so many casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force understands this at an abstract level. The Air Force chief of staff, General Charles Brown, noted this challenge explicitly in his initial guidance: “Tomorrow’s Airmen are more likely to fight in highly contested environments and must be prepared to fight through combat attrition rates and risks to the Nation that are more akin to the World War II era than the uncontested environment to which we have since become accustomed.” However, the challenge will be incorporating this into training and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YQ5xTl2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy and Air Force will need to reject the notion that the next war will be long distance and “push-button,” not requiring personnel to face personal danger or operate under conditions of extreme hardship. Although such notions have been attractive since the end of World War II, they do not describe a twenty-first century conflict between great powers. The Air Force’s recent “multi-capable airmen” concept is a pragmatic acknowledgment of this grim reality. Under this concept, airmen will learn to do basic tasks outside their usual specialty, thus allowing easier adjustments to combat conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broader question about leadership arises from the discussion about casualties and operational results: commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory. It is easy to tell modern officers to emulate the tenacity in the face of adversity shown by their predecessors, such as Vice Admiral William Frederick “Bull” Halsey during the naval battles of the Solomon Islands, Major General Alexander Vandegrift on Guadalcanal, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle raiding Tokyo, or General George Patton at Kasserine Pass. However, the current generation of military officers has been trained on “force protection,” whereby the minimization of casualties is of paramount importance. That makes sense in a counterinsurgency operation where maintaining long-term political support is vital. It is counterproductive in a conventional conflict with clear geographic and political goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All military services should incorporate the recognition of casualties into their training programs and emphasize that there will be no safe rear areas in a great power conflict. The combat forces already do this, but such expectations need to be expanded. For example, many Army support units such as air defense have not suffered significant casualties since 1945, but now they will be a prime target for Chinese missiles. Similarly, aviation organizations should be restructured to cope with wartime losses to aircraft, maintenance facilities, and support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes on the Chinese mainland create grave risks of escalation. These risks are discussed in depth above in the justification for the “U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on Chinese mainland” excursion case. Even if the war plan developed in peacetime calls for mainland strikes, the National Command Authority might withhold permission in the actual event of war. It would therefore be wise to hedge planning on the question of striking the Chinese mainland. If permissions are granted, then military leaders should be ready with plans for strikes on high-value targets such as over-the-horizon radar, satellite uplink stations, and high-value aircraft that affect the fight on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will not be able to insert ground forces onto Taiwan in a timely manner. In some iterations, the U.S. player attrited the PLAN sufficiently that some U.S. ground forces might get through after four or more weeks of conflict, though with some risk from remaining Chinese air and naval power. By that time, however, the battle for Taiwan will likely be decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” In the Ukraine war, the United States and NATO have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies directly to Ukraine during the conflict. Although Russia has made some efforts to interdict this flow by striking railroads with missiles, shutting down or even seriously impeding the flow has been beyond Russia’s military capability. However, China does have that capability. Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” . . . Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should therefore encourage Taiwan to acquire sufficient munitions and weapons to fight the local battle against invading forces without any direct assistance for a prolonged period. For many munitions, Taiwan may be capable of producing its own stockpiles. For U.S.-supplied systems, foreign military sales provide a mechanism to get weapons to Taiwan before conflict begins. Taiwan has ordered billions of dollars of weapons, but deliveries have been slow. The United States should speed up the Foreign Military Sales process on its side and urge the Taiwanese to speed up on their side. There needs to be a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Taiwanese ground forces must immediately shift toward becoming more effective and survivable. Because defeating Chinese forces before they land is likely impossible, effective resistance ashore is critical. This requires an army that is ready, well-trained, well-led, and highly motivated. Without such a ground force, the rest will be in vain. Yet, it is not clear that the Taiwanese army has the necessary qualities. Taiwan needs to give its army a higher priority than it has received in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island of Taiwan contains many geographic features such as mountains and rivers that the Taiwanese forces should use to their advantage. This includes cities and urban sprawl. Although the defense of cities would result in severe damage, failing to defend them makes Chinese operations on the island much easier. The longer Taiwan can lengthen the war, the greater the attrition of the Chinese fleet and the possibility of external aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Taiwan has built a military with broad capabilities, paralleling those of major powers such as the United States. Thus, it has sought large surface ships and advanced aircraft in addition to submarines and ground forces. Currently, it has an air force with 534 combat aircraft (474 fighter/attack, 60 support) and a navy with 38 major vessels (4 submarines, 26 surface combatants, and 8 amphibious ships). Such a structure made sense when Chinese air and naval forces were relatively weak. Taiwan’s ability to contest China in the air and at sea meant it could defeat an invasion before ground forces landed in strength. That minimized damage to Taiwanese infrastructure and its economy. Further, such a structure provided visible reminders of Taiwan’s power and status in peacetime and could counter peacetime Chinese efforts to test Taiwanese sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a broad set of symmetrical capabilities today is inappropriate given the increasing strength of Chinese rocket, air, and naval forces. The Taiwanese surface navy would be quickly destroyed without inflicting significant damage on the Chinese fleet. Submarines are more survivable than surface ships but still vulnerable if China achieves surprise. Having a continuous at-sea submarine presence would mitigate this problem; however, such a presence is currently infeasible due to lack of numbers. The Taiwanese air force is similarly vulnerable. Chinese short-range ballistic missiles can cover all of Taiwan’s military tarmac and HASs, destroying all Taiwanese aircraft not in underground shelters. The surviving aircraft would contribute only marginally to the air battle over the island before being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the “porcupine strategy” was demonstrated by the project’s modeling and wargames. Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons. The project’s findings are consistent with many other studies of Taiwan and reflect the current debate within Taiwan. These asymmetric capabilities (e.g., coastal defense cruise missiles, mobile SAMs, and mines) could also play a role in counter-blockade strategies if China pursued such a strategy with strikes on Taiwan itself. The Taiwanese navy’s budget would better contribute with coastal defense cruise missiles, missile boats, and mining rather than large surface combatants. Taiwanese ground-based ASCMs can survive a Chinese air and missile strike because of their mobility and were highly effective against Chinese surface ships. Mobile SAMs were more effective for air defense than fighters because of their greater survivability. They are also less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly important is the fulfillment of a current deal to supply Taiwan with ground-launched Harpoon missiles. In the game, the 400 missiles already programmed (but not yet delivered) had a large effect on weakening the initial Chinese invasion. Two hundred additional missiles would have as much impact on the naval battle as an MLR or MDTF but without the political risks of basing and the operational challenges of transportation and resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese progress toward such an asymmetric strategy has been halting. The United States has consistently urged the government of Taiwan to move away from boutique, vulnerable systems. Progress toward a “porcupine strategy” seemed to be made with a 2017 strategy by the then-chief of the Taiwanese military forces, Lee Hsi-Min. However, subsequent military chiefs have vacillated. Determining the correct combination of carrots and sticks to change Taiwanese attitudes is imperative for building an effective deterrent on today’s threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture-1&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Posture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next are recommendations for how the U.S. military plans to operate (doctrine) and how it positions its forces in the theater (posture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fortify and expand air base capacity in Japan and Guam.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan lose hundreds of aircraft in every iteration, from an average of 290 in optimistic cases to 646 in pessimistic cases. For the U.S. Air Force, this represents 12 to 32 percent of its operational fighter/attack strength after three to four weeks of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese losses (over 900) from one game iteration (#13), a pessimistic and intense encounter that ended in stalemate. The losses represent about 40 percent of the Air Force’s fighter/attack operational inventory. This would degrade U.S. power for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CEtysLe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese Losses from Game Iteration #13.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for aircraft is that they are vulnerable if based close to Taiwan but less useful if based farther away. The United States must aggressively attack the Chinese amphibious ships to prevent the Chinese from establishing a foothold in Taiwan. However, this means moving many aircraft forward before the Chinese missile threat diminishes. As bases closer to Taiwan can be struck by more Chinese missiles, moving U.S. aircraft closer to Taiwan increases aircrafts’ vulnerability to being destroyed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andersen Air Force Base on Guam cannot substitute for bases in Japan. The distance from Guam to Taiwan (roughly 2,800 km) makes it impossi-ble to generate many sorties from Andersen Air Force Base. Despite the high casualties suffered by air-craft based in Japan, most U.S. players preferred Japanese basing to Guam. However, in those iterations where Japan was strictly neutral, Andersen Air Force Base became the principal U.S. base. This gave the Chinese powerful reasons to attack it repeatedly. Aircraft on Andersen Air Force Base are particularly vulnerable because, as of 2022, the base has no HASs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no viable substitute for using air bases in Japan, the United States needs to work with Tokyo to harden Japanese bases with shelters and expand their tarmacs for dispersing aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete (hardening) lacks influential constituencies within military bureaucracies, but the large benefit justifies a strong effort. Although HASs do not provide complete protection, they require China to expend more missiles to destroy each aircraft. If every aircraft were in a shelter, China would be unable to use missiles with submunitions that destroy several aircraft each. In conjunction with deception and active defenses, the United States could shift the cost-exchange ratio of Chinese attacks on U.S. aircraft in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PS2JoOL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: U.S. Bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While active defenses are helpful, they cannot be thought of as the primary means of mitigating Chinese missile attacks. On the one hand, local commanders want active defenses because they offer a tangible counter against adversary aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Investing in passive defenses such as hardening and dispersion that simply mitigate the effects of enemy attacks represents a tacit acceptance of losses. On the other hand, China’s inventory of missiles means that even if active defenses are highly effective (as assumed in the project’s modeling), then the sheer volume of fire will overwhelm U.S. active defenses. Active defense therefore must be used with a robust system of passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides hardening, the United States and Japan should also work to secure access to civilian international airports. The base case assumed that the Air Force used one civilian regional airfield per military airfield. This could be augmented with access to a broader set of civilian airfields, particularly large international ones. As Chinese missile attacks constitute an area attack problem, increasing the area those missiles must cover is an effective countermeasure. Although local political opposition may obstruct peacetime and possibly wartime access to Japanese civilian airports, the significant payoff justifies a strong effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restructure U.S. Air Force doctrine and procurement to address vulnerability on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with large losses on the ground, U.S. players often dispersed aircraft to regional civilian airfields in Japan. By spreading aircraft out and thus diluting the effect of any single Chinese missile attack, dispersion effectively reduced losses. Dispersion is a major element in contemporary discussions about operational concepts in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unprepared civilian airfields have drawbacks; there will always be a need for well-equipped military airfields. First, there is a logistical cost for dispersing and time lost in making the move top civilian airfields. Second, the United States needs basing for hundreds of aircraft, which is far beyond what regional airfields can handle. Third, as activities on a dispersion airfield expand, the airfield becomes functionally like a main operating base but without the hardened infrastructure, specialized logistics, and air defenses. Large, well-equipped — and fully hardened — bases remain indispensable for sortie generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force doctrine is beginning to address this trade-off between preparation and dispersion through the agile combat employment (ACE) concept. ACE allows operations from a network of smaller, dispersed locations through a hub-and-spokes model that can complicate adversary planning while maintaining high sortie generation. These dispersed locations would be “defensible, sustainable, and relocatable.” This doctrinal adjustment will reduce the drawbacks of using civilian airfields. The Air Force is practicing the skills needed for ACE in a variety of exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these efforts do not go far enough. Rather than attempting to tack dispersion onto a predetermined force structure and doctrine, the Air Force needs to engineer survivability into its structure from the ground up. Sweden’s Flygbassystem 60/90 provides an example of hardening and dispersion to protect forces on the ground. Having observed the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground during World War II and the increasing power of nuclear weapons, the Swedish air force adopted Flygbassystem 60, a system of concrete command bunkers, mobile maintenance teams, and multiple dispersed runways designed to improve aircraft survivability in a potential war against the Soviet Union. This system was updated to Flygbassystem 90 after witnessing the effectiveness of air base attacks and runway cratering munitions in the Arab-Israeli wars. ACE is a sound first step, but it must be expanded into a more holistic doctrine such as with the Flygbassystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the Air Force was never able to begin operations within Chinese airspace by the end of game play (typically after three to four weeks of conflict). Instead, U.S. Air Force had to focus on the ground, air, and sea battles on and immediately around Taiwan and had little leeway to employ airpower over the mainland. Attrition was high enough without contending with China’s integrated air defense system (IADS) on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes against military and civilian infrastructure on the mainland were counterproductive distractions. They require a massive and sustained air campaign that takes a long time to have operational effects and diverted attention from immediate battlefield needs. Bombers equipped with standoff munitions were effective against the mainland but employed solely against ports and airfields because these targets directly affected the situation on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players were reluctant to risk B-2 bombers, the only long-range assets possibly capable of penetrating Chinese airspace, because of their limited numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor will this problem become better in the 2030s. When the B-21 bomber becomes widely available and the B-2 is retired in the 2030s, China’s IADS will have also progressed. Nevertheless, the B-21 program remains important, as it might be the only bomber capable of launching medium-range munitions (e.g., the JSOW) and surviving in the expanding Chinese air defense bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland. This does not mean that stealth is unimportant: it is still necessary to destroy targets away from the coast that are protected by long-range air defenses. However, any program that envisions overflight of the Chinese mainland is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps is building Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs) to operate inside the Chinese defensive zone (which the Marine Corps calls the “weapons engagement zone”) and contest Chinese air and naval assets. The Army envisions its Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) as having a similar function. Although these units could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game assumed that by 2026, the Marine Corps had an MLR on Okinawa and another on Hawaii. The MLR on Okinawa was able to exert local influence, destroying two Chinese ships in one iteration (#19). However, its Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs) have a range of only 100 nautical miles, and Chinese fleets rarely came that close Okinawa, being focused on the waters around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although these units [MLRs and MDTFs] could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several games, the U.S. player tried to move an MLR onto Taiwan by air or sea, but in all cases the unit and transportation assets were destroyed while trying to transit the extensive Chinese defensive zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, political assumptions prevented any U.S. forces from being pre-positioned on Taiwanese or Philippine territory before the conflict begins. (See Chapter 4 for a description of the base case assumptions and above for a recommendation on verifying war plan assumptions.) However, one scenario assumed that that the United States was willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces onto Taiwan, whether because Chinese mobilization generated sufficient concern, or the U.S.-China relationship had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, before hostilities began, an MLR deployed from Okinawa with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese Harpoons. The NSM’s 100-nautical-mile range could easily enable attacks on Chinese amphibious ships from Taiwan. Assuming that the MLR deployed with a load of 72 NSMs on 18 launchers, modeling showed that the MLRs would sink an average of five major Chinese amphibious ships. Because of the MLR’s ability to conduct distributed operations, it was assumed to be survivable in the face of Chinese counteraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, resupply proved impossible. A resupply mission of C-17s escorted by fighters attempted to break through the Chinese CAP but was shot down. After that, no further attempts were made at resupply. The MLR became a ground infantry battalion, augmenting the 114 combat battalions of the Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground units will not provide a significant volume of fire. A squadron of bombers armed with long-range cruise missiles has a greater volume of fire than an entire MLR but without the challenges of transportation and logistics. Ground-based anti-ship units must either deploy with a large number of missiles before the conflict begins or act as forward sensors for long-range air and naval power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar stories emerged from MLR deployments to the western Ryukyus and Philippines. In one scenario, the MLR was prepositioned in the western Ryukyus. In that location, it could attack Chinese naval forces that moved north of Taiwan, but resupply was deemed too risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, an MLR moved onto the Philippine islands north of Luzon. There, it could attack Chinese forces that moved south of Taiwan, but again resupply was impossible, limiting its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All game iterations had an MLR and Army MDTF on Hawaii available for deployment by airlift, but no U.S. player called them forward. Instead, the U.S. player gave priority to Patriot battalions, which could add to the air defense of threatened airfields. These were needed because of repeated Chinese air and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the project team recommends continuing to develop land-based forces to counter Chinese air and naval capabilities but also the need to recognize their employment challenges. While these new formations were more useful than traditional ground forces, multiplying these specialized units has limited value because only the first few can be deployed successfully. Others will sit unused. The maximum number is probably two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of long-range ground-launched missiles might overcome this limitation. If ground-launched Tomahawks have a similar range to their Vertical Launch System (VLS) counterparts, they could be employed from peacetime bases on Okinawa without moving in the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. warfighting doctrine includes a pre-hostility phase designed to strengthen deterrence and enhance U.S. warfighting capabilities should conflict occur. As a result, the United States routinely makes forward deployments in crises. Therefore, in a major confrontation with China, the United States might load up Japan and Guam with aircraft and move CSGs into the region to signal U.S. resolve. Unfortunately, as Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.” In early 1941, the United States transferred the home base of the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to deter Japanese aggression and station the fleet closer to the potential fight. However, this move put the fleet within range of Japanese striking forces, with results as tragic as they are well known. Similarly, U.S. deployments during a confrontation with China might tempt China to attack preemptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the United States might be able to keep air and naval forces forward for deterrence but pull them back or disperse them to less vulnerable sites when deterrence was on the verge of failing. However, this cannot be relied on in practice. First, partners and allies will push hard to keep forces forward as long as possible. They would regard withdrawal as a sign of abandonment, not prudence. Further, it requires precise knowledge about when China intends to strike; however, China decides D-Day. The United States had such knowledge before the war in Ukraine, but warning may not always be as clear. Furthermore, China could plan on one D-Day, then reset it if the U.S. withdraws forward-deployed forces. Finally, it would take several days for all the vulnerable forces to get out of range, so withdrawal must begin with enough lead time before hostilities start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to develop mechanisms to enhance deterrence that do not also create a tempting target. As commentators have noted, the withdrawal of U.S. squadrons from Kadena probably enhances deterrence by reducing the temptation to strike a vulnerable target. Deploying defensive systems within the Chinese defensive zone would increase capabilities without increasing vulnerability. Deploying offensive systems to locations outside Chinese missile ranges, such as sending bombers to Hawaii or Australia, would indicate resolve without increasing vulnerability. Assuming enough warning to withdraw vulnerable assets prior to conflict breaking out is highly risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms-1&quot;&gt;Weapons and Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analysis of the game results generated recommendations about the procurement of specific weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with aircraft, the United States lost many surface ships in almost every iteration because of forward deployment within the Chinese defensive zone. U.S. losses of large surface ships typically totaled two carriers and 15 to 25 cruisers/destroyers. Although this represented only about 15 to 25 percent of total U.S. Navy surface combatants, losses typically included nearly all large surface ships in the Western Pacific. In the most intense iterations, the U.S. Navy was losing a major ship every day of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan. Amphibious ships were particularly vulnerable because of their lack of defensive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some iterations, surface ships could approach Taiwan in week three or four when the Chinese anti-ship missile inventory had declined. Even then, the ALCMs of the PLAAF and PLANAF, the torpedoes and cruise missiles of PLAN submarines, and the ship-based anti-ship missiles of the PLAN meant that the survivability of U.S. surface ships was low. U.S. ships were rarely able to get within Harpoon or SM-6 range of Chinese ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after Chinese ASBMs (Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles) had been expended, the utility of U.S. surface ships had limits. Although the range of the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) allowed U.S. surface ships to attack Chinese ships from a distance, every MST in a ship’s inventory meant one fewer interceptor or anti-submarine missile that the ship had for defense. A ship with enough MSTs to destroy multiple Chinese warships was a glass cannon, very vulnerable in turn to Chinese attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there will be too many incoming missiles for active defense to adequately protect airfields, there will be too many anti-ship missiles for active defense to adequately protect surface ships. Therefore, active defense with interceptors must be paired with soft kill measures (e.g., reduced radar cross-section and electronic warfare) that complicate enemy targeting. To this end, the budget of the Surface Warfare Division of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force, which tests ship defenses, should be increased. Even with improved electronic warfare, many ships will be lost in a conflict with China because electronic warfare advantages are transitory. Procurement decisions must therefore consider the vulnerability of surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all points to benefits in shifting toward a fleet of smaller, stealthier ships integrated with unmanned decoys. Such ships would be better disposed to the soft kill of incoming missiles. In addition, it will not be as devastating to lose smaller, cheaper, less-capable ships. The Navy should also have expendable or unmanned ships accompany CSGs to act as decoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because a ship is sunk does not mean that its problems are over. Hundreds or even thousands of U.S. sailors would be thrown into the water each time a ship sinks. Currently, the U.S. Navy has no way of rescuing these sailors except by diverting a warship, with all the associated risks and opportunity costs. Game participants with a naval background recalled the experience of the USS Juneau in World War II. The ship was torpedoed and sunk on November 13, 1942, leaving 100 sailors in the water. However, the local commander judged it too risky to stop and look for survivors. Only 10 survivors were left when finally picked up eight days later. World War II convoys routinely included a rescue ship to pick up survivors so that warships did not have to be diverted. In addition to their humanitarian function, rescuing 4,200 shipwrecked crew during the war, rescue ships boosted morale by reassuring sailors about their chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9yVUCZ8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, many mission kills would not result in the ship being sunk but rather incapacitated. Without appropriate assets to tow disabled ships to port, they would have to be scuttled, depriving the Navy of an irreplaceable asset. For example, in World War II, all five U.S. fleet carriers lost in action were scuttled to keep them from falling into enemy hands after receiving severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships. Some version of the existing oceangoing tugs (Navy classification: “ATS”) might be suitable. Although this is a lower-priority requirement in peacetime, the wartime need is clear. The nation would be unforgiving if the Navy left sailors to drown because it was too risky to save them. Unlike in 1943, ubiquitous social media would prevent suppression of information about the event. Further, the tugs might save some damaged ships that would otherwise be lost. The Navy will need every ship it has because of the long time required for new construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-navy-needs-to-develop-rescue-ships-that-can-accompany-csgs-and-sags-such-ships-could-both-rescue-shipwrecked-sailors-and-tow-disabled-ships&quot;&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy might also consider acquiring an amphibious patrol aircraft that could help rescue sailors from sunken ships and aircrew from downed aircraft. In a situation where the United States and Japan lose dozens of aircrew a week, each of whom requires millions of dollars and many years to train, such rescues make military sense aside from the humanitarian imperative. The picture shows the Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2, an amphibious aircraft designed for maritime rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the U.S. player moved submarines into the Taiwan Strait, where they could attack Chinese amphibious ships directly. Indeed, in the base case, one U.S. submarine squadron begins in the strait because that likely constitutes current deployment practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the straits, U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping. Based on the agent-based modeling found in RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard and historical evidence from World War II, each submarine would sink two large amphibious vessels (and an equal number of decoys and escorts) over the course of a 3.5-day turn. Every submarine squadron (four submarines) in the strait sank eight Chinese amphibious ships and eight escorts or decoys, but at a price of roughly 20 percent attrition per 3.5 days. U.S. submarines operated on a “conveyor belt,” whereby they hunted, moved back to port (Guam, Yokosuka, or Wake Island), reloaded, then moved forward again and hunted. Doing this cycle as quickly as possible was important because the number of submarine squadrons was limited during the early phases of the conflict and their contribution was so significant. Submarines were also needed to screen against Chinese submarines exiting the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the value of submarines, acquiring more is an obvious recommendation. Most analyses of future naval force structure agree that the United States should build more attack submarines than are currently programmed. However, it is unlikely that the United States could build more than the current rate of two a year during the 2020s and early 2030s when it is also building the Columbia-class SSBN. Indeed, even achieving two per year may be a stretch. However, the U.S. Navy should commit to funding those two per year even if shipbuilding funds get tight. The Navy should also consider keeping submarines in service longer, as it has proposed by extending the service life of some 688-class boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy should also ensure that it has reloading facilities in Yokosuka, Guam, and Wake Island. Forcing submarines to go back to Pearl Harbor to reload wastes valuable hunting time. Because China will likely target fixed facilities, mobile reloading from civilian ports should be practiced. The Navy also needs to ensure that it has enough torpedoes. Although the game did not model this munition, there is reason for concern. The historical record is that many torpedoes will miss or malfunction, some will be lost when the submarine carrying them is sunk, and others will be destroyed when shore facilities are attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, investment in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) should be prioritized. There is guaranteed to be some submarine attrition in a fight against China, particularly in the constrained waters of the Taiwan Strait. Each loss would be a painful blow. A Virginia-class submarine has a crew of 135 and costs roughly $3 billion. While UUVs are not as capable as attack submarines, they could be programmed to fulfill some relatively straightforward missions (e.g., minelaying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure sufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munitions usage was high. In the three to four weeks of conflict, U.S. forces usually expended about 5,000 long-range precision missiles, primarily JASSMs and LRASMs. The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios. JASSM inventories were large enough that they did not run low until the third or fourth week of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In games where the JASSM-ER has maritime strike capabilities, the abundance of U.S. munitions made U.S. strategy an almost uncomplicated exercise. With each squadron of 12 bombers carrying around 200 stealthy, standoff ASCMs, the United States could rapidly cripple the Chinese fleet and leave the invasion force stranded. For this reason, many studies that look at this problem recommend expanding the arsenal of anti-ship weapons. However, as discussed in the assumptions chapter, the JASSM-ER might not have this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JASSM-ERs were still somewhat useful in excursion scenarios where they could not strike ships at sea. In this case, JASSM-ERs could strike Chinese ports and airfields. However, these attacks against the homeland of a nuclear power raised questions about escalation. Attacks against ships at sea do not raise that concern to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, without a deep magazine of standoff anti-ship weapons, the Air Force had to use shorter-range JSMs and JSOWs to attack Chinese ships once the LRASMs were gone. The limited range of JSMs and JSOWs meant that aircraft had to get within range of Chinese SAMs and CAP for strikes, which resulted in higher attrition and aborted missions. With a deeper magazine of LRASMs instead of JASSM-ERs, this problem would not have arisen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile inventories reflect service priorities. The Air Force prefers to strike land targets as part of an air superiority campaign, while naval targets have lower priority. Thus, in 2026, the available Air Force inventory of JASSM (all variants) will number about 6,500, while its LRASM inventory will be only about 100. Although the Navy has more LRASMs, it does not have the ability to launch them en masse in the way that only Air Force bombers can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force needs to embrace and implement the anti-ship mission. The need to attack Chinese amphibious forces makes this mission critical. Maritime strike has a long history with the Air Force, dating from its earliest days, with the sinking of the Ostfreisland in 1921 and the interception of the Rex in 1938. General George C. Kenney’s World War II operations in the Southwest Pacific also constitute a pertinent precedent, as his 5th Air Force supported ground and naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to implement such an effort would be to shift JASSM production to the LRASM. The missiles are built on the same production line and are 70 percent common. The LRASM can strike the greatest threat, the Chinese amphibious fleet, with less risk of escalation. Yet the JASSM inventory is far larger than that of LRASMs, and production plans in FY 2023 continue that imbalance, consisting of 581 JASSMs and 88 LRASMs. This is backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powered naval mines are another option that might be highly effective. Mines have the advantage of obviating the requirement for precise targeting of the Chinese fleet; once the Chinese select an invasion beach, any mine dropped there will eventually hit a ship. While current extended-range mines require aircraft to get within 40 km of the target, a powered version of these mines could reach farther and reduce attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerating CLEAVER, a program to put palletized missiles into the cargo bay of a C-17 or C-130 cargo aircraft, would expand the number of launch platforms. This may sound unnecessary, as the United States has bombers that are specifically designed to deliver such payloads. However, there are not enough bombers to sustain attrition and launch all the strikes that are needed. Being able to include some of the 225 C-17s in these long-range strikes would add flexibility to mission planning and hedge against unexpectedly high losses to the bomber force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project tracked a few key munitions and assumed that the United States had sufficient stockpiles of the rest. This may not be true. The DOD should review the inventories of all relevant munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are a niche capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons, defined as missiles able to travel more than five times the speed of sound, have received considerable attention in recent years. Their high speed makes defense difficult and allows them to strike fleeting targets. The base case includes Chinese DF-17s with hypersonic maneuverable re-entry vehicles. It is logical for China to pursue hypersonic technologies to defeat the well-developed U.S. missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2026, the United States will have few equivalent hypersonic systems. The game included 50 U.S. hypersonic weapons (the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW), although this was speculative. In 2022, no U.S. hypersonic weapons are yet programs of record although several systems are emerging from development. Most U.S. hypersonic programs would likely be in testing or initial fielding in 2026 and thus not available in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons would be useful for attacking highly defended and deep targets such as China’s over-the-horizon-backscatter radars or satellite uplink stations. Modeling indicated that Chinese defenses could typical shoot down about 25 percent of U.S. land-attack cruise missiles targeting the mainland. This blunted the effect of U.S. attacks. Hypersonic weapons would not suffer this attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, hypersonic weapons are expensive and no substitute for large numbers of long-range cruise missiles. Picking off a few high-value targets does not solve the central problem of countering a massed invasion. That requires sinking enough amphibious ships such that Chinese forces cannot sustain a lodgment on Taiwan. The strategist Hal Brands made this point in an assessment of contemporary arms races, “The United States doesn’t need to emulate every Chinese breakthrough in hypersonic weapons. These weapons can’t provide, at a reasonable cost, the volume of fire power Washington would need in the Western Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both bombers and fighter/attack aircraft played important roles. However, the range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces. When paired with standoff munitions, even unstealthy “bomb trucks” are extremely useful against targets at the edge of the Chinese air defense zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of platforms with long-range precision munitions is viable because this air campaign focuses on a few hundred aiming points comprising ships, air bases, and ports and airfields. It is not a strategic bombing campaign involving tens of thousands of aim points on the Chinese mainland and designed to paralyze the economy, military command structure, and political operations. Long-range precision missiles are too expensive to be procured in the numbers necessary to prosecute such a campaign, as the Russians are finding out in Ukraine. Further, as noted earlier, such a campaign raises questions about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of bombers leads to several recommendations for Air Force acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop retiring bombers. The Air Force has been retiring legacy bombers in expectation of fielding the B-21 and as part of its “divest to invest” strategy. This creates a gap in capability because the B-21s will not be available in large numbers until the 2030s. If the United States believes there is a significant chance of conflict with China in the 2020s, then the size of the bomber force should be maintained. Thus, the Air Force might retain its B-1 and B-52 fleets even as the B-21 enters the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-engine the B-52 fleet. The program, called the Commercial Engine Replacement Program, is already in Air Force plans. The Air Force will need as many bombers as it can get even when the B-21 has been fielded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that all bombers can carry the full range of munitions. For example, the LRASM is currently certified only for the B-1 bomber and the F/A-18E/F. Given the LRASM’s centrality in destroying Chinese surface forces, it needs to be employable from all aircraft for maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the implications for aircraft type and mix if most are lost on the ground. Fifth-generation aircraft were just as vulnerable on the ground as 4.5-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think ahead to the next stage of bomber vulnerability. China likely also appreciates the significance of the threat that the U.S. bomber force poses. China might develop longer-range SAMs or deploy long-range air-to-air missiles on fighters that would fly deep into the Philippine Sea. The United States must develop countermeasures in the same way it thinks about disrupting the anti-ship-missile kill chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden bomber bases in Australia, Hawaii, and Alaska. In this game (set in 2026), China had few options for striking these critical bases. Chinese submarines might theoretically operate that far from port but were generally fully engaged in the Western Pacific. However, future Chinese missiles might have the range to destroy aircraft based there. The DOD should examine the defenses of Alaska and Hawaii since they will increasingly be within the scope of Chinese strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure more, cheaper fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of aircraft and becoming irrelevant to the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses. Therefore, the Air Force should be cautious about taking its “divest to invest” strategy too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers matter. Throughout the campaign, even fourth-generation fighter/attack aircraft had value. For many missions (such as launching standoff weapons), the stealth of fifth-generation aircraft is not needed. This was particularly true later in the conflict when Chinese air defenses weakened. At the same time, losing all fifth-generation aircraft early was a problem. After the long-range LRASMs were gone, fifth-generation aircraft were particularly valuable because they could press in to deliver shorter-range JSMs or JSOWs. There is therefore a strong argument for keeping a balanced mix throughout by withholding fifth-generation aircraft until the Chinese missile inventory is depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of aircraft on the ground raises questions about U.S. plans to procure relatively small numbers of extremely capable but expensive aircraft. If most are lost on the ground before they can bring their advanced capabilities to bear, then cheaper airframes might be worthwhile. Plans to procure the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, with a cost per airframe of “‘multiple’ hundreds of millions” of dollars, do not make sense if 90 percent of U.S. and Japanese aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion--victory-is-not-everything&quot;&gt;Conclusion — Victory Is Not Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game results showed that the United States and Taiwan could successfully defend the island even under relatively pessimistic assumptions. This is different from many observers’ impressions and constitutes an important insight. The analysis also indicates that there is no need for the United States to consider highly risky strategies such as preemptive attacks on Chinese amphibious shipping or the early use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would take enormous risks in launching such an operation. Chapter 5 describes the heavy losses to Chinese air and naval forces that even a successful invasion would entail. These losses would take many years to replace. Invasion forces on Taiwan would risk destruction if, as happened in many iterations, the Chinese were unable to sustain these forces in the face of heavy maritime losses. This failure would produce tens of thousands of prisoners of war, a highly visible and emotional symbol of defeat. Although the project did not explore what effects these losses might have on the Chinese political system, the CCP would be risking its hold on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no cause for complacency by the United States or Taiwan. First, China could choose other coercive paths, whether it be the seizure of offshore Taiwanese islands, a bombardment without ensuing invasion, or a blockade. These contingencies also warrant consideration. Second, the morale of Taiwan’s military and leadership must be strong enough to resist a Chinese attack in the face of high losses. Without the will to resist, the rest is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the human, economic, military, and political costs loom over even a successful defense. These would be enormous. The discussion below lays out a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s Economy Debilitated:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces, even if defeated, would inflict massive damage on Taiwanese infrastructure and cripple its economy for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the game included cyber affects at the operational level, it did not examine economic and social impacts. Both Taiwan and the United States might suffer damage to civilian and economic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Military Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States would suffer tremendous damage to its military forces. Rebuilding these capabilities would take many years and would occur at a slower rate than China’s rebuild, given the rapid pace of Chinese military modernization. With only two U.S. shipyards currently building large surface combatants, it would take decades to replace the dozen or more such ships lost while continuing the Navy’s build program. Lost carriers could not be replaced because the current shipyard capacity is sufficient only to maintain the current carrier force. Aircraft would be a bit easier to replace. For example, the United States lost an average of 200 to 500 aircraft across the scenarios. At current procurement rates of about 120 such aircraft per year, it would take two to four years to replace those aircraft, assuming no further attrition and no retirement of aging aircraft in the force. Ships and aircraft would take longer to replace if the war went beyond the three or four weeks of game play or if losses from engagements in the South China Sea were calculated and included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Global Position:&lt;/strong&gt; The world would not be standing still during and after a U.S.-China conflict. Other countries — for example, Russia, North Korea, or Iran — might take advantage of U.S. distraction to pursue their agendas. After the war, a weakened U.S. military might not be able to sustain the balance of power in Europe or the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Escalation:&lt;/strong&gt; Although this project focused on conventional conflict, many analyses of an invasion have nuclear play. The recent novel 2034 concludes with nuclear strikes. The CNAS wargame, Dangerous Straits, similarly ends with the use of nuclear weapons. No one knows what those escalation dynamics would be. They depend on an unprecedented event, conventional war between nuclear powers, as well as the opaque decisionmaking process of the CCP. The recommendations above to focus on anti-ship attacks instead of mainland strikes could reduce the risk of escalation, but that risk will never go away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protracted or Episodic Conflict:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, the war might not end after this initial phase but drag on for months or even years. Conflict might be episodic, with periodic ceasefires. This project is called The First Battle of the Next War for a reason. Opening battles, even if seemingly decisive, generally do not end a conflict. Cathal Nolan makes this argument in his monumental study, The Allure of Battle. After looking at the long history of wars, he concludes, “How to win decisively in war is the aspiration of all professional military, and a main subject of concern to those who study war. Yet it is the single hardest thing to do, to translate combat into achievement of an important strategic and political goal that the other side is forced to recognize and accept when the war is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These losses might cause strategic disillusionment. The United States would sustain as many personnel casualties in a month of such conflict as in 20 years of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The scale and suddenness of such losses would shock a U.S. population unaccustomed to significant military losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect might be like the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, where the combination of surprise, betrayal, and loss solidified public opinion and created a determination to press the conflict to its conclusion. On the other hand, the effect might be like the 1983 bombing of the U.S. barracks in Beirut, where the U.S. population and political establishment decided that the cost was not worth the foreign policy benefit. The result was withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge. U.S. policymakers and Americans might question whether the sacrifice had been worth preserving Taiwanese independence and democracy. That kind of disillusionment occurred after World War I. Even though the United States was successful, with relatively low casualties (at least compared to the other combatants), there was profound disillusionment after the war. Many argued that “merchants of death” had manipulated the United States into the war. This produced a turn toward isolationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the United States should defend Taiwan. That requires a political and foreign policy assessment of benefits, costs, and values that goes beyond the scope of the current effort. The project does rigorously document the likely outcomes of defending Taiwan in a variety of scenarios and how different assumptions about conditions and capabilities affect those outcomes. The intention is that this analysis will help the public and policy discussion about how the United States should move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the project recognizes that a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, a bipartisan consensus in Congress, and a near uniformity of views among strategists identify China as the “pacing” U.S. competitor. U.S. policy needs to be broadly aimed at succeeding in this competition. In the military sphere, it is imperative to deter China from starting any conflict. To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing that capability will have additional costs but does not require across-the-board increases in U.S. defense spending. The recommendations in the previous chapter target specific capabilities that would be most useful for conflict in the Western Pacific. To offset these investments, less effective capabilities might be cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line from the analysis is that a successful defense is possible, and deterrence is achievable, but it will require planning, some resources, and political will.&lt;/p&gt;

The heavy toll of the conflict on civilians – 23.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and around 4.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) – makes a renewal and expansion of the truce in Yemen a priority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To this end, on 23 November 2022 RUSI hosted an expert-led discussion bringing together analysts, practitioners and humanitarian workers on Yemen. The event included a session held off-record with about 20 participants, and a session which was streamed online on RUSI’s website. Both sessions explored how the end of the truce in Yemen impacted the humanitarian situation on the ground and what the prospects for stability and security in the country are moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report summarises the major conclusions and talking points of both events, focusing on the insights that emerged about the humanitarian situation on the ground, the challenges linked to renewing and expanding the truce agreement, and what role international actors, the UK in particular, should play to address both issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-humanitarian-situation-on-the-ground&quot;&gt;The Humanitarian Situation on the Ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most participants argued that the six-month UN-brokered truce in Yemen led to an improvement of the situation on the ground. As a result, there were no cross-border attacks, no attacks from the Houthis against Saudi Arabia and no attack from Saudi Arabia against Houthi-controlled areas. Violence within Yemen continued, especially on the frontlines, but the overall decrease in hostilities meant there was a significant drop in civilian, including child, casualties. Furthermore, the movement of people, feelings of safety and security, and humanitarian conditions generally improved, including for children. One practitioner explained that during the truce, the internationally recognised government of Yemen could focus on the delivery of services and, even with the challenges it continued to face in terms of limited funding, improvements to overall quality of life could be seen. Furthermore, the re-opening of Sana’a airport facilitated the movement of people and improved the population’s access to healthcare and business opportunities. The increased flow of fuel through the Hodeidah port also positively affected the livelihoods of most Yemenis as, during the truce, three times the total amount of fuel was available, easing shortages at the pump and reducing the cost of transport, food and other commodity prices. The practitioner added that, without the truce, the impact of the war in Ukraine in terms of food security and increase in prices would have been much worse than it has been for Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the truce was mostly perceived as having a positive impact on the humanitarian situation across the country, a couple of humanitarian workers presented views from displaced persons that showed that not everyone saw the dividends. Many IDPs in certain areas of the country felt there was no impact on their lives as access to work, basic goods and services, and aid remained difficult, nor did their perception of safety or security increase as a result. The spikes of insecurity in the south also limited the delivery of humanitarian assistance in these areas despite the truce. One humanitarian worker explained how the continued presence of explosive weapons remains a significant threat to civilians but also a challenge in terms of restricting the freedom of movement in Yemen, including during the truce, given that roads stayed closed due to the risk of landmines and IEDs. Children continue to be disproportionately impacted by landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Another humanitarian worker highlighted how women continued to lack mobility as a result of the mahram (male guardian) requirement, arguing that this is an example of how the Houthis are trying to impose their culture and views across the country, with a negative impact on the population as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most argued that there is still a de facto truce despite the failure to secure its renewal back in October, this is fragile, with the potential for full conflict to erupt once again and the situation on the ground being difficult in both security and humanitarian terms, with severe implications for civilians. An analyst discussed how the recent attacks conducted by the Houthis, following the collapse of the truce, targeting critical infrastructure in the south, including the Al-Mukalla port, challenged the government’s ability to export oil and affected the stability of the currency, undermining the ability of the population to afford basic goods. A humanitarian worker argued that divisions within the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) not only create fewer opportunities for a compromise between the parties, but also pose a risk in terms of a return to confrontation. The PLC could see a return to war as the only way to find unity in the face of the same enemy (the Houthis) while also attempting to increase its leverage on the future of the country, particularly with regards to the Saudis. Another analyst explained how, in November, Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula has managed to increase its activity in the south of the country, showcasing another potential area of escalation and conflict in the absence of a renewal of the truce or an extended deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-linked-to-renewing-and-expanding-the-truce&quot;&gt;Challenges Linked to Renewing and Expanding the Truce&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants argued that the truce was agreed in the first place because it was in all parties’ interests, with one analyst explaining that there was not even the need for a monitoring mechanism given how much all sides were keen to maintain it. The difference now is that one side (the Houthis) feels that it is in a stronger position and believes it is winning the war, with the war economy benefiting it significantly. Until the benefits of peace outweigh those of war, there will be no incentive for the Houthis to end the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the main reason why the outcome of the talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia appears to be still uncertain for most participants. Much of the focus in these talks is currently on revenue sharing compared with power sharing, which used to be the main point of contention between the two sides. One analyst explained that, despite perceiving themselves as the winning side, the Houthis have not managed to gain the control over the resources they aimed for and are thus willing to entertain the idea of a truce if they can get enough control over resources in return. In particular, the Houthis are demanding that the salaries of civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas, including their fighters, are paid through the revenues of crude oil in the areas of the PLC; they also asked for a share of these revenues as a condition for the renewal of the truce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants, particularly practitioners and analysts, argued that the shift in focus on to issues of wealth and resource sharing demonstrates the seriousness to reach an agreement by all sides, including the Houthis, who appear ready to consider an option that does not involve fighting, albeit with significant demands in return. It was also described as promising in terms of having the potential to unlock a broader political process – something that other tracks seem less capable of achieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants, particularly from a humanitarian background, criticised the ongoing talks between the Houthis and the Saudis, arguing that even if they manage to reach a deal, this is unlikely to translate into something tangible and positive for the Yemeni population at large. The main reason is that only the Houthis are involved in the talks, with all other Yemeni actors being excluded despite having been affected by the conflict. One former practitioner also argued that there is little leverage or influence international actors can have on the Houthis. Even Iran, while being a key supporter of the Houthis and favouring specific outcomes, is sometimes sidelined as the group decides and acts based on its own calculations and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Houthi-Saudi track is not connected to the UN track was presented as a further reason for scepticism among some participants, who doubted that even a potential deal could lead to a broader, more sustainable and more inclusive political settlement. One humanitarian worker also warned against the approach of the international community, which has so far failed to promote a Yemen-centric process in talks, looking instead at the conflict from the lenses of neighbouring countries, in particular the ones who belong to the Gulf Cooperation Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-role-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;What Role for the UK?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the participants argued that international actors could and should play a more active role in improving the humanitarian situation on the ground, as well as facilitating a political settlement in Yemen. The UK was highlighted by most participants as a key actor, given its membership of the Quad (together with the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE), its role as UN Security Council penholder on Yemen, its membership of the Human Rights Council and its strong relations with Oman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the humanitarian front, participants argued that the UK could help in ensuring the response is adequate to the needs of the population by collecting and mapping all efforts currently taking place and identifying potential gaps. While in 2021 the UK announced a significant reduction to its aid budget, several participants argued the UK is likely to continue its commitment to Yemen, including through its funding for humanitarian issues, although the impact of cuts are being felt according to humanitarian experts. Nevertheless, the UK, for instance, has a food security programme run by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is aimed at aiding those identified as most in need in Yemen (including women and marginalised groups). It is also supporting a project which aims to create a more enabling environment for women’s meaningful political participation and inclusion in Yemen. Furthermore, it is continuing to fund a programme in Yemen to clear the ground of landmines and explosive remnants of war, hoping this will reduce the threat posed to civilians. Despite the limited humanitarian funding available, practitioners argued money will continue to be allocated to these projects and priorities – although, according to those with humanitarian expertise, not at the same levels across all areas as in the past, leading to shortfalls in the overall aid response. Some participants with a humanitarian background argued that more should be done by the UK in terms of protection of civilians in Yemen, especially given its membership of the UN Human Rights Council, including by ensuring the UK does not provide UK-built and licensed arms to any of the parties to the conflict, as this would further fuel confrontation and jeopardise the prospects for a political settlement. Humanitarian experts also argued that the UK has a key role to play in supporting the establishment of an independent, international accountability mechanism to hold perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law to account. Currently there is no mechanism in place and grave violations against civilians, including children, continue to take place with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, together with other international players, can also play a role in facilitating a political settlement. While a Saudi-Houthi dialogue should be encouraged as it is the track presenting the greatest chance for a renewal of a truce or, even better, a ceasefire, ultimately the shared view was that only a UN process can guarantee that the various parties to the conflict will have a seat at the table, and that the elements of a political settlement be truly inclusive. Participants from various fields argued that only a UN-led process can guarantee the sustainability of the final agreement and allow the benefits to be perceived tangibly by a broader spectrum of the population. The UK is currently supporting the diplomatic efforts carried out by the UN, including by actively and frequently engaging with the UN Special Envoy on Yemen, Hans Grundberg. However, some participants argued that more could be done to ensure children, young people and women are better included in the process, so their voices and needs are heard, including by ensuring women can gain freedom of movement and work in a future Yemen. One practitioner also suggested that the UK could build on its efforts to address Mahramrelated restrictions and play a leading role in convening donors in the country to call for an end to the continued restrictions facing female aid workers, while at the same time supporting humanitarian access. Besides ensuring that a truce implementation supports sustained, free and unfettered humanitarian access across Yemen, the UK could also push for the inclusion of the needs of IDPs in the truce process. One humanitarian worker argued finally that actors from the south, including journalists and activists, should be included and engaged with as they have so far been marginalised from the process, with the risk they could act as a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the truce had a positive, if uneven, impact for civilians on the ground, and the aim should therefore be for the international community to facilitate its renewal and expansion. The UK has a leading role to play in this sense, including by ensuring meaningful participation and inclusion from different sides of Yemeni society, including children, women and young people; continued engagement with the UN Special Envoy’s Office is key to facilitating that. The UK should build on its efforts to date and play a leading role with parties to the conflict to ensure safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, including through high-level engagement on rolling back Mahram restrictions directly with involved parties, as well as through UN leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future negotiations on the truce should also consider lessons learned from the previous agreement, including addressing the specific needs of IDPs, and better supporting the wider goals of improving humanitarian access across the country. Mining and clearance efforts must also be prioritised to reduce civilian harm, even after hostilities cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the collapse of the truce, it is crucial for governments such as the UK to support the establishment of an international, independent accountability mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law to prepare files to facilitate criminal proceedings. Such a mechanism would be a deterrent directed at those perpetrating serious violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular consultations between practitioners and analysts as well as humanitarian workers and civil society organisations can ensure a better understanding of the situation on the ground and the collective identification of ways to increase the chances of creating a more stable and secure Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

Officially established by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, the Space Force garnered bipartisan support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized within the Department of the Air Force, the USSF functions at an equal level as the U.S. Air Force, similar to how the Marine Corps is structured within the Department of the Navy. Under Title 10, Section 9081, of the U.S. Code, the Space Force has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip space-focused military forces. Specifically, the Space Force is responsible for space launch, satellite operations, surveillance of the space environment, satellite defense, and some missile defense functions. Previously, space forces and missions were scattered throughout the DoD. With the establishment of the Space Force, the DoD envisions consolidating all or many of these missions, forces, and authorities within the purview of the Space Force. The Space Force will then provide space support to other branches of the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fast-facts&quot;&gt;Fast Facts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: “[T]he USSF is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping Guardians to conduct global space operations that enhance the way our joint and coalition forces fight, while also offering decision-makers military options to achieve national objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;: Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General B. Chance Saltzman); Vice Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General David D. Thompson): and Chief Master Sergeant (CMSSF Roger A. Towberman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motto&lt;/strong&gt;: Sempra Supra, or Always Above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: The Pentagon, Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: The Space Force is the smallest U.S. armed service, consisting of 8,600 military personnel (4,286 enlisted and 4,314 officers), 4,927 civilian personnel, and operating over 100 satellites. Its projected size is 16,000 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2023 Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: $26.3 billion. The Space Force budget for FY 2023 includes $4 billion for operations and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M); $16.6 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E); $4.4 billion for procurement; and $1.1 billion for military personnel costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Locations&lt;/strong&gt;: Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado; Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, California; Patrick Space Force Base near Satellite Beach, Florida; Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Vandenberg Space Force Base near Lompoc, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. military space capabilities have advanced remarkably since the 1950s, they were divided amongst the different services, with the Air Force, Army, and Navy all maintaining programs focused on space. Responding to a deepening dependence on space, concerns about this disparate structure began to emerge, inspiring discussions since the 1960s over the creation of a separate space-focused service in the military. Having gained the attention of Congress, the Rumsfeld (1999-2001) and the Allard commissions (2006-2008) were created to address the organizational structure of national security space. However, despite concerning advances made by competitors in developing counterspace technology — culminating in the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test — neither report brought about any significant reorganization. While the House-passed FY 2018 NDAA introduced the creation of a Space Corps, which was not carried forward in the final bill, it was President Trump’s 2019 directive to establish a separate military service for space that broke nearly twenty years of inaction. That proposal, which directed the standup of a Space Force within the Department of the Air Force, enjoyed bipartisan support and led to Congress passing the proposal as part of the FY 2020 NDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-space-force-do&quot;&gt;What does the Space Force do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was designed to create one organization responsible for the training, development, and acquisition of equipment to support the U.S. military’s space capabilities and operations. Fielding over 100 satellites, USSF Guardians operate and maintain command and control of satellites that provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), strategic and tactical communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and weather. Guardians conduct space launches and operate the Nation’s space launch ranges, while also maintaining an extensive network of satellites, ground-based telescopes and radars that provide early warning of missile launches and track spacecraft and orbital debris. They are called upon to provide space superiority, employing broad offensive and defensive capabilities to support U.S. military missions. The responsibilities of the Space Force include the cultivation of space professionals, the maturation of military doctrine, and the organization of combat-ready forces for use by Combatant Commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-organization&quot;&gt;Internal Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the civilian leader of the Space Force and oversees both the Air Force and Space Force. For the military, the FY 2020 NDAA specified that a four-star general will serve as Chief of Space Operations (CSO) to lead the Space Force and be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chief Master Sergeant is the most senior enlisted advisor of the Space Force. This position “serves as the personal adviser to the Chief of Space Operations and the Secretary of the Air Force on all issues regarding the welfare, readiness, morale, proper utilization and development of the U.S. Space Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was intentionally designed to be a slim, agile, and mission-focused organization, and thus, its Guardian and staff numbers are significantly smaller than other military services in order to remove the traditional layers of bureaucracy. The Space Force relies on the Department of the Air Force to provide everyday support functions such as logistics, base operations and security, civilian personnel HR and hiring, IT support, audits and financial support, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force is supported by three field commands, Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC), and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM), that are further separated into 16 mission Deltas (USSF organizational units) and three Base Deltas that provide mission support functions. Two acquisition organizations, the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), also support the Space Force and report directly to the Chief of Space Operations and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A headquarters function, the Office of the Chief of Space Operations, supporting the CSO and SecAF comprises a mix of general officers and senior executive civilians in roles of deputy chiefs of space operations, including human capital; intelligence; operations, cyber, and nuclear; and strategy, plans, programs, and requirements; and technology and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the three field commands, the SpOC and SSC are led by three-star generals, and STARCOM is led by a two-star general. Each field command is supported by Deltas of around 400 personnel, each focusing on a specific mission area and containing supporting squadrons. Deltas are led by Colonels, while squadrons are led by Lieutenant Colonels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;space-operations-command-spoc&quot;&gt;Space Operations Command (SpOC)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpOC is responsible for operating space capabilities and presenting them to commanders for employment. SpOC is the primary force provider of space forces and capabilities for combatant commanders, coalition partners, the joint force, and the nation. Uniquely operating at the nexus of the USSF and U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), SpOC functions as both a field command for the USSF and a service command for USSPACECOM. Guiding SpOC are three priorities: preparing (a combat-ready, ISR-led, cyber-secure force), partnering (across the U.S. government, allies, and commercial partners), and projecting (combat power in, from, and to space). Furthermore, SpOC is supported by Space Base Deltas (SBDs) 1 and 2, which provide mission support functions on military installations, such as IT and medical support. SpOC is comprised of the following nine Deltas and two Base Deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferred to USSF from the oversight of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in October 2022, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is responsible for the rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions. It is building a proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation, initially focused on missile tracking and SATCOM connectivity to quickly relay data to a range of warfighter platforms. Of note, SDA does not fall under the command of Space Systems Command. Instead, the SDA reports to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters. It retains the authority to set its own policies and decide how to develop and buy its own systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Rapid Capabilities Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in the FY 18 NDAA, with further authorities granted under the FY 19 NDAA, the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) is a direct report to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters, similar to SDA. Forming another component of the USSF’s acquisition capabilities, the Space RCO is tasked with delivering “operationally dominant space capabilities at the speed of warfighting relevance.” Organized in a streamlined manner with agile decision-making authorities, a short chain-of-command, and integrated support functions like contracting, the Space RCO fills a niche within the USSF where it can take “measured risks” in developing and quickly delivering prototypes to the SSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Component Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USSF has activated three service components assigned to combatant commands to provide “service-specific administration and support functions,” as outlined in Title 10, U.S. Code. Service Component commands are personnel, units, organizations, or other support forces that belong to a distinct military service but are assigned to support a Combatant Commander. SpOC performs the service component function for U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). As of December 2022, the USSF also supports two regional combatant commands and a sub-unified command, with component commands at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), and U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM). These service components will “integrate at the component level and provide combatant commanders a subordinate space commander, organic space planning and employment expertise, and space command and control that is focused on the joint force’s operational warfighting priorities and requirements.” In the future, additional space component commands will likely emerge at many, if not all, of the other combatant commands.&lt;/p&gt;

Then came the Great Frost of 1708–9. Birds were said to have frozen in midflight and dropped dead to the ground. Charles’s army of more than 40,000 men soon lost half its strength from exposure and starvation. In an attempt to escape the cold, the Swedish king led the remnants of his army south into Ukraine to join the Cossack leader, Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and his forces. But the damage was done. The following summer, Peter’s Russian army routed Charles’s weakened forces at the Battle of Poltava, bringing an end to Sweden’s empire and its designs on Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swedes were neither the first nor the last European army to suffer the ravages of “General Winter” on Russia’s frontiers. Exacerbated by the vast expanse of the Eurasian landmass, winter fighting there has often proved to be the downfall of great armies. For centuries, this phenomenon has often worked to Russia’s advantage, as a succession of powerful militaries have succumbed to inadequate equipment, deficient supply lines, and poor preparation. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters the harshest months of the year, there are many indications that this time it may be Russia, rather than its adversary, that suffers the worst consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;his-empire-for-a-horse&quot;&gt;His Empire for a Horse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s best-known winter defeat in Russia came in 1812 — just over a century after the Battle of Poltava — when Napoleon’s Grande Armée retreated from Moscow. Russia’s scorched-earth tactics, which left the French with no food or shelter along the line of withdrawal, made the effect even more deadly. Yet the greatest casualties had occurred earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grande Armée had been almost half a million strong when it crossed the River Neman, the frontier between Prussia and Russia, in June 1812. But it soon lost a third of its strength from summer heat, disease, hunger, and exhaustion as the emperor forced his men on toward Moscow. Although the retreat into Russia’s expanse was unintended at first, Tsar Alexander I’s commanders soon realized the advantage. They kept withdrawing east and did not make a stand until General Mikhail Kutuzov was ordered to halt Napoleon at Borodino, 75 miles west of Moscow. The battle proved a costly victory for the French, even though it enabled them to enter Moscow unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was the approaching winter that proved fatal for the invaders. Napoleon wasted five weeks in Moscow expecting the tsar to come to terms. When the Grande Armée finally started to withdraw to central Europe on October 19, the soldiers were still wearing their summer uniforms. They had also lost their baggage trains and could expect little food along the way. Their greatest deficiency was in cavalry to hold off marauding Cossacks. The shaggy Cossack ponies were accustomed to the winter blizzards, which began a month later, while the last of the chargers and draft horses from western Europe collapsed from the cold and lack of forage. Starving soldiers hacked off their meat even before they were dead. Desertion or surrender was far from a guarantee of survival. Avenging Cossacks waited to skewer enemy soldiers on their long lances; Russian peasants simply slaughtered them with scythes. By early December, Napoleon feared a coup d’état during his absence, and, abandoning his army, headed for Paris before his frozen men could reach safety. By this point, his forces had suffered nearly 400,000 casualties, and he had lost his reputation for invincibility on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less well known, although perhaps equally significant, was the way Russia won. Despite having lost 200,000 of its own men, Russia’s military leadership was far less concerned about casualties than was Napoleon. Russian officers still treated their peasant soldiers as little better than serfs (and serfdom would not be abolished in Russia for another 50 years). This lack of interest in soldiers’ well-being — and the casual attitude to massive losses through so-called meat-grinder tactics — are apparent in Putin’s army in Ukraine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-terror-white-frost&quot;&gt;Red Terror, White Frost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another half century later, in World War I, the attitude of Russia’s military authorities had barely changed. Their men were expendable. Trench life for the rank and file along the eastern front that ran through Belorussia, Galicia, and Romania from 1915 to 1917 was an inhuman experience. And many resented that officers retired each night to the warmth and relative comfort of peasant log huts behind the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having dug themselves into the ground,” the Russian writer and anti-tsarist Maxim Gorky observed of the enlisted men, “they live in rain and snow, in filth, in cramped conditions; they are being worn out by disease and eaten by vermin; they live like beasts.” Many lacked boots and had to resort to bast shoes made from birch bark. Stations for treating the wounded at the front were almost as primitive as they had been in the Crimean War. This reality was in cruel contrast to the photographs of the tsarina and her grand duchess daughters immaculately dressed as nurses before the February 1917 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter conditions in the Russian Civil War (1917–­21) were even worse. The most pitiful victims were the civilian refugees fleeing the Bolshevik onslaught, or what became known as the Red Terror. During the winter of 1919, the collapse of Admiral Kolchak’s White Russian armies in Siberia produced terrible scenes along the jammed Trans-Siberian Railroad. Aristocrats, middle-class families, and anti-Bolsheviks of all backgrounds were trying to escape to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East to avoid capture by the Communist Red Army, which was advancing from the Urals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In World War I, many Russians lacked boots and had to resort to shoes made of birch bark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mid-December of that year, the Reds caught up with the tail of the line and took the southern Siberian city and industrial hub of Novo-Nikolaevsk (present-day Novosibirsk), along with numerous trains still blocked there. The city itself was in the grip of a typhus epidemic. All horses, carts, and sledges available had already been taken, so the desperate set out on foot, not knowing that farther ahead in Krasnoyarsk cases had reached more than 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A mass retreat is one of the saddest and most despairing sights in the world,” Captain Brian Horrocks, a British officer in the Allied intervention in Russia, wrote. “The sick just fell down and died in the snow.” He was horrified by the squalid conditions faced even by those refugees who had managed to find a place in packed cattle wagons. Most wagons lacked any heating as temperatures dropped to as low as minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit. “The thing which impressed me most was the fortitude with which the women, many of them reared in luxury, were facing their hopeless future,” he wrote. “The menfolk were much more given to self-pity.” Kolchak’s staff officers were by then drinking themselves into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As White Russian, Czech, and Polish commanders argued bitterly over priority for their troop trains, starving and frozen refugees were dying at an alarming rate. One officer wrote that trains at some Siberian stations were unloading hundreds of bodies of people who had died from cold and disease. “These bodies were stacked up at the stations like so much cordwood,” another officer wrote. “Those who remained alive never talked, never thought of anything save how they might escape death and get farther and farther away from the Bolsheviks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the northern Caucasus, known for its blazing summer heat, winter could sometimes produce drops in temperature of more than 22 degrees Fahrenheit in less than an hour. In February 1920, General Dmitry Pavlov’s cavalry divisions were caught in the open by a sudden blizzard. Pavlov “lost half of his horses which froze in the steppe,” the Red Army high command noted. But the human losses were far worse. “We left behind in the steppe thousands of men frozen to death, and the blizzard buried them,” a Cossack officer recounted. Those who survived did so by huddling against their horses. Pavlov, who had ignored warnings of the possible change in the weather, suffered severe frostbite himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stalins-ice-breakers&quot;&gt;Stalin’s Ice Breakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the twentieth century, winter conditions on the Eurasian landmass posed a growing threat not just to humans and horses but also to military weaponry. Sometimes this worked to Russia’s detriment. Despite its disproportionate strength and its massive expenditure of ammunition, the Soviet army failed to break Finnish resistance in the Winter War of 1939–40, following Stalin’s invasion of Finland. The Finns, proving themselves even better practitioners of winter tactics than their invaders, terrorized Red Army soldiers by day and night as their white-camouflaged ski troops launched surprise attacks from forests, then disappeared like ghosts. Their bravery and skill persuaded Stalin to accept Finland’s independence. But it also served as a lesson for the war to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the rapid military mechanization between the two world wars, the Soviet Union had created the largest tank force in the world. The Red Army at least learned that guns and engines needed special lubricants in extreme conditions. Such measures proved key in Stalin’s ability to block Hitler’s armies in front of Moscow in December 1941. Both the German army and the Luftwaffe were unprepared. They had to light fires under their vehicles and aircraft engines to defrost them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German soldiers referred bitterly to winter conditions as “weather for Russians.” They envied the Red Army’s winter uniforms, with white camouflage suits and padded cotton jackets, which were far more effective than German greatcoats. Russian military historians have attributed the comparatively low rate of frostbite and trench foot among Soviet forces to their old military practice of using layered linen foot bandages instead of socks. German soldiers also suffered more rapidly because their jackboots had steel studs that drained any warmth. In February 1943, when the remnants of Field Marshal Paulus’s Sixth Army finally surrendered at Stalingrad — the psychological turning point of World War II — more than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of the city on frost-ravaged feet. Yet their suffering had been caused less by cold than by Hitler’s orders to hold on there and the inability of German panzers with their narrow tracks to counterattack in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Winter also played a major role in the Red Army’s final victory in 1945. The great Soviet breakthrough in January, a charge from the River Vistula to the River Oder, depended on the weather. Russian forecasters had predicted “a strange winter,” with “heavy rain and wet snow” after the hard frosts of January. An order went out to repair boots. Stalin and the Red Army’s supreme command set January 12 as the start date for the offensive, so that the Soviets’ tank armies could take advantage of the deep-frozen ground before any thaw set in. Characteristically, Stalin falsely claimed that he had advanced the date from January 20 to take pressure off the Americans in the Ardennes. (U.S. forces had already halted the German offensive there just after Christmas.) In fact, there was another motive: Stalin wanted to control the bulk of Polish territory before he met U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at Yalta in the first week of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of Stalingrad on frost-ravaged feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin’s commanders did not let him down. “Our tanks move faster than the trains to Berlin,” boasted the ebullient Colonel Iosif Gusakovsky. He had not bothered to wait for bridging equipment to reach the frontlines before attempting to cross the River Pilica. He simply ordered his leading tanks to smash the ice with gunfire, then to drive straight across the riverbed. The tanks, acting like icebreakers, pushed the ice aside “with a terrible thundering noise,” a terrifying experience for the poor drivers. The German eastern front in Poland collapsed under the armored onslaught, once again because the Soviet T-34’s broad tracks could cope with the ice and snow far better than any German panzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1945, the Red Army’s achievements in winter warfare gave it a fearsome reputation in the West. It was not until the Soviet Union’s ill-planned invasion of Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1968 — the Warsaw Pact forces lacked maps, food supplies, and fuel — that Western analysts first began to suspect that they might have overestimated the Soviets’ warfighting abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet empire was marked by its doomed struggle to control Afghanistan, a terrain that made winter warfare impossible for conventional armies. Then, during the economic collapse in the 1990s, Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s government often proved unable to pay officers and soldiers alike and corruption became institutionalized. Conscripts were frequently on the edge of starvation because their rations were sold off; theft, bullying, and ill discipline became rampant. Spare parts from vehicles, as well as anything from fuel to light bulbs, boots, and especially any cold weather kit, disappeared onto the black market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption became even worse following Russia’s chaotic invasion of Georgia in 2008. Putin began throwing money at the armed forces. The waste on prestige projects encouraged contractors and generals alike to pad their bank accounts. Little appears to have been done in reassessing military doctrine. The Russian idea of urban warfare had still not evolved from World War II, with their artillery, the “god of war,” smashing everything to rubble. This approach would continue during Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Putin’s greatest triumph in Russian eyes was the covert seizure of Crimea the year before by infiltrating it with un-uniformed “little green men” from special forces. This was part of Putin’s angry reaction to the Maidan revolution in Kyiv, which forced his ally President Viktor Yanukovych to flee and led to the start of fighting in the Donbas region of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putin-in-denial&quot;&gt;Putin in Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, eight years later, Putin launched his “special military operation” in Ukraine. At the time, the vanguard was told to bring their parade uniforms ready to celebrate victory — one of the greatest examples of military hubris in history. Yet seven disastrous months later, when the Kremlin was finally forced to order a “partial mobilization” of the Russian population, it had to warn those called up that uniforms and equipment were in short supply. They would have to provide their own body armor and even ask their mothers and girlfriends for sanitary pads to use instead of field dressings. The lack of bandages is astonishing, especially now as winter intensifies, since they are vital to keep frost from entering open wounds. Adding to the dangers are mortar rounds hitting frozen ground: unlike soft mud, which absorbs most of the blast, frozen ground causes fragments to ricochet, in sometimes lethal ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s new commander in chief in the south, General Sergei Surovikin, is determined to clamp down on attempts by some conscripts to avoid combat. Many have been resorting to the sabotage of fuel, weapons, and vehicles, to say nothing of self-inflicted wounds and desertion. Yet the Russian army’s long-standing structural problem — its shortage of experienced noncommissioned officers — has also led to a terrible record of maintaining weapons, equipment, and vehicles. These problems will become especially costly in winter with sensitive technology such as drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both sides enter a far more challenging season of fighting, the outcome will largely depend on morale and determination. While Russian troops curse their shortages and lack of hot food, Ukrainian troops are now benefiting from supplies of insulated camouflage suits, tents with stoves, and sleeping bags provided by Canada and the Nordic nations. Putin seems to be in denial about the state of his army and the way that General Winter will favor his opponents. He may also have made another mistake by concentrating his missiles against Ukraine’s energy network and its vulnerable civilian population. They will endure the greatest suffering, but there is little chance that they will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing wariness of governments in Australia, the US and the UK over potential foreign state interference by countries like Russia and China in their domestic affairs has sparked a greater examination of the tactics and objectives of malign state actors. However, the debate over this challenge is unclear in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign interference can be characterised as activity that takes place through covert means that obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, not in conformity to national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion amongst a population through disinformation efforts. The paper also briefly discusses the concept of ‘sharp power’, which best captures the unique nature of the threat of political interference – namely, co-optation of key decision-makers, influencers and thought leaders for the purpose of internalising, advocating for or advancing the interests of foreign authoritarian powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Southeast Asia, a region of strategic interest to authoritarian and democratic countries alike for its economic dynamism and strategic location, public debate and academic engagement on the question of foreign state interference is limited. This is likely due to political sensitivities over whether governments are seen to be sufficiently addressing the challenge and, where it concerns China, whether they could be seen as taking sides in the wider geopolitical tension between China and the US. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, for example through disinformation on social media platforms, is somewhat easier, as seen in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivity of the subject of state interference, this paper primarily relies on open source material, supplemented by interviews with key policymakers and experts in Southeast Asia under rules of non-attribution. The paper analyses the main vectors of malign foreign influence across key Southeast Asian states, as well as the region’s geopolitical relevance to authoritarian foreign states potentially interested in conducting interference for political objectives. The combination of these three factors affects their vulnerability to malign foreign influence. While this paper cannot address the challenge of foreign state interference in its entirety or map each country’s specific experience in depth, it seeks to offer a starting point for further research and discussions. The paper provides brief policy recommendations as a basis for this. It goes without saying that any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states in light of their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development. However, given the international challenge of foreign state interference, this paper highlights a few ways in which partner countries who are seeking to mitigate their own domestic experiences of the challenge can work with Southeast Asian countries to share lessons learned and exchange issues on risk mitigation. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue support for local media and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer alternatives where investment is needed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase information exchange on malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help develop risk mitigation strategies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensification of strategic competition among states is increasingly taking place in the ‘grey zone’ between acceptable state activity and interference, with the aim of pursuing national strategic interests without resorting to war. States by nature seek to influence one another to protect their interests; this is entirely legitimate when the state-led activity takes place transparently and within legal means, but it becomes malign interference when the activity takes place through covert means which obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, is not in conformity with national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion for a population through disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberal democracies are increasingly becoming aware of this grey zone threat. The UK and allies such as the US and Australia have increasingly revealed malign interference activity within their borders and have attributed it to Iran, Russia and China, to varying extents. Authoritarian regimes engaged in strategic competition below the threshold of outright war, such as Iran, Russia and China, seek to weaken democratic systems through economic interference, information operations and political influence. While investigative journalism, academic research and institutional checks and balances have exposed a range of activities in these countries and have driven further enquiry, it is not clear to what extent malign interference activity is taking place outside of Europe and specific countries, such as Australia and the US, where the issue of malign interference has been politically and publicly explored as a serious challenge to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close allies and partners such as the UK, US and Australia are seeking to engage more strategically in the Indo-Pacific and specifically Southeast Asia, as laid out in their various national strategies, policy documents and official statements. While there are many reasons for this, including economic opportunity, one common security concern is potential growing Chinese influence and interference, through both legitimate and illegitimate means, and the challenge that this presents to their interests. These countries’ engagement in the region includes upholding shared principles such as economic sustainability, free trade based on equal access, and democratic principles of transparency and good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is not able to encompass the entirety of types of interference, nor does it purport to comprehensively cover all potential political, economic and informational interference activities. For the purposes of this study, the paper will examine a few case studies in Southeast Asia in terms of the following potential avenues for interference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Informational: including attempts to use social media or other platforms to advance pro-hostile-state messaging or narratives, as well as hostile states seeking to influence local media communities in order to advance their narratives. It includes, for example, activities of foreign diplomatic missions and their proxies, as well as overseas associations, aimed at manipulating national media outlets and social media platforms through the deliberate propagation of falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political: influential communities, subversive actors. This includes efforts to become involved in local politics or influential communities, or with local communities of any ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic: purchase of or investment in sensitive critical national infrastructure (CNI), defined as infrastructure that is either critical to national GDP or is in a sensitive area such as telecommunications or national defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the focus of Western liberal states on Southeast Asia as part of their Indo-Pacific strategies, this paper seeks to understand whether malign interference activity by authoritarian states across the 10 ASEAN member states (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) is seen as a destabilising threat to national security. It seeks to better understand the current level of debate in Southeast Asia on influence versus interference as a foreign policy tool, and will examine to what extent malign interference activity by authoritarian states is taking place in the region and what the responses have been to any existing or potential malign interference. It will focus primarily on China as the largest actor in Southeast Asia, but will also discuss Iran, Russia and North Korea as authoritarian regimes whose activities are of concern to liberal democracies like the UK, US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper offers examples of activity of concern, highlights potential vulnerabilities and strengths, and aims to underscore regional responses to and perspectives on this global challenge. One main finding is that the political sensitivity around malign interference activities in this region means that the debate on this topic in Southeast Asia is less prominent publicly than, for example, it is in Australia, the US or Europe. This is a particularly sensitive topic due to the debate over national security and whether governments are responding sufficiently to threats, as well as the fact that debates around China are by their very nature difficult in the region, as countries actively seek not to take sides in what is seen as a geopolitical competition between the US and Southeast Asia’s top trading partner. This limits the willingness of individuals, irrespective of sector, to discuss such topics openly, while academic debate seems likewise limited. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, particularly with regard to disinformation, remains a serious challenge in the region, as discussed in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology employed in the research for this paper has chiefly consisted of desk-based open source research, as well as semi-structured interviews for the purpose of supplementing research findings and engaging with specific experts on influence and interference activities in the region. For the purposes of the regional overview chapter, 15 interviews on the three types of potential interference activities that this paper examines were conducted with experts from and based in the region. Interviews were conducted under the Chatham House Rule, and as such any information used is non-attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I presents a regional overview of all 10 focus countries. The subsequent three chapters, one on each area vulnerable to malign interference activity, were authored by experts based in Southeast Asia and selected for their expertise in the areas they explore. In Chapter II, Benjamin Ang defines what constitutes information operations and hostile actions and explores the countermeasures put in place by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. In Chapter III, Richard Javad Heydarian assesses the potential vulnerability to ‘sharp power’ as a form of political interference in the region. In Chapter IV, Ryan Clarke explores the debate around potential economic interference in Southeast Asia by China, focusing specifically on the example of Chinese investment in high-speed rail in Malaysia, Laos and Thailand as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region. Clarke examines, in particular, the potentially political nature of infrastructure investment. The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings of the regional overview and subsequent thematic chapters, and presents policy recommendations for the UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia seeking to support countries in the region to mitigate the challenge of malign interference activities by states. While this study ultimately focuses on China in particular, it is not able to delve into whether other countries are engaged in similar interference activities; there is therefore a need for further research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regional-overview&quot;&gt;Regional Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current scholarly and think tank literature on the question of malign interference by state actors in the 10 ASEAN member states is limited, particularly when pertaining to specific analyses of economic interference, political interference and information operations. The limited public engagement on these topics is equally reflected in the number of experts in Southeast Asia specialising in malign interference by states. In some countries, such as Laos, it would appear that there is no in-country expertise on the subject, while in others requests for expert interviews were met with a muted response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of academic engagement and public debate seems to negatively impact the baseline understanding of the subject, as seen in a confusion as to what constitutes influence and interference, and what differentiates one from the other. Without a firm understanding of the theoretical concepts involved, explorations of the subject within a national context risk drawing incorrect conclusions. This chapter first defines the concepts of influence versus interference before exploring the extent of academic and expert debate on malign interference by states in each of the 10 focus countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interference-or-influence&quot;&gt;Interference or Influence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Influence’ can be understood as legitimate action that involves public, ‘above board’ activities. ‘Interference’ is illegitimate or illicit action, encompassing, for example, activities that are covert, coercive or corrupt, including cyber attacks and disinformation operations. These are malign when they seek to harm or go against the interests of the state they are targeting. Former CIA director John Brennan, rebutting claims by former president Donald Trump that China had attempted to interfere with the 2018 US midterm elections, made such a distinction. In 2017, then-prime minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull, in a speech introducing new legislative amendments on espionage and foreign interference, specified that activities in support of foreign governments are not illegal unless they are ‘covert, coercive or corrupt’, making the distinction between ‘legitimate influence and unacceptable interference’. However, previously legal means of exerting influence, such as political funding, are now only considered legitimate if they are transparent, as the Australian Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Public Register and associated legislation seeks to ensure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In literature and policy on the topic, the distinction is generally less sharp. Indeed, Adam Henschke, Matthew Sussex and Courteney O’Connor suggest that creating a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference is ‘unhelpful outside a strict regulatory context’ because both can be used to undermine democratic processes. They note that hostile actors can exploit ‘grey spaces between legal influence and illegal interference’ and adapt in ways that provide them with plausible deniability. For instance, these authors do not categorise disinformation in election campaigns or longer-term propaganda and lobbying efforts as interference, as they are not illegal; instead, they point to activities such as corruption or tampering with election results as examples of interference. Both, however, are damaging. Making a similar point, Alex Joske highlights the risks of disaggregating activity under China’s United Front system, noting the importance of considering the impact of the consolidated effort rather than assessing activities in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves to emphasise the lack of common definitions of foreign influence and foreign interference, as well as the challenge of finding a widely accepted distinction between the two terms. Kristine Berzina and Etienne Soula note that such ambiguity ‘can delay or complicate lawmakers’ initiatives and muddy civil society’s efforts to build awareness and rally opposition against incursions into democratic processes’. While acknowledging the risks of creating a definition that is too broad and may thus curb freedom of expression, too narrow so as to exclude certain activities, or too focused on tactics and consequently not flexible enough to adapt to evolving technologies, they propose that the core criteria in determining whether an activity constitutes interference should be intent and transparency. Michael N Schmitt characterises ‘intervention’ as activities that impact matters otherwise left to the sole discretion of the state, such as the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and distinguishes it from influence by pointing to the involvement of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Australian context, Katherine Mansted argues that given the emerging grey zone between acceptable state-based activity and interference, it may be useful ‘to move policy frameworks and public discourse beyond a binary divide between “influence” and “interference” and instead to think of foreign influence along a continuum of risk’. The measures she proposes include updating legislation to capture influence activities that may be ‘precursors’ to foreign interference, such as data collection, surveillance and media ownership. Writing about Chinese influence and interference in the UK, Charles Parton proposes a spectrum from ‘acceptable influence activities, through unwanted but tolerable interference, to unacceptable interference against which action is required’. Andrew Chubb has written extensively on China’s overseas political activities in the UK and Australia, and explores this in greater detail. Using case studies from both the UK and Australia, Chubb stresses the need to recognise the differences between issues of national security, human rights and academic freedom, and offers recommendations for what targeted responses might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government clearly outlines the distinction between foreign influence and interference, describing the former as activities ‘conducted in an open and transparent manner’ that ‘contribute positively to public debate’ and the latter as activities that are ‘coercive, corrupting, deceptive, [and] clandestine’ and that are ‘contrary to Australia’s sovereignty, values and national interests’. The Canadian government appears to use the terms interchangeably. The US does not articulate a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference, but clearly defines the latter in the context of elections in an executive order entitled ‘Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election’, signed by then-president Donald Trump in 2018 and extended by President Joe Biden in September 2021. The order defines foreign interference as ‘covert, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlawful actions … undertaken with the purpose or effect of influencing, undermining confidence in, or altering the result or reported result of, the election, or undermining public confidence in election processes or institutions’. However, the FBI refers to activities that seem to fall under foreign interference according to the above definition as ‘foreign influence’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regional overview focuses specifically on instances of interference by authoritarian state actors. Interviewees and other sources did not always clearly differentiate between influence and interference, and over the course of this review, conflation between the two terms in Southeast Asia was prevalent. Overwhelmingly, China arose most frequently when discussing sources of potential state-led or state-directed interference. Mention of Russia was only made on three occasions, and in two of these instances (from Myanmar and Vietnam) the relationship should be interpreted as benign. Iran is also viewed as a benign actor in at least two countries. As seen in the following country-specific overviews, there is clearly a distinct paucity of research and publications about malign interference activities by states across Southeast Asia, and the only significant work on this subject, with the exception of Singapore, has been undertaken extra-regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brunei, there are no publicly avowed examples of disinformation campaigns and no discourse about interference among public intellectuals. There are, however, concerns harboured within the Bruneian establishment over hidden debt, compromise of public health data, and elite capture. Proprietary interviews with regional security specialists reveal growing concerns that China is increasingly aggressively pursuing its elite capture strategy in order to secure exclusive rights to Brunei’s enormous onshore and offshore oil and natural gas reserves. One prominent method consists of offering free shares and other economic interests in Chinese companies that would be involved. These incentives span the entire spectrum of a project, from shares in the drilling equipment company to shares in the company that is involved in retail distribution in China. As these are Chinese corporate entities, their shareholding structures and other relevant data are deemed to be state secrets under China’s relevant law, thereby shielding any Bruneian officials from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and Laos, as states close to China and in line with the authoritarian nature of their regimes, are so penetrated by Chinese geopolitical interests that there is no obvious domestic discourse on malign interference activity by the authoritarian states under examination in this paper. Approaches made to public intellectuals were met with a limited response. There are, however, a handful of dissidents and opponents to the regime who have written on the subject of foreign political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cambodia, China has increasingly sought to position itself as a ‘no questions asked’ provider of dual-use infrastructure investment, especially in port/maritime facilities such as the recent Ream Naval Base. Sources in the financial services industry note that China appears to view Cambodia in a similar light as Laos and therefore as readily available for elite capture. China is also actively incentivising key government officials to execute Mekong-origin water-sharing agreements that are not in Cambodia’s long-term interests by (similar to the methods used in Brunei) offering shares and other considerations in Chinese companies that are involved in Mekong water management projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Laos, Chinese law enforcement has significantly increased its presence, extending extra-territorial control, particularly in casino zones on the border with China. Similar to Cambodia, financial industry sources note that China has been able to negotiate Mekong-origin water-sharing terms that disproportionately favour China by actively exerting influence on parties representing the Laotian side. In particular, the construction of new dams in Laos with heavy investment by China has prompted concern over Laos’ debt burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, there appears to be awareness of, and research on, Chinese and Russian cyber operations aimed at interfering in the 2019 Indonesian election. The Chinese digital footprint is so large and pervasive in Indonesia that Jakarta’s exposure to interference in the digital domain is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with experts and some reporting on the subject reveal an attempt by Chinese state-backed cyber units or Chinese companies to control and/or manipulate telecommunications providers, as well as allegedly censoring material critical of China in acquired Indonesian news aggregator app Baca Berita. Analysis of the methods and technologies used by these Chinese cyber operators suggests some links to China’s People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, in the Philippines, there is a well-documented debate about China’s investment in the country’s CNI, including the power grid and the telecommunications sector. In 2019, media reports cited concerns over the installation of China Telecom infrastructure on Philippines military bases through a deal struck with Filipino-Chinese tycoon Denis Uy. In the run-up to presidential elections in 2022 there appeared to be lively but sensitive debate about the potential for Chinese interference, but no specific allegations have been made since the elections were held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with financial industry executives have noted a strategy of ‘elite capture by proxy’ in the Philippines, whereby Chinese state interests were being furthered without attracting attention. Other notable research on the Philippines includes work on Chinese disinformation on social media and China’s CNI investment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an awareness of China’s ability to interfere in Malaysia, but there are few well-documented cases of outright interference. There may be concerns over disinformation campaigns concerning vaccine diplomacy and human rights violations against the Uyghur population in China. Elite capture appears to be a favoured approach by Beijing in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the security situation in Myanmar, no public intellectuals in the country are currently contactable. One interview with a Myanmar expert in the region suggests that interference and disinformation operations are active on two fronts: China’s ability to penetrate Myanmar’s digital ecosystem and to leverage its support of ethnic armed groups; and Russia’s efforts to assist the Burmese government in psychological operations and disinformation campaigns. Further literature includes discussion of the Chinese presence in Myanmar and China’s proposed railways through Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a regional centre of expertise on the methodologies of hostile state actors, interference and disinformation operations, especially following the country’s recently introduced Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA). There is little discourse on the specifics of how Singapore’s Chinese-speaking community may have been penetrated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the large embedded and wealthy ethnic Chinese population in Thailand, Chinese cultural and economic penetration of the country is overt. The Thai establishment may, however, be concerned over encroachment on Thai sovereignty through large Chinese-funded infrastructure projects. Regional security experts also note that there is growing concern over the fact that China is increasingly attempting to acquire controlling equity stakes in leading Thai media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam takes a robust approach to online disinformation campaigns by China and has a long history of tackling Chinese attempts at interference. There is a concern about hidden debt and closely guarded relationships within the business elites of both countries. As the Vietnamese information environment is not presently conducive to Thai-style information operations, a more coercive, direct influence approach has been observed by one industry executive interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-actor-interference-in-southeast-asia-information-operations-and-what-constitutes-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Malign Actor Interference in Southeast Asia: Information Operations and What Constitutes ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Ang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a spectrum of information operations in Southeast Asia. At one end there are open and legitimate operations, which are generally acceptable to states, while at the other are hostile, deceptive and illegitimate operations by malign actors, which are generally considered as foreign interference that is not acceptable to the target states. For the purposes of this chapter, ‘malign actors’ refers to entities that carry out the latter operations, and ‘target states’ refers to states where such actions are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These malign actors include both foreign and domestic entities, with different objectives in the target state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Businesses, which may be seeking to discourage government regulation or attempting to circumvent existing laws.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NGOs, which may be seeking to change the policies of the target state for ideological or political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religious groups, which may be seeking to change the society in the target state or to radicalise believers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loosely organised groups sharing the same ideology, which may be seeking to change society or ways of thinking in the target state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States, which may be seeking to disrupt the foreign policy of the target state or to destabilise the target state for strategic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic malign actors pose a challenge, especially in Southeast Asia, because it can be unclear where to draw the line between hostile action and legitimate political action, especially when viewed from a Western perspective of free speech and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition-information-operations-and-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Definition: Information Operations and ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To first examine foreign information operations, this research refers to the framework proposed in the 2022 S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) policy report, ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’. This framework is shown in Figure 1. In the figure, the actions encircled in green are generally acceptable to states, while those encircled in red are generally not acceptable to Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RSIS framework, ‘influence’ is the ability to shape the preferences of others using ‘information’ and/or ‘interference’. ‘Soft power’ is a well-accepted form of influence through appeal and attraction, which includes non-coercive means like culture, political values, foreign policies, public diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign aid, civic action, economic reconstruction and development, film, TV, books, and other media, economic ties, trade, business, and open ties with educational institutions and think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is another form of influence. Most Southeast Asian states accept information that spreads through open means, including media syndication (for example, foreign TV shows such as Game of Thrones are popular in Southeast Asia), media ownership (for example, foreign-owned TV channels such as CNN, Fox News, CCTV and CGTN are widely watched in Southeast Asia), open advertisement campaigns (for example, advertisements for foreign businesses like McDonalds are common in local Southeast Asian newspapers), op-eds where authorship is transparent (such as commentaries written by foreigners and published in local newspapers), and public statements (for example, by foreign diplomats or business leaders), with ‘hostile intent’ to disrupt their politics and policies deliberately, covertly and deceptively. For example, Singapore has described such actions as a ‘live and serious threat for Singapore’ and refers to them as ‘hostile information campaigns’ (HICs). This term is also used by some European scholars to describe Russian activities in hybrid warfare. There is no official or statutory definition in Singapore, but HICs usually describes covert or coordinated attempts by malign actors to penetrate different segments and levels of society to create and spread information that will manipulate public sentiment and harm national interests. This chapter uses the term ‘HICs’ to refer to information operations that are hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: RSIS Framework for Influence, Information and Interference.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/cens/cases-of-foreign-interference-in-asia/&quot;&gt;Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman et al., ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’, RSIS Policy Report, 26 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, p. 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Southeast Asian states will not tolerate ‘information operations’ that are undertaken Interference, as defined in the RSIS framework, is the other unacceptable means of influence exerted by malign actors, where the malign actor acts (with or without information operations) with hostile intent to disrupt the politics and policies of the target state deliberately, covertly and deceptively. These actions include covert funding (bribes) or coercion (blackmail) of politicians and political parties, government officials, influential people and business groups, NGOs and activists, academics, and educational institutions. Accusations of foreign interference in elections have been made in Malaysia and the Philippines, but lie beyond the scope of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These definitions, particularly the element of covert action to disrupt states, can be applied to several recent reports on China’s growing influence in Southeast Asian media, highlighting that China’s Xinhua News Agency has established content exchange deals with many Southeast Asian news services and that Chinese chambers of commerce have sponsored trips for journalists. These actions would not fall within the RSIS definition of HICs because they are public, not covert, and they seek to create a positive view of China, not to harm the target states. Southeast Asian states do not appear to be raising alarms over these actions and note that Western news agencies and businesses also do the same. However, if any malign actor were to carry out similar actions covertly, the response might be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-the-volume-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Measuring the Volume of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HICs can obscure themselves by employing different media and channels to address different segments of society. Sometimes the target state may detect unusual activity during times of tension between states, which the target state then attributes to HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when Singapore and Malaysia were disputing maritime and airspace issues in 2018, Singapore noticed a ‘curious spike’ in online comments critical of Singapore on social media, using anonymous accounts, and instances where ‘avatar accounts’ (that is, accounts whose profile photos do not show the user’s face) accounted for about 40% of comments on the social media pages of alternative media. While Singapore described this as an HIC, it did not attribute the action to any state. However, the minister for home affairs noted in Parliament in 2019 that when states are in conflict, one can use an HIC to destabilise the other. For the purposes of this chapter, these actions appear to constitute an HIC because they are covert and coordinated actions (anonymous accounts) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (turning Singaporean public sentiment against the country’s position on maritime and airspace rights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore considers HICs such a ‘live and serious threat’ that it convened a Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods in 2018, with public oral representations from 65 individuals and organisations. This event culminated in a 176-page report which found that Singapore ‘has been and will continue to be a target of hostile information campaigns’ which attack the country’s national security, racial harmony, democratic processes, social cohesion and trust in public institutions. Singapore has since passed legislation against deliberate online falsehoods (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act) and foreign interference (FICA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cases-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Cases of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various Southeast Asian states have detected, or at least strongly suspected, cases of HICs, there is no published research measuring the impact of these campaigns. There are no published datasets that contain data which is observable, replicable and verifiable. These criteria would be necessary for measuring impact, for example using a model like the Breakout Scale from Brookings, which measures impact based on whether information remains on one platform or travels across multiple platforms, and whether it remains in one community or is spread through many communities. However, this requires data-gathering and analytics capabilities that are either lacking in Southeast Asian states or are only available to state intelligence services and are kept classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a global issue, as empirical research on the impacts of such operations, such as altering beliefs, changing voting behaviour or inspiring political violence, is still limited and is focused on Western countries and their platforms. However, since some of the known studies show that targeted information operations can lead to increased political violence in settings of conflict or civil unrest, the threat posed by such operations cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed, especially in Southeast Asian states, to measure the impact of these operations. This will require funding, access to data, cross-disciplinary cooperation and, above all, the political will to drive these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the introduction of legislation against HICs, Singapore has highlighted several instances of information operations conducted by foreign malign actors. Some of these are decades old, and they do not involve China, Russia, Iran or North Korea, but, importantly, they do illustrate that Singapore does not welcome foreign interference from either east or west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1964, a Singaporean businessman received a substantial loan from high-ranking officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong to establish the Eastern Sun, an English-language daily newspaper in Singapore, giving these officials access to the press in Singapore. The businessman confessed and the paper closed with the resignation of the editorial staff. This fits the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (the loan was private) to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was fighting communism at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Singapore revoked the licence of the Singapore Herald for spreading misinformation to work up feelings against Singapore’s compulsory military service policy, and expelled three foreign journalists working for the newspaper. One of the paper’s primary investors was Donald Stephens, then Malaysian high commissioner to Australia. This also fits the definition of an HIC because it was a coordinated action to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was building its defence force at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hoover Institution report, China’s Influence and American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance, has observed that in 2016, when Singapore became ASEAN country coordinator, Chinese diplomats called on Singapore to manage ASEAN’s discussion on South China Sea issues, while messages began to appear on social media that appeared to ‘instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and to get Singaporeans – and not just Chinese Singaporeans – to pressure the government to align Singapore’s national interests with China’s interests’. These messages have not been attributed to any actor, but the report notes that they ‘resemble arguments made in the Chinese media, in particular the Global Times’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already mentioned is the more recent 2018 spike in social media comments critical of Singapore at a time when neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore were in the midst of maritime and airspace disputes. The comments covered not only maritime and airspace, but also traffic jams at land checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has also alleged HICs without using the same terminology, but the circumstances are murky. This section draws on the work of Gulizar Haciyakupoglu to analyse the allegations. In 2018, the government urged foreign press to stop circulating ‘fake news’ that might damage then-prime minister Najib Razak’s campaign for the 14th general election. The news reports alleged that millions of US dollars misappropriated from deposits in 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-owned investment fund, had gone into Najib’s personal account. However, a subsequent post-election criminal investigation of Najib has shown that the reports may have been accurate, and not an HIC. In any event, this does not exactly fit the definition of an HIC because the news stories were public and not covert or coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 2018 election campaign, leading politicians accused rival party members of inviting foreign interference or receiving foreign funding or support. Without substantiation or evidence, these appear to have been attempts at discrediting rivals and deflecting from real issues, rather than actual instances of foreign interference or HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is no real threat of foreign HICs in Malaysia. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) found that in the same election, Twitter bots (automated inauthentic accounts used to artificially inflate numbers of engagements online and manipulate public opinion) with Cyrillic names were responsible for two hashtag campaigns, #SayNOtoPH and #KalahkanPakatan (Defeat Pakatan). DFRLab suggested that the bots were generated by Russian-speaking ‘bot herders’ on behalf of the then-ruling National Front (Barisan Nasional) party or its supporters, so it remains in question whether the malign actors ultimately responsible for the campaign were foreign or domestic. In any event, this action could fit the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (by artificial accounts) to manipulate public sentiment, arguably against the interests of the target state (to keep an allegedly corrupt government in power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed two networks for violating its policy against ‘foreign or government interference’ that consists of ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (multiple fake accounts sharing similar information to manipulate public opinion). One of these networks originated from individuals in Fujian, China, and the other from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first network, with 155 accounts, 11 pages, nine groups and six Instagram accounts, originated in China and focused on the Philippines and Southeast Asia. It supported Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, then-president Rodrigo Duterte, and the potential run of Duterte’s daughter for the 2022 presidential election, and criticised Rappler, a media outlet that is a vocal opponent of the president. Graphika Labs analysed the dataset and noted that its other content reflected Chinese messaging on issues such as the Hong Kong protests, Taiwan’s independence and the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This campaign is interesting because it only spent $60 on advertising, it could not be conclusively attributed to a state actor and, importantly, it supported the ruling government and criticised its opponents. The target state would not be inclined to label this as an HIC because the action, although covert and coordinated (inauthentic accounts), was arguably not against the interests of the target state (nor the ruling government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second network of coordinated inauthentic behaviour originated in the Philippines and focused on domestic political issues for domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesia and Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malaysian and Philippines examples illustrate an inconvenient reality of information operations in Southeast Asia: domestic malign actors account for most of the reported cases, and in some cases governments are accused of being the sources of domestic disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of foreign interference or foreign information operations are used as election tactics to discredit rivals, or to suppress criticism of government policies and politicians, or to dismiss opposing views of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, observers have reported on ‘cyber troops’ (groups tasked with manipulating public opinion online on behalf of political parties or the government) that overlap with ideologically motivated groups and social media influencers supporting the same causes. The cyber troops’ activities include micro-targeting messages and ‘trolling’ (harassing) opponents and journalists. Both major opposing parties in the recent elections are reported to have employed ‘buzzers’ and ‘micro-celebrities’ to run multiple fake accounts to share political narratives for their respective parties. One information campaign in 2016 targeted the then governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (known as Ahok), and resulted in hundreds of thousands protesting on the streets of Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2020 Myanmar elections, politicians and the military are alleged to have spread rumours, misinformation and disinformation through social media, print media and word of mouth to target political opponents and minority groups. The extremist Ma Ba Tha movement is alleged to have used disinformation campaigns targeting the then-ruling National League for Democracy party, then-state counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, and Rohingya/Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came after the tragic inter-ethnic conflict in Myanmar in 2017, where the UN recognised that elements of the Myanmar army had committed genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Muslim Rohingya minority, fuelled in large part by hate speech and disinformation that had been spreading from at least 2014 to 2017 on Facebook, often through accounts and pages controlled by the Myanmar army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesia and Myanmar cases could be described as HICs because they were covert actions (fake accounts) or coordinated actions (pages controlled by the Myanmar army) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (inciting unrest or violence against certain groups), even though the malign actor may have been the ruling government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideological-groups&quot;&gt;Ideological Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asian states also face information operations from malign actors who are loosely organised but share a common ideology or belief that can be dangerous when it morphs into extremism. This includes Hindu extremists, Muslim extremists and Buddhist extremists, who spread hate speech through social media, leading to lynching and other forms of violence. It also includes ‘anti-vaxxers’ spreading Covid-19 misinformation during the pandemic, which is seriously undermining public health efforts in Southeast Asian states. The prominent anti-vaxxer groups in Southeast Asia appear to be domestic and not controlled by foreign malign actors, although they draw much of their material from foreign sources. Are these groups malign actors, victims of deception, ‘useful idiots’ or some combination thereof? Did they seek out the foreign information, or was it pushed to them? If a foreign state is responsible for creating or promoting Covid-19 misinformation in the first place (as Russia and China have both been accused of), does this make the foreign state ultimately responsible as the malign actor, even if the affected state was not a direct target? All these questions merit investigation and further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-countermeasures-and-reactions&quot;&gt;Government Countermeasures and Reactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countermeasures that governments in Southeast Asia have taken against information operations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting public education, digital literacy and critical thinking: Singapore has launched initiatives for students, young adults and senior citizens, such as the Better Internet Campaign (which aims to help students become responsible and ethical users of the internet) and the National Library Board’s SURE (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) programme (which trains individuals to identify fake news).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing legislation against spreading misinformation or disinformation: Singapore has passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA), and Malaysia passed the Anti-Fake News Act, though the latter was subsequently repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with social media platforms: YouTube has taken down videos containing false claims about vaccination by an anti-vaccination group based in Singapore called Healing the Divide. This action was praised by Singapore’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing clear communications, especially to counter falsehoods: Singapore health authorities use a multi-channel communication strategy to share Covid-19 information and policies, including press conferences by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, print media, TV, and dedicated Telegram channels and WhatsApp groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact-checking: The Singaporean and Malaysian governments do this with their Factually and Sebenarnya websites, respectively. The weakness of this approach is that people who believe in conspiracy theories are unlikely to believe government fact checks, and people generally may not trust fact checks that appear to be partisan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-legislation-as-a-countermeasure&quot;&gt;Focus on Legislation as a Countermeasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under POFMA, the government can issue ‘correction directions’ that require social media platforms to display correction notices to their users in Singapore, next to the information or post that is labelled as an online falsehood. Since the start of the global pandemic, Singapore has issued several correction directions under POFMA against Facebook, Twitter and media company SPH magazines over false claims about Covid-19. These corrections were generally welcomed by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the 2020 general election, the authorities issued correction directions about certain comments made by opposition politicians, some of which were critical of the government. This raised fears that POFMA was being used to silence criticism of the government. One scholar suggests that POFMA could diminish public trust in this way, citing the ruling government’s diminished performance in the 2020 general election as an indication of a fall in public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore also passed FICA in 2021, to prevent foreign entities from using HICs and local proxies (called ‘politically significant persons’ in the Act) to interfere in Singapore’s politics, including acts of foreign interference ‘by covert means using electronic communications’. The minister for law clarified in Parliament that FICA did not apply to Singaporeans acting of their own accord, foreigners who made open, attributable comments, or foreign political observers and commentators. Rather, it would cover instances where a foreign state (or its proxies) covertly offers a local politician or journalist incentives to influence what they say in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that some other Southeast Asian governments are less likely to use legislation against disinformation campaigns since Malaysia repealed its Anti-Fake News Act in 2018 and the Philippines did not pass its proposed law against fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, laws against disinformation or fake news are clearly being used by other Southeast Asian governments, such as Vietnam’s Cyber Security Law (which covers false information on social media) and Indonesia’s Information and Electronic Transactions Act. Prosecutions have been made in Thailand and Indonesia for allegedly spreading false information about Covid-19, and even in Malaysia, a journalist has been arrested for her social media posts on the subject. The speed of these actions and gaps in government accountability have raised fears from local critics and Western observers that Southeast Asian governments might use the pandemic as an excuse to suppress unfavourable content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-as-the-threat-actor&quot;&gt;Government as the Threat Actor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments in Southeast Asia have a special dilemma in responding to information operations, because they are often accused of being perpetrators in the first place, as discussed above. Existing legislation is seen as already infringing on freedom of expression, and government actions are seen as another way to suppress dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, the burden has fallen on non-governmental fact-checking efforts instead, such as the Thai News Agency’s Sure and Share Center and Indonesia’s Fakta atau Hoax (Fact or Hoax) and Mafindo projects. In Myanmar, civil society organisations such Panzagar, Myanmar ICT for Development Organisation, the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network and Phandeeyar work to mitigate social media risks, running anti-hate speech campaigns and fact-checking propaganda emails. In the Philippines, the Rappler media organisation reports on the spread of government propaganda on social media, as well as misogyny, human rights violations, and corruption in government. In response, the government has accused Rappler and its editor, Nobel Prize laureate Maria Ressa, of spreading disinformation and has levied criminal charges, including a conviction for cyber libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this brief survey of information operations in Southeast Asia, it can be seen that hostile actions can be carried out by domestic entities, including political parties and even the ruling government, with no discernible support from overseas. While the impact on the public is no less negative – polarisation, mutual distrust, spread of dangerous false information – the domestic source makes countermeasures difficult, especially where the government is suspected of using such measures to stifle legitimate free speech, or where trust in government is already low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive set of countermeasures must then come from a whole-of-society effort, since Southeast Asian governments cannot provide them alone. Journalists, fact-checkers, NGOs, educators, governments, social media platforms, influential persons and ordinary citizens all have different parts to play. At the same time, however, these entities may be contesting each other for the information space or may have opposing ideas of what information is acceptable or not. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to put aside their differences and cooperate enough to counter the hostile information operations coming from malign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Javad Heydarian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Canberra announced the scrapping of its conventional submarine deal with France upon the announcement of the AUKUS (Australia–UK–US) security partnership, there was predictable outrage in Paris and, by extension, across the EU. However, arguably the most bizarre response to the AUKUS deal came from the least expected quarters. In theory, Southeast Asian countries should have welcomed the enhancement of a US-led ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy against China. ASEAN has proven largely ineffectual in constraining Chinese coercion in the South China Sea, for example, where Beijing has rapidly expanded its military and paramilitary footprint. Southeast Asian states would be beneficiaries of a more proactive Australian defence role across the Indo-Pacific, and any Australian nuclear-powered submarine would almost certainly be deployed to the South China Sea under the auspices of AUKUS in the coming decades. Yet, shortly after the AUKUS announcement, key ASEAN members turned into vocal naysayers, largely echoing Beijing’s narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s largest country, Indonesia, quickly stated that it was ‘deeply concerned over the continuing arms race and power projection in the region’ without mentioning China’s rapidly expanding naval presence in the area, well into Indonesia’s waters in the North Natuna Sea. Malaysia, recently at the receiving end of Chinese harassment within its exclusive economic zones in the southern portions of the South China Sea, turned the whole affair into a test of loyalty to Beijing. Kuala Lumpur accused the AUKUS alliance of stoking tensions by ‘openly regard[ing] China as a possible enemy’. Malaysia’s defence minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, during a parliamentary inquiry, announced a surprise short working trip to Beijing in order to understand Beijing’s views on AUKUS. Vietnam and Singapore made largely oblique statements, falling short of an open endorsement. Responses from US treaty allies in the region were far from reassuring; having tilted closer to China in recent years, Thailand, for example, proved unreliable, and in the Philippines, there were contradicting messages from then-president Rodrigo Duterte and his foreign secretary, Teodoro Locsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acrimony over AUKUS has revealed three important characteristics of Southeast Asian states. First, the episode laid bare long-simmering geopolitical fault lines in Southeast Asia amid continuing Sino-American rivalry. Regional states have very divergent threat perceptions, including what represents a ‘hostile’ foreign state actor. Most Southeast Asian countries, with the possible exceptions of Vietnam and the Philippines, do not openly describe China’s expanding military capabilities as a national security threat. Neither is Russia seen as a national security threat – in fact, Russia has become the largest arms supplier to the region amid burgeoning strategic and defence ties with not only traditional partners such as Vietnam and Myanmar, but also Indonesia, Malaysia and potentially even the Philippines. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Singapore was the only regional state to impose sanctions on Moscow; the key regional states of Vietnam and the Philippines even expressed their commitment to maintaining robust defence ties with Moscow amid a new barrage of Western sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent warnings by regional commentators, hardly a single Southeast Asian country has officially identified Russia or China as a potential source of foreign interference, including during regular elections across the region. In fact, democratic countries such as the Philippines have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of local journalists, especially those from state-affiliated media and non-mainstream outlets, as well as influencers, especially those accused of buttressing pro-government ‘troll farms’, receiving ‘training’ during official visits to Beijing or Moscow. In 2017, party-to-party cooperation also took place between the then-ruling party in the Philippines (Partido Demokratiko Pilipino – Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban)) and its counterparts in Russia and China. The party has also signed a cooperation agreement with North Korea’s Workers’ Party of Korea. Southeast Asian countries, notwithstanding their compliance with relevant UN-backed sanctions against Pyongyang, have continued engagement with North Korea despite the assassination of Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asian countries where religious extremism is a major concern, security experts and military officials appear to be preoccupied with the influence of US partners such as Saudi Arabia. Notwithstanding outbursts of sectarianism in neighbouring (Sunni-majority) Malaysia and Indonesia, especially against Muslim minority groups, both Southeast Asian countries have maintained largely constructive relations with Shia-majority Iran throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS has revealed the reluctance of regional states to directly criticise China. No ASEAN member has dared to criticise Beijing for its recent alleged hypersonic missile tests, expanding stockpile of nuclear warheads, and growing fleet of nuclear submarines. Furthermore, AUKUS has exposed deficiencies in coherent strategic thinking, institutional strength and political conviction among key Southeast Asian states. In the Philippines, the Duterte administration struggled to form a single position, as multiple top officials adopted radically divergent positions on AUKUS. It is precisely the brittleness of governance structures across the region, with the notable exceptions of Singapore and Vietnam, that has made Southeast Asia particularly vulnerable to foreign corrosive influence and political co-optation. Winston Churchill once described Italy as the ‘soft underbelly’ of the axis powers. The same can be said about key US partners across Southeast Asia, which have openly courted warmer relations with authoritarian powers, namely China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;varieties-of-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Varieties of Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of vulnerabilities to malign interference from external actors, Southeast Asia falls across a relatively wide spectrum. After all, regional states have differential agency in terms of insulating their core political institutions from predatory interference. Southeast Asia is a region of immense geopolitical potential and economic dynamism; it is also arguably the world’s most diverse region in terms of levels of economic development and types of government and political regimes, as well as population size and territorial expanse. The core Southeast Asian states – the ‘ASEAN-6’ countries – have consistently enjoyed relatively high rankings in various international competitiveness indices. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015, for instance, Singapore ranked second in the world, with Malaysia (20th), Thailand (31st), Indonesia (34th), the Philippines (52nd) and Vietnam (68th) performing relatively well among 144 countries. The ASEAN-6 were also among the more competitive nations in the Global Innovation Index 2020, where Singapore ranked eighth among 131 countries, followed by Malaysia (33rd), Vietnam (42nd), Thailand (44th) and the Philippines (50th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This economic dynamism, however, obfuscates institutional vulnerabilities across much of the region. A cursory look at key indicators of governance reveals unaccountable governance, corruption, weak institutional checks and balances, and democratic deficit. Southeast Asian states universally rank poorly in various indices such as the Press Freedom Index, Freedom House’s Freedom in the World reports, the Democracy Index and, with the notable exception of Singapore, Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. Not one ASEAN country is considered to be a ‘fully deepened’ democracy by experts, with Indonesia, which enjoys the region’s freest political regime, classified as a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Democracy Index and as ‘partly free’ by Freedom House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, only Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines can be classified as ‘minimalist-procedural’ democracies, given their record of relatively competitive elections in recent years. But even when a more relativistic ‘varieties of democracy’ approach is adopted, all three countries rank poorly in terms of press freedom, corruption and robustness of institutional checks and balances. In both the Philippines and Indonesia, meanwhile, patterns of authoritarian populism and patronage politics have persisted in recent years, further eroding the institutional foundations of ASEAN’s fledgling democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually and politically, the line between (legitimate) influence and malign interference is often unclear and hard to pin down. In practice, vectors of influence comprise grey-zone tactics providing plausible deniability to malign actors as well as their overseas clients. Thus, this chapter focuses in particular on what political scientist Christopher Walker has described as ‘sharp power’: a unique attribute of authoritarian superpowers, which seek to project their influence internationally, with the objectives of limiting free expression, spreading confusion and distorting the political environment within democracies. Beyond targeting fledgling and established democracies, authoritarian superpowers can deploy a variety of means – from bribery to intimidation and disinformation – to co-opt and corrode vectors of power and decision-making in target countries, including spheres of mainstream as well as social media, civil society, and the broader business community, in addition to state institutions, political figures and political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oycOfMW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Vulnerability to Sharp Power in ASEAN Countries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Joseph Nye argues, ‘Beijing and Moscow have spent tens of billions of dollars to shape public perceptions and behaviour around the world’ through the systematic deployment of ‘tools new and old that exploit the asymmetry of openness between their own restrictive systems and democratic societies’. In particular, sharp power can come in the form of ‘the deceptive use of information for hostile purposes’, harking back to the Cold War era of ‘manipulation of ideas, political perceptions, and electoral processes’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess vulnerability to sharp power as a form of foreign interference by overseas actors, Southeast Asian countries can be divided along two axes: vulnerability based on the level of strategic autonomy and institutional checks and balances (against corruption and co-optation); and geopolitical relevance (to foreign actors). Thus, Southeast Asian nations can be roughly classified into four types: low-to-medium geopolitical relevance with high vulnerability (Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia); high geopolitical relevance with low vulnerability (Vietnam and Singapore); medium geopolitical relevance and medium vulnerability (Thailand and Brunei); and high geopolitical relevance and medium-to-high vulnerability (Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asean-vulnerability-to-sharp-power-and-foreign-state-actors&quot;&gt;ASEAN Vulnerability to Sharp Power and Foreign State Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vulnerability to malign foreign interference, some countries are more equal than others. Regionally, Singapore has proactively pushed back against suspected interference operations by China. One big area of concern for Singapore, which has developed robust defence cooperation with the US and other major Western powers in recent years, is the potential emergence of a pro-Beijing ‘fifth column’ in the Chinese-majority city state. China set off alarm bells when its Overseas Chinese Affairs Office was incorporated into the United Front Work Department, thus raising concerns over more active efforts by Beijing to co-opt communities of Chinese descent overseas. As veteran Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan openly warned at a public conference in 2018, ‘[the] very point of [the ongoing] United Front work is to blur the distinction between the domestic and international and promote the [Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]’s interests wherever it may be, domestic or international’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, China maintains a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbouring countries. However, President Xi Jinping effectively contradicted that position when he began blurring the distinction between huaren (ethnic Chinese of all nationalities) and huaqiao (overseas Chinese citizens) by declaring that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the joint efforts of the Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad. In effect, Xi has embraced 60 million huaqiao, many of whom are spread across the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as demographic extensions of a greater China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Singaporean universities have had the highest level of research and academic collaboration with Chinese counterparts affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) compared to any other country in the region. Meanwhile, a study by the Jamestown Foundation has found that China has used seemingly innocuous front organisations, including business groups, for disinformation campaigns, including the narrative of a ‘greater China’, which is extremely sensitive in a city state where three-quarters of the population is of Chinese ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore has responded to sharp power and foreign interference threats in a variety of ways. Intent on reiterating its ‘Chinese’ identity distinct from that of China, the country went as far as to build the $110-million Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, which serves as a clear rejection of Xi’s vision. It has also crafted strict regulations for social media platforms. In a national statement at the adoption of its third Universal Periodic Review in 2021, Singapore’s permanent representative to the UN Office in Geneva described such measures as a matter of national security: ‘Our concern lies with the use of coordinated, deceptive methods by hostile foreign actors to manipulate our political discourse and disrupt our society.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has staked its legitimacy on resisting Chinese influence in addition to providing stability and economic growth, and has had a proactive approach to mitigating interference by hostile foreign actors. Vietnam has consciously tried to minimise its institutional linkages and webs of interdependence with China, including in the realm of higher education. Vietnam’s national security doctrine and its trade–industrial policy are primarily shaped by an abiding commitment to reducing dependence on and vulnerability to China. The same cannot be said about three other, highly geopolitically relevant Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia may find the stricter measures adopted by Singapore and Vietnam problematic for their own political systems. Even the historically authoritarian Malaysia, which adopted a more liberal direction following the game-changing 2018 elections, had to amend its notorious Internal Security Act in 2012. Former Malaysian prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin also promised to amend the successor Prevention of Crime Act 1959 and the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 to further reduce abuses by security officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although far from champions of democracy and press freedom, contemporary governments in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are bound to face both institutional and public resistance should they adopt strict regulation of the media landscape as do Singapore or Vietnam. All three countries also lack the nimble state security apparatus and surveillance regimes that undergird public governance in proactive Southeast Asian states such as Singapore and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are vulnerable to manipulation and corrosive influence from hostile foreign actors on multiple levels. Specifically, sharp power operations in these key Southeast Asian countries function along three vectors: social media, influencers and disinformation; corrosive capital; and leadership targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-influencers-and-disinformation&quot;&gt;Social Media, Influencers and Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three countries, but especially in the Philippines, social media platforms have increasingly transmogrified into vast pools of disinformation. As Ressa warned years ago, Facebook, in particular, has rapidly turned into the unwitting enabler of authoritarian populists, far-right revisionists and conspiracy theorists, with devastating impacts on public discourse and democratic politics. Over the past five years, certain ‘bloggers’ and social media influencers, some with millions of followers, have emerged as the primary arbiters of political discourse in places such as the Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines has become a global ‘troll farm’ hub, as elements within the country’s massive business process outsourcing industry as well as advertising agencies join the lucrative trade in political disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to political co-optation and influence operations, two particularly troubling patterns have emerged. First, major influencers have become a conduit for state-backed propaganda, both domestic and foreign. During the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, multiple high-profile influencers and bloggers began spreading and reinforcing the Chinese embassy’s talking points in the Philippines. A similar pattern has emerged with respect to other contentious issues, including China’s claims in the South China Sea and the insurrection in Hong Kong. At times, it has become difficult to distinguish between the key arguments of political bloggers, who have a very limited grasp of international law, and the narratives of senior diplomats and officials from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, social media platforms, especially Facebook, publicly flagged up to 150 China-based accounts in 2020, which were allegedly engaged in ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’, including hosting fake accounts that pushed for the victory of a specific China-leaning ticket in the 2022 presidential elections in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second vector of sharp power is corrosive capital, which has a significant impact on already fragile government institutions in host countries. Unlike legitimate business, corrosive capital serves the specific geopolitical ends of hostile foreign actors. One potential conduit for foreign interference activities, therefore, is through ostensibly ‘private’ investments, especially in sectors that are highly prone to illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Philippines’ Beijing-friendly former president Rodrigo Duterte, for instance, there was a boom in online Chinese-run casinos, officially known as Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). Despite Duterte’s supposed opposition to the gambling industry, the Philippines’ licensing fees topped $150 million in 2019, with total revenues reaching $4 billion. The industry, however, is plagued by reports of institutionalised bribery, widespread tax evasion, human and drug trafficking, money laundering and even kidnapping in recent years. On multiple occasions, Duterte has rejected calls by Chinese authorities to ban the POGOs due to their association with the criminal underworld and their negative effect on anti-gambling regulations in mainland China. Since the Philippine authorities themselves admit that POGOs are notorious perpetrators of tax evasion, critics claim that top government officials are likely the personal beneficiaries of illicit transactions with the Chinese operators. The problem is even more severe in places such as Cambodia, northern regions of Laos, and Myanmar’s porous borders with China, where mainlander criminal gangs effectively run whole towns, if not sub-regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, concern over online casinos also has direct and serious national security implications. For instance, Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former general and head of the Philippine Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, has warned that, drawing on military intelligence sources, up to 3,000 members of the PLA could be embedded among Chinese POGOs as part of a large-scale ‘immersion mission’. During a shootout incident between two Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in POGOs, a PLA military ID was reportedly discovered by Philippine authorities. Senator Richard Gordon, meanwhile, has warned of ‘infiltration’ by Chinese security agencies, claiming that POGOs have been involved in suspicious transactions valuing up to $150 million, part of which may have been used to fund ‘fifth column’ operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even former national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon and former defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana have warned of potential interference activities among Chinese POGO workers clustered around sensitive locations such as military installations, including Camp Aguinaldo, which hosts Department of National Defense offices and the Philippine Army; the Philippine National Police headquarters at Camp Crame; and the Philippine Air Force and Navy headquarters. As Lorenzana put it, ‘When you already see many people [at the POGOs], who are always there … it’s very easy for all these [Chinese] people to perhaps shift their activities to spying’, since ‘[the POGOs] are near [military facilities]’. The seamless expansion of POGOs, and their clustering around key military bases in Metro Manila, has raised concerns over either lack of proper oversight or, worse, co-optation of key agencies in charge of ensuring that the Chinese online casinos do not pose a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership Targeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and potentially most problematic, vector of sharp power is interference operations targeting top decision-makers, either directly or via their proxies. Traditionally, co-optation can take place through large-scale bribery, especially during elections, or kompromat (extortion through compromising material). Less well-resourced hostile foreign actors may adopt more surgical measures which directly target key decision-makers, but for wealthier hostile foreign actors, co-optation can take place through seemingly legitimate and mutually beneficial agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to China’s BRI, much has been written about the potential for ‘debt trap’ – drowning host countries in unsustainable debt amid corrupt infrastructure deals. But the potentially corrosive impact of big-ticket infrastructure projects is far more subtle and multifarious, especially in larger and more advanced Southeast Asian economies. In places such as Laos or Cambodia, for instance, China has managed to achieve decisive influence by becoming the dominant source of investments and aid by far, thus consolidating Beijing’s ability to shape the strategic policies of these smaller Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines and Indonesia, the picture is far more complicated. On the one hand, there is the risk of ‘pledge trap’ – luring elected leaders in key Southeast Asian countries through pledges of (rather than realised) large-scale investments, which tend to generate positive headlines at home. In the Philippines, Duterte adopted a largely obsequious position on the South China Sea disputes in exchange for (still unrealised) Chinese investment pledges. Until recently, in Indonesia, President Joko Widodo adopted strategic patience regarding maritime disputes with China and, crucially, tried to water down good governance regulations and de-fang anti-corruption agencies to expedite infrastructure development. Even more dramatic is the case of Malaysia, where former prime minister Najib Razak largely relied on large-scale Chinese capital and investments to boost the country’s finances and his flailing political career amid the massive 1MDB corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostile foreign powers can also influence host countries by cultivating strong relations with key interlocutors or officials in charge of important state agencies. Over the past few years, China has backed large economic projects in Indonesia. Some experts have noted the potential role played by key officials in facilitating these projects and greater bilateral economic ties, although others point towards greater agency and directives of government in attracting, in the case of Indonesia, foreign direct investment from a range of countries, including China. Similar questions have been raised with regard to the sudden mushrooming of Chinese private and public investment initiatives across strategic locations such as Subic, Clark, Sangley and Palawan in the Philippines – areas that are close to key naval and air-force facilities that face the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells were also raised when a former top Filipino general, who would later move to Duterte’s cabinet, allowed a China Telecom-backed and equipped company, Dito Telecommunity, which is owned by Uy, to install communications infrastructure within Philippine bases. The US had earlier warned that such activities could jeopardise bilateral intelligence and defence cooperation. Ultimately, however, one of the biggest concerns in fragile democracies such as the Philippines and Indonesia is the emergence of ‘Manchurian candidates’ during vital elections, including for the presidency, thanks to the high cost of election campaigns, minimal supervision over election financing, and limited ability to monitor and deter disinformation efforts by hostile foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Southeast Asian countries fall along a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities, depending on their institutional coherence, geopolitical relevance and political regimes. While all have equally been targets of malign foreign interference, some have exercised more agency and institutional resilience than others. Regional states tend to also have diverse, and at times divergent, threat perceptions regarding authoritarian superpowers. What is clear is that hostile foreign actors can and have deployed a variety of tools to exploit a wide range of vulnerabilities across key Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, any nuanced policy response, either by targeted nations or in tandem with like-minded allies and external powers, should balance comprehensiveness in addressing a full range of vulnerabilities with targeted measures. Targeted responses include timely interventions and policy countermeasures against the most nefarious vectors of malign interference by hostile foreign actors. This is an indispensable step towards enhancing the overall resilience of pivotal Southeast Asian countries, especially amid the intensified assertiveness of authoritarian powers in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states given their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the threat of hostile interference should be addressed on four important fronts. The first is to spotlight the issue through raising public awareness, mobilising civil society groups and enhancing multilateral information sharing on malign foreign influence. In extreme cases, independent international inquiry, if not sanctions, against compromised political figures can also be considered. Second, states should pursue capacity-building efforts through providing technical assistance to and enhancing the mandate of key government agencies tasked with countering interference operations. Third, regulation plays an important role in countering political interference and should focus on tightening legislation against and lawful surveillance of foreign-backed disinformation campaigns. Finally, alternative approaches could include the establishment of bilateral, minilateral and multilateral cooperative mechanisms by like-minded international partners to reduce Southeast Asian countries’ dependence on critical infrastructure investment from malign foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-economic-activity-chinese-high-speed-rail-projects-in-laos-thailand-and-malaysia&quot;&gt;Malign Economic Activity: Chinese High-Speed Rail Projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan Clarke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign economic activity is distinct from traditional forms of commerce, investment and capital market activity in that commercial considerations, such as project viability or investment return schedules, represent only secondary considerations. Malign economic activity often still seeks profit, but simultaneously can meet broader strategic goals or geopolitical intent to the detriment of the targeted country or organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is a significant economic actor in Southeast Asia through its BRI, with the high-speed rail projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia highly visible examples. While not problematic in and of themselves, these three case studies provide rich examples of how such economic investments can carry unanticipated consequences to varying extents, such as elite capture, debt structures and the opportunity to exert influence over key national transportation infrastructure or leverage it for other strategic and political ends, as well as engage in corrupt activities that weaken good governance. In very extreme cases foreign states could acquire infrastructure assets, although this has proven so far to rarely occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of Chinese infrastructure investment is complicated by the complexity of the Chinese system, in which BRI investments can be directed from the central government by provincial governments, state-owned banks, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or even private companies. The almost ubiquitous presence of the CCP across industries and sectors in China, as well as questions of the Chinese government’s ultimate ambition for regional influence and power, means that commercial projects may carry strategic opportunities for the Chinese government or may indirectly be guided by it. Chinese SOEs are subject to the vagaries of global market competition but can ultimately serve as tools of the CCP with regard to geo-economic gambits such as the BRI or where the party deems that its geopolitical core interests are being challenged. The management of Chinese SOEs since 2012 has seen a transformation towards a ‘modern state-owned enterprise system with Chinese characteristics’, in which Party leadership is institutionalised through Party groups and Party committees who to varying extents can appoint senior management and participate in setting the company’s strategic direction. This morphing of the Party with the business also counts to a certain extent for joint ventures, particularly if it employs three or more Party members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bri-infrastructure-projects-with-strategic-intent&quot;&gt;BRI Infrastructure: Projects with Strategic Intent?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial number of BRI projects are concentrated around China’s Asian periphery, especially in Southeast Asia. As a 2021 AidData study of over 13,000 BRI projects shows, some include loan structures that exceed a country’s financial ability for repayment, leading to unforeseen debt or the prospect of commercial non-viability. A March 2018 Centre for Global Development policy paper asserted that eight BRI signatory countries were at high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans and were facing debt-to-GDP ratios beyond 50%, with 40% of external debt owed to China. This is not necessarily due to Chinese government-instructed deception or ‘obfuscation traps’. Nevertheless, what appears to be a strategy of co-optation of elites through opaque means is problematic in that it carries the potential to create a politically favourable environment in which potential Chinese government interests can be more easily pursued. A further consideration to bear in mind when considering Chinese infrastructure investment is that in smaller, less developed countries, Chinese investments and aid can surpass those of other actors, affording it a more visible presence and greater political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BRI is unique in its size (roughly $47 billion allocated, based on the most recent available data of 2020), its geographic scope (covering 138 countries) and its strategic ambition. A 2020 Council on Foreign Relations report quoted investment bank Morgan Stanley’s prediction that China’s overall BRI spending could reach $1.2–$1.3 trillion by 2027. While the exact figures remain contested, the BRI likely exceeds any competing efforts by other non-democratic states such as North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia or Russia, either in the Asia-Pacific or globally, in terms of human and material resources, capital, and market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Versus Indebtedness: The New Laos–China High-Speed Railway and Hambantota Port&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early December 2021, Laos launched a 414-km electrified high-speed railway running between the capital Vientiane and the town of Boten on the Laos–China border. Travelling to the Chinese border now takes less than four hours, compared to 15 hours by car, and costs $33 for a second-class seat. The line heads 600 km north to the capital of China’s Yunnan province, Kunming, linking the landlocked mountainous country of Laos to China’s key southwestern BRI hub. This $6-billion project (equivalent to one-third of Laos’ GDP) is backed by China as part of its BRI and is described as a lynchpin of deepening ties between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was marketed as a transformative opportunity for Laos to gain access to the Chinese market for agricultural and other exports while also developing a domestic tourism sector to accommodate Chinese travellers. Key details of the deal have not been made public, and no substantial degree of transparency is likely to be witnessed in the future. There have also been no open source discussions within Laos, in English or Laotian, regarding the overall cost-benefit ratio of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the China–Laos high-speed rail project is not a Chinese equity investment, grant or any other structure that would generate high-value jobs or the positive diffusion of benefits that are traditionally associated with CNI projects. This project’s loan structure suggests that it is deliberately designed to extract maximum financial benefit from Laos while also simultaneously undermining Vientiane’s already fragile sovereignty. While there are some differences, the China–Laos railway includes key elements from China’s now-infamous Hambantota Port project in Sri Lanka, which ultimately saw China take control after the Sri Lankan government defaulted on high-interest loans. Various studies and commentaries have debated the Sri Lankan case. Some have shown that the Sri Lankan government bears a great degree of responsibility for the loans it agreed with China and that domestic agency should be given greater consideration in the assessment of whether China is at fault for the state of Sri Lanka’s economic collapse. Ultimately, both sides likely played a part – indeed, interviews with experts in the financial sector have highlighted some problematic aspects of China’s engagement on negotiating these deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee indicated that the Chinese SOEs and funders may view the Hambantota Port as a successful deal, of which elements could be replicated in other key countries, such as in Southeast Asia. Chinese lending banks have demonstrated a high level of investment in developing least-developed countries that have found it challenging to access funding from other sources such as other governments and international capital markets, and have high structural unemployment rates. For countries like Sri Lanka and Laos, China thus offers a source of funding for infrastructure when financing cannot be accessed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one report, the average loan from an official Chinese creditor carries an interest rate of over 4% with an average repayment period of less than 10 years, while the average of an OECD creditor carries an interest rate of on average 1% and an average repayment period of 28 years. According to one interviewee in the financial sector, the high interest rates are positioned as the ‘price’ for the Chinese developer deploying its end-to-end capabilities to the country in question, while other experts note that China is successful in demanding higher interest rates due to its willingness to take on risks that other lenders will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond high interest loans, there are also concerns around corruption and bribery in BRI projects, owing not least to a lack of transparency in the infrastructure project agreements. Two financial industry executives interviewed made reference to seemingly corrupt business practices involving obfuscated financial incentivisation in some BRI projects, while a third financial industry executive noted preferential treatment in the formation of holding companies and other corporate vehicles. However, publicly available information remains scarce and requires further investigation. If true, such practices would be deeply problematic and further add to the concerns over the lack of transparency of BRI projects and impact on good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are concerns that these problematic practices have been replicated in other BRI projects since, including for example in the case of Laos. According to a financial industry executive based in the region, specific state-owned banking executives were brought back in to structure and execute the railway deal. These bank personnel were advised to replicate their previously successful deal elements while also ‘learning from previous mistakes’. The concern is therefore that, given the opacity of these deals, China may have the option to exert sovereign control over the Laos–China railway and any other land- or rail-related facilities included in the final agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand: Failure to Replicate and Strategic Pushback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand was offered similar high interest rates as Laos had in 2016 for the extension of its high-speed railway from Laos to Bangkok. The Chinese terms of high interest rates, development rights along and on either side of the railway, as well as the right to work for Chinese engineers in Thailand were rejected by the State Railway of Thailand and Ministry of Finance and caused widespread offence across Thai leadership and corporate circles as they were interpreted as China viewing Thailand and Laos as undifferentiated and subservient countries to China, with then Thai Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisth remarking in 2016 that ‘Thailand is not the same as Laos’. While the Thai government still maintains an interest in developing high-speed rail within Thailand and regionally, one interviewee suggested that the Thai government has begun to multi-source for potential alternative partners to avoid being too dependent on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one regionally based investigative journalist, Thailand’s search for balance could have further downstream impacts on Chinese investment projects, such as the Chinese-proposed arms manufacturing facility in Udon Thani, of which there have been few updates since its announcement in 2017, and a naval shipyard in Sattahip, both of which would be co-located with facilities that are used by US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Thailand is seeking to strike a balance, and choosing sides between the two major powers is not an appealing policy option, as is the case for other Southeast Asian states, Thailand has its own complicated history with the US following the 2014 coup and concerns over democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China–Laos high-speed rail project has also further accelerated awareness and concerns regarding a range of activities by the CCP’s United Front in Thailand. The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), an organ directly subordinate to the CCP Central Committee, focuses its work on targeting governments, including in Southeast Asia, to exert political and economic influence and sometimes malign interference. In particular, there is now an enhanced focus on and investigation into United Front-funded Confucius Institutes in Thailand, specifically regarding why there are more of these institutes in Thailand than in the rest of Southeast Asia combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources have noted that Thailand’s US treaty ally status is what is likely driving the CCP’s strong focus and multifaceted approach in both the economic and information domains. Indeed, this could be seen as a part of a wider attempt to weaken the US hub-and-spoke alliance system in Asia, which Beijing views with suspicion as part of a US attempt to exert ‘all-round containment’ of China, as foreign minister Wang Yi has termed it, notwithstanding Thailand’s own objectives in its relationship with China and the US. Thailand could therefore present an opportunity for undue influence and interference through, for example, elite capture within a key American ally in Asia by using high-speed rail under the BRI front. 169 However, the problematic nature of China’s dealings in both Laos and Sri Lanka, combined with Beijing’s offensive offer to Thailand, appears to have undermined these efforts, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaysia’s East Coast Rail Link Project: BRI-Driven Strategic Envelopment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese funds were a core component of the 1MBD scandal, as has been demonstrated over the course of the multiple investigations and successful prosecutions of a range of individuals who were involved. Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and a select group of individuals around him had effectively bankrupted the publicly financed 1MBD national development fund through a range of corrupt activities, most of which occurred outside Malaysia. As the scale and scope of these activities expanded to a level where they could no longer be hidden, particularly when in 2015 1MDb missed a loan repayment of around US $550 million, the government of Malaysia was pressured to set up a special taskforce to investigate why and the United States Department of Justice files a civil suit in 2016. Some sources note that Najib received an offer from China to recapitalise the drained 1MDB account to cover up his previous activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for this, Najib allegedly granted Chinese SOEs privileged rights and access to a range of existing Malaysian port, energy and other infrastructure assets. Leading real-estate industry analysts noted that Chinese property developers were also given prime real estate at highly discounted rates in the southernmost Malaysian state of Johor, directly across from Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Malaysia’s parliamentary form of government and reasonably open press, information regarding these events became widespread and prompted outrage across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with these developments, Najib claimed he was misled by financial advisers. While some analysts have attributed this to his lack of perceptiveness, others question whether he felt bolstered by the alleged Chinese backing. It is noteworthy that one of the key conspirators in the 1MBD corruption scandal, Malaysian citizen Jho Low, continues to reside in China despite being wanted by the Malaysian government for questioning while also being subject to an Interpol Red Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Najib had not counted on was former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad coming out of a long retirement to run for the post again. According to one executive interviewed, this development also represented an intelligence failure on the Chinese investors’ side, as Mahathir was assessed to be a senior adviser and retired statesman but not someone who would actively seek office again. Sources note that Mahathir’s re-election in 2018 caused distress among Malaysian and Chinese investors involved in the infrastructure deals and 1MDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese BRI-driven activity in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia indicates that Chinese actors, ranging from state-owned companies to state-owned banks, and by association the Chinese government, have leveraged BRI high-speed rail projects for economic gain through a range of corrupt and predatory activities. To a certain extent, strategic leverage appears to have been sought through elite capture in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government and affiliated SOEs are likely to pursue further BRI engagements in Malaysia, Thailand, Laos and other key Southeast Asian countries through continued pursuit of BRI projects and positive incentives, with potential negative consequences for good governance at the national level if transparency and scrutiny are lacking. However, there is also the potential for resistance, especially in countries that have electoral politics and somewhat free media and information environments. Malaysia presents a clear case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation should be conducted on whether cyber operations have increased in existing target countries that have proven resistant, such as Malaysia and Thailand. This would help shine a light on whether a range of both incentives and coercive measures are used in target countries, and could indicate a more concerted state-led effort on the part of the Chinese state, and lend greater credit to the idea that some BRI projects are not simply commercial engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-findings-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has examined the debate on influence versus malign interference in Southeast Asia and has outlined some case study examples of interference in the region that highlight the modus operandi of authoritarian regimes, particularly China, in the economic, political and information domains. It has also explored the question of whether governments in the region have implemented or strengthened risk mitigation strategies as a result of interference within their borders. This chapter highlights four broad trends that can be seen throughout the case studies and the regional overview, and offers concluding policy recommendations for the UK and its partners with regard to strengthening national resilience in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interpretations of Malign States and Hostile Activity Differ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen throughout the various case studies, countries in Southeast Asia differ in their interpretation of what constitutes a hostile action. There is overarching agreement that interference is different from influence, which is defined as soft power. More menacing is covert interference in a state’s sovereignty and decision-making, although the extent to which actions are viewed as interference versus influence is not aligned across the region. The case studies have shown that deep links between political elites, ethnic demographics and vulnerabilities in institutional resilience through, for example, corruption, complicate how states respond to foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So too are there differences on the question of which states are considered to be engaging in ‘malign’ behaviour. The geographic and demographic particularities and close bilateral partnerships of specific Southeast Asian states shape the prism through which foreign countries are viewed. This is not unsurprising or unreasonable – for European countries and close liberal democratic partners more generally, the staunch differences in foreign and domestic policy of countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea and China pose direct and indirect challenges to European perspectives of the rules-based international order and the principles upon which it is built. The geographical proximity of Russia and Iran, for example, poses a direct danger to European security in the continent’s own territory or its periphery. This distinction is not as stark in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the concept of a state with ‘malign intent’ is viewed somewhat differently, with examples focusing more on challenging behaviour than intent, due to political sensitivity around risking being seen as choosing sides in what is ultimately considered a geopolitical competition between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical pressures that Southeast Asian states face are not identical and thus shape each country’s view of which states are viewed as malign actors in the region. While there are some concerns around Saudi Arabia and Iran, these are limited to relevant states such as Indonesia and Malaysia. As Richard Javad Heydarian notes, Russia’s status as the largest source of defence sales for certain countries may play a role in how this actor is viewed in Southeast Asia. While Chinese examples of interference exist across the region, the geopolitical and economic realities that Southeast Asian states must contend with hamper public discussion of the challenges that Beijing presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Current Level of Analysis of Malign Interference is Low Across the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the regional overview and case studies show, Southeast Asian open source information on interference in the economic, political and information domains is limited where foreign state activity is concerned. Often, these themes are addressed by investigative journalists, but few public studies by experts in the region itself have examined them in detail. This is despite the much stronger focus on overt interference in the region, such as in the maritime domain, around the South China Sea issue. However, even the South China Sea disputes and regional security developments, such as the announcement of AUKUS, have elicited ambivalent responses that seek to avoid directly criticising Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature review and associated interviews as summarised in the regional overview showed four particular trends across the region: elite capture and hidden debt in Southeast Asia; online interference in election campaigns; investment in digital CNI; and Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy in selected states. However, issues of potential covert interference, such as through economic investment, elite capture or information operations, appear too sensitive to discuss publicly. This could be because of the difficulty in confirming state attribution of interference, or because of the political sensitivities of the offending and target states in question. Indeed, interviewees for this paper who have offered details on potential interference by foreign states have only spoken on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some specific hubs of analysis in the region, which include the RSIS Centre of Excellence for National Security in Singapore, and in the private sector, Mandiant and Recorded Future, which have established regional centres of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Chinese Interference is Seen Across the Region in the Three Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has sought to explore case studies of foreign interference in Southeast Asia by four distinct authoritarian regimes, the case studies have overwhelmingly featured China. This could be for a variety of reasons. One is the comparatively weaker and smaller presence of Iran, Russia and North Korea in seeking influence through interference in domestic affairs in Southeast Asia, and their priority of focusing on other regions and national security interests. It could also be, as noted earlier, that actors like Russia are not necessarily seen as nefarious actors in the region. China’s extensive engagement in Southeast Asia and desire for influence in its surrounding environment is well appreciated by countries in the region, and prominent case studies thus tend to more naturally revolve around China. Indeed, interference connected to Chinese state-linked actors was seen across the three themes under examination in this paper (information operations, political interference and economic interference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly prominent in discussions around Chinese economic investment and elite capture, which appear to go hand in hand in the case study chapters. These investments are being made along the BRI, but also in states where China may be seeking to achieve additional objectives, such as diminishing the influence of the US in treaty allies Thailand and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some evidence of Chinese and Russian cyber operations targeting Indonesia’s presidential elections in 2019. Indeed, China’s investment in CNI such as telecommunications in the region has created a particular vulnerability, with several countries in the region facing cyber attacks and media interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Greater Countermeasures to Mitigate Risks are Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe, the US and other like-minded partners have strengthened their risk mitigation regimes to protect critical industries, heighten investment screening regimes, and prevent foreign interference in politics and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not occurred to a similar extent in Southeast Asia, despite obvious strategic interests in the region from actors like China and activity taking place in the economic, political and information domains. There are notable exceptions, however – as seen in the chapter case studies, some countries in the region have responded with some mitigation efforts. These include Singapore, which introduced FICA in 2021, and Malaysia, through its focus on cyber security and various national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they look for opportunities for deeper engagement in and with countries in the Indo-Pacific, the UK and partners could increase engagement in the region in several ways. This paper offers the following four recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Continue Support for Local Media and Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate area for engagement that has emerged from this paper, although not entirely new, is the importance of supporting local media and civil society, and the fundamental role that investigative journalism and local engagement have played in exposing elite capture and corruption, as well as covert interference in the economic and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the worrying trend of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, the limits placed on the press in other Southeast Asian countries, and China’s offer of media training to journalists in the region, this should be a continued policy priority for the UK and partners. It should include media training to aspiring journalists in the region, but as has been pointed out, any such assistance must be made transparently and should be understood to be highly sensitive in certain countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Offer Alternatives Where Investment is Needed in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which the UK and other partners have already highlighted the need for increased engagement is infrastructure initiatives. While this is not purported to be in response to China specifically, the language around principles of sustainable infrastructure based on high environmental standards, fair financial arrangements and transparency in project contracting underscores the concerns around Chinese investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure investment can be a slow and complex process. Given the heightened interest in Southeast Asia, the UK and like-minded liberal democratic partners would do well to engage in joint needs assessments in consultation with governments in the region, particularly around the area of CNI. Further investment and engagement through groupings like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the G20 (through standard-setting), the Blue Dot Network and the EU Global Gateway should be pursued. The unwitting exposure of Western financial institutions to liabilities associated with the BRI in Southeast Asia should also be examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Increase Information Exchange on Malign Interference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia should consider exchanging information with one another on malign interference to help build a better threat picture of specific vulnerabilities and trends in targeting. As this information is likely highly sensitive and to various extents classified, the UK, for example, might consider, in trusted government-to-government settings, sharing information on observable trends, rather than specific detailed accounts or attribution to specific actors. This would help reinforce the global response to the challenge of malign interference and help shed light on whether observable trends are replicated in different geographical locations and specific contexts. Given that governments are understandably reactive and malign actors are more easily able to change tactics, this would also help governments shorten response times and address vulnerabilities in a timelier manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Help Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe and other partners have strengthened existing legislative regimes and crafted new ones to counter malign interference within their borders. These may not be best practice, but they represent examples that could be tailored to meet the specificities of Southeast Asian countries when it comes to legislation on cyber security, disinformation, investment screening and foreign interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific areas that are underdeveloped in Southeast Asia include cyber security and investment screening. On the latter, Southeast Asian countries have been liberalising foreign direct investment regimes since the 1990s as part of their development models. However, given increasing awareness of risk, investment screening mechanisms that protect national security (for example, on CNI, data and resources) may be required. Other reports have recommended that these be along the lines of OECD standards, even if not identical to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States regime or other regimes of developed countries. Foreign interference laws are another area that could be strengthened, with Singapore having strengthened its legislation in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners in the transatlantic community, as well as the Indo-Pacific, should consider sharing experiences and legislative countermeasures in Track 1 and Track 2 settings. However, the unique and distinct environments of all 10 ASEAN member states should be taken into consideration here, with an understanding that there will not be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to countermeasures. Furthermore, as has been discussed in this paper, there is the added complexity of criticisms in Southeast Asian countries that legislation which is meant to protect national security has also been used for domestic political ends by ruling governments. Given the UK’s new Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN announced in early August 2021, and the launch of the ASEAN–UK Digital Innovation Partnership the following month, there may be an opportunity for the UK and other ASEAN partners to launch a programme of engagement focusing on best practice in mitigating malign activity and specifically hostile information campaigns in the digital space across Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK in particular could also sponsor fellowships for higher-level and executive-level training on hybrid warfare and hybrid threats or courses at institutions like the Oxford Changing Character of War Centre, the European Centre for Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, think tanks, or private sector institutions working on cyber security, whether in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, none of these recommendations can be employed individually; rather, they should form the arms of a multifaceted strategy of regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of sanctions against the oligarchs which followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered an intensive policy conversation about the potential to move from temporary sanctions-based asset freezes to permanent asset confiscation, as policymakers seek to achieve two goals simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ensuring that individuals linked to the Kremlin are held accountable for Russia’s aggression…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and for their alleged historical corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ultimate origins of oligarchs’ assets may lie in historical bribery, corruption and patronage, linking sanctioned assets to historical acts of corruption presents challenges that the UK’s asset recovery mechanisms have yet to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising the limited impact of existing powers under the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) against more clearly evidenced corruption proceeds, and the complexities of gathering evidence to the necessary standard of proof, in 2022, research was conducted to identify possible alternative asset recovery mechanisms that would achieve permanent confiscation of such assets, without trumping due process and human-rights and rule-of-law protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this project, a series of RUSI Commentaries were published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-dealing-oligarchs-assets-uk&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-creativity-and-nuance-needed&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-how-uk-can-break-deadlock-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; 2022, as well as a RUSI Emerging Insights paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also held a Virtual Roundtable on International Asset Recovery Mechanisms and the “Freeze to Seize” Dilemma with international asset recovery experts in September 2022. The roundtable aimed at examining additional potential avenues to improve the UK’s ability to move, where a suitable case presents itself, from temporary sanctions-based asset freezes to permanent asset deprivation using human rights-compliant and proportionate tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a summary of the views that the different experts shared in this regard, drawing in particular on lessons provided by existing international models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-viewpoints-from-the-roundtable-discussion&quot;&gt;Summary Viewpoints From the Roundtable Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-1-what-are-the-potential-routes-to-amend-uk-legislation-in-order-to-move-from-freeze-to-seize&quot;&gt;Question 1: What are the potential routes to amend UK legislation in order to move from “freeze” to “seize”?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 1: Amending existing civil confiscation laws is a meaningful starting point for the UK, but individual cases must be considered on a case-by-case basis given the need for proportionality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that any future model needs to include appropriate human rights safeguards, particularly surrounding Article 1, Protocol 1 (A1/P1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to property and according to which any interference must be justified as a proportionate means of pursuing a legitimate aim in the public interest, and Article 6(1), the right to a fair trial – which clashes with sanctions provisions due to the lack of independent judicial oversight of the designation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participants, the civil confiscation route provides a sound basis for confiscating proceeds of kleptocracy. Given the expediency with which measures much be taken, it was generally agreed that amending the UK’s existing legislation for civil recovery (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/part/5&quot;&gt;Part 5 of POCA 2002&lt;/a&gt;), as opposed to establishing an entirely new regime, should be the focus of efforts. This also has the benefit of drawing on the significant extent to which Part 5 of POCA has been tested in the courts from an A1/P1 perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants raised the importance of being clear in legislation about the basis on which individuals are being deprived of their assets. For example, the current legislative provisions relate to assets of unlawful origin, which may not be a viable route in this context given the difficulty in obtaining evidence from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants suggested that amendments to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/section/242&quot;&gt;Section 242 of POCA&lt;/a&gt; to provide a broader definition of “unlawful conduct” may be a way forward. This could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assets obtained through political patronage; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assets which may be made available to support a hostile regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an amendment may overcome challenges of lawfulness of the investigation. However, cases will need to demonstrate proportionality, which will need to be judged on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-2-can-sanctions-evasion-be-used-as-the-starting-point-for-confiscation&quot;&gt;Question 2: Can sanctions evasion be used as the starting point for confiscation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 2: Sanctions evasion offences have limited reach given they will only capture the specific proceeds of the evasion itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants indicated that cases have indeed been brought forward in the United States against sanctioned individuals on the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-oligarch-oleg-vladimirovich-deripaska-and-associates-indicted-sanctions-evasion-and&quot;&gt;sanctions evasion&lt;/a&gt;. The European Commission has also looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_7373&quot;&gt;ways to criminalise the evasion of EU sanctions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proving underlying corruption is too challenging, the strategy should therefore be aimed at finding a criminal offence of sanctions evasion as a starting point for asset confiscation. Sanctions evasion is a relatively easy offence to prove and thus participants agreed that it provides a good practical starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants stressed that the UK should be investing in investigating sanctions evasion offences, especially through the newly established &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-takes-landmark-steps-to-further-clamp-down-on-dirty-money&quot;&gt;Combating Kleptocracy Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the proportionality test, a range of participants agreed that this approach is only likely to address a limited proportion of the sanctioned individual’s assets, namely the direct proceeds of the sanctions evasion, and is thus likely to be a minor solution in the “freeze to seize” debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-3-is-there-a-role-for-administrative-government-ordered-asset-forfeiture&quot;&gt;Question 3: Is there a role for administrative, government-ordered asset forfeiture?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 3: Administrative, government-issued forfeiture orders are unlikely to stand up to challenges in the courts and may risk diluting the meaning and impact of the wider sanctions regime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable considered confiscation proceedings stemming from a sanctions designation, an example of which is provided by recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-14.5/index.html&quot;&gt;amendments to Canadian legislation&lt;/a&gt;. These allow for the Canadian government to directly issue an order seeking permanent asset forfeiture if it assesses that an individual presents a “grave breach of international security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation has not been tested in court and the bar to be reached for making an order is not clear. Canadian legal professionals participating in the roundtable have argued that this approach is likely to face substantial challenge in the courts and may be unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of participants also agreed that this was not an appropriate approach for the UK. There was general consensus among participants at the roundtable that sanctions are a political tool that seeks behaviour change. Using them as the basis for eventual asset deprivation risks diluting their purpose and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-4-is-there-a-role-for-reverse-burden-of-proof-or-rebuttable-presumptions&quot;&gt;Question 4: Is there a role for reverse burden of proof or rebuttable presumptions?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 4: Full reverse burden offences in a range of jurisdictions have been proved human-rights compliant and may be a useful component of future UK amendments seeking to deal with the freeze to seize challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at the roundtable referred to a range of reverse burden/rebuttable presumption-based models, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Zealand is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_126022/criminal-proceeds-recovery-amendment-bill&quot;&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt; adopting full reverse burden at the point of asset freeze, which places the burden on the respondent to explain the lawful basis of any frozen property to the satisfaction of the court, otherwise there is a presumption of recoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, a law in France created a presumption of money laundering according to which “the property or income is presumed to be the direct or indirect proceeds of a crime or offence if the material, legal or financial conditions of the investment, concealment or conversion operation have no other justification than to conceal the origin or beneficial owner of such property or income” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000028285954&quot;&gt;French Criminal Code Article 324-1-1&lt;/a&gt;). Following this rebuttable presumption, the burden of proof no longer rests on the prosecution but on the defendant, who must demonstrate that the operation fulfils a licit purpose. As reported by the French &lt;a href=&quot;https://navacelle.law/the-french-supreme-court-confirms-its-position-on-the-presumption-of-money-laundering/&quot;&gt;Court of Cassation&lt;/a&gt;, applying the presumption of money laundering does not require the characterisation of the predicate offence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illicit enrichment offences such as the ones in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_231_homepage.html&quot;&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and other mechanisms targeting unexplained wealth (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/322/en&quot;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;) generally rely on reverse burden mechanisms and have been adopted in a range of jurisdictions to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-5-what-about-organised-crime-based-asset-confiscation-models&quot;&gt;Question 5: What about organised crime-based asset confiscation models?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 5: Categorising kleptocracy as an organised crime may provide another avenue to overcome some of the challenges inherent in asset confiscation linked to the proceeds of kleptocracy and political patronage, by negating the need to make an express link between individual assets and specific criminality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples discussed at the roundtable include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title18/part1/chapter96&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;US Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)&lt;/a&gt; model and the Italian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altalex.com/documents/codici-altalex/2014/07/24/codice-antimafia-edizione-giugno-2014&quot;&gt;Anti-Mafia Code&lt;/a&gt;, which use the organised criminality and/or societal impacts of specific groups and individuals as the starting point for confiscation proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of such approaches is that they negate the need to link individual assets to specific criminality; rather, they create a presumption that wealth obtained by the individual is the proceeds of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in the courts may be around the proportionality of individual cases. In Italian legislation, participants made an express link to societal harms to overcome such challenges and may offer a useful blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-6-could-confiscation-be-linked-to-national-security&quot;&gt;Question 6: Could confiscation be linked to national security?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 6: Using national security/societal danger as the basis for confiscation in isolation risks conflicts between national security and foreign policy goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants referred to the option of models which use the status of the individual, rather than the status or provenance of the assets, as the basis for confiscation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example discussed in this regard is the Swiss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/322/en&quot;&gt;Foreign Illicit Assets Act&lt;/a&gt; (FIIA), which may order an asset freeze in anticipation of initiating proceedings for the confiscation of assets if these “have been made subject to a provisional seizure order within the framework of international legal assistance proceedings in criminal matters instigated at the request of the country of origin … the country of origin is unable to satisfy the requirements for mutual legal assistance owing to the total or substantial collapse, or the impairment, of its judicial system (failure of state structures) [and] the safeguarding of Switzerland’s interests requires the freezing of the assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using diffuse concepts such as national security as a basis for confiscation could lead to highly politicised outcomes, unintended consequences, conflicts between prosecutors and government, and significant tensions between criminal justice and foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-7-is-there-a-role-for-fugitive-disentitlement-provisions&quot;&gt;Question 7: Is there a role for fugitive disentitlement provisions?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 7: Fugitive disentitlement provisions may have a particular use in cases where a viable criminal case has been identified, but the offender remains overseas and/or extradition is not possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable raised the potential of mirroring US-style “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2466&quot;&gt;fugitive disentitlement provisions&lt;/a&gt;” to prevent defendants who have absconded from the jurisdiction from using the resources of the court to defend a civil case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While likely only to cover a limited number of cases, participants agreed that such provisions would provide a potentially useful additional tool within the asset confiscation arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing legislative mechanisms to facilitate the permanent confiscation of kleptocratic proceeds is a challenge that goes well beyond the UK. However, other jurisdictions’ existing asset recovery mechanisms provide some useful lessons at the legislative level that, coupled with appropriate resourcing and expertise, could lead to a refined whole-of-a-system approach to the recovery of proceeds of kleptocracy in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-oligarchs-assets-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Dealing with Oligarchs’ Assets in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maria Nizzero, 13 April 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j9kvsh6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Having frozen the assets of Russia’s wealthy elite, seizing those assets will be far more difficult.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has seen an unprecedented response in terms of the economic retaliation rolled out against Russia. Alongside a basket of sanctions aimed at debilitating the Russian economy, Western governments have heavily targeted oligarchs’ assets, leaving no villa or superyacht untouched. However, sanctions-based asset freezes are a tool of foreign policy, and the assets cannot stay frozen in limbo forever: they must eventually be confiscated, or unfrozen. There is a risk, if Russian President Vladimir Putin demands that sanctions measures are dropped as a condition for ending hostilities, or if the oligarchs win their appeals against sanctions, that the assets will simply be unfrozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears from UK government rhetoric that the policy intention is to find a fast solution to move from “freeze” to “seize”. However, the tools currently available under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) make gathering the necessary evidence on oligarchs’ assets, and having it stand up in court, hard to achieve. Given this challenge, it is tempting to seek a “shortcut” fix, but in its haste, the government must be cautious not to create precedent for more draconian measures in the future. Any action the government decides to take needs to balance the policy intention that “crime shouldn’t pay” with respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law, and be capable of standing the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;desperate-measures-for-desperate-times&quot;&gt;Desperate Measures for Desperate Times?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the war and the drive to make an example of oligarchs, while showing that something is being done to put pressure on Russia, have led to some extreme proposals by the government, such as seizing oligarchs’ properties and using them to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees. While attractive in political terms, this approach falls short when assessed against the rule of law. Property rights and legal due process should be respected regardless of whether these individuals are oligarchs. Ignoring these principles would invite comparison with the autocracies we are supposedly standing against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these proposals are more political theatre than reality. However, they reveal a general lack of understanding of what sanctions can and cannot do. In the current crisis, sanctions have been used against those that benefit from or support the Russian government. If ministers want to deprive oligarchs of their assets, they will need to use different mechanisms to seize and confiscate them to achieve their desired outcome – mechanisms that require separate, lengthier legal proceedings, and which need to meet specific requirements regarding the nature of the assets and the way in which they were generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, recovery of oligarchs’ assets will prove to be a much harder task than simply sanctioning them, and will require appropriate tools to be available. To many, the most obvious solution is deploying the much-vaunted Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). However, UWOs have previously fallen short and, although the Economic Crime Act has addressed some of their limitations – namely by expanding the definition of a UWO subject and placing a cap on the costs to which law enforcement could be subject should they be unsuccessful in their bid – they are still not straightforward to operationalise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the complexities presented by the use of UWOs, oligarch assets give rise to additional problems. Notably, the criminality and corruption at the root of this wealth are historical, meaning it was amassed decades ago and has been laundered into legitimate businesses so many times that, by the time the money is used to buy a house in Kensington, it is difficult to prove it was tainted in the first place. Additionally, these assets are often well-hidden behind complex structures, complicating the task of identifying the real owner for law enforcement, as recent attempted detentions of superyachts have shown. These issues, coupled with the investigative nature of UWOs – which requires a separate civil proceeding to be commenced for a recovery order and adds another step to an already lengthy process – still represent unresolved obstacles that render UWOs unlikely to meet the requirements needed for effectively dealing with kleptocratic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-means-for-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;Alternative Means for Asset Recovery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the challenge ahead, what alternatives exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first option, a full reverse burden of proof as to the origin of the assets could be introduced, modelled on examples such as the Swiss Law on Asset Recovery. Should an oligarch fail to demonstrate the lawfulness of their wealth, this tool would allow for the confiscation of frozen assets without the need to commence a separate civil proceeding – a step that has contributed to the disappointing use of UWOs so far. However, it would likely still be relatively easy for foreign kleptocrats to “prove” the legitimacy of their wealth, given the time that has elapsed since it was first “earned”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar option would be adopting an Irish model, through which property is frozen based on “belief evidence” and is subsequently forfeited if it appears to the court that a person is in possession or control of property that constitutes – directly or indirectly – proceeds of crime. Part of the success of the Irish system stems from the resourcing provided to its Criminal Assets Bureau, something the UK has not traditionally been willing to consider. This mechanism has also not traditionally dealt with cases involving politically exposed persons, bringing into question its effectiveness when applied against oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option to consider is the concept of “criminality by association”, found in racketeering legislation in Italy and the US. In the US case, the general test is whether the defendant knew about the criminal nature of a conspiracy of which they were part, not that they agreed to a specific predicate offence. If applied to oligarchs, the key point would be proving they knew and understood the corrupt nature of the Russian regime with which they are associated, in the same way a mafia member would. For this to work, a close connection between the oligarchs and the regime needs to be established, as well as the kleptocratic nature of the Russian government. However, the latter would require the UK government to list Russia as a kleptocracy – something that is likely to be undesirable from a diplomatic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-easy-answer&quot;&gt;No Easy Answer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although current tools may prove ineffective in these unique circumstances, it may be possible for the government to develop new legislation to move from “freeze” to “seize” while respecting due process, providing the precise circumstances justifying confiscation are carefully set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with ensuring proportionality and respect for human rights and the rule of law, policymakers should also carefully consider the primary purpose of this asset confiscation. Is it a step that is felt necessary to persuade Putin to stop waging war against Ukraine, and to disincentivise other countries (like China) from carrying out similar acts of aggression, or is it because the oligarchs’ wealth was illicitly acquired in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the latter, the line between the role of sanctions and the role of asset confiscation must not be blurred in the way it has been thus far. More importantly, any measure taken today should be designed to stand the test of time, so that it can be used in the future against criminally acquired assets from other unpalatable regimes and in support of other sanctions, such as those targeting corruption or human rights abuses. The government should aim to develop asset recovery mechanisms that are capable of targeting dirty money, whatever its origin may be. After all, the “London laundromat” was a national security issue long before the war in Ukraine, and will continue to be a threat long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creativity-and-nuance-is-needed&quot;&gt;Creativity and Nuance is Needed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Keatinge and Maria Nizzero, 7 June 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nnOb5d4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Political rhetoric on sanctioned Russian asset seizure is being replaced by concrete proposals. A long legal road lies ahead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine passes 100 days, and as the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia-related assets continues, the debate surrounding what to do with these frozen assets is still high on the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the political rhetoric has become more moderated, and the process has entered a new stage, with the US, Canada and the EU all bringing forward proposals that are semantically different, but share the same goal: seizing Russia-related assets within the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-on-the-table-and-whats-not&quot;&gt;What’s on the Table, and What’s Not&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lively debate on the different mechanisms that might be employed to achieve the intended policy goal of seizing sanctioned assets – assets that, despite being frozen, remain the property of their original owner, be that an oligarch or the Russian Central Bank, and where a connection with criminality remains, thus far, undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late April, the US opened the way, by proposing a comprehensive legislative package “to hold the Russian government and Russian oligarchs accountable for President Putin’s war against Ukraine”. The proposal considers establishing new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, while setting up mechanisms that would allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine. Among the most relevant elements of this package is the forfeiture of property used to facilitate the evasion of sanctions, and the inclusion of this offence in the definition of “racketeering activity” in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The legislative package also creates a new criminal offence making it unlawful for any person to “knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Canada dusted off a previous proposal aimed at allowing Canadian courts “to take the frozen assets of foreign officials whose mis-rule creates forced displacement and other humanitarian needs”. The Frozen Assets Repurposing Act, originally drafted with the primary purpose of assisting the humanitarian needs of those forcibly displaced, essentially foresees new powers to seize and sell assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs while repurposing the proceeds to rebuild Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has also followed suit, presenting in late May a new Directive on Asset Recovery and Confiscation. The proposal seeks to modernise EU rules on asset recovery through a series of measures, including an Asset Recovery and Management Office with the powers to trace and identify criminal assets, ensure that frozen property does not lose value, and enable its sale. The proposal also allows the confiscation of assets obtained from a wider set of crimes, all linked to some form of organised criminality. Like the US proposal, the directive would make sanctions evasion a crime across the EU, triggering the potential to enforce seizure procedures. This is a significant step, considering that only 12 EU member states currently treat evasion as a crime, while in 13 more it is either an administrative or a criminal offence, and two other member states only treat it as an administrative offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, thus far, the UK has yet to make the transition from political theatre over the topic to a more informed debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creativity-and-nuance-needed&quot;&gt;Creativity (and Nuance) Needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These proposals include a few common themes. First, the current stance is to approach recovering the assets of oligarchs from an organised crime/racketeering standpoint, with little consideration given to securing reparations from the largest source of assets, the Central Bank of Russia. Both the US and EU packages include proposals aimed at expanding their current initiatives against organised crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, even though the EU proposal has been advertised as providing new rules aimed at confiscating sanctioned Russian assets, the full text of the proposed directive reveals that its primary target is organised crime in general, and that the Russian oligarchs are just affected by proxy. Thus, operationalising the Directive would require establishing a link between oligarch assets and organised crime. The proposed Directive has an Italian flavour. This is unsurprising as the Italian Anti-Mafia Code’s asset recovery mechanisms, albeit not perfect, have been put forward as a palatable option upon which to build tools that could help solve the puzzle of how to seize oligarchs’ assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sanctions evasion is receiving more attention from policymakers as a possible route to seizure. In the US, existing laws related to sanctions evasion and money laundering have already been creatively deployed to seize the Tango, a yacht belonging to sanctioned oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, via civil forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final theme concerns asset return and repurposing. While still uncertain on how to effectively seize sanctioned Russian assets, the US and Canadian proposals already discuss their use once forfeited, and propose repurposing them for the reconstruction of Ukraine. This gives rise to a discussion over whom the recovered money should be returned to. The purpose of asset recovery is to return funds to victims and the country from which they were originally stolen. However, in the case of the oligarchs’ wealth, which was originally accumulated decades ago following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the “rightful” owners are, indeed, the Russian people (who might not agree with the Kremlin’s actions). While attractive and warranted, using the oligarchs’ money to help reconstruct Ukraine – rather than returning it to the original Russian victims – may not be in line with current asset recovery norms, requiring further legal exploration. A different matter would be compensating Ukraine with the money derived from penalties linked to sanctions evasion – a totally acceptable option that would achieve two goals simultaneously (ensuring that crime doesn’t pay, and that Ukraine’s reconstruction is supported).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-are-easier-said-than-done&quot;&gt;Sanctions are Easier Said Than Done&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current proposals highlight the complications of using administrative tools (sanctions) to achieve criminal justice outcomes (asset recovery). While progress is being made, and experts are becoming more optimistic about the possibility of holding Russian kleptocrats accountable, there is a long road ahead which will require careful drafting of legal frameworks that can be used should another “kleptocracy crisis” hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the objective complexity of designing appropriate legal mechanisms, at a time when Western allies are seeking to build support for Ukraine around the world, whatever solution is brought forward is likely to invite comparison with the autocracies the West supposedly stands against. There is also a considerable risk that a court might invalidate these mechanisms under challenge, thus handing Russia a propaganda win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the current focus on seizing assets which are potentially the proceeds of historical crime from oligarchs ignores the greatest source of reparations for Ukraine, the assets of the Russian government, held primarily in the Central Bank of Russia’s frozen accounts in the West. Focusing on this dimension might yield a more profitable return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the emphasis on seizing oligarch assets is politically appealing, there is a long legal road ahead as considerable creativity will be needed to ensure that whatever results is sufficiently robust to withstand scrutiny from a range of legal, moral and human rights perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-uk-can-break-the-deadlock-on-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;How the UK Can Break the Deadlock on Asset Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maria Nizzero, 10 October 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cGdi2tF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the UK continues to impose sanctions, it is lagging behind allies in developing its approach to the recovery of ill-gotten assets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September, members of the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Taskforce convened to discuss initiatives to tailor “already robust asset forfeiture tools and maximize the impact of … joint work on Russian elites”. Participants from G7 countries, plus Australia, debated legislative efforts and several proposals – including some already discussed in a previous commentary by this author – with a key focus on expanding definitions of racketeering to include sanctions evasion as well as a trigger for property forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, gone are the days of ministers posing in front of detained yachts or proposing to seize oligarchs’ villas to house Ukrainian refugees. Despite continuing to sanction individuals for their support for Russia’s aggression – the UK has so far sanctioned over 1,200 Russian individuals – and a couple of parliamentary debates on the matter, it has been months since the last attempt to freeze (and seize and confiscate) oligarch assets. This inaction is indicative of two elements: the persistent confusion among UK policymakers surrounding the ultimate goal of confiscating Russian sanctioned assets, and the inadequacy of the UK’s asset recovery frameworks when faced with this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;time-to-refocus&quot;&gt;Time to Refocus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries in the Western alliance are grappling to develop legislation that enables asset confiscation while adhering to the rule of law, a process that has produced a number of different approaches. Sanctions evasion offences are likely to have limited reach as a starting point for asset forfeiture, given that they would only capture the specific proceeds of the evasion itself. The seizure of the yacht Amadea is a case in point. As such, this approach is likely to be only a minor solution in the “freeze to seize” debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REPO Taskforce has made it clear that the goal of recovery initiatives should be to hold “Russian elites and their cronies” accountable “for their complicity in Putin’s illegal invasion”. In the US, this has translated into cases being brought forward on loosely related grounds, including violation of bank fraud, money laundering, and sanction statutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has taken a different approach, where new legislation will allow the government to directly issue an Order seeking permanent asset forfeiture based on individuals who risk a “grave breach of international security”. This type of administrative, government-issued forfeiture order, however, is unlikely to stand up to challenges in the courts and may risk diluting the meaning and impact of the wider sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread uniting these initiatives is the attempt to bypass the stumbling block of proving the underlying corruption of the oligarchs, a process that is too challenging, slow and time-consuming. This legal creativity seeks to deliver the short-term goal of constraining the oligarchs and responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It does not, however, tackle the bigger issue of kleptocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first commentary of this series, the author highlighted the need for policymakers to “carefully consider the primary purpose of this asset confiscation”. Without identifying such a purpose or the characteristics of the property to be confiscated, recovery efforts will be confused, disjointed and likely to fail. A choice is needed, one that the UK is yet to make: while some MPs would like confiscation efforts to tackle the UK’s dirty money problem, others firmly believe they should be linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Given the limitations highlighted above, and the threat that dirty money poses to national security, a long-sighted strategy aimed at tackling corrupt proceeds would be more advisable. However, no strategy can be brought forward until its ultimate goal is decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tweaking-the-law&quot;&gt;Tweaking the Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ultimate goal of asset confiscation is clear, it is possible to look at ways to recalibrate the current legislation to include provisions that target oligarch assets. If the goal is to go after kleptocracy, it is clear that the current provisions are simply not capable of overcoming the hurdle of procuring evidence from overseas and proving the oligarchs’ underlying corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) to provide a broader definition of “unlawful conduct” may be a way forward. These could include, for instance, “assets obtained through political patronage”, or “assets which may be made available to support a hostile regime”. Full reverse burden offences have also been proved human-rights compliant in a range of jurisdictions and may be a useful component of future amendments. As explained in a previous commentary, categorising kleptocracy as organised crime may also provide another avenue to overcome some of the challenges inherent in asset confiscation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-matter-of-resources&quot;&gt;A Matter of Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intention and legislation aside, much of the inaction in the UK results from law enforcement’s ability to go after the assets in question. A recent investigation found that £700 million worth of luxury homes linked to sanctioned oligarchs have not been flagged for asset freezes. This is due not only to the ongoing role of offshore secrecy jurisdictions, but also to law enforcement’s current lack of specialism and resources to go after these assets. How is it even possible to talk about moving from freeze to seize if the assets are not frozen in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies are also confronted with sanctioned individuals’ appeals. In UK courts, the first major sanctions evasion case sees a Russian billionaire requesting that two Account Freezing Orders are overturned because of the “chaotic and unprincipled approach” of the National Crime Agency (NCA). A setback in this case could seriously affect future efforts in this area, in much the same way as the Baker case did with Unexplained Wealth Orders. To obviate these challenges, the NCA needs enough time and resources to trace assets and provide evidence to bring watertight cases to court. This means ensuring a funding stream that is long-term and increasing in order to face the growing threat posed by illicit finance – something that has so far been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;late-to-the-party--ready-to-dance&quot;&gt;Late to the Party … Ready to Dance?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is still far from being successful in freezing, seizing and confiscating the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs, but can of course catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is important that the UK government finally makes up its mind on the ultimate goal of asset confiscation. Granted that linking asset confiscation to the actions in Ukraine is not the recommended option, it is still possible to target hostile regimes and their associates on the basis of kleptocracy or national security interests. Secondly, once decided, changes in legislation that are meaningful and respectful of human rights and due process are needed. Lastly, resourcing and specialism need to be prioritised to tip the balance in favour of law enforcement agencies. It is now time to refocus, recalibrate and resource: only in this way will it be possible to turn sanctions-based asset freezes into asset recovery opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past few years, however, Huawei and Alibaba have both faced major hurdles due to their integration in the CCP Inc. state capitalist system. Political pushback against Huawei is damaging its ability to expand internationally, while a government crackdown on China’s own tech sector is challenging Alibaba’s growth prospects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCP Inc. in the Private Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond China’s borders, CCP Inc. can be thought of as the latest evolution of China’s “Going Out” state capitalist strategy to promote outbound investment. It is comprised of an international ecosystem of key state-owned and private commercial actors, state-owned financiers, government regulators, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organs that are connected through an increasingly complicated web of direct and indirect transactional, financial, strategic, operational, and political relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these ecosystems operate both within China’s domestic commercial space, where they have been honed to provide integral support to state development goals, and in the international commercial space, where they provide a significant boost to the reach and economic influence of a given Chinese commercial entity, especially when compared with standalone private sector competitors from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese entities within this ecosystem often enjoy a wide degree of commercial autonomy, the CCP leadership maintains significant leverage (active or latent) to steer or support firms through financial, political, and regulatory channels. Each firm tacitly understands that they will be supported in their operations where there is overlap with national strategic objectives, and that they will likely be constrained if their operations are perceived to be counterproductive to the CCP’s policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study will examine CCP Inc. in the private sector by focusing on two of China’s highest-profile companies: Huawei and Alibaba. Both benefited from a favorable domestic environment that helped propel them to international competitiveness. Both succeeded in expanding across the world — this study focuses specifically on Malaysia as one example, but Huawei and Alibaba are both among China’s most global companies. Then, both Huawei and Alibaba fell prey to the major internal and external risks of being tied to CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2000s and 2010s marked a period of rapid growth for both tech giants. The two titans were able to bring unlevel playing fields with them during their international expansions, thanks to the practical (financial) and political (diplomatic) safety nets delivered by the Chinese party-state. The intrinsic advantages that companies like Huawei and Alibaba could once bring to bear help explain their remarkable success in places like Malaysia, as this report argues. The ten- and five-year odysseys of Huawei and Alibaba, respectively, in that country paint a picture of what it looks like when the CCP Inc. ecosystem generates industry giants and then unleashes them abroad. Over time, their success bred more success for other Chinese tech players. Eventually, both firms became so deeply entrenched in Malaysia that Kuala Lumpur’s technological reliance on China became a story in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei and Alibaba both followed the CCP leadership’s general directional guidance for China’s firms when they expanded into Malaysia, but both also walked a commercial path and implemented their own for-profit corporate visions in the process. In so doing, they were initially able to move faster, and go farther, than the more tightly controlled state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the early 2020s, however, the narrative for both firms had changed, in part thanks to the changing reach of the CCP. Huawei’s international predominance in areas like 5G services and mobile telecommunications had been severely undermined by U.S.-led pressure campaigns — which were driven largely by the perception that Huawei is a tool of CCP interests. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s global momentum had been stymied by its own government as a part of the CCP’s crusade against its domestic internet companies. While both firms remain major players in the global tech sector, the narratives around them have shifted drastically over the past few years, due in large part to their relations with CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Malaysia was a success story for both companies — and it may yet be again. But for now, Huawei seems to have missed out on its largest goal (building out and running the country’s 5G network), and Alibaba has been losing ground to regional rivals in e-commerce while its flagship City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur appears to have lost momentum. However, the story is no longer just about two flagship firms; there are now dozens of Chinese players extending into every element of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem. CCP Inc. has stalled to some degree in Malaysia, but many of its tech roots remain firmly in place, and Huawei and Alibaba are the two companies most responsible for growing those roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of new challenges, China’s tech footprint in Malaysia remains unmatched from both countries’ perspectives: China has not achieved such an extensive technological presence anywhere else, and no other foreign country has achieved such a large presence in Malaysia. Thus there are lessons to be learned both from the shape of the CCP Inc. presence in Malaysia in its heyday and from the challenges that severely complicated that presence during the 2020–2022 period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will proceed in three chapters. Chapter 1 will examine CCP Inc.’s “incubation” of private sector champions, showing that both Huawei and Alibaba benefited from state financing and political support throughout their expansion both domestically and abroad. Chapter 2 will focus in on Huawei’s and Alibaba’s expansion in Malaysia, which benefited from a strong domestic base, connectivity between Chinese companies, and diplomatic support. Finally, Chapter 3 will examine blowback on Huawei and Alibaba in the late 2010s and 2020s, resulting from a combination of external pushback against China’s involvement in strategic infrastructure and an internal crackdown by the CCP on its own private sector internet champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ccp-inc-as-an-incubator-of-national-champions&quot;&gt;CCP Inc. as an “Incubator” of National Champions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately held Chinese companies present unique analytical challenges when examining CCP Inc. For SOEs, it is relatively easy to draw a straight line from CCP proclamations of intent and SOE behavior abroad. State financing patterns are overt, goals are explicit, specific policy obligations find their way into the performance reviews of SOE executives, and mega-initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) generate predictable call-and-response patterns for all to see. SOEs have easier access to China’s policy banks for financing, particularly those that have taken on high levels of policy responsibility. Researchers have even found that privatized companies that were once SOEs enjoy a higher level of state support in comparison to companies that were privately owned since their inception. A closer relationship with the state also extends to international projects, as SOEs may enjoy a higher degree of state support than their private counterparts. Among the private players, for whom revenue and profit are more of an existential imperative, the line from CCP proclamations to boardroom decisionmaking is less direct and visible — but the line exists, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, both China’s SOEs and its private enterprises emerge from the same shielded, subsidized, politically guided, expectation-laden, and ultimately high-intensity crucible that is China’s domestic economy. Therein lies a fundamental parallel: long before any “national champion” firm leaves China’s shores, it has been nurtured, toughened up, ladened with resources, and positioned for dominance by China’s political-economy system. On the one hand, competition within China’s national arena can be as cutthroat and winner-take-all as anywhere else in the world. On the other, those private players that emerge victorious (and those SOEs that play their own game the best) end up with vast financial and political resources that they can bring to bear once they begin to “go out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere has this phenomenon been more evident than in the telecommunications and technology space. Two of China’s best-known tech champions, Huawei and Alibaba, form the backbone of this case study report. Both companies honed their corporate vision and perfected their competitive approach decades ago, demonstrating legitimate business acumen within China’s brutal marketplace. Both also benefited enormously from not having to compete with international rivals, follow international legal norms, or respect intellectual property rights during their nascency. Both leveraged tech-friendly domestic subsidy policies, both accumulated outsized power and influence with the help of cheerleading regulators, and both enjoyed an unlevel playing field for more than a decade after their rise to prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-support-for-huaweis-domestic-rise-and-international-expansion&quot;&gt;State Support for Huawei’s Domestic Rise and International Expansion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ren Zhengfei, a former People’s Liberation Army (PLA) engineer, founded Huawei in Shenzhen in 1988. At the time, China relied heavily on imports for its telecommunications infrastructure needs. Ren built up Huawei’s reputation (and its revenues) via a business model that centered on government procurement and leveraging his old relationships, and over time he positioned the company as China’s solution to its reliance on foreign suppliers like Lucent, Ericsson, Motorola, and others. Government subsidies poured in (see Figure 1 below and Appendix A).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Beijing’s market-access policies for foreign technology companies, Huawei eventually was able to extract enough intellectual property (IP) from its foreign competitors (legally, via forced technology transfers and joint ventures (JVs), and illegally, via reverse engineering) to become an effective manufacturer of its own switches, handsets, and 2G and 3G network equipment. Once it could produce enough lower-cost homegrown telecom products to carve out a dominant position in its own protected domestic marketplace, Huawei began to look abroad, particularly at underserved and tech-starved emerging markets. After several years of exponential growth at home — built on the back of guaranteed government contracts, many of which still exist today (see the recent multi-billion-dollar 5G award from China Mobile) — Huawei’s technical expertise matured to the point that it was able to manufacture reliable and affordable telecom products for export, at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it was a relatively simple matter for Huawei to leverage its cost advantages, its access to favorable export financing, and its competitors’ hesitancy to carve out dominant positions in a wide swath of emerging markets where Western technology companies had only a limited presence (or in markets where those same technology companies determined they could not profitably do business). In 2012, Huawei became the largest telecommunications manufacturer in the world. It has become a company with global reach; along with its much-publicized role in international 5G networks, Huawei is a key provider of an array of digital infrastructure, from 4G networks and mobile devices to AI surveillance devices. By 2021, international revenues rose to constitute 35 percent of Huawei’s total revenue. Huawei has undeniably become a global powerhouse and developed its own sophisticated research and development (R&amp;amp;D) capabilities, so much so that it became competitive even in the most advanced markets (until recent geopolitical blowback). Meanwhile, the emerging markets that Western firms once ignored eventually became wealthy enough to be attractive, but by then Huawei was already largely entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: A Snapshot of Huawei’s State Support.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Full table included in Appendix A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evolution played out under the watchful eye of the CCP, which from the beginning has counted on Huawei — and a few others, like ZTE — to guarantee China’s ability to supply its own telecommunications infrastructure. This obligation (and burden), which Huawei has borne since the 1990s, also provided Huawei with a privileged position within China’s state financing ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a generation, Huawei — officially a private company — has received a steady stream of government support from China’s economic managers. The strength Huawei draws from this support has given it significant advantages abroad. Figure 1 provides representative examples of how different parts of the Chinese state and financial apparatus supported the company through the period of Huawei’s nascency, adolescence, and emergence as a global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s benefits extend well beyond favorable export financing terms and a consistently green light from China Exim Bank and the China Development Bank (CDB). One prominent study suggested that Huawei saved as much as $25 billion between 2008 and 2018 just via tech-related tax incentives. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Huawei’s total state support amounted to the equivalent of $75 billion, mainly in the form of credit facilities and tax breaks. The U.S. Department of Commerce determined in 2020 that as much as 10 percent of Huawei’s annual R&amp;amp;D is covered by Chinese government grants. In 2020, the party-state stepped in to arrange the offloading of Huawei’s Honor phone brand as a way to cushion the blow from U.S. sanctions. And finally, it could be argued that Huawei was able to offer goods and services at a 20 to 30 percent discount internationally, based solely off of the currency management policies implemented by the People’s Bank of China (PCOB) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plethora of government grants, low-cost land, and below-market lending continued to stream in Huawei’s direction throughout the late 2010s, even after the company had become internationally competitive. By then Huawei was already entrenched across much of the developing world. Although Huawei was expanding internationally as a private sector company, it thus still benefited from a state support system distinct from what market economy private sector companies enjoy. Disentangling the impact of state support from that of Huawei’s independent business acumen and position in a burgeoning new technology field is difficult. But state support certainly played a key role in building up Huawei during its early days and later supporting its international expansion — a pattern also seen in the rise and global spread of fellow private sector champion Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-quick-review-of-alibabas-nascency-and-global-emergence&quot;&gt;A Quick Review of Alibaba’s Nascency and Global Emergence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou by Jack Ma and a small cohort of his friends. It started as a business-to-business e-commerce marketplace but rapidly evolved into China’s answer to eBay — and eventually Amazon. Today, Alibaba is one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies, and its international subsidiaries AliExpress and Lazada have carved out competitive — and occasionally dominant — positions in various offshore e-commerce markets. Cainiao (菜鸟网络), its e-commerce-centric logistics and delivery platform, has also become prominent in various external markets, often coming hand-in-hand with operations like Lazada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this study, Alibaba’s core e-commerce competencies are only part of the story. Alibaba’s attractiveness to countries like Malaysia derives not only from the value it provides in fostering cross-border and in-market e-commerce dynamism, but also from the vast array of technology solutions offered by the full suite of Alibaba Group companies. Alibaba’s innovations at home began with electronic payments in the form of Alipay, moved quickly to a more expansive fintech vision in the form of Ant Financial, and eventually moved into cloud computing, AI, and cutting-edge “smart city” software and networking. Before the rollout of China’s new regulatory regime, Alibaba’s all-in-one digital umbrella had helped it establish a reputation for being Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, FedEx, and TD Ameritrade all in one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Hangzhou municipality, where Alibaba was founded and is still headquartered, provided critical support to Alibaba in its early development. By Alibaba’s teenage years, Beijing was also subsidizing its explosive growth. Although Alibaba was a much-celebrated member of China’s cohort of new digital behemoths for many years, its status as an internet-first company — rather than a tech infrastructure company — led to somewhat less overt state support than telecommunications peers such as Huawei received. Besides its tax benefits, most of Alibaba’s friendly treatment came at the local level, rather than the national level. Nonetheless, Alibaba benefited from the same unlevel, protected, and subsidized nascency as the rest of China’s tech giants, and this home field advantage enabled the growth of Alibaba’s resources to their eventual world-leading levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yWiIhQ7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: A Snapshot of Alibaba’s State Support during Its Rise.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Full table is included in Appendix B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for better or for worse (from Alibaba’s perspective), the Chinese government is a significant minority owner of the firm: in 2012, a consortium led by China’s sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation (CIC), bought half of Yahoo’s then-40 percent ownership stake in Alibaba. Thus, in some small way, China’s own national bottom line is tied in with Alibaba’s valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Alibaba’s U.S. SEC filings have consistently reported an effective tax rate of 10 percent for the company and its subsidiaries, because Alibaba continues to be a “key software enterprise within the scope of the PRC national plan.” This tax rate is well below China’s standard corporate tax rate of 25 percent, reflecting a tax exemption benefit that the Chinese government grants to “high and new technology enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different types of state support — preferential financing, favorable tax rates, and government-guaranteed contracts — enjoyed by Alibaba and Huawei are key to understanding how the private sector is connected to conduits of state influence in the CCP Inc. system. Before Huawei or Alibaba ever took their business abroad, they were already embedded in an ecosystem of Chinese state capitalism, which would continue to influence their behavior and success beyond China’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;huaweis-and-alibabas-expansion-in-malaysia&quot;&gt;Huawei’s and Alibaba’s Expansion in Malaysia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. ecosystem’s “incubation” of private sector champions helps Chinese companies to develop rapidly and cultivate a competitive edge which they can then use to expand internationally. And state support does not stop at China’s borders: CCP Inc. continues to promote private sector players through conduits of financing, diplomatic support, and connectivity between Chinese companies. The following section will examine how Huawei and Alibaba built up their businesses in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia is a middle-income country, with a nominal per-capita average annual income of $11,200 (or $29,000 in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms). Malaysia ranks 62nd on the latest UN Human Development Index — somewhat lower than its global rankings for income, but ahead of every other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country besides wealthy Singapore and Brunei. As of 2022, over 80 percent of Malaysians had access to the internet, and according to surveys, nearly 90 percent of that connected cohort had access to a smartphone. Malaysia’s technology demographics have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade — in 2010, only 56 percent of the population was online — and today Malaysia has one of the most dynamic digital economies in Southeast Asia. The fingerprints of China’s tech firms can be found all over the background stories driving these accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s tech presence in Malaysia started similarly to its approach in many other markets: Huawei got there first. Years before Western telecom competitors would see Malaysia as an attractive market, Huawei was already there, offering lower-cost market-appropriate pricing and service options for telecommunications infrastructure. This familiar storyline would lead to a dominant position for Huawei — and, eventually, other Chinese telecom players — and open the door for wider Chinese participation in Malaysia’s broader technology space. Huawei’s quiet success via its 3G and 4G rollouts set the stage for more advanced China projects, like Alibaba’s next-level City Brain buildout in Kuala Lumpur and its related AI, cloud, and e-commerce presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s international investments, which for most of the last decade have fallen under the BRI brand, tend to center on more traditional physical infrastructure — ports, roads, rails, and energy. In Malaysia, however, technology emerged as the featured element. Even as SOE-driven real estate ventures, high-speed rail initiatives, port developments, and energy projects came and went and started and stopped again and again, China’s private tech players distinguished themselves by following through on projects and developing positive reputations among Malaysia’s consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-2010s, Malaysia’s need for digital infrastructure and its potential as a lucrative technology market also provided an opportunity for Chinese actors to engage under the purview of a new sub-brand of the BRI: the Digital Silk Road (DSR). While DSR projects are less likely to draw substantial financial resources from China’s export-oriented policy banks, by some measures the scope of the DSR already matches that of the regular BRI. However, only 16 countries have signed formal DSR-related memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with China, meaning the vast majority of DSR projects are moving forward at the subnational and sub-diplomatic level. Moreover, while Chinese SOEs overwhelmingly serve as the vanguard in BRI-branded projects around the world, among DSR-branded projects it is China’s private players that tend to be the lead actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, tech carried the flag in Malaysia for at least a decade, particularly as other projects faltered or were derailed by scandal — such as the massive 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption fiasco that rocked Malaysian politics starting in 2015. For the CCP, this meant that tech not only reinforced China’s reputation but also served its national interests by securing a valuable international relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huawei-leads-off-in-malaysias-tech-sector&quot;&gt;Huawei Leads Off in Malaysia’s Tech Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolstered by CCP Inc.’s systemic incubation, protection, reinforcement, and guidance of its national champions — followed in turn by flexible yet non-negotiable outbound marching orders, like China’s original Going Out policy, and later initiatives like the BRI and DSR — Huawei went to Malaysia in much the same way it went everywhere else. It also found commercial success in much the same way as it did elsewhere. The significant difference is the extent to which Huawei seemingly opened the door for more Chinese investment in Malaysia’s technology sphere, which eventually reached a level unseen in perhaps any other market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China in Malaysia, the 2000s and the beginning of the 2010s still involved substantial investment in local energy, natural resources, manufacturing, and transportation industries — all of which was typical for China in the 2000s and earlier, both in Malaysia and everywhere else. But Huawei’s arrival in the country signaled the beginning of a different dynamic. Increasingly, technology-related business, transactions, and investments began to dot the record of China’s activities in-country. Initially it was mainly Huawei itself, but eventually others began to follow, expanding a CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Huawei first entered Malaysia in 2001, its in-country activities began to truly scale up in 2011, when Huawei Marine was contracted to lay a 353-kilometer fiber-optic cable for Telekom Malaysia, PT XL Axiata Tbk, and PT Mora Telematika, connecting Indonesia and Malaysia. In the following decade, Huawei continued to build its footprint in Malaysia through a cascade of MOUs, investments, contracts, joint ventures, and other initiatives. In 2014, Huawei was selected to install 4G infrastructure across Malaysia. Huawei securing the contracts for, and then successfully building out, Malaysia’s 4G network changed the game going forward. Outside observers took little note at the time, but after Huawei’s 4G deal with Altel, the momentum began to build — not only for Huawei’s partnerships with Malaysia’s other aspiring 4G operators to develop, but also for additional Chinese firms like ZTE to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2014, Huawei signed an additional 4G deal with Malaysia’s U Mobile, and this time fellow tech giant ZTE was brought into the deal from the get-go. Shortly thereafter, ZTE would build its own commercial relationship with U Mobile. This kind of pattern would repeat itself with other Chinese firms across other digital projects, with Chinese companies often working in collaboration rather than competition. This behavior exemplifies how interconnectedness between Chinese companies in the CCP Inc. system boosts their collective market power. Rather than a unitary actor, Huawei was opening doors for other Chinese companies — including ones that could have been seen as competitors outside the collaborative ecosystem of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Huawei setting the stage in Malaysia for several years — and, importantly, doing well — the time eventually became ripe for a new generation of China’s outbound technology players to enter the scene. Alibaba would be the leader of this next charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alibaba-goes-to-malaysia&quot;&gt;Alibaba Goes to Malaysia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Alibaba staked its claim as an economic force in Southeast Asia by acquiring a $1 billion controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada, which at the time was one of Malaysia’s and Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce platforms. Helped by this reputational and branding boost and driven by the commercial logic of increasing its presence to support Lazada’s expansion, Alibaba’s participation in Malaysia’s technology ecosystem grew rapidly after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2016 and over the course of 2017, Alibaba became extremely prominent in Malaysia. Following its acquisition of Lazada, in March 2017 Alibaba announced a major e-commerce hub in collaboration with the Malaysian government, which also included deals between Ant Financial and Malaysia’s Commerce International Merchant Bankers Berhad (CIMB) and Maybank. Later in 2017, Alibaba Cloud opened a data center in Malaysia, brokered a deal to connect the first bilateral “e-hubs” between China’s Hangzhou municipal government and the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, and aided the development of a Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these corporate deals, Alibaba enjoyed close political ties to the Malaysian government. In 2017, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak visited Hangzhou meet with his “friend” Jack Ma and personally discuss the DFTZ. A pilgrimage to Hangzhou was representative of the kind of access Alibaba had with the Malaysian government at the time, and it was not a unique occurrence. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, Jack Ma met with Malaysia’s heads of state at least five times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Alibaba’s senior leaders regularly secured meetings and cohosted events with Malaysia’s senior political leaders, regardless of who was in power in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese diplomats regularly advocate for China’s flagship companies abroad, including the private players. Lobbying of this sort is relatively standard practice for most countries, but China’s leaders heavily imply to their foreign counterparts that doing business with China’s technology firms is the equivalent of doing business with China itself, particularly in the context of the BRI and the DSR. The diplomatic heft that China’s SOEs carry is more well known, but the private tech players often receive similar support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that China’s private companies are often associated with the Chinese state and the CCP has created unwanted political blowback for China’s tech and internet companies in the West. In Malaysia, however, this association has been much more beneficial. Alibaba has been able to meet with Malaysian delegations many times, both under the aegis of various BRI initiatives and independently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-1mdb-scandal-chinas-image-takes-a-hit-but-alibaba-gets-a-pass&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 1MDB Scandal: China’s Image Takes a Hit, but Alibaba Gets a Pass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Between 2015 and 2020, the Najib regime was brought down by a corruption scandal involving the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB, a government-run economic development agency). Najib and his associates were accused of, and eventually convicted of, channeling hundreds of millions of dollars of 1MDB’s assets into personal bank accounts. Following the scandal, media and judicial investigations alleged that China attempted to rescue Najib from his problems with 1MDB in exchange for green lights on preferred BRI projects. While China was not involved in the core of the 1MDB corruption scheme, Najib’s quagmire offered Beijing an opening to curry political favor and fast-track strategically important rail and energy projects.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Najib’s successor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, defeated Najib partially on an “anti-China” platform, raged against Najib’s supposedly excessive embrace of China, and blamed Najib for putting Malaysia in China’s debt. And yet, within three months of taking power, Mahathir visited Hangzhou to assure Jack Ma that Alibaba was still welcome and that Malaysia wanted to proceed with everything previously planned in the technology space. In this case, Alibaba’s status as a private company likely insulated it from some degree of anti-China backlash. However, the CCP Inc. integration of private companies into the fold of party control is reducing the plausibility of treating private companies as separate entities from the Chinese state.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion leaders in Malaysia have embraced the notion that transactions with Chinese tech firms are good for Malaysia-China relations, and local reporting indicates that Malaysia’s regulators can be quite purposeful in drawing these associations. One such source described a Malaysian politician seeking confirmation from his Chinese interlocutors that a particular project would be considered a part of the BRI. Another anecdote related the story of Malaysian regulators discussing the fact that Huawei had already received plenty of recent contracts and that it was time to give one to ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-huawei-and-alibaba-helped-other-chinese-companies-in-malaysia&quot;&gt;How Huawei and Alibaba Helped Other Chinese Companies in Malaysia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Malaysian government seeing developmental and diplomatic benefit in opening its doors ever wider to China, Alibaba continued to charge through, and others started to follow. Huawei, Alibaba, and their peers demonstrated that they could affordably provide Malaysia’s leaders and consumers with what they wanted, and this value delivery was apparently enough to redeem a vast array of China-related cybersecurity concerns, corruption scandals, and failed or stalled infrastructure projects, and even to weather a dramatic regime change — following the 1MDB scandal — that was partially anti-China in nature. This positive association between different Chinese companies demonstrates a strength of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, as newer tech companies benefited from the reputational foundations laid by Huawei and Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, China’s tech companies are warmly received in Malaysia, even as the U.S.-led campaign against Huawei has achieved many of its goals. The story is no longer about two flagship firms; now there are dozens of Chinese players extending into every element of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem. CCP Inc. has stalled to some degree in Malaysia in the 2020s, but many of its tech roots remain firmly in place, and Huawei and Alibaba are the two companies most responsible for growing those roots. A fuller timeline of individual business deals can be found in Appendix C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network of tech companies in Malaysia continued expanding throughout the 2010s, from Huawei to ZTE, to Alibaba and Ant Financial, to Tencent, then to services like Alipay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay, and eventually to less well-known Chinese tech players and services — such as Wuhan FiberHome Technologies, which signed an MOU with Malaysia’s PP Telecommunication Sdn Bhd in 2019. The dotted line between this cohort of companies is indicative of the mutually beneficial web that firms in the CCP Inc. ecosystem weave for one another in host countries. Although many of them compete on a micro level, on a macro level they open doors for each other as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alibabas-city-brain-huaweis-5g-push-and-the-pinnacle-of-china-tech-in-malaysia-20182020&quot;&gt;Alibaba’s City Brain, Huawei’s 5G Push, and the Pinnacle of China Tech in Malaysia, 2018–2020&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications firms continued to expand their prominence as Malaysia’s providers of choice for physical technology infrastructure, Alibaba began a new wave of local investment in AI, cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), and ultimately “smart cities” via its high-profile City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur. The latter years of the 2010s show a demonstrable difference in the nature (and participants) of China’s technology ventures in Malaysia. A wider range of companies became involved — like Tencent, UnionPay, SenseTime, China Unicom, and others — and the more “advanced” nature of the projects stands out. This transition aligned perfectly with the Malaysian leadership’s publicly stated intentions to develop Malaysia’s “knowledge economy” and its call for foreign investors to help facilitate the country’s tech evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, major Chinese engineering SOEs — who had been there the whole time, struggling to make progress on more traditional port, rail, and energy projects — began couching their in-country projects in high-tech terminology to match the catchphrases of their more successful private sector peers (suddenly every factory was “smart,” and every port used “AI”). Over the course of the 2010s, China’s foreign direct investment (FDI), construction, and financing in Malaysia began to show less emphasis on old-economy priorities (manufacturing, auto, energy, etc.), and more on real estate, smart infrastructure, technology parks, payments, and e-commerce. Alibaba’s entrance was a clear pivot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of tech- and telecom-related infrastructure contracts, MOUs, joint ventures, and multi-layered multi-partnered initiatives undertaken by China’s private enterprises in Malaysia already seemed vast prior to 2018. But after Alibaba’s City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur hit the headlines — described below — the magnitude of China’s tech endeavors hit another gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-tech-footprint-becomes-central-to-malaysias-development-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s Tech Footprint Becomes Central to Malaysia’s Development Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba pioneered its City Brain AI platform in Hangzhou in 2016 and 2017. At the time, it dovetailed perfectly with the CCP’s declared national technology priorities, which in that era centered on what increasingly came to be called “smart infrastructure.” Not surprisingly, this same “smart infrastructure” concept eventually migrated into the core talking points attached to the Digital Silk Road (DSR). In its role as a leading national tech company, Alibaba could thus be seen as both carrying out CCP policy and feeding into CCP policy with its technology innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Malaysian leaders came calling to Jack Ma to inquire about ways that Malaysia (in general), and Kuala Lumpur (specifically), could leverage Alibaba’s most cutting-edge AI solutions, City Brain was an obvious choice. Not only was the platform already blessed by Chinese policymakers, it also naturally lent itself to additional collaborative infrastructure buildouts (ideally by Chinese engineering firms), and it would tie a wide array of the city’s digital ecology to Chinese suppliers and Chinese IP. Furthermore, the scale of Kuala Lumpur as a testbed and proof of concept was highly attractive to both Alibaba and China’s DSR advocates. The goal, of course, was to do this again and again around the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City Brain itself is a package of AI-driven technologies designed to help improve city management. Cloud-based networks connect with street-level visual sensors, data collection points, municipal systems, security cameras, streetlights, city vehicles, public transit, emergency response teams, GPS trackers, and so on, and work to optimize all manner of functions (traffic being the most obvious and most commonly referenced). In Hangzhou, public and private video is incorporated, as is social media and big data gleaned from personal devices. In theory, all of this is (or will be) optimized to run on 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Alibaba itself provides only the software platform, AI programming, cloud services, and virtual digital infrastructure, there remains a huge array of physical infrastructure — electronic or otherwise — that needs to be put in place to operationalize City Brain. It is a perfect opportunity for a multifaceted CCP Inc. ecosystem of China tech suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) — which already had a track record of working with Alibaba — announced the City Brain project for Kuala Lumpur. It kicked off later that year with the installation of smart traffic lights at hundreds of intersections, and it eventually connected with a range of urban management systems like ambulances, emergency dispatches, and traffic control. Month-by-month progress is hard to track, but it appears that the early stages of implementation were successful, and that further functionality is meant to roll out in stages — although the pandemic seems to have slowed its progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As City Brain was capturing the imagination of the tech cognoscenti, Alibaba’s entire suite of digital solutions implanted itself in the Malaysian marketplace. Along with the ubiquity of Lazada and its logistical support from Cainiao, Ant Financial established cooperation agreements with numerous banks, Alipay appeared on smartphones, and Alibaba’s corporate cloud and AI business began integrating with Malaysia’s financial community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Huawei was trying to get out in front of a U.S.-led campaign against its 5G business by locking in its role in Malaysia’s next-gen telecom infrastructure. In February of 2019, Huawei announced an MOU with Malaysia’s Maxis Communications, centered on eventual 5G trials and “end-to-end systems and services” throughout the country. By October, Huawei and Maxis had a formal agreement on rolling out a nationwide 5G network, with Maxis as the service provider and Huawei handling the technology. By January of 2020, the two companies were planning a 5G-centric “TechCity” initiative and a joint 5G innovation lab. For Huawei, it looked as if a new cycle of deeper involvement in Malaysia was beginning, and ZTE and even state-owned China Unicom were conspicuously present as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 2010s, China’s tech FDI in Malaysia was accelerating at a remarkable rate. Alibaba and Huawei remained the leaders, but other Chinese companies were increasingly involved in Malaysia’s tech space as well; key examples of CCP Inc. collaboration in Malaysia include projects that do not even include a direct role for Alibaba or Huawei. After the flagship companies had paved the way, other, newer Chinese firms were able to ride in on their coattails, and even SOEs started to find new opportunities. According to RWR’s IntelTrak, from which many of these project data points derive, April 2019 marked the kickoff of a mega-project that encapsulates a potentially ideal outcome for CCP Inc. abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That month, it was reported that China’s SenseTime Group and G3 Global Berhad, a Malaysian ICT company specializing in IoT and AI, were exploring a collaboration with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC, a subsidiary of CCCC) to develop a $1 billion AI park over the next five years. The project’s goals were to promote technological developments in AI, grow Malaysia’s AI sector, and provide training to future workers at the AI park. Under the MOU, CHEC would provide infrastructure engineering and construction services, SenseTime would build an AI and supercomputing platform, and G3 would form partnerships with Malaysian government agencies, universities, and corporations in support of the park. At first, the AI park developers showed strong momentum. A few months after the agreement, SenseTime’s founder Tang Xiao’ou made Malaysian history as the first foreign national to be appointed as a board member of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, underscoring Malaysia’s interest in expanding technology investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nJo4vE2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: A CCP Inc. Microcosm in Malaysia.&lt;/strong&gt; SenseTime, G3 Global, and CHEC collaborate to build an AI park. Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources included in the text of the report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October of 2019, G3 secured a piece of land in Technology Park Malaysia for the new AI campus. The board of Technology Park Malaysia Corp reportedly awarded G3 the parcel of land over other applicants due to the impressive international (Chinese) names that were affiliated with their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, however, the AI park project has made little measurable progress, and the original MOU recently expired. However, in April 2022, the original three parties (G3, SenseTime, and CHEC) reiterated their commitment to following through on their partnership. While company press releases do not specify what derailed the initial development of the AI park, it is likely that the pandemic, the long delay in cross-border investment activities, and shifting political winds all played a role. However, the partnership between SenseTime and G3 Global remains strong; in G3’s 2021 annual report, the company names SenseTime as an important partner for supporting AI initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-beginning-of-the-end&quot;&gt;The Covid-19 Pandemic and the Beginning of the End&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 2010s and the start of the 2020s, Malaysia had begun to perceive itself as a relatively technologically advanced country (especially compared to most of its neighbors). It is not a stretch to say that Malaysia owed much of this confident self-perception to the work of Chinese technology companies. Moreover, the locally and regionally produced literature and reporting suggests that many Malaysians are keenly aware of this cause and effect. By 2020, China had its hooks firmly in Malaysia’s tech space, and the hooks appeared to be mostly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networking among Chinese companies in Malaysia continued in 2020; for example, Tencent signed an MOU that year with China Construction Bank’s Labuan Branch in Malaysia to use Tencent Cloud sevices and WeChat Pay. However, it soon became clear that early 2020 represented a peak for both Alibaba and Huawei domestically and internationally, including specifically in Malaysia. The sum total of technology investment activities by the two companies and their Chinese technology peers — as measured by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;As), MOUs, and other announcements captured by the RWR IntelTrak database — dropped into the single digits for the 12-month period. By the end of the year, it was clear that the façade of China’s technology dominance in Malaysia was cracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-liabilities-of-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;The Liabilities of CCP Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Suspicion and Internal Crackdowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, Huawei’s and Alibaba’s business momentum have been curtailed by the same CCP Inc. ecosystem that helped cultivate their success. The story behind the different sets of challenges faced by Huawei and Alibaba provides a useful two-pronged lesson. The reversals demonstrate that China struggles to achieve its goals internationally just as much as any other major power. Moreover, the stumbles by both companies show that corporate association with, and reliance on, CCP Inc. can turn from a boon to a liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After early 2020, Chinese activities in Malaysia essentially froze for at least two years, well into 2022. Three fundamental causes of this sudden change of fortune can be identified, and all emerged from outside of Malaysia itself. First, to be sure, was the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to an immediate suspension of person-to-person contacts and travel, as well as the suspension of — or long delays in — cross-border investment activities. China’s corporate advance in Southeast Asia was just as constrained by lockdowns and travel restrictions as every other cross-border activity. A large proportion of publicly reported announcements and activities by China’s SOEs and private enterprises in Malaysia that year centered on PPE donations, health-related collaborations, and other philanthropic or corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, two other factors more closely related to the nature of CCP Inc. itself played a more important role. The close association between private firms and Chinese government and party networks led to debilitating external blowback against many Chinese firms — and against no one more than Huawei. In Malaysia, Huawei likely lost important 5G telecom contracts due to this new sensitivity. Finally, in addition to external pressure against CCP Inc., the shifting relationship between the CCP and prominent private sector actors within China became a third factor challenging the system. In this case, it was Alibaba that became a case study on how China’s symbiotic government-to-private-sector relations can turn sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s crackdown on private sector champions over the last few years indicates that the success of a company like Alibaba is no longer of chief concern to the decisionmakers in Beijing. Alibaba was not perceived to be in lockstep with the party’s ideology, and therefore its wings were clipped, despite its lofty position as China’s most well-regarded company internationally. Under the growth-oriented mentality that was once dominant among China’s top leadership, this outcome would have been unlikely, as Alibaba’s China-enhancing stature abroad would likely have given the company more political wiggle room at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei, on the other hand, has enjoyed reinvigorated state support in recent years. For such on-side private companies, there are costs and benefits attached to being politically lumped in with SOEs. While their strategic scope of operations may become more limited, the ease of doing business within approved parameters tends to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost-benefit analysis becomes more complicated abroad, however. Excessive proximity to, and alignment with, the CCP can become a reputational stain internationally and create intractable challenges for a private company’s global ambitions. For many of China’s most prominent tech companies, the situation has become extremely delicate. Huawei is the most obvious example of CCP adjacency becoming more of a hindrance than a boon, but dozens of other private sector Chinese firms have found themselves constrained internationally for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huawei-becomes-the-poster-child-for-international-suspicion-of-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Huawei Becomes the Poster Child for International Suspicion of CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While connectivity to an ecosystem of banks, regulators, SOEs, and other Chinese state actors helped Huawei develop into a global tech powerhouse, those connections later became tripwires for Huawei’s international operations. Since the late 2000s, concern about its close ties to the Chinese government have complicated business deals and engendered suspicion from international governments — chief among them the United States. This trend has intensified in the past few years with the United States’ effective blacklisting of Huawei in 2019 and the decisions by a growing number of U.S. partners to bar Huawei from their 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through various legal and administrative mechanisms, Huawei was slowly disconnected from U.S. technology supply chains, a development that eventually crippled many of Huawei’s most prominent businesses. Arguably just as devastating was the Trump administration‘s diplomatic campaign against Huawei‘s involvement in 5G infrastructure around the world, an effort that continues under the Biden administration. The Trump administration emphasized to allies and unaligned countries that if they allowed Huawei to be a part of their 5G rollouts, they risked their relationship with the U.S. national security apparatus and their access to intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2020 and 2021, country, after country, after country, announced they would not be using Huawei for next-generation telecommunications buildouts. Some countries explicitly banned Huawei, while others moved away from the company more quietly. While the U.S. campaign of pressure and persuasion played a key role in swaying allies, it was not U.S. concerns alone that drove countries away from Huawei. Australia, for one, also harbored deep concerns about Huawei’s state ties — in fact, according to media reports, this helped sway the Trump administration toward a harder line on Huawei. Meanwhile, moves away from Huawei in European countries came amid a broader downturn in China’s relationship with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Trump administration, the United States ratcheted up a rhetorical, regulatory, and diplomatic campaign against Huawei on the basis that Huawei technology constitutes a security risk due to the firm’s close ties to the Chinese state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Q2 2020, Huawei shipped more smartphones than any other company in the world, exceeding Apple and Samsung’s totals for the first time ever. This would prove to be Huawei’s peak. With no access to Google’s operating systems, no way to supply its customers with many globally popular apps, and — most importantly — no way to replenish its stock of advanced U.S.-designed semiconductors, Huawei’s decline was swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2020, Huawei spun off its largest smartphone brand, Honor, in an attempt to preserve that subsidiary’s ability to continue operating (via a deal that was itself an excellent example of CCP Inc. in action). By late 2021, Huawei was no longer in the top 10 among global smartphone producers, and the company was regularly reporting staggering quarterly losses. All told, Huawei’s revenue dropped by 28.6 percent in 2021, reversing years of steady growth (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n3TT22O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Huawei’s Annual Revenue.&lt;/strong&gt; Years of steady growth in Huawei’s annual revenue dropped off in 2021.

&lt;p&gt;Most salient for this report is Huawei’s 5G fate in Malaysia. The company had been Malaysia’s provider of choice for its 4G rollout for many years, had long-established working relationships with Malaysia’s largest mobile service providers and internet service providers, and, over the course of 2018 and 2019, had signed numerous MOUs with those same companies designating Huawei as the vendor of choice for Malaysia’s eventual 5G rollout. Nonetheless, in mid-2021 Huawei lost its bid to provide Malaysia’s new 5G telecommunications network. Kuala Lumpur chose Sweden’s Ericsson instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia’s political leaders offered no formal explanation as to why they spurned Huawei. Analytically, however, two obvious explanations stand out: first, the U.S. pressure campaign probably addled nerves, even in a China-friendly capital like Kuala Lumpur; and second, potential clients have likely lost faith that Huawei can maintain its status as a long-term reliable provider of cutting-edge technology services now that the company lacks access to advanced U.S. semiconductors and other related inputs. It is difficult to measure the impact of backlash against Huawei in nations that have not taken an explicit stance for or against the company. To be sure, a growing number of nations have barred the company from their networks — but at the same time, Huawei is growing its business in other international markets. Huawei faces massive challenges, but given the strong support it receives from CCP Inc., it will likely survive, maintaining its infrastructure equipment sales and pursuing initiatives like providing telecom services and manufacturing components for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ccp-vs-alibaba&quot;&gt;The CCP vs. Alibaba&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s political problems with China’s regulators over the past two years have also been well-documented, and in many ways the company’s fate has been far more shocking than Huawei’s. Numerous voices in the U.S. national security community had long been calling for the ostracization of Huawei, and when those voices got their wish, the results were at least somewhat predictable (although the magnitude of the success was perhaps surprising to some). For Alibaba, however, almost no one predicted the company’s twist of fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, Alibaba’s own government began a political, regulatory, and legislative assault on China’s private sector “platform economy” internet giants, of which Alibaba is by far the largest. Due to Alibaba’s stature — and, perhaps, due to an ill-timed contentious speech in which Alibaba founder Jack Ma criticized China’s financial system — the company quickly became the poster child for what was eventually dubbed China’s “techlash.” Beijing’s crackdown on China’s internet companies centered on anti-monopoly investigations, corruption probes, stringent new privacy and data security regulations, strict new anti-“unfair competition” rules, burdensome cybersecurity inspections, and ramped-up penalties for non-compliant financial practices.83 Alibaba at one time or another came under the microscope for almost all of these and endured wave after wave of fines and penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the U.S. assault on Huawei, China’s assault on its own digital economy champions led to an inevitable slide in business performance for the targeted companies, particularly Alibaba. By the end of 2021, Alibaba’s revenue growth and profits had cratered to historically low levels. Previously high-flying portions of its business, like advertising, suddenly flatlined. Its market valuation suffered commensurately: in October 2020 Alibaba was worth $837.84 billion, but by November 2022 that figure had fallen below $200 billion, a decline of more than three-quarters. Alibaba’s shareholders have lost nearly all of their gains since the company’s IPO in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0mbcVrq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Alibaba’s Stock Value.&lt;/strong&gt; Since its peak in September 2020, Alibaba’s stock has steadily declined in value. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/baba/history/&quot;&gt;“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA),” Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba does not delineate its financial performance in individual foreign markets in its quarterly or annual reports, so there is no way to be certain how much its struggles at home have impacted its business in Malaysia. However, from a qualitative perspective, open-source media chatter on Alibaba’s investment activities in Malaysia has dropped off considerably, as have discussions about expanding the company’s much-vaunted City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the technocrats in China enacting this assault on Alibaba’s business model are for the most part members of the bureaucracy, the driver of the initiative was certainly the CCP itself. Movements of this magnitude, and decisions of this much consequence, can only arise from the top. And once the decision is made to shift gears on a governance concept — in this case, the decision to unwind and reconstitute the previous approach to developing the domestic internet economy — the entire legal-governmental apparatus falls into lockstep. For Alibaba, the very same CCP-centric ecosystem that had succored, built up, and unleashed the company upon the world became a suffocating burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccp-inc-as-political-risk&quot;&gt;CCP Inc. as Political Risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new dual-pronged threat (external pressure and internal pressure) does not bode well for China’s next generation of technology stars or its current roster of platform economy heavy hitters. With Washington and its allies increasingly hostile to China’s telecommunications companies and device manufacturers, alongside Beijing’s enduring disapproval of China’s e-commerce, social networking, gaming, and digital service providers, it is hard to envision another Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, or ByteDance emerging on an international scale. Had the CCP not initiated its techlash, Meituan might have become as consequential in Southeast Asia as Alibaba by now, and DiDi might have had a chance to compete with Uber around the world. At the moment, both of these outcomes seem extremely far off, if not entirely precluded. Similarly, companies like SMIC, SenseTime, and Hikvision might be destined to go the way of Huawei, thanks to their close association with the CCP in the eyes of Western capitals. The Biden administration’s October 2022 semiconductor export restrictions underline that in the United States, political will to target China’s strategic technology capabilities is bipartisan and enduring across administrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party’s regulatory assault on its platform economy giants will eventually end — but it is unclear how strong the companies will be that manage to rebound from the storm. The existing mega-players are much weakened, and even though they will likely once again be encouraged by Beijing to expand abroad, the resources they will be able to bring to bear in foreign markets will likely be much reduced. Presumably, the party will one day look to these firms to reintegrate with CCP Inc. abroad, but only time will tell the extent to which they will be able to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, the CCP and its political-economy systems remain at the core of the story for companies like Huawei and Alibaba, both at home and abroad in places like Malaysia. Both those companies are, and will forever be, enmeshed in a network of politicized interests, benefits, and constraints that will continuously have outsized influence on their successes or failures over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Make of China’s Tech Story in Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s technology players in a country like Malaysia, the party-state sets the direction, provides starting-gate advantages, and, where possible, uses diplomatic leverage to open doors, but companies like Huawei and Alibaba still need to succeed in the host country on their own merits. If and when they succeed, the floodgates open for the rest of China’s players, and the full CCP Inc. ecosystem of mutual reinforcement kicks into gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these political interlinkages, it is important to acknowledge the fundamentally commercial nature of most of China’s tech investments in places like Malaysia. Companies like Huawei and Alibaba arrived years ago with huge advantages derived from their subsidized home front, but they also arrived with the intention to make money, and neither firm would likely have stuck around if business were bad — nor would they have been welcome if their goods and services failed to serve Malaysia’s consumers and national interests. As for Beijing, the lines between “commercial” and “strategic” success abroad have become blurred, and the concepts now often dovetail within the CCP’s more modernized authoritarian ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to assess how much of China’s tech presence in Malaysia came about because of the urgings of the party-state and how much arose from the individual firms’ rational business strategies. One could reasonably make the case that both Huawei and Alibaba would have gone to Malaysia even had the CCP never sent out the pro-expansion signal nor offered so many layers of assistance. The leaders of Huawei and Alibaba are astute businessmen who understood early on that their technical capabilities and experience were readily transferable to new markets such as Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments are valid, but they are perhaps no longer salient. China’s private sector technology companies have found success abroad because of both their home country’s party-state ecosystem and their own commercial imperatives and abilities. Whether one element or the other deserves the most credit is not the most important question; the issue is rather the extent to which this outcome matters. How should Western companies and policymakers think about and respond to this type of success? Is the Huawei treatment the correct and justifiable approach? Is it excessive? Is it not enough? Should more private sector Chinese companies be saddled with similar constraints? What might be the consequences if they are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Malaysia model from the 2010s is still intact, and it could be revived. One needs look no further than the statement in April 2022 that the original three parties to the AI campus within Technology Park Malaysia (G3, SenseTime, and CHEC) were renewing their commitment to the project and their partnership. Such arrangements have the potential to serve as a template for other countries as the DSR regains momentum. Arguably, a similar process is already underway in places like Indonesia, Ethiopia, and to some extent even Russia (a process that may pause due the threat of sanctions over Ukraine, but which will likely ramp up considerably once the war is over). U.S., European, and Japanese competitors of Huawei, Alibaba, ZTE, Tencent, and the rest can expect to find a similar network of CCP Inc. players in every nonaligned emerging market in the world, save perhaps India’s. The case study of Huawei and Alibaba in Malaysia provides useful insight for understanding future CCP Inc. business expansion into international markets — as well as the critical internal and external challenges facing members of the CCP Inc. ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

Legacy arms control tools had little utility as Russia eschewed arms control agreements and transparency-based risk reduction measures.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russian aggression has included direct and indirect nuclear threats, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s statement on September 21, 2022: “They [NATO] have even resorted to the nuclear blackmail. . . . I would like to remind those who make such statements regarding Russia that our country has different types of weapons as well.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is forcing a reckoning for the arms control community on the utility of arms control and risk reduction tools, many of which are designed to lower the chances of inadvertent escalation, in the face of an actor who intentionally escalates crises and uses nuclear weapons for coercion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reckoning comes as the United States also wrestles with how to deter two peer competitors, given China’s growing strategic arsenal and regional ambitions. In 2020, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) commander Admiral Charles Richard stated, “We are on a trajectory for the first time in our nation’s history to face two peer nuclear-capable competitors who have to be deterred differently, and we’re working very hard to meet that challenge.” And the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy outlines the need to compete with China as a pacing challenge while accounting for the acute threat from Russia. If arms control is to have a future, it will have to work in tandem with these changing deterrence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Project on Nuclear Issues published a study, Integrated Arms Control in an Era of Strategic Competition, that offered a vision for the future of arms control evolving in parallel with integrated deterrence. Integrated arms control may go beyond the rigid structures that have shaped legacy U.S.-Russia arms control agreements by adopting new modalities, incorporating new systems, and including new actors. This policy paper applies the principles of integrated arms control to the changing deterrence landscape and argues that because arms control and deterrence work hand in hand, future U.S. arms control efforts will have to adapt to the changing strategic necessity of deterring two peer competitors. However, arms control remains a path worth pursuing because of its benefits to strategic stability, risk reduction, transparency, and predictability. How the United States and arms control partners apply these principles will be determined by a variety of factors, including the outcome of the war in Ukraine and U.S. decisions about force posture. To be clear, prospects for arms control in the short term are not a cause for optimism; rather, this paper is intended as a first step in identifying the key questions that will determine the role of arms control while deterring two peer competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will first examine ways that the war in Ukraine may impact prospects for arms control, then pose first-order questions about future U.S. arms control policy. In so doing, it assumes Russia will remain a peer strategic competitor with a sizeable nuclear arsenal. Even if Russia emerges from the Ukraine crisis with significantly depleted conventional forces, its nuclear arsenal will be of even greater importance. The paper also assumes that China will continue on its current trajectory of expanding its strategic arsenal. It concludes that balancing integrated arms control and integrated deterrence in the face of two peer competitors should focus on five priorities: 1) tailoring arms control to match deterrence requirements; 2) developing short-term risk reduction measures; 3) furthering allies’ strategic priorities; 4) continuing U.S. strategic modernization; and 5) competing in emerging technologies while also exploring arms control opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-arms-control&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for Arms Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, threatened to undermine not only European security and the wider international order but also the practice of arms control. The war in Ukraine has seen conventional forces deployed on a scale unprecedented since the collapse of the Soviet Union, prompted fears of nuclear and chemical weapons use, and poisoned prospects for dialogue on reducing or limiting nuclear weapons in the near term. Russia’s activities in Ukraine have already proven to be damaging to international arms control and disarmament efforts, driving Moscow’s decision to block consensus at the 2022 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. Russian diplomats objected to the inclusion of language in the final document expressing concern about operations and security at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, arguing it was designed “to settle scores with Russia by raising issues that are not directly related to the treaty.” Although arms control has been under strain for at least a decade, the war in Ukraine has highlighted its limits in preventing intentional aggression and escalation. At the same time, arms control has made Russia’s military buildup over the years more transparent and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, it is worth recalling what arms control is and what it is not. In their classic volume Strategy and Arms Control, Thomas Schelling and Morton Halperin defined arms control as “all the forms of military cooperation between potential enemies in the interest of reducing the likelihood of war, its scope and violence if it occurs, and the political and economic costs of being prepared for it.” As they described, competition and cooperation can coexist in arms control agreements. Arms control efforts do not necessarily entail disarmament or arms reductions; indeed, as Schelling and Halperin noted, “Any agreement that reduced the capability for destruction in general war might make war more likely, in that the costs and risks in initiating it would not appear as great.” Arms control is a tool for managing — rather than eliminating — competition and armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrated arms control is a twenty-first-century tool that can be used while balancing competition and cooperation. It offers an approach that is more flexible than many historical arms control mechanisms and can include a diversity of actors, verification tools, and formats, ranging from bilateral treaties to informal multilateral risk reduction efforts. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tested the utility of arms control and raises difficult questions about prospects for future cooperation. Although the war continues at the time of writing, a series of lessons learned can still be hypothesized regarding what the war will mean for arms control going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the limits of arms control and risk reduction tools focused primarily on avoiding misperception or inadvertent escalation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most historical arms control efforts centered on crisis stability and arms race stability, with an underlying assumption that crisis escalation would be due to misperception, inadvertency, or accident. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not an accident. It was not due to misperception of Ukrainian, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO), or U.S. interests in the sense originally envisioned by most arms control theorists — although Putin may have overestimated his own military capabilities, misjudged Ukraine’s resolve, and underestimated NATO’s unity. The invasion cannot be blamed on a lack of crisis communication channels. The war in Ukraine was not a failure of existing risk reduction measures. Rather, most arms control tools were not matched to the nature of the Russian threat and intentional escalation. Presently, Russian and Chinese strategies for competition with the United States involve manipulation of risk underpinned by a growing reliance on nuclear weapons for coercion during a crisis. They do not want to reduce risks in certain scenarios. Combined with increasingly complex and integrated conventional and nuclear systems, these emerging adversary strategies will move future crises further from the Cold War–era escalation ladder and warrant a reassessment of the U.S. crisis management and arms control tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second, Russian noncompliance with treaties and arms control norms is indicative of a broader aggressive turn in its strategic posture and intentions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has consistently violated arms control obligations, including its 2007 suspension of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), violation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and rollback of Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs. Additionally, it has used chemical agents as tools of assassination and continued to support the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria despite its use of chemical agents in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Moscow has drawn down participation in numerous cooperative risk reduction activities, decreased decisionmaking transparency, and backstopped its actions with nuclear threats. These data points reflect a wider trend of Russia attempting to remake the international order. In this case, arms control has served as a canary in the coal mine to the Kremlin’s broader strategic intentions; while many of these agreements may now be moot, they point to an enduring value of arms control for adding transparency and predictability to an otherwise opaque and ambiguous actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third, nuclear weapons are of increasing strategic value to ambitious autocrats hoping to pursue opportunistic aggression and risk manipulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has relied on nuclear weapons throughout the Ukraine crisis for both implicit and explicit bullying, announcing on February 27, 2022, “orders to the defense minister and chief of General Staff to introduce a special combat duty regime in the Russian army’s deference [deterrence] forces.” The reference in the September 21 speech to “existential” risks to Russia — and the alleged threat of Ukraine invading Russian territory — is a direct link to Russian strategic doctrine. Russian policy holds that nuclear weapons may be employed to counter “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.” It should be assumed that China is closely watching how Putin uses nuclear threats in Ukraine. Adversary escalation strategies rest on the assumption that they have several asymmetric advantages relative to the United States in stakes, geography, and authoritarian decisionmaking structure that would allow them to credibly threaten escalation in limited wars to the point of deterring U.S. activity in the region. Russia has attempted to leverage these asymmetries in Ukraine, along with integrating military and nonmilitary tools across phases of conflict, albeit with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, rising tensions with China during the war in Ukraine may be a harbinger of future challenges for the United States in deterring two peer competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For the United States, nuclear deterrence has typically been a two-party game, and while some attention has historically been paid to the potential for China to become a nuclear competitor, this possibility has been comparatively limited until the past decade. The recent quantitative and qualitative expansion of Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals has already offered a preview of future competition. In the midst of the Ukraine war, China has for the first time conducted live-fire exercises in areas Taiwan claims as its own territorial waters, demarcating six training areas that encircled the island for four days. Future nuclear arms control between major powers will have to address multiple actors and domains. Traditional arms control tools, including treaties, may struggle to incorporate and verify any limits on strategic systems. Additionally, arms control with only one competitor could create an opportunity for the other to pursue strategic superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arms control has served as a canary in the coal mine to the Kremlin’s broader strategic intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy outlined five principles for integrated deterrence, offering a vision that leverages all the tools of national power to deter adversaries through integration across domains, regions, the continuum of conflict, the U.S. government, and allies. As the United States moves toward a strategy of integrated deterrence, so too should it pursue a strategy of integrated arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the new challenges of an uncertain and rapidly changing strategic environment, the fundamental role of arms control as a complementary tool to deterrence has not changed. Indeed, the lessons learned from Ukraine should be to return to the first principles of arms control: negotiating agreements between competitors that can avoid war and escalation, balancing competition and cooperation, and flexibly adapting to a changing technological and geopolitical landscape. The increasingly complex and integrated conventional and nuclear systems at the core of Russian and Chinese strategy demand equally integrated strategies for deterrence and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, the U.S. interagency and its allies and partners should address first-order questions about whether arms control is in the national interest. The future of arms control will depend on the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would the United States want arms control with Russia or China?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should be the focus of arms control efforts with Russia and China: crisis management, arms racing, or nuclear or nonnuclear capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who should be the focus of U.S. strategic arms control efforts: Russia, China, or both simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When should the United States engage Russia and China in arms control?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the United States incentivize Russia and China to join arms control efforts while also strengthening deterrence?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring each of these questions in turn can help identify arms control opportunities for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the United States moves toward a strategy of integrated deterrence, so too should it pursue a strategy of integrated arms control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; would arms control with Russia or China be in the U.S. national interest? The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) lists the goals of arms control as “greater transparency and predictability, enhanced stability, reduced reliance on nuclear weapons and, ultimately, a world without nuclear weapons.” Historically the “why” behind arms control was a bit simpler: to avoid nuclear war. Strategic stability was a conceptual tool for ensuring a survivable second strike, which arguably would deter any nuclear escalation and war. On a practical level, it may be in the United States’ interest to set limits on Russian tactical nuclear weapons or China’s growing strategic arsenal, but decisionmakers should first reflect on the underlying reasons to pursue cooperation. U.S. arms control efforts should begin with a “why” that drives any subsequent agreements, whether it is to avoid nuclear war, strengthen strategic stability, or reduce risks of escalation. Of course, both Moscow and Beijing would demand something in exchange for any U.S. arms control efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; should be the focus of arms control efforts with Russia and China: crisis management, arms racing, or nuclear or nonnuclear capabilities? Perhaps a harder question is what would the United States give up in exchange for any limits on Russian or Chinese systems? Russia and China have been continuously modernizing their strategic arsenals both quantitatively and qualitatively, whereas the United States is just now replacing all three legs of the triad. In blunt terms, there is not much “fat to trim” in the current U.S. nuclear arsenal if it also hopes to deter two peer competitors. What, therefore, could the United States offer Russia and China, and what would Washington want in return? The answers to these questions will ultimately depend on U.S. decisions about using force posture to deter two peer competitors. Force posture and sizing have historically driven strategic arms control agreements, not the other way around. But more informal arms control efforts, such as risk reduction measures or crisis communication, are not as directly tied to force posture and could be pursued independently, drawing on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine to avoid escalation in future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; should be the focus of U.S. strategic arms control efforts: Russia, China, or both simultaneously? A fundamental question for deterring two peer competitors is whether they are acting in concert or independently. The answer to this question might also change over time and the continuum of conflict, with adversaries cooperating during peacetime but splitting during a crisis or vice versa. An essential component of integrated deterrence is tailoring the multitude of deterrence tools to an adversary. Integrated arms control will also need to be tailored to two peer competitors; parallel bilateral agreements — each with its own format, timelines, and objectives — may be better suited for this. While a trilateral, legally binding, nuclear arms control agreement may be useful as an aspirational polestar, unwavering commitment to the pursuit of such an agreement in the current strategic environment may prove burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; should the United States engage Russia and China in arms control? Pressure on Washington is likely to increase with the approaching expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in 2026 and from the NPT community to demonstrate progress on arms control and disarmament. But cooperation with Russia on any strategic issues is politically risky in the near future. The present U.S.-Russia relationship is defined by crisis management and attempts to strengthen deterrence against further escalation, as well as by assuring European allies. International opinion remains firmly with Ukraine, and Eastern European allies might perceive any overtures to Moscow for dialogue as concessionary or a sign of waning U.S. commitment. To be sure, now is not the time for in-depth arms control dialogue with Russia. But when the war in Ukraine ends, Washington will still face a hard choice. On the one hand, post-conflict environments are historically a prime opportunity for arms control; on the other hand, President Joe Biden has labeled Putin a “war criminal,” meaning any future dialogue and cooperation will require delicate communications and explanations for allies and the public. Engaging with Beijing will face similar timing challenges as China continues to expand its arsenal. Leadership in Washington should pursue arms control with Moscow and Beijing when the geopolitical climate permits — and when there is a clear “why” and “what” to justify arms control overtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; can the United States pursue arms control with Russia and China? Will the format be bilateral or trilateral, formal or informal? And what are the incentives for Moscow and Beijing to join? Arms control can range from treaties to more informal agreements. In a 1985 edition of their original work, Schelling and Halperin lamented, “We regret that informal understandings and unilateral actions seem to have taken a back seat to the quest for formal agreements,” seeing potential for arms control in informal and unilateral agreements. Following the war in Ukraine, Russia’s conventional forces will likely be depleted, and it may react by increasing reliance on its nuclear deterrent. Moscow may be reluctant to agree to any limits on its strategic forces in such a climate, although this will depend on the outcome of the war. Likewise, arms control is seemingly at odds with China’s expanding arsenal. Moreover, the transparency that typically accompanies arms control goes against current Chinese practices. But there are also potential incentives for Russia and China to engage in arms control over time. First and foremost, the war in Ukraine may prove to be a “reality check” on nuclear risks and escalation for the entire international community, similar to the environment following the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, as Russia will be forced to rebuild its conventional forces and China faces economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, neither country can easily afford an arms race with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An essential component of integrated deterrence is tailoring the multitude of deterrence tools to an adversary. Integrated arms control will also need to be tailored to two peer competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-priorities-for-arms-control-after-ukraine&quot;&gt;Five Priorities for Arms Control after Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has identified a series of priorities for arms control going forward, to include reestablishing leadership in arms control, emphasizing strategic stability, and avoiding costly arms racing. Balancing the requirements for deterring two peer competitors with the commitment to leading on arms control presents numerous challenges. These include rebuilding interest and confidence in arms control as a practice for strengthening strategic stability, particularly within Congress, in addition to the questions raised above. Obviously, the specifics of what arms control will look like amid deterring two peer competitors cannot be predicted, as this will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the war in Ukraine and U.S. force-posture decisions, but this paper offers five priorities that can guide such efforts: tailoring arms control to adversaries, using short-term risk reduction tools, supporting allies’ strategic interests, continuing nuclear modernization, and integrating emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trilateral arms control is a tempting prospect of “one treaty to rule them all;” however, as previously mentioned, achieving this is unlikely and may not be the best means for deterring two peer competitors. What deters Moscow will not necessarily resonate in Beijing, and vice versa. Future arms control with Russia may need to prioritize conventional forces, as both NATO members and Russia have made a push for defense production of conventional capabilities, including tanks and artillery, during the war in Ukraine. Future arms control with Russia will also likely have to prioritize tactical nuclear weapons given the quantitative imbalance. Conversely, arms control with China might be better focused on capturing its growing strategic nuclear arsenal or nonnuclear strategic capabilities, along with emerging technologies. Forcing a trilateral version of New START in the near to mid-term may serve little strategic purpose and fail to contribute to integrated deterrence and strategic stability if it holds cooperation with one adversary hostage to cooperation with the other. The U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China rivalries do not resemble each other, nor should arms control. Instead, the United States can pursue parallel, concentrated bilateral efforts to strengthen deterrence vis-à-vis Moscow and Beijing, respectively, while also pursuing multilateral efforts when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future arms control prospects appear grim and may take years to materialize. In the meantime, the United States and its allies should prioritize short-term risk reduction measures. This might take the form of confidence-building exercises — or establishing codes of conduct and rules of the road. In 2020, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace offered specific risk reduction proposals, such as data exchanges, transparency for warhead storage facilities, and launch notification agreements. When the United States can return to dialogue with Russia — or perhaps in the context of the P5 Process, a set of ongoing dialogues among the five countries the NPT designates as “nuclear weapon states” — these transparency measures could be part of a wider discussion on risk reduction. In addition to practical risk reduction measures, norms and rules of the road can also play a role in limiting the deployment of emerging technologies or potentially destabilizing nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. During this interlude, the United States can also build capacity for future arms control efforts, such as training the next generation of negotiators and inspectors and promoting interagency expertise, including among the U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third priority for post-Ukraine arms control while deterring two peer competitors will be furthering allies’ strategic interests — though this will not be straightforward. A strong deterrent (and, therefore, strong extended deterrent) should be at the forefront of U.S. strategic planning. Yet European and Asian allies have different understandings of U.S. credibility, security cooperation agreements, and threat perceptions regarding various adversaries. Arms control agreements need to take into account U.S. forward-deployed assets, military exercises, or other forms of cooperation with allies. Future arms control efforts will have to engage allies early and ensure that cooperation with an adversary does not come at the cost of credibility with an ally. This is not a new challenge for the United States, but it will be increasingly complex in the face of two peer competitors, multiple arms control channels, and increasingly anxious allies. The need to tailor assurance to allies is another reason to consider parallel tracks when engaging Moscow and Beijing on arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these cooperation efforts, the United States should continue with its nuclear modernization and plan to compete with Russia and China in advanced technologies. In a testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services on September 20, 2022, chair of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States Madelyn Creedon pointed to the importance of continuing to modernize all three legs of the nuclear triad, which she said had the support of the public and Congress. Other experts have warned, “As things stand today, it is not at all clear that within a few years the U.S. will retain enough to deter two well-armed nuclear competitors.” In addition, Rose Gottemoeller, a member of the commission, stressed the need to “rebuild our industrial capacity” in both the public and private sectors in order to compete with two adversaries. This need for improved capacity and competition is particularly important in advanced technologies. Although emerging technologies, such as AI-enabled and hypersonic weapons, have not played a major role in the war in Ukraine to date, their potential strategic importance should not be ruled out, especially as China is likely to have more success with these technologies than Russia and their military utility is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-arms-control-options&quot;&gt;Future Arms Control Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future arms control options will ultimately depend on when and how the war in Ukraine ends, U.S. force posture decisions to deter two peer competitors, and wider geopolitical trends. Taking this into account, however, the framework of integrated arms control can help identify potential options that would contribute to avoiding nuclear war, strengthening strategic stability, and reducing risks of escalation. At the one end of the spectrum would be negotiating a New START follow-on — such as a treaty setting an overall warhead cap, to include both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons — between the United States and Russia before the treaty expires in 2026. Meanwhile, Washington might more actively engage China on bilateral risk reduction efforts or through multilateral forums, such as the P5 Process, to ensure there is always a “human in the loop” in nuclear decisionmaking and launch command. A trilateral version of a warhead ceiling treaty might be an option in the early 2030s if China’s arsenal continues to grow as expected. At the other end of the spectrum might be informal agreements, such as a trilateral commitment to refrain from cyberattacks on each other’s nuclear command and control, along with specific critical infrastructure targets. To reduce risks of crisis outbreak and escalation, nonnuclear opportunities for arms control could draw on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, such as how risk reduction measures did or did not manage escalation, or building guardrails to slow the pace of future crises, such as “rules of the road” in contested geographical regions or poorly regulated domains like the information ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control will need to remain a tool of simultaneous competition and cooperation in the era of deterring two peer competitors. This presents numerous challenges for U.S. policymakers, who have to determine what the priority for arms control should be, whether to engage Russia and China individually or separately, and how to structure future agreements. The original principles of arms control — preventing war, managing competition, and maintaining flexibility — can continue to guide such efforts, but should be revisited and updated to reflect lessons learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine, along with the changing technological and geopolitical landscape. Integrated arms control, working in tandem with integrated deterrence, is the best way forward, albeit a challenging one.&lt;/p&gt;

The two oldest U.S. security alliances in the region — with the Philippines and Australia — illustrate this clearly.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The U.S. alliance with Australia has never been stronger. By contrast, the United States’ alliance with the Philippines has barely survived a period of deep uncertainty and remains fragile and underdeveloped, posing significant challenges and risks to U.S. defense strategy and interests. It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Australia shore up the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), the United States is engaged in long-term strategic competition with China that is playing out with particular intensity in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing seeks to undermine the U.S. alliance system and displace the United States as the preeminent power in the region. Given China’s clear strategic intent, the focus in the NDS on strengthening alliances is well placed, but U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific vary dramatically in terms of reliability, capability, and clarity of strategic rationale. The two oldest U.S. security alliances in the region — with the Philippines and Australia — illustrate this clearly. The U.S. alliance with Australia has never been stronger. The two are developing new defense capabilities, building interoperability, and increasingly working together as a networked security architecture. The Australia-United Kingdom-United States pact, or AUKUS, is just the latest sign of this increasingly robust partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States’ alliance with the Philippines has barely survived a period of deep uncertainty under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. While Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s administration has signaled that it will prioritize the Philippines’ relationship with the United States, the alliance remains fragile and underdeveloped, posing significant challenges and risks to U.S. defense strategy and interests. However, this alliance remains critically important for the United States, both for the benefits the United States derives from bilateral cooperation in peacetime and for the role the alliance plays in U.S. defense planning above or just below the threshold of conflict. If China succeeds in peeling the Philippines away from the United States, it will profoundly weaken the strategic position of the United States, Australia, and other allies within the broader Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Australia shore up the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security. Furthermore, defense policymakers in the United States and Australia need to better understand Philippine strategic assessments and threat perceptions to inform assumptions about the role the Philippines would play in the event of conflict with China, including in a Taiwan contingency. How do Filipino and Australian strategic planners view China? How can the United States and its allies respond to — and deter — Chinese gray zone activities? What are the implications of a Taiwan contingency on regional stability, and how would Manila and Canberra respond to such a crisis? Under what circumstances would the Philippines allow access for U.S. and allied forces flowing into the region in the event of an emerging conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to answer these questions, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened a trilateral U.S.-Australia-Philippines track 2 strategic dialogue in August 2022 in Manila, Philippines. The dialogue was intended to provide a platform for U.S., Australian, and Filipino experts and practitioners to discuss practical issues of alliance coordination, share insights regarding each country’s respective strategic outlooks, and consider the ways in which the security triangle could be operationalized in a time of conflict. CSIS concluded the dialogue by hosting a tabletop exercise involving a complex near-future crisis in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion at the dialogue largely spanned four key themes: the need to assess and align strategic outlooks and threat perceptions in Washington, Manila, and Canberra; the challenges associated with Chinese gray zone activities and potential pathways toward enhancing resilience; the growing need for all three countries to consider how a Taiwan contingency would not only impact alliance obligations, but also affect their own respective national security priorities; and the current limited ability of the security triangle to respond to a South China Sea crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dialogue informed the findings and recommendations in this brief, although all opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the dialogue participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-australia-philippines-security-triangle&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Australia-Philippines Security Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Philippines alliance has experienced an upswing since then-president Rodrigo Duterte’s decision to recall the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in 2021. Early signs demonstrate that the Marcos Jr. administration is generally less skeptical of the United States than its predecessor and views the alliance as a top priority. President Biden’s meeting with President Marcos Jr. in New York in September 2022 represents a positive step forward — as well as the first time a sitting Philippine president visited the United States since the late president Benigno Aquino III attended the Sunnylands summit in 2016 — with the United States affirming its commitment to the defense of the Philippines. Whether these trends continue and the alliance undergoes much-needed modernization will ultimately depend on it continuing to receive high-level political and military attention from both sides. Implementation of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) remains years behind schedule, the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization plans need a considerable increase in support, and the long-term viability of the alliance rests on a number of agreements and new institutions currently under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Australia alliance has also experienced a surge in activity in recent years. Canberra and Washington have seen increased alignment on strategic outlooks, as evidenced by enhanced U.S. rotational access to Australian facilities, collaboration through the Quad, and the AUKUS pact. The transition to a Labor government led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May 2022 has further opened the door to enhanced cooperation with the United States, including in relation to the Biden administration’s stated focus on issues like climate change. Albanese has also cast himself as a foreign policy–oriented premier, attending the Quad summit in Tokyo immediately after being sworn in and directing his cabinet to embark on a series of diplomatic tours to affirm Australia’s position in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific underscores the need for Canberra and Washington to collaborate more closely in engaging with other alliance partners, including the Philippines. Australia is uniquely suited to this role as it is the only country other than the United States to have a Status of Forces Agreement with the Philippines. As a result, Australia and the Philippines enjoy a significant degree of security cooperation, including the presence of Australian mobile training teams on the ground undertaking capacity-building work on counterterrorism, urban warfare, maritime security, and other fronts. Yet, despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Australia-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion on the merits of the partnership remains limited and has only just begun to emerge in Australian policy circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-outlooks-and-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Strategic Outlooks and Threat Perceptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared challenges faced by Manila, Washington, and Canberra necessitate a review of strategic outlooks and threat perceptions in all three capitals, along with an examination of the extent to which Philippine, U.S., and Australian assumptions about these alliances and partnerships cohere amid strategic competition with China. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy made clear the Biden administration’s intent to strengthen the United States’ long-term position in, and commitment to, the Indo-Pacific. Congress remains steadfast in its bipartisan support for shoring up U.S. alliances to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and counter China’s advances in the region. Thus, in the face of continued reservations about U.S. staying power in the region and a challenging strategic environment in Europe and the Middle East, Washington has signaled that its commitment to the Indo-Pacific remains robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s presence at the forefront of Beijing’s coercive activities in the Indo-Pacific has significantly sharpened strategic outlooks toward China in recent years. Opinion polling demonstrates that a majority of the Australian public now views China as a security threat. The Australian political and security establishment, mirroring the public, has largely reached consensus on its views of China, even as the governing Labor Party and the opposition Liberal-National Coalition disagree over tactics and tone in foreign policy. Australia’s experience with China’s coercive activities and its long-standing history of alignment with the United States in times of conflict mean that Canberra is an essential partner for Washington in countering challenges to the regional order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic outlooks in Manila, by contrast, remain in transition. The shift from a decades-long focus on internal threats to a more maritime-oriented external defense doctrine is underway. But this shift is constrained by limited state resources and colored by concerns about U.S. credibility, made especially salient by the huge disparity in power between the two allies and the economic necessity to balance engagement and confrontation in China policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Australian views on China, which have largely sharpened in recent years, there is no singular view of China policy in the Philippines. The state and military bureaucracy, public opinion, and business interests are broadly pro-American and suspicious of Beijing — and becoming more so in the wake of China’s increasing coercion. But they remain divided on how to respond to that coercion. An influential minority within the political and business elite continues to view the U.S.-Philippines alliance as a destabilizing factor that could upend Manila’s ties with Beijing and lead the Philippines into unwanted conflict. That minority continues to use the narrative of U.S. failure and ambiguity during the Scarborough Shoal standoff in 2012 to insist that, when push comes to shove, the United States will not stand with its ally. The power of this line of argument has been diminished by the increasing clarity of U.S. declaratory policy and closer alliance coordination over the last decade, but it is unlikely to disappear entirely any time soon. Moreover, views on China in the Philippines are divided across geographic lines, with some subnational actors in places like Mindanao and northern Luzon increasingly reliant on Chinese investment and people-to-people ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divergences in Philippine and Australian threat perceptions are compounded by differences in capacity to respond to Chinese coercion and other material and non-material factors. As an advanced economy, Australia has been better able to absorb economic coercion, and its military capabilities mean that it is ultimately better equipped than the Philippines to respond to gray zone challenges. Furthermore, Australia’s status as a mature democracy means that it is generally less tolerant of authoritarian practices and challenges to the regional order, more resilient to misinformation and influence operations, and more likely to view a China-dominated order as a threat to Australia’s interests and worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, changes in government in both Canberra and Manila have reshaped Australian and Philippine strategic outlooks. As noted above, the Australian political establishment has largely reached consensus in their views on China, though the new Labor government has opted to strike what it views as a more delicate tone in approaching Beijing and regional partners. While President Marcos Jr. has generally taken a stronger position toward Beijing than his predecessor and sought to deepen relations with the United States, his focus on economic recovery and attracting foreign investment makes it likely that he will try to balance this with outreach to China, to say nothing of the Marcos family’s own long-standing ties with the Chinese business community. However, no matter what Marcos Jr.’s own perspectives toward China may be, it is likely that the Philippine foreign policy and security establishment will ultimately constrain the president’s ability to make any extreme overtures toward Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing dynamics in the regional security landscape have also shifted strategic outlooks in the three capitals, including challenges associated with China’s nuclear buildup and other proliferation risks. Yet, while both Washington and Canberra have increasingly voiced concern regarding the threat of nuclear escalation in a Taiwan contingency or other crises, issues related to nuclear buildup and proliferation remain underdiscussed and understudied in Manila. To the extent that public discourse in the Philippines focuses on nuclear risks, this discourse largely centers on evincing concern around narratives that AUKUS could negatively impact nonproliferation in the region — even while Philippine views on the pact are largely positive relative to those of its immediate neighbors. Manila generally views China’s nuclear ambitions and the threat of nuclear escalation as a less critical issue relative to other, more immediate threats posed by Beijing in the maritime, cyber, and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite clear opportunities for Australia and the Philippines to deepen cooperation, neither capital has prioritized its partnership with the other at the level one would expect given the increasing convergence in their strategic outlooks and the logic of closer coordination. In contrast to the U.S. government, Canberra has not historically given the Philippines as much priority in its regional strategy as Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, or especially Indonesia. In the Philippines, meanwhile, high-level discourse on non-U.S. partnerships tends to focus on Japan and South Korea. Filipinos evince warm feelings toward Australia in public opinion polls and the military maintains significant on-the-ground cooperation, but those ties are rarely top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Canberra has not historically given the Philippines as much priority in its regional strategy as Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, or especially Indonesia. In the Philippines, meanwhile, high-level discourse on non-U.S. partnerships tends to focus on Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Philippine and Australian strategic outlooks will be shaped by overall views toward the United States and U.S. credibility as a guarantor of regional stability and security. While support for the U.S.-Australia alliance is at an all-time high, this largely reflects anxieties about the threat posed by China, rather than a vote of confidence in the reliability of the United States. And despite these concerns, neither Australia nor the Philippines have a plan B in the event of waning U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific, as only the United States currently has the weight needed to balance China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-resilience-against-gray-zone-challenges&quot;&gt;Enhancing Resilience against Gray Zone Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has leveraged an extensive tool kit of coercive measures in the region, including activities that fall in the gray zone short of conflict — weaponizing investments in critical infrastructure and using economic coercion, employing influence operations and disinformation campaigns, and deploying maritime militia and coast guard vessels in Philippine waters. Coupled with a general increase in China’s risk tolerance, these levers of influence have granted Beijing a wide range of policy options and approaches that enhance the risks associated with sub-conflict disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the South China Sea, Beijing’s island-building campaign and its deployment of law enforcement and maritime militia vessels have significantly altered the strategic landscape, allowing Beijing to harass oil and gas operations and restrict Philippine resupply vessels’ access to the isolated Filipino Marines stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. The broad span of China’s gray zone activities points to the need for an “all of the above” approach that encompasses both military and diplomatic solutions to deterring Chinese behavior. But successful responses to gray zone activities will ultimately be contingent on whether the United States, Australia, and the Philippines are able to determine what specific approaches would credibly deter Chinese aggression, let alone whether there are activities that the United States and its allies simply cannot deter. Responses to Chinese gray zone activities could encompass both offensive and defensive measures, particularly in the informational realm. This could include declassifying intelligence relevant to Chinese coercive behavior (in a manner similar to U.S. declassification of information related to Russian activities prior to and during the invasion of Ukraine), while also focusing on enhancing domestic military capabilities and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to respond to gray zone activities will be complicated by the extent to which the Philippines remains vulnerable to Chinese influence operations and elite capture. This includes ongoing narratives regarding China’s overwhelming economic dominance in the Philippines. Whether they are overstated or not, these narratives of economic dominance and political influence speak to the success of China’s information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The broad span of China’s gray zone activities points to the need for an “all of the above” approach that encompasses both military and diplomatic solutions to deterring Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, enhancing domestic resilience includes the continued modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, including procurement of BrahMos cruise missile systems or other similar platforms. Such weapons systems would effectively allow the Philippines to raise China’s short-term costs in a time of conflict, mirroring Vietnam’s approach to military modernization in recent decades. This approach has focused on the acquisition of a small but capable number of advanced surface, undersea, and air platforms paired with asymmetric strike capabilities to ensure that it can give China a “bloody nose” in any contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;Implications of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in early August, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and perceived parallels between that conflict and China’s behavior in the Indo-Pacific, have helped sharpen the region’s focus on the prospect of a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan means that simple geography, to say nothing of the alliance with the United States, could drag Manila into a Taiwan contingency. This in turn highlights the need for Filipino strategic thinkers to consider the potential impacts of such a conflict. Much in the same way that South Vietnamese refugee ships fled to Subic Bay during the fall of Saigon, a cross-strait contingency could lead to Taiwanese vessels evacuating to the Philippines. With northern Luzon less than 200 miles from Taiwan, and the Batanes Islands even closer, a refugee crisis seems inevitable in the case of a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has nearly 200,000 overseas foreign workers based in Taiwan, and their evacuation — likely impossible in the face of an outright invasion of the island — would be a top priority if conflict were to break out across the Taiwan Strait. The Philippines also has a much smaller, but still sizeable, number of overseas foreign workers in mainland China, and even more in Hong Kong. This raises the possibility that those workers could become political leverage for Beijing in a time of conflict and limit the Philippines’ flexibility in responding to a Taiwan contingency. The direction of public sentiment in such a crisis — whether demanding intervention on behalf of those Filipinos in Taiwan or restraint in the name of those in China — is difficult to predict. Much would depend on the details and scale of the crisis, including the number of Filipinos killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of Philippine territory to Taiwan also makes it an attractive staging point for U.S. intervention and a possible target for Chinese retaliation. Both the United States and the Philippines have increasingly recognized that Washington would expect access and support in any crisis endangering the lives of U.S. service members. Most Filipino strategic thinkers recognize that is part of the price of a more “equal” alliance with the United States that both the Duterte and Marcos governments have sought. To this end, if the Philippine government wants the United States to increase security assistance and stay committed to defending Filipino lives in the contested South China Sea, then Manila must meet matching obligations. U.S. forces will require greater access to the country to rotate forces and pre-position equipment to credibly project power over both the South China Sea and Taiwan. The extent to which the Philippine strategic community has internalized the implications of reciprocity — meaning that the Philippines has obligations to the United States under Articles II, IV, and V of the Mutual Defense Treaty, not just vice versa — is unclear. The security establishment appears more cognizant of these than the wider political and academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candid, ongoing, and at times difficult, discussions on alliance obligations and their role in a Taiwan contingency between the United States and the Philippines at the track 1.5 and track 2 levels mirror the talks currently underway between the two governments as part of the ongoing process of alliance modernization. At the 9th U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Strategic Dialogue last year, interlocuters from the Biden and Duterte administrations set forth a roadmap for modernizing the alliance. They agreed to negotiate their first set of joint defense guidelines and a military information-sharing agreement, launch a new maritime security dialogue, increase U.S. capacity-building support to the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and implement the long-delayed 2014 EDCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDCA allows the United States to gain access to five predetermined Philippine military sites to fund upgrades, pre-position equipment, and engage in joint training and operations. In addition to implementing the agreement at those five sites, the allies are seeking to expand it to additional locations, which has fueled speculation that new sites would include facilities in northern Luzon, less than 200 miles from Taiwan. Moreover, ongoing discussion on the risks associated with a Taiwan contingency has raised expectations that the United States would look to the Philippines to, among other things, help monitor the Bashi Channel and prevent any undetected Chinese breakout from the first island chain in a crisis scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Australia has met rising concern over a Taiwan contingency by increasing funding for high-end capabilities and other deterrent responses — as have Japan, South Korea, and other partners. But Australian public opinion and strategic thinking toward Taiwan generally come from a low base of knowledge, viewed more through the prism of U.S. alliance obligations rather than a clear articulation of what Taiwan — and the defense of Taiwan — means for Australian national security interests. And few, if any, of Australia’s recent strategy documents — including the 2020 Defence Strategic Update — explicitly reference Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with regard to the Philippines, it remains generally unclear the extent to which the Marcos Jr. administration has focused on thinking through how a Taiwan contingency would impact the country. To this end, both Australia and the Philippines need to take major steps toward articulating why Taiwan matters to their foreign policy and national security interests outside of the narrow prism of their U.S. alliance commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-australia-philippines-security-triangle-in-a-south-china-sea-crisis&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Australia-Philippines Security Triangle in a South China Sea Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given current force posture, weak alliance coordination, and political uncertainties, the U.S.-Australia-Philippines security triangle would face considerable challenges in responding to a South China Sea contingency. In particular, the Philippines’ ability to respond to a gray zone challenge in the South China Sea will depend on Manila’s ability to break through excessive internal debate and bureaucratic red tape. This includes ongoing debates on when to view a gray zone challenge as a national security crisis to be overcome or a foreign policy issue to be managed, and when to declare a national emergency and explicitly invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. Public opinion will also play a key role in shaping Philippine responses to a gray zone crisis, as public opinion, traditional media, and social media have taken an increasingly central role in the Philippine policy discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and Australia, a lack of considered preplanning or of a prearranged playbook between allies for responding to a gray zone crisis remains a significant hurdle. Absent the expansion of EDCA sites in the near term, the United States will lack the ability to quickly move assets into the region in response to a crisis scenario, ultimately forcing Washington and its allies into a reactive, rather than proactive, posture. Meanwhile, Australia’s role in a South China Sea crisis will ultimately be limited by the lack of a direct alliance with the Philippines. Limited preplanning across all sides of the security triangle is in turn compounded by a general lack of discussion on rules of engagement in a gray zone contingency and a lack of clarity on whether Manila would be willing to stomach the initiation of conflict, or if it would prefer to stop short of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; An increasingly complex threat environment points to the need for continued and robust dialogue between the United States and partners in the Philippines and Australia. High-level discussion in Manila policy circles on the threat associated with nuclear escalation and proliferation remains underdeveloped, and these risks are generally underestimated relative to challenges in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation 1: Washington should seek more opportunities for high-level track 1.5 and track 2 dialogues with Manila and Canberra. Dialogues held in the trilateral context would grant a degree of political cover to discuss issues that might otherwise be sensitive in the bilateral context. Such dialogues would help build a broader coalition of support for not only each country’s respective relations with the United States but relations between U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation 2: The United States should seek out more opportunities for high-level track 1 and track 1.5 dialogues between Washington and counterparts in Manila on nuclear issues. Dialogues could be held in the bilateral or trilateral format, and they would allow the Philippine policy community to internalize and take part in the discussions on nuclear deterrence and risk reduction within the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; At present, the United States lacks the ground-based air assets or ground-based missiles to be able to respond effectively to a South China Sea contingency, while the Philippines’ military modernization remains sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: The United States should not only move swiftly to fully implement EDCA and expand it to include other bases but also encourage the Philippines to continue its process of military modernization, including the procurement of BrahMos anti-ship missiles, unmanned platforms, and other asymmetric strike capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia’s presence and engagement with Southeast Asia has traditionally been anchored in its closest neighbor, Indonesia. But the Philippines’ unique status — including its role in the U.S. alliance network, its own robust ties with Canberra, and its position at the front lines of China’s coercive activities — means that firming up relations with Manila will be critical for Australia moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Canberra needs to invest time and political capital into shoring up relations with Manila, particularly in the context of the upcoming Defence Strategic Review. The United States should use its bilateral dialogues with Australia to encourage it to do so, and it should seek to bring Australian officials into the mechanisms of the U.S.-Philippines alliance (such as the annual Mutual Defense Board-Security Engagement Board meetings) as observers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s maritime militia poses a potent threat to the ability of Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, to exercise their sovereign rights in the waterways of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: In line with the Quad’s Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, the United States and Australia should continue to invest in the remote sensing capabilities of its Southeast Asian and Pacific partners, allowing regional states better visibility into activities occurring in their waters. The United States, Australia, and like-minded partners like Japan should also explore avenues for unmanned data collection in the South China Sea in partnership with the Philippines. Fifth Fleet’s Task Force 59 in Bahrain offers a good model that could be pursued by Seventh Fleet from the Philippines. The United States should publicly clarify that it would treat militia vessels that intentionally endanger the lives of U.S. or allied personnel as armed combatants, and that any attack on Philippine troops or vessels by militia falls within the scope of Articles IV and V of the Mutual Defense Treaty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The BRP Sierra Madre is the most vulnerable Philippine facility in the South China Sea, with resupply missions facing frequent interference by Chinese militia and coast guard forces. This makes it the most likely site for military escalation in the South China Sea at present. It is also the only Philippine outpost whose legal status within the context of the alliance is crystal clear: it is an underwater feature within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and China can make no claim upon it. Loss of control over the feature would be severely damaging to the Philippines politically and strategically, not to mention to the credibility of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: The United States and the Philippines should focus on contingency planning for a Second Thomas Shoal crisis, including a U.S. commitment to help resupply the garrison if needed in case of a blockade. The United States should help the Philippines assess the structural integrity of the Sierra Madre and repair or replace it to ensure permanent control over the feature by Manila.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States currently shares sensitive information with the Philippines through a Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), which is set to expire in March 2023. Without a replacement, information sharing and alliance coordination will be severely hampered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: The United States and Philippines should conclude a permanent General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). Negotiations for a GSOMIA are underway and were flagged as a priority at the annual Bilateral Strategic Dialogue last year. That high-level focus from military and political leaders, if maintained, should be enough to break through the sticking points in negotiations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China maintains significant diplomatic and economic largesse in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific. In particular, Beijing has embarked on a campaign of subnational diplomacy in both Australia and the Philippines, undermining their respective national governments’ ability to formulate a coherent and unified China strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 8: The United States should redouble its efforts toward engaging with local and subnational stakeholders — whether through diplomatic, economic, or military-to-military channels — focusing on outlying regions of the Philippines vulnerable to China’s economic heft. The State Department’s recent appointment of Ambassador Nina Hachigian — formerly U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — as special representative for subnational diplomacy is a welcome step in the right direction. The United States must continue to build on this momentum and establish comprehensive interagency mechanisms for focusing time, attention, and resources to local and subnational stakeholders that may be disconnected or disenfranchised from the Manila and Canberra elite. This should include the reopening of the U.S. consulate in Cebu and the exploration of new consulates in Davao and Ilocos Norte, both of which already host Chinese consulates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s island-building activities in the South China Sea not only impact the military and strategic balance in Southeast Asia, but also pose risk to the health of the marine ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 9: The United States, Australia, and other regional partners should collaborate on scientific efforts focused on understanding and publicizing the risks associated with China’s activities in regional waters and their potential impact on Southeast Asian fisheries and marine resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this report, RUSI’s Open-Source Intelligence and Analysis (OSIA) and Military Sciences departments used extensive datasets of components and microelectronics sourced from disassembled Russian weapons either captured or expended in Ukraine since February 2022. These compilations of technical assessments were databased, standardised and categorised to enable further analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical inspection of the platforms contained in this report by RUSI during fieldwork confirmed the authenticity and accuracy of this data, which was also compared to product descriptions and serial numbers published by a wide variety of manufacturers. It should be noted that grey and black markets for counterfeit components and microelectronics are a global problem, meaning that fool-proof corroboration is a challenging endeavour. Given the evidence assessed here and the long history of Soviet and Russian military procurement efforts targeting the world’s leading technology and microelectronic companies, the research team operated under the assumption that the majority of these parts were likely genuine. Assessments conducted internally by the Russian government, and seen by the authors, highlighting critical dependence on a number of foreign manufacturers, increases the confidence that the components identified in Russian weapons are genuine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This data was then married with a range of other sources, such as shipment-level trade data, import and export declarations, court records, financial information sourced by Reuters and iStories, and corporate records in Russian in an attempt to better understand a particular Russian procurement network while also placing the Orlan-10, a Russian UAV, in its tactical and operational context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;identification-of-individuals-companies-and-governments-in-this-report&quot;&gt;IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTS IN THIS REPORT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The purpose of this report is to understand and explain how the Russian military depends on Western technology. To achieve this purpose, it identifies a number of individuals/companies/governments who are believed to be involved in the designing and manufacturing of components which have been acquired by the Russian military and are used in their military hardware. For the avoidance of doubt, RUSI does not impute any allegations of wrongdoing on the part of these individuals/companies/governments and makes no representations or assertion that these individuals/companies/governments have any involvement in any sanctions evasion-related activity or are involved in directly or indirectly supplying the Russian military and/or Russian military customers in breach of any international (or their own domestic) laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting such action, unless expressly stated in the report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint investigation between RUSI, Reuters and iStories has found that Russian companies closely associated with the St Petersburg-based Special Technology Centre Limited Liability Company (STC LLC or STC) – the Russian military-affiliated manufacturer of the Orlan-10 UAV – have drastically increased imports of critical Western-manufactured components since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These imports will likely enable the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) to maintain and expand production of the country’s most successful UAV – a platform that sits at the heart of the country’s warfighting capabilities and enables the AFRF to rain accurate fire down on Ukrainian formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial records, customs data, court records, Russian company filings and a range of other open sources indicate that many of these Western-manufactured imports are likely being procured by a St Petersburg-based company named SMT-iLogic on behalf of STC, which was first sanctioned by the US government in December 2016 for supporting Russia’s interference in the 2016 US Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These components, which are critical both to Russia’s plans to expand UAV production and its ongoing operations in Ukraine, are being shipped to Russia by a variety of distributors based in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, these exporters appear to be operated by Russian nationals or expatriates based abroad with limited public profiles. In one such case, a US company owned by an individual with Russian and American citizenship named Igor Kazhdan shipped large volumes of export-controlled components to SMT-iLogic and another company named Device Consulting, also based in St Petersburg, in violation of US export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of SMT-iLogic’s largest suppliers since the start of Russia’s invasion have been a range of Hong Kong companies, some with a history of evading sanctions and providing military equipment to the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networks such as those profiled in this report are core to Russia’s ability to procure advanced microelectronics for its weapons programs. As the United States and its allies seek to restrict Russia’s ability to access the world’s most advanced technologies, trade restrictions such as export controls and sanctions are emerging as core tools available to policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report highlights methodologies that can be used by state and non-state actors alike in combating Russian sanctions evasion networks. Approaches demonstrated in this report, including the use of open-source information, integration of modern data analysis methods, and the use of commercial technologies, can successfully identify sanctions evasion networks in detail and at scale. If governments wish to slow shipments to critical Russian military programmes such as the Orlan-10, they should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase their ability to amass, analyse, and action open-source information through investments in data storage, processing, and visualization. Artificial intelligence will be a core part of several capabilities that can materially improve export control and sanctions enforcement, such as the creation of graph databases showing historical trading relationships, entity resolution, text extraction, machine translation, and geolocation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase use of commercial analytics and data providers. As demonstrated in this report, commercial tools available today can allow for the identification of export control and sanctions evasion networks at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curate the data environment to ensure that actionable information flows to enforcement authorities to the maximum degree allowed by law. Enforcement authorities should work with Congress to pass laws that expand visibility into trade, corporate and risk data that would provide actionable intelligence on sanctions evasion networks, while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt systems that allow for data-driven interoperability with allies, including by adopting information architectures that allow for easy and secure sharing of information. The US is just one node in a global trading web used by sanctions and export control evaders – successful enforcement necessarily depends on joint action. The US can bring to bear open-source information and federated data architectures to share information with partners, even where sharing classified information is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partner with, and make greater use of, non-state analytical organisations with expertise in identifying illicit activity using open-source information. As this report demonstrates, non-state analytical actors possess significant expertise in identifying sanctions and export control evasion. The US and its allies should engage robustly with these organisations to share leads, investigative techniques, tools and data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, improving this capability this will entail investments in the government’s ability to amass, analyse, and action large quantities of publicly-available and commercial information. This will allow the government to more quickly and comprehensively identify and address gaps in its enforcement of sanctions and export controls, allowing it to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rapidly sanction entities and individuals involved in the illicit supply chain of components to the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and prosecute individuals knowingly evading sanctions and export controls to ship components to the AFRF or those acting on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen the monitoring of components and microelectronics moving to Russia and the identity of end-users to which they are being shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve guidance and expand capacity-building operations for private sector companies and financial institutions engaged in exporting or financing these component flows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 UAV has proven to be one of the most critical components of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’s (AFRF) lethality in Ukraine. Designed and manufactured by Russia’s Special Technology Centre Limited Liability Company (STC LLC or STC), the Orlan-10 is a sophisticated yet relatively affordable UAV, costing approximately $87,000-120,000 per system. The UAV can carry a wide range of military payloads, enabling it to conduct a variety of missions and to be used in combination with other systems, including other UAVs, for more advanced combinations of effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common and deadliest use of Orlan-10s by the AFRF in Ukraine is as part of an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance complex. The UAVs are used to locate Ukrainian troops and vehicles from medium altitudes and relay their positions for rapid artillery, missile and loitering munition strikes. When an Orlan-10 is overhead, Russian artillery response times can be as short as three minutes from target detection, leaving those targets almost no time to escape the fire zone. By contrast, response times when UAVs are not overhead are generally around 20 minutes, affording Ukrainian units the opportunity to relocate and avoid destruction. The centrality of artillery firepower to battlefield tactics on both sides means that the presence or absence of Russian UAVs in Ukraine is a core determinant of Russian lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 is particularly challenging for Ukrainian ground forces to counter. It can reportedly reach speeds of at least 150km/h and a maximum altitude of 5,000 metres. The ability to fly at these relatively fast speeds and high altitudes allows the Orlan-10 to operate beyond the range of most man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS), and also makes the UAV harder to detect and engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IloZDPM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Orlan-10 Military Sensors and Payloads.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: OE Data Integration Network – US Government; Information provided to RUSI; graphic designed by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Orlan-10 boasts hardened radio datalinks with frequency-hopping capabilities and an accurate inertial navigation system that renders it difficult to effectively jam using electronic warfare (EW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to artillery spotting, the AFRF uses the Orlan-10 for effective suppression and destruction of enemy air defence (SEAD/DEAD) operations in Ukraine. For such missions, a high-flying Orlan-10 with an EW payload baits Ukrainian SA-8 and SA-11 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, with its survivability boosted by its capacity to jam SA-8 missile proximity fuses. Once a SAM is launched to engage the UAV, a second Orlan-10 at a lower altitude geolocates the SAM’s launch system using electronic intelligence capabilities and cues a third Orlan-10 which uses an electro-optical payload to designate the launch system as a target for rapid artillery or missile strikes from Russian forces. Given this flexibility and effectiveness from a mass-produced system, constraining and countering Orlan-10s is one of the Ukrainian military’s top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-in-russia-made-abroad&quot;&gt;Built In Russia, Made Abroad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the impressive success of Russia’s most prevalent UAV system is the St Petersburg-headquartered STC, a limited liability company with extensive connections to the country’s leading research centres and Russia’s expansive military industrial complex. However, while the Orlan-10 is designed and built in Russia by a range of scientists and engineers from flagship Russian military research institutes, its construction is highly dependent on Western technology and components historically procured through suppliers based in the US, Europe and East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork conducted by RUSI in Ukraine over the course of 2022 confirmed that the sub-systems of the Orlan-10 are heavily reliant on foreign-made microelectronics. This is particularly the case for a range of products such as the microcontrollers, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers and pressure sensors that enable the UAV to collect and transmit relevant data to the operator, sometimes over 100 km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these Western-manufactured components are also subject to export controls, meaning that those seeking to ship them abroad require a licence to do so. Even before Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, US manufacturers could not legally export goods subject to US Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to Russian defence companies – and certainly not to designated entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of Russia’s designated military entities, this has led to a need for illicit procurement tactics, including the use of front companies and transshipment hubs to move goods through the international trading system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial records for STC, acquired by Reuters and iStories, indicate that the company has remitted large volumes of money to a range of Russian companies involved in the electronics and radiocommunication businesses. One of the largest recipients is an entity named SMT-iLogic, a company based in St Petersburg that not only imports large volumes of microelectronics and components used in the Orlan-10 to Russia but also has additional extensive connections to STC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-special-technology-centre&quot;&gt;THE SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY CENTRE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded over twenty years ago, STC designs and manufactures radio and communications equipment for a range of customers, including military systems and the Orlan-10. In addition to the Orlan-10, STC manufactures other UAVs including the Orlan-1, the Orlan-2, the Orlan-30 and the Orlan-50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STC also appears to be engaged in a range of clandestine activities separate from the design and manufacture of military UAVs. In December 2016, for example, the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned STC alongside Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU) for conducting malicious cyber-related activities. According to the US Department of the Treasury, STC was designated because it had supported the GU’s interference campaign targeting the 2016 US Presidential election. Three years later, the cyber security company Lookout alleged that STC was developing advanced mobile spyware designed to infect devices using Google Android. The spyware, dubbed Monokle, reportedly targeted a small number of individuals, including those researching Russian-backed militias in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, STC was further designated by the US, the UK, Canada, Taiwan and Japan. These designations identified STC’s role in aiding Russia’s invasion and aimed to further restrict the company’s imports of foreign technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-men-behind-the-curtain&quot;&gt;The Men Behind The Curtain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at the affiliations and activities of some of STC’s executives reveals that the company is closely linked to the Russian military, as well as SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership of STC is largely composed of highly accomplished Russian military scientists, at least two of whom are also employed by the SM Budyonny Military Academy of the Signal Corps, a military university in St Petersburg for Russia’s signal troops. These individuals are Aleksei Vasilievich Terentiev and Oleg Vladimirovich Tsarik, both recognised as ‘Honoured Inventors of the Russian Federation’ – an accolade bestowed by the Russian president for an outstanding track record of inventions of national significance and major contributions to technological progress. The Academy’s website notes that Terentiev has been serving at the SM Budyonny Academy since 1981, including as senior researcher and head of the research laboratory. Tsarik has also held a number of positions at the Academy since 1998, including as senior lecturer in the radio intelligence and electronic warfare department. Terentiev has also been listed in the honour roll of best inventors at the Budyonny Academy, while Tsarik was named best inventor of the year by the Russian Ministry of Defence in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 2022, Terentiev and Tsarik are two of seven shareholders in STC and some of the company’s most prolific scientists. Since 11 May 2010, STC has filed over 70 patents for radio-electronics and other communication technologies, with the majority focused on military applications. Terentiev and Tsarik are listed as inventors on dozens of these patents, including several explicitly referencing technology related to the Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuzzy-logic-stcs-links-to-smt-ilogic&quot;&gt;FUZZY LOGIC: STC’S LINKS TO SMT-ILOGIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite producing large volumes of Orlan-10s and other UAVs that are highly dependent on foreign components and technology, STC does not appear to directly import any foreign components. However, Russian bank records for STC show the company paying tens of millions of dollars to SMT-iLogic. Company records filed in 2017 show that both Terentiev and Tsarik had founded the company alongside other members of STC and were listed as shareholders at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMT-iLogic’s website notes that the company was founded in November 2015 – a year after Russia’s initial incursion into Ukraine – by a group of ‘highly-qualified specialists in information and telecommunication technology.’ This statement is consistent with the list of individuals on the company’s filings with the Russian Federal Tax Registry over the years, which include Tsarik and Terentiev and several other scientists who also share patents with both inventors. However, in August 2017, Tsarik, Terentiev and several other STC shareholders were removed from official records of SMT-iLogic, thus eliminating obvious evidence of SMT-iLogic’s links to STC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, connections between STC and SMT-iLogic persist. For example, one of the current shareholders of SMT-iLogic is a Russian national named Aleksandr Mikhailovich Shepilov. Shepilov has been listed on SMT-iLogic’s corporate documents since November 2015, suggesting that he may have been one of the founders of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like his former colleagues, Shepilov is a prolific inventor and is named on at least 45 patents granted between June 2004 and July 2019. Many of these were filed by STC and the SM Budyonny Academy, and some even list Tsarik and Terentiev as inventors alongside Shepilov. Shepilov also continued to appear on patents for STC and the SM Budyonny Academy after the founding of SMT-iLogic in 2015, including a patent granted in July 2018 for the invention of a ‘method and device for determining the coordinates of the source of radio-emissions’ that was tested with an Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other collaborations suggest that Shepilov is closely connected to both STC and the Budyonny Academy and that he has continued to aid STC’s work on the Orlan-10 while being a shareholder of SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMT-iLogic and STC are also linked through the address of a former STC subsidiary. In 2014, STC founded and took a 76% share in the now-liquidated Joint Stock Company Special Technologies Centre (JSC STC). On corporate documents, JSC STC listed its address as an office at 17 Nepokorennyh Prospekt in St Petersburg. The address that SMT-iLogic lists on its website is a nearby unit in the same building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, this building also houses the Autonomous Non-Commercial Organisation of Continuing Professional Education Centre for the Training of Unmanned Systems Professionals (CP SBS). Founded in August 2014, the CP SBS offers training on a range of matters related to UAVs, including their operation and maintenance. Meanwhile, the Centre’s general director is Vasiliy Viktorovich Makarov, who also served as general director and founding shareholder of JSC STC. SMT-iLogic, as an undesignated entity, was likely able to serve as a deniable vehicle for STC to procure microelectronics from suppliers located outside of Russia. To do so, it relied on a large, decentralised network of suppliers located in Europe, Asia and North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;illicit-procurement&quot;&gt;Illicit Procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, Florida resident Igor Kazhdan was indicted by the US government for procuring and shipping a wide range of export-controlled military and dual-use technologies to Russia. Kazhdan, a dual citizen of Russia and the US, used the alias ‘Alex Stanton’ to operate two companies – IK Tech Corporation and GeoSat Microwave – in Dania Beach, Florida and California that advertised state-of-the-art commercial and military satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazhdan, however, was allegedly using his two companies to illegally procure export-controlled items for delivery to SMT-iLogic and another company based in St Petersburg named Device Consulting LLC. Russian bank records confirm that STC has also paid millions of dollars to Device Consulting, whose website – until recently – included a letter signed by ‘Alex Stanton’ certifying Device Consulting as an authorised distributor of GeoSat products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Gd8IWL6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Letter Signed by Alex Stanton AKA Igor Kazhdan on Device Consulting’s Website.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Documents found on www.Device.Consulting; United States of America v. Igor Kazhdan; annotations by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US indictment alleges that, between December 2021 and February 2022, Kazhdan acquired hundreds of export-controlled items from US-based manufacturers and fraudulently shipped them to Russia without a licence. In December 2021, for example, Kazhdan allegedly procured over 100 power amplifiers with defence applications produced by US company Qorvo, which he then shipped to Device Consulting in Russia. His company had also shipped Qorvo products to SMT-iLogic in April and June of the same year. These Qorvo components are very similar to those found inside a captured Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, company-level shipment records filed between 2020 and 2022 confirm that Kazhdan’s companies exported large volumes of microelectronics to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting, including critical components often used in the Orlan-10 that are also subject to US export controls. Between October 2020 and February 2022, for example, IK Tech Corporation dispatched over 1,300 Gumstix-produced GUM3703FEBY computer-on-module units to both SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting. This exact component was discovered in the payload control unit of an Orlan-10 and is also export-controlled by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XlguNxk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: IK Tech Shipments to Russia.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian Trade Data; graphic designed by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examination of the shipment-level trade records also reveals that IK Tech Corporation sent SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting several shipments of foreign components manufactured by JST Manufacturing, Semtech, Texas Instruments, u-blox and Xilinx – some of the most common brands of components found inside the Orlan-10. In addition to microelectronics, the US indictment alleges IK Tech sought to procure other export-controlled items such as couple control cables also used by the US military in communications complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregated import records for SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting also show an intriguing procurement pattern closely mirroring the timeline of IK Tech’s shipments and the Russian military build-up along Ukraine’s border before the February 2022 invasion. SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting also significantly ramped-up imports from May 2022, possibly to supplement depleted stocks following the botched invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade records indicate that several other individuals and corporate entities have engaged in very similar shipment patterns to IK Tech Corporation, shipping almost exclusively to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include a German company named Industrial Components Weirich, a California-registered company named GA Universal and Hong Kong-registered company named Asia Pacific Links. Since Russia’s invasion, however, SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting’s suppliers have changed as Russian imports rose drastically from pre-invasion levels. Several Hong Kong-based companies have now become the primary suppliers of SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-suppliers&quot;&gt;CHINESE SUPPLIERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of SMT-iLogic’s primary suppliers are Hong Kong-registered Xinghua Co Ltd and Sinno Electronics Co Ltd, a US-designated company previously identified by RUSI as shipping microelectronics to Russia to bolster the country’s defence industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinghua began shipping to SMT-iLogic in December 2021 and has since become the company’s third largest supplier. Shipment-level trade data states that Xinghua has been predominantly shipping portable computers produced by Getac, a Taiwanese manufacturer of rugged computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole director and shareholder of Xinghua is a Chinese national named Yuan Jilun, who is also the executive director and owner of Beijing-based Luchengtech Co Ltd, a supplier of information technology products to China’s defence, aviation and space industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Companies linked to Anton Trofimov.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Hong Kong and Macao Companies Registries; annotations by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data also shows that Luchengtech shipped a range of goods to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting in May, July and August 2022. This included over 200 engines used in aviation modelling produced by Chinese companies DLE and DTRC as well as data-processing and cloud-computing machines supplied by California-based Super Micro Computer Inc. In addition, between 2019 and 2021, the company sold hundreds of Getac-made portable computers to SMT-iLogic. This evidence of a relationship between these Chinese entities and AFRF-affiliated companies is particularly noteworthy, further highlighting the growing importance of Chinese companies to Russian military supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anton-trofimov&quot;&gt;ANTON TROFIMOV&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by far the largest supplier to SMT-iLogic – accounting for 25% of imports in 2022 – is Asia Pacific Links, a Hong Kong-headquartered company owned and controlled by a Russian national named Anton Trofimov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, Asia Pacific Links shipped over $10 million’s worth of microelectronic components to Russian companies, more than half of which were destined to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting. After Russia’s February 2022 invasion, however, Asia Pacific Links appears to have increased deliveries, shipping over $9 million of components to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of these shipments appear to have contained a range of notable components. For example, between June and August 2022 Asia Pacific Links shipped at least 800 export-controlled quad-band cellular modules to the St Petersburg office of SMT-iLogic. As noted above, these precise modules are often utilised in the Orlan-10. Other shipments in 2022 included components that have been found inside Orlan-10 UAVs, such as GNSS modules made by u-blox and computer-on-modules made by Gumstix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trofimov, who founded Asia Pacific Links in 2014, operates a number of other companies in Canada, China, Hong Kong and Macao. His LinkedIn profile also claims that he has been involved with the GP Gentlemen’s Club at the Tigre de Cristal Hotel and Resort, based just outside Vladivostok, since April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another one of Trofimov’s companies, the Macao-registered New Blockchain Advisory, also appears to have shipped large quantities of microelectronic components and semiconductors to Device Consulting, the St Petersburg company that received shipments from Kazhdan. One of these shipments, made in 2021, reportedly included over $6,000 of direction-finding compasses manufactured by Safran Sensing Technologies, whose products are advertised for military and UAV applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 is one of Russia’s most essential and indirectly lethal pieces of military equipment, and one that relies on Western components for a significant number of its critical functions. The Russian military is urgently attempting to increase the number of Orlan-10s available for artillery-spotting, reconnaissance, EW and SEAD/DEAD duties in Ukraine as both sides make preparations for renewed offensive operations in spring 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production quantities required to increase numbers while also replacing combat losses implies a continued requirement for large volumes of components to be brought in through the networks identified in this report. Disrupting these networks should, therefore, be considered a high priority for Western efforts to counter sanctions evasion, since reducing the number of Orlan-10s available to the Russian military by spring 2023 would significantly reduce overall force lethality and give the Ukrainian military more room for manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missile and aircraft manufacturing practices require many new components to be thoroughly tested and certified as safe in operation with all the other elements of each system. This also applies to some of the components that might be introduced as substitutes for Western-supplied ones in the event of a successful embargo. This process of certification – putting aside the development time to find and fit new components – is assessed to take three months, each time a change is made to the design. Hence, even if Russia were able to find technically viable substitutes for many of the Western components identified in this report, integrating them into the Orlan-10 production line would create major delays, add cost and thus help buy time for Ukrainian forces. In some cases, replacing these Western-manufactured components will be impossible in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as detailed in this report, Russian companies closely associated with the manufacturer of the Orlan-10 have been able to increase imports of necessary components since the beginning of the invasion. Given that much of this technology is ultimately manufactured and produced by companies domiciled in Western states, greater effort should be made to prevent diversion to Russia’s military manufacturers by intermediaries in the US, Europe, Hong Kong and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, governments should act against those individuals and entities responsible for diverting components to the AFRF and step-up efforts to monitor their flow to important transshipment-hubs and suspicious third parties. Governments should also improve guidance and expand capacity building activities for the private sector and financial institutions in countries that are often exploited by those seeking to procure technology for the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;

The document provides Moscow with a newly codified justification to intervene in the domestic affairs of other states, specifically those of the former Soviet Union, should it decide that the rights of local Russian-speaking groups are violated in any significant way. This brief analyzes the Kremlin’s new decree, considering the complex geopolitical context contributing to the release of the document, as well as Russia’s ability to defend the idea of the “Russian World” in the post-Soviet bloc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 5, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the “Concept of Humanitarian Policy of the Russian Federation Abroad.” The document, which runs over 30 pages, is presented by the Kremlin as an “indispensable” part of Russia’s national security strategy and foreign policy toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the new policy, coming six months after Moscow’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, seems detached from reality. It describes the Russian Federation as a multinational and multireligious country that aspires to maintain peace and stability in the world. “This has absolutely nothing to do with the reality — the catastrophe into which Russia is plunging itself,” notes Elena Sorokina, a journalist with the Russian-language branch of Radio Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Kremlin’s decision to roll out this new policy is directly tied to the war, as it seeks to send a threatening signal to Russia’s neighbors. The decree articulates what Moscow considers one of the driving forces behind its foreign policy decisions: the concept of the “Russian World” (Russkiy Mir). The document states that as the current “world order” attempts to politicize culture — and thus pressure “specific governments and individuals” — one of the core goals of Russia’s “humanitarian policy” should be to preserve and promote the values intrinsic to Russkiy Mir. Crucially, this concept is the latest justification for Russian intervention in neighboring countries. The decree provides an additional pretext for interfering in sovereign territories of the former Soviet Union, notably in Georgia, Moldova, and the Baltics, to protect the rights of local Russian-speaking groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By codifying the right of the Russian state to intercede for Russian speakers in its near abroad based on an ill-defined set of cultural criteria, Moscow’s newly minted humanitarian policy provides an evergreen casus belli that Russia can invoke against its neighbors. Yet though it attempts to demonstrate Russia’s strength to former Soviet states, the decree is borne out of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “special military operation” in Ukraine is putting great strain on Russia’s economy, limiting the country’s capacity to engage with, and thus exert influence on, its post-Soviet neighbors. In this context, the humanitarian policy should be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to put countries within its sphere of influence on notice. Despite its troubles in Ukraine, including military losses, Moscow is signaling that it has not lost sight of its post-Soviet neighbors and reserves the right to intervene should they seek to exploit Russia’s current weakness. Having failed at its efforts to trigger regime change in Kyiv or gain any traction in claiming Russia was engaged in the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the Kremlin is using the publication of its humanitarian policy as a new addition to its means of legitimizing the war — one that is narrower in its implications for Ukraine but potentially broader in its impact on the post-Soviet space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By codifying the right of the Russian state to intercede for Russian speakers in its near abroad based on an ill-defined set of cultural criteria, Moscow’s newly minted humanitarian policy provides an evergreen casus belli that Russia can invoke against its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections of the brief evaluate this policy document in greater detail, analyzing the troubling geopolitical context within which it was produced, as well as the reinvigorated concept of the Russian World and its possible effects on the post-Soviet bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-geopolitical-context-behind-russias-humanitarian-policy&quot;&gt;THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND RUSSIA’S HUMANITARIAN POLICY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of the humanitarian policy follows a series of earlier diplomatic victories and recent battlefield setbacks for Russia in 2022. This context is critical to understanding Moscow’s rationale in issuing the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin entered 2022 in a position of relative geopolitical strength. Across Russia’s post-Soviet periphery, it appeared to be the preeminent regional actor. In Belarus, Russian president Vladmir Putin’s long-held desire to further integrate the Lukashenko regime into the Russian-led Union State was continuing apace. In the Baltic states, local governments continued to express concern about the influence of Russian media and business interests over domestic Russian-speaking populations. In Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party continued to take a conciliatory approach in its dealings with Moscow. Elsewhere in the Caucasus, Russia had successfully brokered a ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020, further entrenching Russia’s diplomatic and military presence within the region. Most importantly, the Kremlin’s proxies in eastern Ukraine continued their frozen conflict with Kyiv, trapping Ukraine in an ongoing border dispute that had de facto disqualified the country indefinitely from membership in either the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s position as a formidable regional power was further solidified in Central Asia in January 2022. Popular uprisings against the Kazakh government forced President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to reach out to his Russian counterpart for assistance. Tokayev’s plea and concern about another liberal “color revolution” prompted Putin to intervene militarily. Moscow swiftly deployed 2,000 soldiers, mostly Russian, to Kazakhstan, claiming that the troops represented the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) — a Eurasian intergovernmental military alliance led by Russia. The intervention succeeded in quelling the street protests, including the civil unrest in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, ultimately helping the Tokayev government reestablish control over the country. As Bayram Balci, a researcher at Sciences Po, later argued, the Kazakh crisis was so easily quelled by Moscow that it reinforced the Kremlin’s belief that former Soviet states, especially in Eurasia, were dependent on Russian power and could therefore never pursue an independent foreign policy. By assisting the Tokayev government, “Russia has demonstrated to the Kazakh elites and all other partners of Kazakhstan that without Russia the country could have sunk into the abyss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar Russian assertions of regional hegemony were expressed by Putin in his infamous speech on February 24, 2022, declaring the start of the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Addressing the nation and the world, the Russian president claimed that Moscow had long ago accepted “the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR” and always treated the former Soviet republics with respect and consideration. This was most recently “proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity” [emphasis added]. However, according to Putin, what Moscow would never be able to accept and tolerate was NATO’s continuous eastward expansion into Russia’s “historical lands” — especially in Ukraine, where a threatening “anti-Russia” was taking shape. Crucially, Putin contended, Moscow had to intervene in Ukraine to save millions of people with strong cultural affinity to Russia from an alleged genocide spearheaded by the central government in Kyiv but “fully controlled from the outside” (i.e., the West).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events that unfolded in January and February showcase two controversial, yet strongly intertwined, concepts underpinning the Kremlin’s foreign policy. On the one hand, Russia is represented as a guarantor of peace, integrity, and stability in its near abroad, as proven by its prompt resolution of the Kazakh crisis, support for the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, and deft mediation between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, Moscow tolerates the “statehood and integrity” of the post-Soviet states only as long as they do not seek greater political autonomy from the Kremlin. And when certain territorial entities seek a separate path that is closer to Moscow, the Kremlin has no qualms undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors, as demonstrated by its ongoing support for separatist factions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, as well as its ongoing pressure on the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Moscow felt itself in a position of strength before the launch of its February invasion, its continuing military setbacks, the implementation of aggressive Western sanctions, and the increasing consolidation of the Ukrainian state and national identity have forced realists within the Kremlin to reassess the country’s international position and articulate new justifications for its actions. This is the context needed to understand the release of Russia’s humanitarian policy. Published six months into Moscow’s war of aggression against Kyiv, the document articulates how the Kremlin has adjusted its foreign policy thinking to match the shifting geopolitical landscape in Russia’s near abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin first highlighted the importance of creating such a document in mid-April, when he met with the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. The meeting followed two major military setbacks in Ukraine: a forced retreat from the Kyiv-adjacent town of Bucha on April 1, which unveiled brutal killings of civilians by Russian forces, and the sinking of Russia’s Black Sea missile cruiser Moskva after a successful Ukrainian offensive on April 13. While it is difficult to infer whether these events had any direct impact on Putin’s decision to have the humanitarian policy drafted, it is certain that these incidents significantly affected the Kremlin’s regional and international standing, showcasing Russia as a brutal, yet declining, global power. It was within this heightened and troublesome geopolitical context that Putin convened his Security Council and argued for the creation of Russia’s humanitarian policy, which would be consistent with the country’s “national interests in the near, medium, and more distant future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russkiy-mir-a-community-that-goes-far-beyond-russia&quot;&gt;RUSSKIY MIR: “A COMMUNITY THAT GOES FAR BEYOND RUSSIA”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, one of Moscow’s chief national interests that the humanitarian policy seeks to revive is the concept of Russkiy Mir. While Russian World is not explicitly defined in the document, the term itself is far from new. It was initially coined in Russian political circles in the late 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the country’s subsequent quest for a national identity, and revolved around the idea that Moscow had a sacred duty to defend the culture, language, and rights of all Russian speakers across the world, particularly in the former Soviet Union. According to Heather Ashby, the senior program officer for the Center for Russia and Europe at the U.S. Institute of Peace, such a “broader conceptualization of ‘Russianness’,” expanding into other sovereign territories, was a natural outcome of the Soviet collapse, which left some 25 million ethnic Russians outside of Russia’s territorial borders: “Living in a country that had long been a multinational empire, it was difficult for many Russians to accept that many of their ethnic brethren now lived in foreign countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the concept of the Russian World fit into a broader trend of Russian thinkers and policymakers grappling with the future role of the new Russian Federation. Researchers and writers such as Charles Clover have documented the ideological development of the post-Soviet Russian right, exploring the myriad ways this movement has embedded itself within, influenced, and been instrumentally co-opted by the Putin regime. More specifically, this doctrine of Russia’s moral, linguistic, and cultural supremacy in the post-Soviet bloc has been viewed by the Putin administration as “a guiding notion,” complementing and strengthening “the Kremlin’s belief that it possesses — and should continue to maintain through cultural, economic, political, and military ties — legitimate spheres of influence across the former Soviet Union.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has expressed similar sentiments numerous times in the past, most notably in April 2007, when he said during an address to the Federal Assembly, “The Russian language not only preserves an entire layer of truly global achievements but is also the living space for the many millions of people in the Russian-speaking world, a community that goes far beyond Russia itself.” In June 2007, Putin signed a decree creating the Russkiy Mir Foundation to promote Russian language and culture regionally and internationally. Today, the foundation claims that Russian World includes not only members of the Russian diaspora, but also anyone who speaks Russian and has developed “an appreciation for Russia and its rich cultural heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the revival and further elevation of the concept of Russkiy Mir in the humanitarian policy can be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to establish a cultural separation with the West by emphasizing Russian civilization’s distinctiveness. The policy comes against the backdrop of Moscow’s rising economic and diplomatic isolation, which in turn further elevates the status of the Russian World, as the decree provides a legal platform to the Kremlin to declare Russia culturally and politically superior to its near abroad. This language of defensive cultural posturing can be interpreted as part of Moscow’s reaction to the war and need to justify its invasion of Ukraine. In addition, it is also a response to the perceived threat of Western-backed “color revolutions” in the post-Soviet space; these supposedly foreign interventions by Western powers are believed to be executed by local actors pushing an anti-Russian message that is just as much about culture as it is about political institutions. The rhetorical construction of a linguistically and socially homogenous Russkiy Mir gives the Kremlin an ideological justification to intervene in Russia’s near abroad, one that can be invoked in the face of international criticism. It also sends a warning to the West: since the Kremlin wrongly perceives “color revolutions” as something done by the West to undermine Russia, Moscow is similarly signaling it can respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet the revival and further elevation of the concept of Russkiy Mir in the humanitarian policy can be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to establish a cultural separation with the West by emphasizing Russian civilization’s distinctiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine and the perceived efforts of certain Western actors to “cancel” the celebration of Russian culture internationally, analysts should continue to expect Russian leaders and state-backed news outlets to lean into the language of cultural grievance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-doctrine-of-interference&quot;&gt;THE DOCTRINE OF INTERFERENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document claims that one of the core principles of the Russian World, in addition to advancing Russian culture and language through “soft power,” is “noninterference in internal affairs of other states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has repeatedly used the now-infamous doctrine of noninterference to appeal to authoritarian governments across East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The decree stresses the importance of deepening traditional, cultural ties with countries in these regions, singling out China and India in particular. Russia’s isolation from Europe since the war in Ukraine has accelerated the Kremlin’s own geopolitical reorientation. Putin has frequently echoed these sentiments in his speeches, signaling his intention to “pivot to the East” not only with Russian gas and oil, but also culturally and politically. Two days after signing the humanitarian policy, the president reaffirmed his intentions during a speech at the Eastern Economic Forum, held in the city of Vladivostok with the aim of driving foreign investment in Russia’s easternmost region. He referred to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region as the new cultural, economic, and technological hegemons, contributing to the shift “toward a multipolar world” and thus challenging an “obsolete” Western-led rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if Moscow has upheld the principle of noninterference in its relations with Beijing and New Delhi, the opposite is true about the Kremlin’s intentions toward countries perceived as part of the Russian World. As mentioned above, the Putin administration respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the post-Soviet nations as long as they do not question and dispute Russia’s leading cultural, political, and economic posture in the region. This contradiction in Moscow’s thinking is embedded in the humanitarian policy. The document prioritizes the advancement of bilateral and multilateral cooperation between the Kremlin and the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a regional intergovernmental organization bringing Russia together with eight neighboring countries from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus. The decree maintains that one of the central goals of Russia’s humanitarian policy will be to create “a unified cultural, educational, and informational environment” and strengthen the “historically entrenched” position of the Russian language in the CIS. Although the CIS countries cumulatively have nine different official languages, the decree only acknowledges and promotes the culture and language of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while there is no mention of Ukraine in the humanitarian policy, clause 94 of the document stresses that the Kremlin will maintain close diplomatic ties with the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic — statelet names that Putin excluded from the decree on October 17, following sham referendums held in late September that led to the proclamation of these territories as official parts of the Russian Federation. The updated version of clause 94 now only mentions two breakaway and internationally unrecognized territories: Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Moscow acknowledged as “independent states” after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. The decree emphasizes the strengthening of diplomatic ties between the Russian Federation and these South Caucasian “republics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, clause 62 of the decree pledges to protect the rights and interests of Russian compatriots living abroad and to assist them in “the preservation of the all-Russian cultural identity.” At the same time, clause 95 warns that the Kremlin will carefully observe the “protection of the rights of Russian-speakers” in the post-Soviet states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and Georgia, which will impact Russia’s foreign policy decisions vis-à-vis these nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;should-the-singled-out-be-concerned&quot;&gt;SHOULD THE SINGLED-OUT BE CONCERNED?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While clauses 62 and 95 do not seem menacing at first glance, their subtext surely is. Singling out the post-Soviet states that are either in NATO and the European Union, in the case of the Baltic countries, or have pro-Western aspirations, in the case of Moldova and Georgia, is by no means an accident. Instead, it is a clear reaction to the drastically changing security environment in Russia’s “historical lands,” which the Kremlin believes have become hostile parts of Russkiy Mir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow had been basing its right to protect Russian speakers from continued oppression and discrimination in foreign countries, including Ukraine, on the United Nations’ principle of “responsibility to protect.” From now on, however, it can use the language of the humanitarian policy, specifically clause 62, to justify Russia’s interference in the domestic affairs of other post-Soviet states — presenting it as a sign of the Kremlin’s unwavering commitment to the safety and security of all Russian-speaking communities residing abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the invasion, thousands of Russians opposing Putin’s war have fled the Russian Federation, attempting to find safe havens in the neighboring countries of post-Soviet Eurasia and even the European Union. According to Kirill Krivosheev, a journalist with Russia’s Kommersant newspaper, the immediate problems created by Russian expatriates in these countries are “somewhat more mundane,” including a shortage of places and increased rent and consumer prices. Most Russians fleeing the regime do not seek to create or contribute to heightened political tensions between the Kremlin and the governments of the former Soviet countries. However, Krivosheev also notes that “given Putin’s penchant for launching wars with the purported aim of protecting ethnic Russians . . . the idea that tomorrow he may decide to ‘protect’ those Russians who have escaped his grip no longer seems entirely outlandish.” In this context, the humanitarian policy can also be viewed as a means for Moscow to justify aggressive intelligence operations in its near abroad because the Russian émigrés, even if they oppose the regime and the war, are still part of the Kremlin’s Russkiy Mir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baltic States:&lt;/strong&gt; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, three Baltic nations with a combined population of approximately 6 million people, have sizeable Russian-speaking communities. About 25 percent of Estonia’s population of 1.3 million and Latvia’s population of 1.9 million self-identify as ethnic Russians. This number is smaller, yet still significant, in Lithuania, where 15 percent of the 2.8 million citizens belong to the local Russian-speaking minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Baltic states have been unanimous in their efforts to curtail Moscow’s influence over ethnic Russians in their respective countries, from banning Russian and Belarusian television channels and online media outlets to demolishing Communist-era monuments. The three nations have also not been cowed by the release of the humanitarian policy. On September 7, the heads of the governments came to a joint decision to restrict entry indefinitely from Russia and Belarus for virtually all Russian citizens with EU visas. “What we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months, is that the number of border crossings by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,” declared Latvian minister for foreign affairs Edgars Rinkēvičs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states have remained similarly adamant in their decision to keep borders closed even for those Russian citizens who are running away from the partial military mobilization announced by Putin on September 21. Top diplomats have asserted that “being drafted into the army is not enough” to grant asylum to the fleeing Russians, claiming that they would still pose a significant threat to the national security of their respective nations, as well as to Euro-Atlantic stability more broadly. However, as Western European nations such as Germany and France continue to push back on efforts to block the entry into the European Union of Russians fleeing mobilization, it remains unclear to what extent the decisions of the Baltic states will affect the ability of these émigrés to seek shelter in Europe. In fact, despite facing opposition from the Baltic nations, the European Union received more than 100,000 Russian citizens in the weeks immediately following the announcement of partial mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that the travel ban on Russian citizens imposed by EU and NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania plays into President Putin’s narrative that the West uses Moscow’s “historical territories and people close to us living there” to cultivate hatred against Russia and Russians. Independent media outlets are already reporting that a rising number of Russians in these countries “are left feeling they may be losing their place in the society.” To prevent such ethnic tensions from escalating even further, Estonian president Alar Karis has called for mutual respect and sensitivity, acknowledging that “some residents of our country do have a different historical understanding,” as they “have not been taught an ideologically unbiased history of Estonia, Europe and the world.” However, considering the Kremlin’s history of malign influence operations in the Baltic states, these countries will have to ensure that their strong opposition to the Kremlin does not simultaneously alienate their own Russian-speaking minorities and thus create a vulnerability that Moscow could exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moldova:&lt;/strong&gt; Moldova is actively distancing itself from Russia. Yet the country is in a difficult political and security situation, as it still has up to 1,500 Russian troops present in the Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria. Additionally, while ethnic Russians account for 6 percent of the country’s overall population, their share in Transnistria reaches 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March 2022, Moldova applied for EU membership, seeking to cement its Westward turn. However, this was soon followed by a series of “terrorist incidents” in Transnistria, which the local de facto authorities promptly attributed to Kyiv. The central government introduced a state of emergency in the country but also stressed the importance of a diplomatic resolution of the conflict with Transnistria — which, through Moldova, maintains much stronger trade relations with the European Union than with Russia. More specifically, as a result of the 2014 Association Agreement between the European Union and Moldova, Transnistria now trades with 20 EU member states; 70 percent of its exports, including textile materials and steel products, end up in the European market. By contrast, exports to Russia experienced a steady decline, with a sharp fall from “$909 million between 2007 and 2010 to $232 million between 2015 and 2018.” Therefore, despite Transnistria’s intention to gain independence from Moldova, the local authorities seem to understand that the region’s “economic lifeline,” especially against the backdrop of a politically and economically isolated Russia, lies in its links to Brussels and Chisinau rather than to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central authorities in Moldova also understand the changing geopolitical context and its effects on domestic policymaking. On August 27, Moldovan Independence Day, President Maia Sandu told citizens celebrating at the Great National Assembly Square in Chisinau that “Russia’s unjust war against Ukraine clearly shows us the price of freedom. . . . The war will end, and we will be able to get out of these crises stronger, more resilient.” Similar sentiments were shared by the Moldovan minister of foreign affairs and European integration in late September, strongly condemning the Kremlin’s move to hold sham referendums in Ukraine’s Donbas region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Moldova’s pro-Western aspirations are on the rise, so is the Kremlin’s fear of losing yet another member of its Russian World. Putin believes that Russia is currently fighting not against Ukraine but “actually the entire military machine of the collective West,” which has been “nurturing the hatred of Russia for decades” across the former Soviet Union. Reflecting the president’s attitude, the humanitarian policy attempts to warn newly minted EU candidate Moldova of Moscow’s self-granted ability to protect Russian speakers in Transnistria and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be extremely difficult for Moscow to openly intervene in the domestic affairs of the Baltic NATO member states or even Moldova, sandwiched between Ukraine and NATO member Romania. Georgia, however, is a much easier target. According to the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI), a local nongovernmental organization, up to 50,000 citizens of Russia were staying in Georgia between March and June 2022. This figure has grown significantly since September 21, as more than 53,000 Russians crossed the Russo-Georgian border following Putin’s order on partial military mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides escaping the army and the war, Russian citizens travel to Georgia to circumvent the ongoing Western economic sanctions on technology and consumer goods and Russian businesses. Based on data from Transparency International, Russian émigrés have registered about 6,400 companies in Georgia since the start of the war in Ukraine. Most of the Russians settling in Georgia are encouraged by the existing visa regime, which enables them to stay in the country visa-free for up to a year. Even though several opposition parties have argued in favor of introducing visas for Russian citizens fleeing to Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party has disregarded the opposition’s plea as a “xenophobic” campaign aimed at dragging Tbilisi into an armed conflict with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet public opinion polls show that up to 60 percent of Georgians are concerned about the advancement of a pro-Kremlin agenda in their country and expect Russian military aggression in the near future. Despite — or perhaps because of — this, the majority of Georgians remain highly supportive of Georgia’s EU (82 percent) and NATO (71 percent) aspirations, as well as of the Ukrainians fighting against Russian aggression (98 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 commentary, Igor Zevelev, then a visiting fellow with the CSIS Russia and Eurasia Program, claimed that the Russian diaspora in the South Caucasus “is relatively small, aging, and continues to shrink. It is not mobilized and thus cannot become an instrument of Russian foreign policy.” Today, however, Georgia faces a drastically different demographic picture, as the country of 3.7 million keeps accepting thousands of Russian expatriates daily. As time goes on, analysts will need to track the increased economic influence Russian workers and investors will have on the Georgian economy and what percentage of the Russian émigrés will seek long-term residency in their new home. As the Russian presence in Georgia becomes both more pronounced and influential, clause 95 in Moscow’s new humanitarian policy will continue to make the Georgian public wary. In the past several weeks, the exact text from the decree has been continuously circulated throughout Georgian media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant public concern, the government has not yet commented on Moscow’s self-proclaimed right to intervene should it one day decide Russian speakers are oppressed in any way in Georgia. Conveniently, and unsurprisingly, such a “humanitarian” act could coincide with a spike in the Kremlin’s fears that Tbilisi has become too comfortable with its Euro-Atlantic partners. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already raised its concerns regarding the joint Tbilisi-NATO military exercises that took place in Georgia in September 2022, stating that the West’s continuous efforts to “draw” Tbilisi into NATO present a national security threat to Russia and jeopardize peace and stability in the South Caucasus at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kazakhstan:&lt;/strong&gt; Even though the humanitarian policy does not list Kazakhstan as one of the five former Soviet states where Moscow pledges to observe the rights of local Russian-speaking groups, the Kremlin might revisit its approach as Russia’s influence in Central Asia starts to weaken. In stark contrast to January 2022, when it seemed that the Kremlin’s grip on the Tokayev government was as tight as ever, Putin’s Kazakh counterpart has become less transparent about where his political loyalties might lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokayev was one of the first leaders within the CSTO to refuse to send troops to assist the Kremlin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. More importantly, in a July phone call with European Council president Charles Michel, the Kazakh president expressed the country’s readiness to cooperate with the European Union on developing alternative delivery routes for oil and natural gas, including the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route — a direct affront to Moscow’s efforts to choke off European energy supplies and break the political will for the current sanctions regime. However, following Tokayev’s call with Michel, a Russian court temporarily closed down the Russo-Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium’s oil terminal in Russia. This move served as a warning for the Tokayev administration not to intervene in Moscow’s energy war with the West and a reminder that the Kremlin can still influence Kazakhstan’s foreign policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in its dealings with Russia, Kazakhstan has to factor in the thousands of Russian émigrés currently present in the country. Already, around 70,000 of them have received Kazakh ID numbers to open bank accounts and look for jobs, indicating that many Russians might be seeking a longer-term residence in this Central Asian republic. In the meantime, according to The Economist, the Kremlin “is already irked by the lack of cheerleading for its war from its supposed allies in the region,” including Kazakhstan. Therefore, as in Georgia, Moscow might use the humanitarian policy and presence of Russian speakers in Kazakhstan to check the country’s pro-Europe plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s new policy document outlines a pretext for future aggression against the post-Soviet states seeking greater political autonomy and a more liberal future. However, Russia currently finds itself in a severely weakened geopolitical position. As the Russian military is challenged in Ukraine and the economic and diplomatic effects of international sanctions become more pronounced, questions regarding Moscow’s actual capacity to uphold promises made in the humanitarian policy will become unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, experts claim that the long-held perception of the Kremlin’s authority as a mediator of conflicts and a guarantor of peace and security in the broader region is cracking. According to Jeffrey Mankoff, a senior associate with CSIS, “As Moscow bleeds in Ukraine, it is losing the ability to manipulate the other post-imperial conflicts that litter its borderlands.” Proving this point are renewed border clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus and Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Central Asia. These tensions have signaled Russia’s inability to effectively involve itself in several simultaneous conflicts in the region and have thus impacted Moscow’s standing in a larger post-Soviet Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering these changing geopolitical dynamics within the Kremlin’s supposed sphere of influence, it might seem easy to dismiss the threatening language of the humanitarian policy. However, such an increasingly prominent idea of Russian weakness in the Russian World could make the Putin regime even more desperate to exert its influence and therefore willing to take even greater risks in its efforts to claim post-Soviet hegemony. As Zaur Shiriyev, an analyst at Crisis Group, states, “There are no illusions in the region about Russia’s power. . . . No one wants to antagonize Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, besides Ukraine, Russian troops and military equipment are currently present in different contested territories across the former Soviet Union, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Transnistria, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow continues to exert significant economic and political influence over Belarus, providing multimillion-dollar loans to the Lukashenko regime and using the country as a staging area for the Russian military. Furthermore, the Putin administration still enjoys sufficient economic and political influence across the countries of Central Asia, which continue to rely on Russia’s security assistance, remittance inflows, and export routes. Finally, in the case of the Baltic states, despite the efforts of local authorities to battle Moscow’s propaganda at home, news has emerged about a large-scale Russian disinformation campaign aimed at mimicking reputable European media outlets to disseminate pro-Kremlin interpretations of the Ukraine war across the European Union. Considering Moscow’s entrenched position among Russian minority groups in the Baltic states, such disinformation campaigns could further intensify tensions between the local governments and Russian-speaking communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that current Western sanctions continue to erode Moscow’s economic and geopolitical lifelines, limiting its ability to exert power in the broader region. Still, a politically and economically weakened Russia has managed to ignite and manipulate various ethnic tensions and conflicts in the post-Soviet era. Today, the Putin regime wants the world to know that despite sanctions, Russia’s capacity to control its sphere of influence should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of the humanitarian policy serves exactly this purpose. By signing the decree into law, the Kremlin has made it crystal clear that it is buttressing the concept of Russkiy Mir — its nationalist narrative about Russia’s cultural, linguistic, and moral supremacy in the former Soviet Union. Already, the Security Council of the Russian Federation is discussing drafting a new language policy commensurate with the stated goals of the humanitarian policy, namely preservation and promotion of the Russian language against the backdrop of the ongoing “Westernization” of the world. According to Oleg Khramov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, creation of such a decree is necessary to “prevent further Latinization of the Russian society and preserve civilizational sovereignty” [emphasis added].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, the Putin regime wants the world to know that despite sanctions, Russia’s capacity to control its spheres of influence should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the humanitarian policy is part of a continuing effort by the Kremlin to claim that Russia is culturally distinct and separate from the West, furthering its view that the two are inevitable adversaries. Adding a cultural dimension to this conflict is also intended to help mobilize the Russian public and stoke nationalism against the West in support of a costly and possibly ruinous war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Putin’s Russia still has enough stamina to fight for its near abroad. The Kremlin is not yet backing off — indeed, it is doubling down. Accordingly, the West should be wary of Moscow’s revanchist tendencies in the post-Soviet bloc and remain on the alert for more trouble ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to reaping vast commercial rewards, nations with leading LEO broadband providers could enjoy increased resiliency in their communications, accuracy in positioning services, and even enhanced early warning capabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elite group of companies, primarily from the United States and Europe, are on the cutting edge of these efforts. But China has its own plans for LEO broadband, deep pockets of state funding to pursue those ambitions, and political ties to leverage through its Belt and Road Initiative. As the LEO broadband competition intensifies, policymakers need an accessible guide to these developments and recommendations for advancing U.S. interests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 2022, just over 63 percent of the 8 billion people in the world use the internet — leaving about 3 billion people (and potential customers) unconnected. To bridge this digital divide, governments and private commercial companies are investing in initiatives to build space-based broadband internet. If successful, these efforts have the potential to quickly connect people around the globe, as well as change the space environment itself. Several countries are launching national initiatives to establish low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations and capture large portions of a burgeoning market, unleashing extensive private- or state-backed resources to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition to provide broadband services from satellites is not new. The 1990s saw a similar commercial broadband internet boom that resulted in little success. Companies such as Teledesic, Celestri, Globalstar, Odyssey, and Iridium all proposed large satellite-communications (SATCOM) constellations in LEO, but almost all ended in bankruptcy by the early 2000s. As similar ambitions emerge 30 years later, will the new generation of LEO-based satellite broadband succeed? Today the barrier to entry to orbit has significantly decreased as technology, materials, and launch capabilities have become cheaper and more widely available. International competition to build, launch, and operate a low-cost and low-latency system that spans the globe is fierce, as the demand for fast, reliable, and affordable internet services continues to expand. As of 2022, only one operator, Starlink, is providing LEO-based service on the open market. High capital investment and extensive initial infrastructure requirements have slowed the commercialization of LEO broadband. However, this is set to change. Satellite broadband revenues have already increased by 1.1 percent in 2021, and global subscribers jumped by 11 percent — up to 3 million people — since the year prior. The global SATCOM market is estimated to grow to $40 billion by 2030, largely driven by LEO-based ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a LEO constellation — a network of LEO-based satellites necessary for continuous global broadband delivery — involves substantial upfront investment, specialized technical know-how, and the ability to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. As international competition in LEO communications intensifies, it is imperative that the U.S. government creates an enabling (yet robust) regulatory environment for U.S.-based ventures to thrive at home and abroad. The government can also support U.S. companies, as well as the development of norms and standards, in key international coordinating bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States profits significantly — economically, militarily, and in global norms and standards setting — from its dominance in global networks, capturing 38 percent of industry revenue in 2021. There have been significant investments in a U.S.-serviced space-based internet, to include U.S commercial endeavors and separate proposed Department of Defense (DOD) efforts. However, allies and competitors alike are launching their own ventures in an increasingly contentious market: Telesat LightSpeed is based in Canada, and the newly merged Eutelsat/OneWeb is supported by both private funders in India and the UK government. Perhaps the greatest U.S. competitor in the race to global connectivity through satellite broadband is China. It has proposed a 13,000-satellite constellation in LEO to serve residential and business needs in the Chinese market, as well as to underdeveloped internet markets across the globe. Leveraging its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public funding, and political and economic ties won through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China poses a real threat to U.S. dominance in this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers in Washington and many allied nations now appreciate the risks that Chinese vendors pose in 5G networks, undersea cables, and other vital communications links. But they have yet to consider the economic and strategic implications of LEO satellite constellations, which promise to deliver quality and continuous coverage in underserved markets and bring more of the world online. In addition to reaping vast commercial rewards, nations with leading LEO broadband providers could enjoy increased economic benefits, resiliency, greater control over international communications networks, more accuracy in positioning services, enhanced early-warning capabilities, and potentially even greater intelligence access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following analysis examines the competition for satellite broadband, focusing on the interests of the United States and China. Beginning with a description of proposed satellite network constellations and their effects on the space environment, the paper will then examine U.S. interests in space, China’s planned satellite broadband efforts (and the competitive environment that may build), and the risks of operating large constellations in low Earth orbit. Finally, the authors will conclude with recommendations for specific actors, with an emphasis on U.S. government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advantages-of-low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Advantages of Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites are typically launched into one of three popular orbits: LEO at 160 to 2,000 kilometers (99 to 1243 miles), medium Earth orbit (MEO) at 2,000 to 35,786 kilometers (1243 to 22,236 miles), or geosynchronous orbit (GEO) at up to 42,164 kilometers (26,199 miles). All three orbits have varying advantages and challenges for satellites operating within them. For example, a constellation in GEO can have global coverage with only three satellites because of its distance from the Earth’s surface; GEO is popular for communications for this reason. However, because the satellites are so far away from Earth there is a longer period of latency — i.e., the time it takes for the signal to route to a satellite in GEO and back down to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iVNOr0x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generation of satellite internet suppliers are placing satellites in LEO instead of the traditional GEO for a multitude of reasons. Satellites launched into LEO are typically smaller and lighter than those in GEO, meaning that less fuel is required, and companies can place more satellites in orbit per launch for lower costs. Additionally, since LEO satellites are in relatively close proximity to Earth — between 160 and 2,000 kilometers (99 and 1243 miles) above the surface — user terminals can detect multiple satellites at once and connect with greater accuracy. Because LEO satellites are in constant motion, each satellite can only service a relatively small area on Earth at any given moment, so a large constellation of satellites is necessary to provide continuous global coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications from LEO also experience a lower latency than satellites in GEO because they are so much closer to the Earth’s surface. LEO satellite operators tout that a web page can be opened around eight times faster when using LEO satellites than when using a traditional SATCOM system at GEO, something that has become more important to consumers who want to interact online in near-real time. This means that satellite internet needs to be capable of supporting high-throughput applications such as streaming, video conferencing, and real-time gaming. At the time of publication, LEO broadband constellations are capable of download speeds up to 250 megabits per second (Mbps), upload speeds of 30 Mbps, and latency of 25 milliseconds. This can be compared to cable internet, which in the United States can reach download speeds of up to 500 Mbps and upload speeds of 50 Mbps, with 100 milliseconds of latency. As more satellites are added to each constellation, these numbers will continue to improve for each respective provider. For nonstationary customers, such as airline travelers or maritime shipping vessels, LEO’s continuous coverage enables quicker and more reliable broadband than is currently provided through GEO- and MEO-based services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-the-digital-divide-through-leo&quot;&gt;Bridging the Digital Divide through LEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadband has proven to be a critical enabler for global “trade, employment, learning, leisure, and communications.” Access to the rapidly growing digital economy, which comprises roughly 15.5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), can be transformational for previously unconnected and underdeveloped regions. The World Bank estimates that a 10 percent increase in broadband access can cause a 1.38 percent jump in GDP among low- and middle-income countries. Particularly in remote, hard-to-reach areas where building dedicated ground infrastructure is too expensive or simply not possible, LEO systems can provide quality internet connectivity to populations that are unreliably served by legacy technology. In the case of outages or gaps in service, such as during conflict or natural disaster, LEO constellations can boost the resiliency of communications networks and help fill the gaps in global connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rural households across the globe, 63 percent of which do not have access to the internet as of 2020, satellite internet may be the only option for connectivity. Unlike other terrestrial forms of internet delivery, satellite terminals — receivers for space-based signals — require only a mostly unobstructed view of the sky and an electric connection. Current broadband services such as fiber optic cables, digital subscriber lines (DSL), or copper-based cable internet require extensive infrastructure (e.g., underground cable ducts or network tower construction) to become operational. The minimal and lower-cost ground-infrastructure requirements of satellite-based internet, coupled with LEO’s ability to provide broadband of a superior quality than other forms of satellite broadband (i.e., higher data rates with lower latency) makes LEO an extremely compelling solution for bridging gaps in the digital divide. Yet while there is great potential for space-based broadband, companies will need to improve quality, reliability, and affordability in order to meaningfully expand coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the barriers to entry and sustained operation are high, several operators throughout North America, Europe, and Asia are moving forward with LEO broadband plans. In the United States, SpaceX’s Starlink, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and Boeing are expected to be top competitors in the market. In January 2015, Elon Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, first announced a $10-billion space internet plan. This service, now known as Starlink, would reportedly come online after five years and would be a revenue stream for SpaceX to pursue founding a city on Mars. As of November 2022, Starlink has launched over 3,500 satellites, all on SpaceX launch vehicles, and offers coverage in more than 50 markets across North America, South America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Project Kuiper constellation has been in progress since 2019 and is expected to launch its first prototype satellites in early 2023, with the full constellation being implemented over the following five-year period. Named for the Kuiper Belt, a band of icy celestial bodies just beyond Neptune’s orbit, Kuiper is meant to be available to residential customers as well as an anchor for Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing. According to its operating license granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), half of Kuiper’s 1,618 satellite constellation must be launched by 2026, and the full constellation by 2029. In April 2022, Amazon announced landmark launch agreements with Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) for a total of 83 launches of Kuiper satellites over a period of five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Verizon and T-Mobile are testing telecommunications integration with LEO satellites to create more robust fifth-generation (5G) wireless services. This added competition from traditional terrestrial broadband providers will likely drive down prices in previously monopolized markets. In October 2021, Verizon and Project Kuiper announced a collaboration that would enable Project Kuiper satellites to “deliver backhaul solutions to extend Verizon’s 4G/LTE and 5G data networks, connecting rural and remote communities in the U.S.” In August 2022, SpaceX and T-Mobile announced a similar agreement that would enable next-generation Starlink satellites (to be launched in 2023) to communicate with cell phones consumers already own, theoretically eliminating dead zones in the T-Mobile cellular network. Customers could then call, text, and possibly stream videos without connection to a cell tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing has been publicly discussing investing in satellite internet since 2015, hoping to substantially increase internet capability while driving down the cost of satellite networks. After it failed to gain FCC approval for a 3,000-satellite LEO broadband constellation in 2017, an updated plan for a 147-satellite constellation was approved in 2021. This “V-band Constellation,” as it is called in its FCC application, would provide internet and communication services to the United States and its territories before expanding globally. The 147 satellites are to be broken down into LEO and GEO segments, with 132 satellites orbiting at 1,056 kilometers (656 miles) and 15 additional satellites orbiting between 27,355 and 44,221 kilometers (16,998 and 27,478 miles). According to its operating license granted by the FCC, half of the constellation must be launched by November 2027, and the rest by November 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telesat, established by the Canadian parliament in 1969, has continued to operate domestic satellite communications networks in the years since, even after the company officially separated from the Canadian government in 2008. Telesat announced its Lightspeed LEO constellation in 2016, creating a network of 188 satellites orbiting at 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above Earth. Lightspeed does not aim to be a consumer broadband company but will instead market to cruise ships, airlines, and rural municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest publicly known plan for satellite broadband in Asia comes from China. Following the disintegration of two broadband constellation projects, China applied to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to operate a 12,992-satellite fleet in LEO in 2020. In early 2022, the local government of Shanghai entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with state-funded SatNet; in return for unknown support, SatNet will establish a space hub for the production of satellites and reusable launch vehicles in Shanghai. Additional details about the constellation have not been made public, but SatNet is to be a critical part of China’s political goal of being a leader in advanced technology across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, several would-be LEO operators have been forced to scale back their ambitions, declare bankruptcy, or seek drastic measures to keep afloat. UK-based LEO broadband start-up OneWeb filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, only eight years after it was founded. Narrowly managing to escape default, the company received funding from the UK government and Bharti International, a large Indian conglomerate. Despite being one of the few firms close to bringing a product to market, having launched 66 percent (428 satellites) of its first constellation fleet and having received FCC permission to provide service in the United States, OneWeb struggled to attract the levels of investment it needed to stay afloat. In July 2022, the company merged with Eutelsat, a GEO satellite operator backed by French and Chinese funders, to bridge its growing financial gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar merger is expected to be finalized between U.S.-based GEO satellite operator ViaSat and UK-based satellite operator Inmarsat to deploy a constellation of 150 LEO satellites to join Inmarsat’s already established GEO network. This constellation, named Orchestra, will provide increased cybersecurity to government customers, integrate with 5G services, and improve the network’s latency, resiliency, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leo-economics&quot;&gt;LEO Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the LEO satellite internet industry is heavily concentrated among a few private sector companies and government-backed or -owned ventures. The high capital expenditure requirements for launching, maintaining, and manufacturing LEO constellations, along with the competition over finite spectrum resources and near-Earth orbital space contribute to the market having only a few major players. LEO constellations are expensive in both resources and time. Establishing a satellite constellation capable of global coverage — necessary for continuous broadband service in any one location — is a long-term endeavor. Furthermore, licensing and regulatory requirements are extensive and highly variable across different countries, leading to greater uncertainty and high compliance costs. Investing in LEO broadband is a long-term venture with many uncertainties and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the business case for LEO broadband is strong. Global demand for connectivity remains high — and so does the demand for low latency and quality service. Rural areas are a key potential consumer base for satellite-broadband operators, and the quality promised by LEO-based constellations make them a favored avenue to satisfy demand. In the United States alone, 28 percent of rural households (roughly 4.8 million Americans) remain unconnected — but a MossAdams study reports that both subscribership and average revenue per user in U.S. rural areas are also on the rise. Other key consumer bases for LEO-based services include business-to-business (B2B) applications, nonstationary customers such as airlines and shipping conglomerates, and developing economies. Some LEO providers, Telesat and OneWeb included, are focusing entirely on B2B applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty for the LEO broadband business case is that it requires substantial and costly infrastructure: hardware and software for satellites, ground stations, secure launch vehicles, and space situational awareness (SSA), just to name a few. Every segment needs to successfully work together and provide a high-quality product for the business to draw in customers and make a return on investment. Because of the growing desire for worldwide connectivity, experts assess that a strong and growing market will reach a 20 percent compound annual growth rate by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the establishment of a LEO-based constellation, companies will be able to offer a range of services beyond simple connectivity, such as cloud computing, entertainment streaming, remote internet of things (IoT) applications, and government and military uses. Once high initial barriers to connectivity are satisfied, extending service offerings involves relatively low marginal costs. Indeed, operators are already exploring LEO-constellation applications beyond direct broadband delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector investment in space companies exceeded $10 billion in 2021, 60 to 70 percent of which is now directed into LEO-related ventures. Venture capitalists, encouraged by decreasing launch costs and the development of commercially viable applications, have also turned their attention toward space firms operating in LEO. While investment is increasing, current levels may not be enough to sustain a crowded industry due to the long-term nature of the LEO broadband enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building and operating large LEO constellations are incredibly complex and expensive, and today the industry is primarily driven by large companies with vast monetary reserves or by SOEs, a paradigm reinforced by structural and policy challenges. McKinsey estimates a $5 to $10 billion price tag for deploying an operational LEO satellite constellation. On top of that, recurring operating and maintenance costs are predicted to run companies $1 to $2 billion per year. In October 2022, Elon Musk said that the cost of the Starlink operation in Ukraine — including providing terminals and maintaining satellites and ground stations, among other expenditures — would reach $100 million by the end of the year. Though extenuating circumstances are driving this estimate up to much higher-than-average national operating costs, it is an example of the large funding necessary to maintain a successful and operational network in a time of crisis. High barriers to entry have resulted in the need for continuous and substantial investment financing for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO constellations have the potential to reshape global networks, both those in orbit and on the ground. While reliant on the placement of numerous ground stations to extend service, the development of optical intersatellite links — communication channels that allow satellites within the same constellation to transfer data seamlessly between one another — will (when operational) further reduce the need for expensive ground infrastructure. Despite these advancements, one of the largest barriers to wide commercial adoption of LEO broadband services remains affordability. While end-user terminals allow communities to bypass the large infrastructure needs of traditional broadband delivery, production costs range anywhere from $1,000 for a home-use terminal to $10,000 for an airborne terminal (another potential market), making them prohibitively expensive for most customers in developing economies. Industry experts estimate the price of home terminals will be cut in half by the 2030s, with Amazon’s Project Kuiper already reporting terminal production costs will be under $500 per unit. Still, LEO satellite terminals are estimated to be approximately three times more expensive than GEO satellite terminals and seven times more expensive than traditional internet routers. Companies are likely to highly subsidize current and future terminals to incentivize adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high capital expenditures of manufacturing, launching, and maintaining a satellite constellation and its constituent parts require providers to charge high prices to recuperate these substantial early-stage investments. However, the average revenue per user in most developing markets is not currently high enough for companies to sustain operations. Instead, it is likely that select households will adopt and pay for these services, potentially driving the price down for expansion to underserved populations. Lack of access to broadband is heavily correlated with poverty, and the companies that can quickly decrease costs and meaningfully expand access to underserved populations could capture significant portions of the market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-space-broadband-vision&quot;&gt;China’s Space Broadband Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space sector has historically been dominated by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). As an SOE, CASC, along with its many subsidiaries, is tasked with the “research, design, manufacture, test and launch of ” all space-based activities. Only over the past 10 years has there been a slow emergence of space firms not solely government-owned or -operated. Document 60, a policy directive issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2014, unlocked a small portion of the space sector to private financing and created the first Chinese commercial space companies. A 2016 white paper called for increased “cooperation with private investors” on space, signaling a more relaxed approach to the restricted sector. It wasn’t until 2019 that an NDRC directive opened the majority of China’s nascent space economy to private investors at home and abroad. With broader permissions than allowed by Document 60, this directive prompted a significant shift in China’s space and satellite communications sector. That year, the country surpassed all but the United States in the number of space start-ups receiving funding, as well as in the amount of funding received, drawing 16 percent of total global investment in these ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting flood of capital led to a boom in Chinese space start-ups. As the sector matures, so will China’s capacity to grow and operationalize its space-based assets. According to an unclassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, China doubled the number of satellites it has in orbit from 250 to 499 between 2019 and 2021. Accelerated by strong and well-communicated political will, that number is expected to grow quickly moving forward. Chinese auto manufacturer Geely, for example, is employing its deep manufacturing expertise to build a factory capable of producing 500 satellites per year by 2025. According to Euroconsult, more than $1.9 billion was invested into China’s commercial space companies between 2014 and 2020, half of which came from private capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space sector and commercial capabilities have seen dramatic changes over the past 10 years. Bolstered by state resources and China’s extensive Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative, Chinese LEO operators are well placed to provide service to a global market and pose a significant competitive threat to U.S. strategic and economic interests. Beijing start-up GalaxySpace launched several operational satellites in March 2022 that will eventually form a larger, multiconstellation, interconnected Chinese “National Network” of LEO communications, Earth observation, and navigation satellites. GalaxySpace intends to develop an integrated satellite/terrestrial 5G network via a 1,000-satellite constellation. ITU spectrum applications in 2020 show plans for an additional Chinese constellation consisting of 12,992 satellites, indicative of aims to develop a national network. Public ITU documents suggest this constellation, referred to as GuoWang or StarNet, will consist of two subconstellations capable of global broadband delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s attempt to deploy a national LEO broadband constellation enjoys significant support from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2020, China’s NDRC added satellite internet to its list of priority “new infrastructures,” signaling increased investment and support for the burgeoning commercial sector. Adopted in 2021, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly outlined the goal of establishing “a space infrastructure system for communication, navigation and remote sensing with global coverage and efficient operation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allocating and directing resources toward competing enterprises, some of which are government-backed, China is developing a space sector capable of producing the infrastructure and expertise to support its vision for a national space-based internet. Shepherded by major CCP policy announcements and signals, the country’s LEO communications market has trended toward consolidation over the past two years. Investment, flowing hotly since the sector opened in 2019, is beginning to cool and concentrate on fewer firms. In April 2021, China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the body responsible for oversight of China’s biggest SOEs, created China SatNet to manage the GuoWang constellation, blurring the lines between it being a government- or commercial-led service. SASAC’s direct creation and administration of SatNet places the company on the same level as China’s three national telecommunication companies, as well as the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) and CASC. Elevating SatNet to the level of the country’s most important SOEs likely grants the organization significant autonomy and expanded state support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASIC and CASC have each launched experimental satellites for their own LEO constellations — Hongyun and Hongyan, respectively — that aim to provide connectivity to China’s remote regions and to select maritime and air-travel customers. There is a significant chance that plans for both constellations will be absorbed by SatNet’s GuoWang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;China’s Competitive Advantage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the country’s SOEs and its existing efforts under the DSR initiative, China could become an extremely robust competitor. China SatNet, along with CASIC’s and CASC’s LEO communications ventures, enjoys nearly unrestricted funding, municipal government support, and significant regulatory leeway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R5E7vB0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Timeline of Select Chinese Policies on LEO Broadband.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following directives from the central government, municipal actors are heavily incentivized to invest in designated “strategic” sectors. For example, the city of Wuhan has committed to developing a local 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) space industry by 2025. In a bid to host the Chinese “valley of satellites,” Wuhan is offering millions in concessional financing to space companies. The city’s pledges, however, pale in comparison to those of China’s richer coastal regions. Taking advantage of this sentiment, SatNet executives have traveled to multiple cities in China attempting to court local leaders, receive regulatory concessions, and link SatNet with existing domestic industrial bases. The same day that Shanghai announced a flurry of new initiatives to grow the city’s space sector, local leaders signed a cooperation agreement with SatNet. Chongqing, host to the majority of CASC’s LEO Hongyan operations, has also signed a codevelopment agreement with SatNet for a new satellite industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic concessions at home are bolstered by China’s foreign engagement through the DSR and the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor, part of the broader BRI. China’s 2021 white paper on space referenced the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor as a key avenue through which to “strengthen cooperation on the application of . . . communication satellites.” Since 2016, China has signed over 117 space cooperation agreements and 19 memorandums of understanding with at least 37 foreign governments to share space-related infrastructure and build ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s successful strategy of exporting terrestrial infrastructure through the DSR — up to 70 percent of 4G network infrastructure across Africa was built by Huawei — these agreements and engagements may significantly help the country achieve its aspiration of hosting a globally adopted LEO broadband service. With its heavy economic presence in many BRI countries, China is positioned to negotiate regulatory concessions for its national LEO system while discouraging the adoption of U.S. commercial services. A combination of diplomatic maneuvering, the bundling of hard infrastructure and digital services, and attractive pricing will likely make it difficult to compete with Chinese companies for market share in BRI countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominance in foreign markets comes with benefits beyond economic gains. China’s heavy information and communication technology (ICT) presence in BRI countries creates path dependencies, spreads techno-authoritarian norms and standards, grows China’s voice in international governance and standards bodies, and strengthens China’s power over global networks. The successful proliferation of Chinese LEO broadband service could similarly boost China’s presence in foreign terrestrial networks, providing Beijing with greater control over international data flows and granting it extensive intelligence and coercive powers. China’s open push for civil-military integration suggests built-in dual-use capabilities in overseas BRI infrastructure. A planning document published by the State Council in 2016 reiterated China’s ambitions to establish satellite communications systems, linking them to the “development of military-civil fusion, in order to obtain global service capabilities as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the role that LEO constellations will potentially play in communications networks, countries that permit Chinese ground stations and grant the country landing rights may find it less costly to continue adopting Chinese ICT technology. This digital dependency is fostered through exorbitant replacement costs and a reliance on a small set of vendors, often SOEs, that rate low on interoperability. High levels of dependency on Chinese-built and -operated digital infrastructure may lead to the default adoption of Chinese-crafted norms, standards, and data governance practices. Tanzania, a close BRI partner country, has modeled a subset of its data and cybersecurity laws after Beijing’s example leading to more restrictions on country’s social media landscape and information flows. Such adoption and regulatory alignment in turn reduces regulatory compliance costs for purchasing other Chinese-origin ICT technology. For countries such as Pakistan and Egypt, whose entire suite of digital infrastructure heavily features Chinese assets — from submarine cables and terrestrial fiber optic lines to 5G networks and satellite ground stations — the choice to integrate Chinese LEO broadband into existing network stacks will be a relatively easy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Security Implications for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States holds an advantage in the competition over LEO broadband, as just under 50 percent of new companies seeking to operate in LEO originate in the country. But as China continues to further its ambitions for its own LEO broadband network, which may fall somewhere in the gray zone between commercial and governmental, the United States could lose its competitive edge. Furthermore, agreements through the DSR and the BRI could help China make inroads as the LEO broadband provider of choice in countries in Asia, South America, and Africa that do not currently have widespread internet infrastructure but do have good relationships with China. This could make burgeoning broadband markets reliant on Chinese services, leaving less room for U.S. manufacturers to provide service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also been known to block certain websites for citizens using domestic internet sources; Western applications such as Google Maps are not available on Chinese-built phones and networks, and often domestic apps can only be accessed by divulging privacy information or verifying one’s identity. If SatNet’s GuoWang constellation becomes the dominant broadband supplier, users could be blocked from accessing entire sections of the internet or expose personal and identifying data to network operators. This could further exacerbate the suppression or censorship of information in countries where there is already a widespread information vacuum or civil unrest. An infamous case of Chinese intelligence using BRI-built networks involves the African Union. Although officials have denied the allegations, for five years the African Union headquarters — paid, built, and wired by China — would send daily transmissions of confidential data to Beijing. Conversely, open connectivity can support citizens who need accessible information and communication channels, particularly in times of civil unrest when citizens need access to unrestricted, reliable services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing efficient and affordable broadband services based in LEO is not only a priority for privately funded industry but also for the U.S. military. From relaying massive amounts of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data to detecting and tracking missiles to providing command, control, and communications for units in austere locations across the globe, the U.S. military’s demand for SATCOM continues to grow. The DOD has been working to build its own satellite broadband networks, the most public of which is the National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA) being designed by the Space Development Agency. The NDSA will consist of several layers of military constellations in LEO, each focusing on different aspects to enhance military connectivity, sensing, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing domestic military capability, the U.S. Space Force has shown interest in leveraging commercial services to increase the resiliency of military broadband networks and communications. The Space Force is currently working on a design to build a “space data backbone,” a service that will be able to integrate military, commercial, civil, and possibly allied networks. This access would follow a “fee for service” model wherein the Space Force would pay a fixed price to use a particular bandwidth over a fixed amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will the U.S. military depend on advanced LEO broadband constellations for its own network operations, but LEO broadband is already being used — and targeted — on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Starlink terminals SpaceX sent have been used by the Ukrainian military and people alike, connecting a country whose other operating forms of communication were hacked and jammed in the initial days of the conflict — though SpaceX has had to devote additional funding and resources to protect the signals from attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leo-broadband-licensing&quot;&gt;LEO Broadband Licensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years alone, the FCC has received applications for over 64,000 new satellites. For perspective, there are only 6,800 functioning satellites in orbit as of November 2022. Regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over space and space-related activities are struggling to keep pace with private sector growth in managing these constellations, a task that is correspondingly growing in difficulty. The rise of commercial space-based operations more broadly has forced new paradigms on a sector previously dominated by government and defense ventures, highlighting the need for updated regulation and an increase in capacity for the regulatory review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensing requirements include allocating limited spectrum among a host of global actors, granting launch permissions, coordinating with international bodies, and managing orbital capacity and debris. In the United States, no single agency is responsible for overseeing these requirements; regulatory authority and review are unevenly split among the FCC, the DOD, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While not all the listed agencies are involved in regulating LEO broadband constellations in particular, coordination among agencies can be difficult, and shifting regulatory responsibilities slows progress and exacerbates issues resulting from varying levels of proficiency on space-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCC regulates the frequencies that satellite constellations can use and, as such, is often the first stop for companies looking to begin operations. The commission, which has historically auctioned spectrum licenses on a first-come, first-served basis, is considering updating its auction rules for LEO-based satellite operators to ensure that operators licensed in earlier rounds have their spectrum access protected. The FCC, through its mandate to issue licenses “if public convenience, interest, or necessity will be served thereby,” has often gone beyond the direct regulation of spectrum use. The agency made headlines after it denied one operator a license for the launch of small satellites (11 x 11 x 2.8 cm) due to concerns the satellites would be too small for adequate tracking and SSA. Unable to keep pace with a rapidly evolving industry, the commission is planning to reorganize, potentially creating a new Space Bureau and an Office of International Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate licensing for LEO constellations, satellite operators are not only regulated by their own governments but by global entities as well. Though approval for the design and launch of communications constellations first comes from the licensing authority of the corresponding government (e.g., the FCC in the United States), the only international regulatory body that approves satellites before launch is the ITU, part of the United Nations. The ITU — which includes two different member groups, composed of 193 countries and 900 private sector companies — is responsible for managing “the international coordination, notification and recording of the specific radio frequencies transmitted and received by satellites.” Because spectrum is a limited resource, the ITU process aims to establish impartial access while also limiting interference that may occur between satellite systems. Due to availability and other technical considerations, operators need to share certain spectrum bands with one another. The process for allocating spectrum is therefore extremely competitive. Representatives of the ITU member states license satellite systems, then file descriptions of the projects with the union, which shares the descriptions and findings with other member states. Prelaunch filings are made so that harmful interference between proposed projects can be resolved bilaterally between member states. Satellite filings are also required to be used within seven years from the date of the request or else the reserved spectrum is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the global nature of space, regulators also need to consider emerging and conflicting interests between U.S. firms and foreign competitors and between market incumbents and entrants. One of the largest bottlenecks to market dominance in LEO broadband is licensing: “The most difficult aspect of building a [low Earth orbit] broadband system is acquiring the spectrum, not building and launching satellites,” according to Quilty Analytics. For U.S. companies that compete against foreign firms facing different national regulatory structures, requirements, and enforcement capabilities, comparatively stringent domestic requirements are costly and dampen U.S. firms’ first-mover advantage. Additionally, regulations regarding landing rights, ground stations and related infrastructure, and market access vary significantly by country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High compliance costs notwithstanding, competition from national telecommunication companies and domestic LEO ventures in host countries is fierce. Domestic companies looking to defend their market share often lobby their governments to implement protectionist policies masquerading as regulatory requirements. For example, SpaceX’s attempt to expand Starlink service into India was strongly opposed by OneWeb, a firm with substantial investment from Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises. Eventually, SpaceX’s attempts to secure the necessary licenses stalled, and the company had to halt presales in the region. Some countries forbid foreign ownership over telecommunications infrastructure outright, forcing entrants to set up joint ventures with domestic firms or open locally owned and operated companies as a prerequisite for market access. Conversely, the FCC Satellite Division often grants permission for U.S. market access to commercial satellites licensed by other countries. There is a risk that asymmetric requirements between U.S. license holders and foreign-licensed companies with permission to operate in the United States may create an uneven playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, staff shortages, a more complicated operating environment, multiple processing rounds, and poorly defined deadlines have elongated license approval timelines for satellite licenses. Since LEO constellations involve many rapidly evolving technologies, by the time licenses are granted, the subjects of those licenses risk becoming obsolete. The pace of development in related technology often means that licenses, once granted, must be updated to reflect new advancements. This, in turn, slows down government review. Long licensing timelines across the entire space sector delay the process of bringing a product to market, resulting in market uncertainty and lower profit projections that dampen sector growth. Navigating an onerous regulatory process — while also facing narrow profit margins and unforgiving business models of LEO broadband systems — can make it impossible for all but the largest, most well-resourced companies to obtain licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risks-and-operator-mitigation&quot;&gt;Risks and Operator Mitigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As increased opportunities emerge in LEO, so do the risks — not only due to international competition but also due to the unforgiving space environment itself. The space domain is becoming more diverse, disruptive, disordered, and dangerous as more countries and companies begin to operate there. When looking at proposed LEO broadband networks, risks can include — but are not limited to — on-orbit collisions in space, disruptions to astronomy missions, and political discord between nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest risks associated with the launch of large constellations is to the space environment itself; an increase in the number of satellites in orbit increases the potential for collisions. As of November 7, 2022, there have been about 14,450 satellites launched into Earth orbit. About 9,610 of these satellites are still in space — of which 6,800 are still functioning. Government-conducted destructive anti-satellite (ASAT) tests have significantly contributed to debris creation, and upper-stage rocket bodies left in orbit have fragmented into thousands of large debris objects. These activities have created over 27,000 pieces of trackable debris being monitored by DOD’s Space Surveillance Network — not including pieces that are too small to detect. These high-velocity pieces of “space junk” make operating in the space environment more dangerous, and the possibility of a collision increases the more objects enter orbit. SpaceX alone has requested FCC authorization for another 30,000 satellites (it has received authorization for 7,500 of the 30,000 as of December 2022). OneWeb, Amazon, Telesat, and China SatNet constellation plans are similarly in the thousands. Together, proposed LEO broadband constellations could potentially add over 90,000 satellites into Earth orbit, vastly changing the operational domain. In April 2021, reports surfaced that SpaceX and OneWeb had an alleged close approach between their respective satellites. There was no collision, and both companies have differing opinions on the risk their satellites faced. However, a significant increase in satellites orbiting in LEO could restrict additional space activities, including impacting future human spaceflight and launch schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink satellites have SSA capabilities on board and can perform avoidance maneuvers autonomously based on the satellite’s knowledge of its current position and information about potential close approaches. These capabilities have already proven to be necessary; Starlink satellites have reportedly had to maneuver over 1,700 times to avoid orbital debris from Russia’s 2021 ASAT test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no satellites from the Project Kuiper constellation are currently in orbit, space safety and sustainability have been emphasized throughout Amazon’s design process. Project Kuiper satellites will have active propulsion systems on board and be programmed to perform avoidance maneuvers if the risk of collision is estimated to be more than 1 in 100,000. Additionally, the constellation’s low altitude will increase the ability for satellites to be deorbited faster and more reliably. Kuiper satellites are scheduled to actively deorbit within one year of a completed mission and, if this fails, will naturally deorbit within 10 years. Satellites will have be held to a tight orbital tolerance, the distance in which a satellite can move in orbit, of within 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) to avoid overlapping with other large LEO systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OneWeb also has an SSA component via an agreement with LeoLabs to incorporate its Collision Avoidance service. This agreement adds another layer of operational safety to OneWeb satellites, allowing the on-orbit systems to receive real-time data regarding the location of space debris and other satellites. This LeoLabs service is also used by SpaceX and the Earth imaging company Planet, which operates a 200-satellite Earth-observation fleet. In addition to the LeoLabs software, OneWeb satellites incorporate sustainable components, such as grappling fixtures and a magnetic docking plate so they can be deorbited or serviced in an active debris removal mission if necessary. Because the satellites were designed in France, the fleet also is ready to comply with the France Space Operation Act, which mandates that all LEO satellite operators deorbit satellites at the close of their operational activity. In October 2022, Iridium, OneWeb, and SpaceX released a set of “Satellite Orbital Safety Best Practices” through the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to “guide and improve cooperative operations in space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk to the space environment is the potential for satellites to interfere with astronomical observations. Astronomers have raised concerns that Starlink satellites have disrupted night-sky observations, blocking or interrupting telescope images, with the potential for further disruptions as more satellites from additional operators are launched into orbit. Environmental groups in France have been so vocal about this subject — as well as the pollution caused by launches — that Starlink’s permit to operate in the country was temporarily overturned. Starlink competitor ViaSat has also criticized the vast Starlink fleet’s obstructions to astronomy and has filed court documents to stop it from launching more satellites based on environmental grounds, though this has not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to concerns, both Telesat and SpaceX have been working with the astronomy community to decrease the reflectivity of their satellites. Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg reported that its satellites would be kept to a smaller constellation and will orbit at a higher altitude to ensure Telesat is a responsible user of the space domain. SpaceX has published details on the work it has undertaken to mitigate impacts to astronomy and has signed coordination agreements with the National Science Foundation to further collaborate on solutions. Changes to both the design and operation of the Starlink constellation have resulted in improvements to the brightness of satellites, mitigating the effect on astronomical observations. Amazon is also working with the National Science Foundation and the American Astronomical Society to incorporate astronomers’ concerns into current prototype plans. According to an interview with the company, Project Kuiper is limiting the number of satellites in its constellation and choosing an operating altitude with an eye toward sustainability and convenience, in keeping with best practices recommended by astronomers and industry. However, there is no permanent solution for astronomers using Earth-based telescopes. This challenge highlights a significant gap in the international regulatory system for space, as one country’s approvals of constellations can affect people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the space domain itself, intense broadband competition also carries a political dimension. A researcher in a Chinese peer-reviewed journal wrote about the threat Starlink’s spread posed to Chinese assets, that the country should “adopt a combination of soft and hard kill methods to disable some of the Starlink satellites and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” Though the paper was taken down shortly after publishing, this sentiment is not unique in China. An opinion piece published in the Chinese military’s official news site, China Military Online, wrote about Starlink’s “unchecked expansion” and alleged it had an “ambition to use it [the system] for military purposes” that should alarm governments worldwide. There has been no documented concern from Chinese media about the threats a domestic constellation may also pose to global space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trajectories of Starlink’s satellites have continued to draw political attention, most vocally from China. In two separate events in July 2020 and October 2021, Chinese officials claimed Starlink satellites came so close to the Tiangong space station that astronauts had to shelter in place. Chinese officials issued a complaint to the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, to which the United States replied on January 28, 2022, refuting claims that Starlink satellites endangered the crewed space station and that the satellites involved “did not meet the threshold of established emergency collision criteria.” While this issue has not been formally concluded, it is a potent reminder that the accurate tracking of space objects will be crucial in supporting or disputing similar claims in the future. Additionally, China does not currently publish the Tiangong space station’s planned maneuvers, unlike the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) does with the International Space Station, which could facilitate operator planning and coordination. This incident underscores the importance of having open avenues of communication as well as shared standards and data among all operators in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO systems have the potential to play a role in geopolitical competition with other competitors as well. A large shift in the geopolitical relationship between the United States and Russia, the two longest-standing space powers, took place after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. OneWeb had a launch of 36 satellites planned for March 4, 2022, from the Russian-operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, just a week after the invasion of Ukraine. Operations at Baikonur were immediately halted in late February, impacting the satellites OneWeb had sent to be launched by a Soyuz rocket. As of November 2022, the 36 satellites remain in Russia and have not been returned to OneWeb, which reported a $229 million loss after the incident. Looking for another provider, OneWeb turned to SpaceX, which operates competitor Starlink, to continue satellite launches to complete OneWeb’s constellation. This is not the first time SpaceX has launched satellites for a competitor: its Falcon 9 rockets launched upgrades for an Iridium communications constellation until 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Ukrainian officials issued a plea on Twitter at the onset of the Russian invasion of the country, Elon Musk pledged tens of thousands of Starlink user terminals to aid in connectivity around the country in March 2022. Furthermore, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces were using Starlink terminals to send targeting information to artillery and communicate with reconnaissance drones. Starlink’s involvement in the conflict opens the door to questions about commercial companies’ involvement in zones of geopolitical conflict and what risks this poses to their assets. Days after civilian Starlink services were established in Ukraine, Musk reported on Twitter that Russian forces had jammed user-terminal access. He further stated that the company had pushed out software updates to its assets to harden them against further attacks. The additional connections involved in operating a large LEO constellation increase the system’s vulnerability to cyberattacks or even jamming. Cyber connections need to be hardened and encryption increased to ensure communications are safe and not tampered with. However, this would likely come at a higher cost and add latency to the network. Commercial companies should be aware of what this risk management would cost and adapt their security if more instances of malware attacks are made public. Because commercial LEO broadband companies may be operational in conflict zones or support national-security missions, their systems will likely continue to be targets for electronic warfare or cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of U.S. private sector companies has led to cost reductions in launch services and satellite manufacturing and rapidly increased the pace of innovation in the space domain, all of which have led to the successful reemergence of space-based broadband operators. SpaceX is the first company to commercialize its LEO broadband constellation, allowing U.S. actors to take the lead in setting emerging standards, norms, and best practices. However, foreign competitors are close behind. U.S. government agencies can support and encourage — or, at a minimum, not hinder — commercial activity, uphold sustainability requirements for an increasingly congested orbit, and facilitate U.S. commercial growth, particularly in the broadband internet domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread is that regulatory clarity, speed, and reform at the FCC will have an enormous impact as commercial competition intensifies. As the FCC continues to play the dominant role in regulating satellite communications, it should take care to strike the appropriate balance between burdensome regulation and market development. Providing additional clarity and establishing defined approval timelines, adhering to deadlines on public comment periods, and opening communication channels with commercial companies submitting licensing requests are a few ways it can achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help address these issues, the FCC announced in November 2022 that it would open a new space bureau under its current International Bureau to improve commercial marketplace relations. The chairwoman of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel, conceded that the agency had not kept up with the rapid changes in the commercial space domain and stated that this office will “support the United States leadership and the emerging space economy, promote long term technical capacity to address satellite policies[,] and improve our coordination with other agencies on these issues.” At the time of publication, there is no timeline in place for this office to be fully functional, but assembling it should be a priority so that it can establish interagency communication and commercial market coordination as more companies launch their constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the FCC can increase coordination with international governing bodies. The regulations to which competing broadband companies are subject to can vary greatly, and U.S. companies may be held to unique standards that others in orbit are not. While the FCC and other regulatory bodies must maintain integrity in the regulatory process, it will only become more critical to coordinate with international partners to establish shared standards for operation in the space domain. The ITU could be a key partner for the United States and FCC in promoting common international norms and standards regarding shared spectrum. This can discourage dishonesty from actors with unclear motives in reserving spectrum and help identify deceptive actions by large actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Department of Commerce becomes more involved in the space domain, its SSA mission area will continue to increase in importance and affect every aspect of space. Increased SSA capabilities can include tracking even smaller debris, and current capabilities can successfully monitor objects 10 centimeters or larger, which would help create a more accurate picture of the operating environment for satellite operators around the globe. Ensuring that SSA data is widely accessible and that different tracking organizations’ standards are similar can provide clarity and consistency for an increasingly congested domain. Because broadband operators of LEO constellations will have larger numbers of satellites than ever before, accurate SSA will be integral to the successful and sustainable operation of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should also emphasize interacting with the international community to establish shared norms of operation for space systems in orbit, starting with operators in LEO. By creating widely adopted rules of operation, the United States can be a leader in the domain and make it easier to identify abnormal, potentially nefarious behavior. Global operating standards can also emphasize space sustainability, protecting various orbital regimes from space debris and ensuring that others will still be able to use the domain in years to come. These norms could potentially expand to include reciprocal regulations, which would make it easier for satellite operators to operate in multiple countries at once. International regulatory agencies could even work together to simplify license applications, potentially even creating a joint license application where one application could be used to apply to many countries at once. This could simplify standards for commercial companies and shift the speed at which licenses are approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, U.S. leaders should aim to increase soft power across the globe by working with commercial companies that can successfully operate broadband internet constellations and incorporate connectivity. The United States has a strong record of projecting soft power through space exploration, namely through NASA programs that have captivated the globe for decades. NASA has over 700 international agreements with more than 100 countries around the world, allowing the United States to maintain strong relationships with foreign governments through civil space agencies at times when collaboration may not be possible in other parts of government. The emergence of a strong U.S. commercial space sector that offers individual services extends the country’s possible reach — but it could lose this strategic soft power if China is able to leverage its current BRI networks to implement SatNet in developing regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the United States profits significantly from its dominance in global networks, and U.S.-based commercial satellite networks have a significant head start. But as the race for space-based communication networks intensifies, it is important that the United States government enact policies and incentives to keep U.S. companies competitive internationally. Even once firms have accumulated the vast capital and expertise required for entry into the LEO broadband market, they face high compliance costs and uncertainty in navigating multilevel regulatory regimes. Licensing requirements persist through domestic, foreign, and international processes, which are at times opaque, unaligned, and unevenly applied, as regulators may not be keeping pace with industry’s rate of innovation. Striking the right balance between appropriate regulation and market development is a perennial problem, one that should be reckoned with in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing competition in the race to establish space-based broadband networks carries many risks to a rapidly growing space domain. These include environmental, technical, and political risks, not to mention the challenge posed by looming international competition from China. Beijing has its own plans for a national LEO broadband network that benefits from extensive state funding and the political support gained through its BRI. Leveraging its heavy economic presence in a large portion of BRI countries, China is positioned to negotiate regulatory concessions for its LEO system while discouraging the adoption of U.S. commercial services. A combination of diplomatic maneuvering, the bundling of hard infrastructure and digital services, and attractive pricing will likely make it difficult to compete with Chinese companies for market share in BRI countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, U.S. companies often face protectionist barriers and a complex regulatory landscape when looking to expand into foreign markets. Requirements regarding landing rights, ground stations and related infrastructure, and market access vary significantly by country. Future regulatory changes need to consider competition between domestic market incumbents and new entrants as well. As U.S. government agencies begin to regulate the thousands of SATCOM satellites that will be launched into LEO in the next five to ten years, they will need to establish shared norms of operation for on-orbit space systems, more clearly convey licensing standards and practices, and communicate heavily with both domestic commercial companies and the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

Azu International Ltd Sti described itself as a wholesale trader of IT products, and a week later began shipping U.S. computer parts to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business was brisk, Russian customs records show. The United States and the EU had recently restricted sales of sensitive technology to Russia because of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and many Western tech companies had suspended all dealings with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-founded by Gokturk Agvaz, a Turkish businessman, Azu International stepped in to help fill the supply gap. Over the next seven months, the company exported at least $20 million worth of components to Russia, including chips made by U.S. manufacturers, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jJTpdwI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The LinkedIn profile of Gokturk Agvaz, Azu International’s co-founder. Agvaz recently sold his stake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azu International’s rapidly growing business didn’t come from a standing start, Reuters reporting shows: Agvaz manages a wholesaler of IT products in Germany called Smart Impex GmbH. Before the invasion, Russian custom records show that the German company shipped American and other products to a Moscow customer that recently has imported goods from Azu International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached at his office near Cologne in October, Agvaz told Reuters that Smart Impex stopped exporting to Russia to comply with EU trade restrictions but sells to Turkey, a non-EU country that doesn’t enforce most of the West’s sanctions against Moscow. “We cannot export to Russia, we cannot sell to Russia, and that’s why we just sell to Turkey,” he said. Asked about Azu International’s sales to Russia, he replied, “This is a business secret of ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contacted again shortly before publication, Agvaz said Smart Impex “observes all export restrictions and manufacturer bans” and “has not circumvented Western sanctions against Russia.” He said he couldn’t answer questions about Azu International. Turkish corporate records show he sold his 50% interest in the Istanbul company on Nov. 30 to his co-founder, Huma Gulum Ulucan. She couldn’t be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azu International is an example of how supply channels to Russia have remained open despite Western export restrictions and manufacturer bans. At least $2.6 billion of computer and other electronic components flowed into Russia in the seven months to Oct. 31, Russian customs records show. At least $777 million of these products were made by Western firms whose chips have been found in Russian weapons systems: America’s Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc and Analog Devices Inc., and Germany’s Infineon AG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6OTBJFg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Azu International, founded in March of this year, describes itself as a wholesale trader in IT products. Its offices are inside this business center in Istanbul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint investigation by Reuters and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense think tank, details for the first time the global supply chain that continues to feed Russia with Western computer components and other electronics. The investigation into this trade identified a galaxy of obscure importers and exporters, like Azu International, and found that shipments of semiconductors and other technology continue to arrive in Russia from Hong Kong, Turkey and other trading hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Russian importer, OOO Fortap, based in St. Petersburg, was set up by a Russian businessman in April and has since imported at least $138 million worth of electronics, including U.S. computer parts, according to Russian customs records. They show that one of Fortap’s biggest suppliers is a Turkish company, Bion Group Ltd Sti, a former textile trader that recently expanded into wholesale electronics. Bion’s general manager declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Russian importer, OOO Titan-Micro, registered an address that’s a house in a forest on the northern edge of Moscow. It, too, has imported Western computer components since the invasion, according to the customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the suppliers – including firms in Hong Kong and Turkey – have ties to Russian nationals, according to a review of company filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Logos of firms whose products have been shipped to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customs records – which Reuters purchased from three commercial providers – don’t identify the precise type of semiconductors and other electronic products, nor do they show what happens to the components once they arrive in Russia. Reuters reported in August that Western companies’ mass-produced chips, in many cases not subject to export restrictions, have shown up inside missiles and weapons systems the Russian military has deployed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters provided to Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and Infineon data from Russian customs records that detail shipments of their products that have arrived in Russia in recent months. Reuters excluded data between Feb. 25 and March 31 to account for shipments that might have been in transit before the invasion or before the manufacturers’ announced suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Intel said the company is taking the findings “very seriously and we are looking into the matter.” The spokesperson said Intel adheres to all sanctions and export controls against Russia and “has a clear policy that its distributors and customers must comply with all export requirements and international laws as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a spokesperson for AMD said the firm “strictly complies” with all export regulations and has suspended sales and support for its products in Russia. “That includes requiring all AMD customers and authorized distributors” to stop selling AMD products into Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infineon, too, said that after the invasion, it “instructed all distribution partners globally to prevent deliveries and to implement robust measures that will prevent any diversion of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments said it has not shipped to Russia since the end of February. Analog Devices didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Commerce said, “Since the start of the invasion, Russia’s access to semiconductors from all sources has been slashed by nearly 70 percent thanks to the actions of the unprecedented 38 nation coalition that has come together to respond to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s aggression. It is no surprise that Russia is working hard to circumvent controls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Reuters review of Russian customs data found that since the invasion, the declared value of semiconductor imports by Russia has, in fact, risen sharply. The spokesperson said the Commerce Department had analyzed different data and therefore couldn’t comment on Reuters findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s office and Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade didn’t respond to requests seeking comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stacks-of-boxes&quot;&gt;Stacks of boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the firms shipping Western technology to Russia is a Hong Kong- registered company called Pixel Devices Ltd. A Reuters journalist who visited Pixel Devices’ office in a Hong Kong business tower found a small room with cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling, and no employees. There was little sign that the company has shipped at least $210 million in electronics to Russia since April 1, including at least $50 million in Intel and AMD products through Oct. 31, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company records show that Pixel Devices was incorporated in 2017 by a Hong Kong firm called Bigfish Investments Ltd, controlled by Kirill Nosov, a Hong Kong resident with a Russian passport. Nosov told Reuters in an email that he helped set up the firm but doesn’t work for it and isn’t in a position to comment about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices’ current owner is a Singapore company, Asia Global Neolink Pte Ltd, which in turn is owned by a Seychelles company called White Wings Ltd, according to Hong Kong and Singapore company records. Pixel Devices’ only director at present is Pere Roura Cano, a Spaniard, who is also listed as a director of Asia Global Neolink and runs an aviation club in Catalonia. Reached by telephone in Spain, Roura Cano confirmed that Pixel Devices has been shipping semiconductors and other products to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m beginning with these people and I’m not sure what goods are moving,” he said. “I cannot inform you more; it’s our private activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices’ website, www.pixel-devices.com, was originally registered in 2017 with a web-services firm in St. Petersburg, according to internet intelligence firm DomainTools. The website states that Pixel Devices’ “Components &amp;amp; Subassemblies” division serves businesses in diversified sectors including military and aerospace. In response to questions from Reuters, Pixel Devices said it doesn’t sell products to the military sector and prohibits its customers from reselling to defense companies. It said some of the information on the website is “quite outdated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices said it has been supplying IT equipment to Russia for several years and “it is possible” that it shipped Intel and AMD products this year “as part of long-term contracts.” It said it acquires its products from manufacturers or their resellers and doesn’t supply components “that violate any binding policies imposed on the company by its partners, vendors, or distributors.” Intel and AMD told Reuters that Pixel Devices isn’t an authorized distributor of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ A screenshot of an English version of KompLiga’s website, compliga.ru. The firm, a supplier of IT products, is in St. Petersburg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices said it couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the values found by Reuters of the company’s exports of electronics to Russia; it didn’t provide its own figures. It also noted that export restrictions aren’t universal and there isn’t a complete ban on the export of IT equipment to Russia. The company said it doesn’t sell to entities controlled by sanctioned individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices also said it’s not surprising that no one was in Pixel Devices’ office recently because most employees work remotely or in warehouse operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that Pixel Devices’ main client in Russia is a company in St. Petersburg called OOO KompLiga. Its website, states that the firm can supply a wide range of IT products and parts. According to the customs records, since April 1, KompLiga has imported at least $181 million worth of electronics, almost exclusively from Pixel Devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KompLiga’s general manager, Aleksandr Kotelnikov, told Reuters he was reluctant to provide details on how his company manages to continue procuring Western electronic components. “I’d rather not disclose details about my company’s work so as not to tip off rivals and give them a helping hand in their hard work,” Kotelnikov wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iron-curtain&quot;&gt;“Iron curtain”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every Russian company is reluctant to discuss how to deal with export restrictions. A Moscow-based logistics firm, OOO Novelco, has been advising Russian businesses on how to continue importing foreign goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Novelco organized a seminar in Moscow for its clients on “how to find alternative ways to deliver goods” to Russia. In a 45-minute presentation entitled “Foreign trade tactics and strategies to compensate for sanctions,” Novelco’s chief executive, Grigory Grigoriev, urged companies to stockpile products and develop diversified pools of suppliers from more than one country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Novelco executive offered a tip for clients tempted to use the Chinese territory of Macau as a shipping point to Russia: “We do not recommend sending cargo through this airport, despite the attractive rates, as there are enormous waiting times, cancellations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve shipping problems, he and other Novelco executives have recommended on the company’s YouTube channel using lessons learned during the pandemic, such as transporting goods through third countries, rather than directly from a supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews with Russian media and in a series of posts on LinkedIn, Grigoriev described recent trade restrictions on Russia as tantamount to erecting an “iron curtain” around his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rDbXXsk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A video presentation by the CEO of Novelco, a Russian logistics firm, offering advice on how to cope with sanctions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grigoriev said in one LinkedIn post that Novelco had set up an affiliate in Istanbul and has been shipping goods to Russia from Turkey, which doesn’t enforce all U.S. and EU Russian trade restrictions. Once merchandise arrives in Turkey, “shipments are processed for re-export and cargo can follow to Russia by air, sea, road and rail transport,” Grigoriev said in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, Grigoriev registered in Istanbul a company called Smart Trading Ltd Sti, Turkish corporate records show. Since then, the company has shipped at least $660,000 worth of products made by U.S. semiconductor makers, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other Russian firms believe it is unwise to discuss publicly how to handle trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an August blog post, a senior executive at F+ tech, a Russian IT equipment manufacturer that relies on many imported components, said the business of procuring foreign parts requires discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We ourselves increase the risks of sanctions by publicly reporting on who will carry what and from where,” Evgeny Krivosheev, F+ tech’s head of production and development, wrote in a blog post, which was published by Russian business daily Vedomosti and on the company’s website. “Such publicity attracts unnecessary attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Krivosheev’s company said the executive wasn’t speaking about any particular firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eu-shipments&quot;&gt;EU shipments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many recent shipments of Western computer parts to Russia have arrived from China and other countries that haven’t joined the United States and the EU in restricting exports to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some exceptions, Reuters found. Customs records show shipments of Analog Devices and other U.S. components directly from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmec Trade Oü, an electronic-components wholesaler based in the Estonian capital Tallinn, shipped at least $17 million worth of goods to Russia between April 1 and Oct. 31, according to Russian customs records. These included chips made by Analog Devices and other U.S. manufacturers, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmec Trade’s general manager, Aleksandr Fomenko, told Reuters that his company buys its products through official channels, follows all legal requirements and complies with all sanctions and export restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked how his company could continue to export Analog Devices and other Western chips months after the manufacturers announced they had suspended sales to Russia, he said that “the majority” were orders placed last year. The shipments were delayed because of pandemic-related transit disruptions, he said. Analog Devices didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the European Commission didn’t respond to questions about Elmec Trade. In general, the spokesperson said, “The EU takes circumvention very seriously, as it is a practice that can undermine the effectiveness of EU sanctions.” The spokesperson noted that the 27-member bloc has been encouraging other countries to align with EU measures adopted against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eleventh-floor&quot;&gt;Eleventh floor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has placed export restrictions on scores of companies to try to stop the flow of sensitive high-tech components to Russia. But the probe by Reuters and RUSI found that there appears to be an active roster of substitute players ready to replace such entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the case of AO GK Radiant, a Moscow-based distributor of computer chips and other electronic parts that celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in June. It states on its website that its objective is to provide Russian clients with “the best solutions from global manufacturers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Russian customs records show for years the company had imported millions of dollars worth of Western-designed chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in July 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce added the company to its trade restrictions list, alleging that it was “involved in the procurement of U.S.-origin electronic components likely in furtherance of Russian military programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that GK Radiant’s imports have since plummeted. The company’s founder, Andrei Kuznetsov, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s head office remains on the eleventh floor of a building at 65 Profsoyuznaya Street in Moscow. There also appears to be another importer of Western computer components operating on the same floor. It’s called Titan-Micro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w5KzpA0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The house in northern Moscow where IT electronics distributor OOO Titan-Micro is registered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that Titan-Micro began importing Analog Devices and other electronic components in November 2021, nine months after it was established. Titan-Micro has since imported at least $12.7 million in parts, including $9.9 million worth since April 2022. It has used some of the same suppliers as GK Radiant, including Sinno Electronics Co Ltd, a Chinese company that was placed under export restrictions by the U.S. Department of Commerce in June for allegedly providing support to Russia’s defense sector. Sinno Electronics didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The address for Titan-Micro listed in Russian corporate records leads to a wooden house, deep inside a birch forest in northern Moscow, with no apparent sign of business activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s general manager, Nadejda Shevchenko, hung up when Reuters reached her by phone. But a Titan-Micro employee, who declined to give his name, later said employees weren’t working at the wooden house, but on the 11th floor of the business center at 65 Profsoyuznaya Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where GK Radiant also operates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steve Stecklow, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">In March this year, a new firm appeared in Turkey’s corporate registry.

This phenomenon has immediately and severely affected thousands of Africans subjected to violence. The growing Salafi-jihadi base in Africa also supports a global movement waging war on the US and many of its allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;African groups may become more direct participants in global jihad as they develop capabilities that they can use overseas. Every Salafi-jihadi group that has attacked transnationally began with a local focus; past examples show that groups can rapidly pivot to transnational attack plotting when circumstances shift. As African Salafi-jihadi groups continue to develop more advanced military and nonmilitary capabilities, they stand to provide even greater benefits to the global Salafi-jihadi movement in terms of recruits, money, propaganda, innovation, leadership, and safe havens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report considers the capabilities, resources, and opportunities that can be used to assess the relative strength of a Salafi-jihadi group in terms of its sophistication, effectiveness, and resilience. This framework aims to facilitate comparing groups at different stages of development, tracking changes in their capacity over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analysis in this report points to a necessary rethink in US policy to counter the Salafi-jihadi movement. The United States’ counterterrorism policy is missing the opening to stop Salafi-jihadi insurgencies from forming and becoming entrenched. Policymakers should reform US foreign assistance and expand intelligence coverage to prioritize conflict prevention and resolution. A long-term solution requires reducing the overall level of capability, resourcing, and opportunity available to the Salafi-jihadi movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are rising in Africa. The Salafi-jihadi movement has long-standing connections to the continent, exemplified by the participation of North African mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s and al Qaeda’s operations in East Africa in the 1990s. The global crackdown on al Qaeda’s networks in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks compounded setbacks for the movement, briefly reversing its progress on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the past decade has been a period of clear expansion marked by the exponential growth of rank-and-file membership and increases in the number of active Salafi-jihadi organizations and their territorial reach in Africa. (See the sidebar.) This phenomenon has immediately and severely affected thousands of Africans subjected to violence. But not only Africans have a stake in beating back this jihadist expansion. The growing Salafi-jihadi base in Africa supports a global movement waging war on the US and many of its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Salafi-jihadi groups in sub-Saharan Africa are advancing as Western countries shift focus away from counterterrorism concerns and toward geostrategic competition. Al Shabaab, al Qaeda’s East African affiliate, seized the opportunity to reestablish itself in south-central Somalia after US troops withdrew in January 2021 and again threatens Mogadishu’s security, despite the US military’s reentry to the country in May 2022. Al Qaeda–linked groups in the Sahel are capitalizing on a rash of coups, deteriorating security, and reduced counterterrorism pressure to embed themselves further in a growing swath of terrain. The Islamic State affiliate in Nigeria is expanding its operations into areas of greater concern to the Nigerian government. Salafi-jihadi groups across West Africa have tapped into illicit trafficking networks, deepening a symbiosis between terrorism and crime. Even in North Africa, where military and policing campaigns significantly degraded Salafi-jihadi groups in recent years, governance and security trends — particularly in Libya and Tunisia — signal opportunities for militants to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Salafi-jihadi militancy in Africa harms not only the militants’ direct victims but also those affected by related conflicts and humanitarian crises. Salafi-jihadi expansion also contributes to persistent instability that compounds state weakness. Antiliberal and antidemocratic actors can draw opportunity and justification from this weakness and the presence of jihadist terror threats. Long-running jihadist insurgencies and disruptive terror campaigns undermine economic growth in some of the continent’s poorest countries and disrupt global markets, including oil and gas. Instability, poor governance, and high security costs also threaten the advancement of cornerstone countries — those that will disproportionately affect the continent’s trajectory — including Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of Salafi-jihadi expansion in Africa reach beyond national and regional borders. African bases and affiliates help sustain the global Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s African affiliates are more than just rebranded local insurgencies. Even newly pledged affiliates can derive concrete benefits from their participation in regional and global jihadi networks. As African Salafi-jihadi groups continue to develop more advanced military and nonmilitary capabilities, they stand to provide even greater benefits to the global movement in terms of recruits, money, propaganda, innovation, leadership, and safe havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trigger point for Western policymakers to act is a transnational terror threat from one of these Salafi-jihadi groups. Yet though Africa-based groups are responsible for many attacks on limited Western interests in Africa, only a fraction of transnational terror attacks trace back to them. Islamic State attacks in Germany in 2016 and the UK in 2017 originated with external attack plotters in Libya. Al Shabaab has attempted to target international aviation in recent years, with a bomb attempt on a plane leaving Mogadishu in 2016 and an early-stage 9/11-style attack disrupted in the Philippines in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What national security strategies tend to overlook is that the maturation of African Salafi-jihadi groups will lead to an increased transnational terror threat. Local and global jihad are indelibly linked. Attack cells — the small groups of individuals involved in a terror attack — are small, but they rely on a threat node with a larger footprint. The threat node’s larger set of capabilities comes from Salafi-jihadi insurgent organizations’ regional support bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regional bases also allow threat nodes to reconstitute, meaning that counterterrorism gains against particular plotters, attacks, and infrastructure are typically temporary, especially when there is a well-developed underpinning organization. Salafijihadi havens provide capabilities and resources, including “recruitment and inter-theater movement; funding; communication; counter-intelligence; media support; vetting, training, and indoctrination; weapons design expertise; and intelligence and planning.” Local and regional insurgencies provide destinations for foreign fighters and propaganda fodder for global Salafi-jihadi organizations. Entrenched jihadist insurgencies with governing capabilities are also preparing future recruits by indoctrinating a generation of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US counterterrorism policies focus on eliminating threat nodes over removing regional support bases. These policies and accompanying legal authorities are structured around either actors’ present intent and active plotting or their past culpability for attacks. Identifying and destroying discrete terror networks is necessary to address present threats but fails to prevent new terror threats from emerging. The existence of a larger Salafi-jihadi base — the loose network of individuals, groups, and organizations united by a common cause — allows external attack plotting and facilitation networks to regenerate continually. The expansion of Salafi-jihadi insurgencies also creates new opportunities for terror networks to form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African groups may become more direct participants in global jihad as they develop capabilities that they can use overseas. Every Salafi-jihadi group that has attacked transnationally began with a local focus; past examples show that groups can rapidly pivot to transnational attack plotting when circumstances shift. Not every Salafi-jihadi group will inevitably pursue or enable global terror campaigns. Some may calculate that eschewing such attacks better serves their efforts to achieve local dominance. Certainly, groups that originate within the Salafi-jihadi movement but disavow global terror deserve further study. But past patterns show that ideological, bureaucratic, and organizational factors, including intra-jihadist competition, push local groups toward pursuing transnational attacks directly or supporting externally focused attack networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables in this report consider capabilities, resources, and opportunities that can be used to assess the relative strength of a Salafi-jihadi group in terms of its sophistication, effectiveness, and resilience. (See Figure 1.) These tables incorporate military and technical skills but recognize that assessments of militant groups’ strength often overvalue these “hard” metrics. The tables therefore also consider “softer” skills, including governance capabilities and organizational qualities, that affect groups’ ability to recover from hardships. This framework aims to facilitate comparing groups at different stages of development and track changes in groups’ capabilities, resources, and opportunities over time. Any effective policy for degrading the global Salafi-jihadi movement will require blocking or reducing groups’ overall capabilities and access to resources and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

Salafi-Jihadi Capabilities, Resources, and Opportunities: Governance.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Colors indicate the level of a group’s capabilities or its access to resources and opportunities. The color-coding indicates the level of skill or access, from red (highest threat level) to orange, yellow (moderate threat level), and green (lowest threat level). * “AQIM” in these tables refers to AQIM activity in Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia. AQIM activity in the Sahel is considered as part of JNIM. ** “JNIM and Allies” refers to groups that are part of JNIM and those that cooperate with it, including AQIM in the Sahel and Ansar al Islam in Burkina Faso. “ISCAP-DRC” refers to Islamic State Central Africa Province–Democratic Republic of Congo. See Appendix A for a further explanation of group definitions and labeling. See Appendix B for the criteria and thresholds used to assess groups’ capabilities and resources. Source: Author’s analysis using cited materials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors assess a group’s interaction with its audience, particularly the local population but also potential recruits regionally and globally. (See Table 1.) These criteria consider a group’s capacity to bend a population to its will by either force or persuasion and the local conditions that create opportunities for armed groups to influence communities. This analysis is a rough proxy for criteria that are difficult to judge, including popular sentiment and other hyperlocal dynamics, which should be studied for a deeper understanding of Salafi-jihadi groups’ effectiveness across local contexts. The factors are provision of social services, exercise of social control, effective use of propaganda, exploitation of local networks, and mobilization of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors analyze an armed group’s ability to build, acquire, and use tools for making war. (See Table 2). They consider conventional and unconventional military effectiveness and terror attack capability, ranging from local to transnational. The factors are bomb making, access to weapons systems, sophisticated tactics, local force projection, regional force projection, global terror attack capability, presence of elite units, access to resources, and access to a permissive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors consider a group’s ability to coordinate people toward its goals by managing its internal processes and its interactions with other organizations. (See Table 3.) These criteria also consider groups’ contributions to the broader Salafi-jihadi movement. The factors are the ability to generate force, resilience and adaptability, the ability to integrate with and amplify Salafi-jihadi networks, and interaction with competitors and the presence of infighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capabilities-won-and-lost&quot;&gt;Capabilities Won and Lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below narratives consider the trajectories of several African Salafi-jihadi groups that have gained and lost capabilities. The narratives explore different categories of capability: governance, military and technical, and organizational. They consider how these capabilities affect each other and contribute to the groups’ overall resilience and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda Plays Politics in the Sahel.&lt;/strong&gt; The Salafi-jihadi expansion in the Sahel demonstrates the importance of adaptation to a local social context. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) emerged from Algeria’s 1991–2002 civil war, and its leaders have largely been Algerians focused on North African affairs. Yet this group leveraged its foothold in southern Algeria to set off a chain of jihadist activity in the Sahel that, a decade later, has spread all the way to the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM came to the Sahel because of the opportunities that region presented. The group took up lucrative kidnapping-for-ransom efforts in southern Algeria and over time embedded itself in cross-border human networks, including through intermarriage. This attenuation to local dynamics and Malian security forces’ inability to apply consistent pressure allowed AQIM to establish a consistent presence in northern Mali, though not to overtly control terrain. (See Figure 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM rapidly increased its influence in northern Mali by tapping into elite Tuareg networks. AQIM and its partner, the Tuareg-majority militant group Ansar al Din, outcompeted a less-organized non-jihadi group to take lead of the rebellion that controlled northern Mali. (See Figure 3.) Organization and governance provision helped AQIM and Ansar al Din overtake their rivals before implementing a hard-line interpretation of shari’a. (See Figure 4.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM and its allies have continued to embed themselves in the Sahel’s social fabric by taking advantage of weak competitors and adapting to local conditions. Salafi-jihadi militants, despite their violence, have cultivated a reputation for being less corrupt than local or national authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM’s longevity also stems from organizational and ideological flexibility across a diverse jihadist network. The Salafi-jihadi ecosystem in the Sahel is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, but these internal squabbles have largely not undermined the movement and its goals. Several factions split off in the early 2010s due to frustrations with leadership, including limited opportunities for non-Arab militants. But the Salafi-jihadi network in the Sahel seems to have largely overcome this challenge through a franchising model in which ideological ties integrate armed groups aligned to multiple ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen’s (JNIM) 2017 formation underscores this dynamic. JNIM formed through a merger that brought together several AQIM-linked groups, including the Tuareg-majority Ansar al Din and the Fulani-majority Macina Liberation Front (MLF). JNIM’s federation model enables its subgroups to operate where they are most effective. The MLF has led JNIM’s expansion through central Mali and into Burkina Faso. (See Figures 5 and 6.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLF has introduced a more grassroots model of engaging with local populations, in contrast to AQIM’s initial entry through Tuareg elites. The MLF practices a combination of coercion and negotiation to develop de facto control relationships with villages. The Fulani population in central Mali includes many pastoralists often marginalized by state structures and in conflict with other communities. The MLF has merged Fulani grievances with a narrative of religious legitimacy to cast itself as the population’s defender. (See Figure 7.) The MLF’s success in its pressure-and-governance campaign has also yielded military benefits, bringing it within striking distance of Mali’s capital and facilitating attacks on strategic Malian military positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM has weathered a challenge from an Islamic State affiliate in the Sahel. Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which originated as an AQIM splinter group, has challenged JNIM in some areas, including in attracting defectors. ISGS is likely not a serious threat to JNIM’s overall dominance in large areas of Mali and Burkina Faso, however. (See Figure 8). JNIM and ISGS have vacillated between cooperation, conflict, and deconfliction, and they will likely carve out separate spheres of influence over the long term. ISGS’s presence allows JNIM to present itself as comparatively moderate. JNIM fighters, likely from the MLF, may now be partnering with non-jihadist forces against ISGS. JNIM will likely suffer some short-term losses but will cement its ties to local communities — and its base for fighting against the Malian government — in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g0WDc5L.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

Salafi-Jihadi Areas of Operation in the Sahel.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/salafi-jihadi-areas-of-operation-in-the-sahel&quot;&gt;Brian Carter, “Salafi-Jihadi Areas of Operation in the Sahel,” Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, September 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM’s governance proposal is perhaps best described as solving the problem it helped create. The group strikes security agreements with communities in Mali and Burkina Faso, granting truces or providing security while requiring residents to accept the group’s interpretation and implementation of shari’a. The deals, accepted by community leaders desperate to stop displacement and violence, reflect exhaustion with years of violence perpetrated by jihadists, state security forces, local militias, and foreign forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of JNIM’s progress is owed to its adversaries’ shortcomings, including a Malian state that has an absent, if not abusive, relationship with many communities in northern and central Mali. Mali’s recent coups and its government’s hiring of Russian Wagner Group mercenaries have only intensified negative relationships between security forces and populations in central Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM’s application of governance skills and military strategy will allow it to solidify its position as the de facto governing entity across large areas of Mali and Burkina Faso. JNIM — and al Qaeda — will consider this success against the “near enemy” a major victory for the movement. JNIM media has drawn parallels between the 2021 French withdrawal from Mali and the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan, placing JNIM within an al Qaeda strategic narrative that prioritizes long-term insurgencies to remove external forces and topple local “apostate” governments. In an August 2021 video, the group’s leader called for Muslims to rise up and attack France, Israel, Russia, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These threats do not indicate that JNIM will immediately plot or facilitate external attacks, but they demonstrate the group’s ideological predisposition to support such operations. JNIM has not followed the model of the former al Qaeda–linked group Hayat Tahrir al Sham in Syria, which disavowed external terror attack plotting. JNIM’s expansion in the Sahel not only delivers another victory to al Qaeda’s model for jihadist takeovers but also perpetuates the Salafi-jihadi transnational terror threat by providing havens and a growing pool of funding and recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Libya Loses the Governance Game.&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State’s branch in Libya rose rapidly thanks to external support and the chaotic conditions of Libya’s civil war. But the group also collapsed quickly, in part because it failed to root itself into the local community and align itself with popular grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya rose rapidly in 2014 and 2015, capitalizing on the Libyan Salafi-jihadi networks that had reemerged as the Libyan state disintegrated. The Islamic State provided crucial expertise and startup funding, including senior leaders with wartime experience in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State highlighted IS-Libya as its priority outpost beyond its core terrain, particularly as the group consolidated control of Sirte — Muammar Qaddafi’s hometown and a city largely abandoned between the front lines of Libya’s civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya developed an advanced military capability, including the capacity to build and use multiple suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. Islamic State media highlighted its governance project in the city. IS-Libya attracted significant numbers of foreign fighters, including many from neighboring Tunisia and an unprecedented mobilization of militants from sub-Saharan Africa. IS-Libya also supported external attack planners. The group facilitated the Berlin Christmas market attack in 2016 and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. (See Figure 9.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Cgk8BmA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, IS-Libya’s high public profile and appearance of strength belied weaknesses in its organization and ability to exert control and influence. The group’s multiple outposts in Libya gradually crumbled when rival armed groups — including some linked to al Qaeda — mobilized against it. IS-Libya’s crown jewel, Sirte, slipped from its fingers, first because it struggled to provide for civilians and eventually its fighters there and second because the group expanded too far westward, inciting the military campaign that would oust it from the city. IS-Libya’s lack of ties to the local population left its remnants vulnerable in desert camps far from populated areas, making it vulnerable to follow-on strikes that decimated its forces. (See Figure 10.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya today is a rump group in a remote area, still lacking governance capabilities and organizational backing. It retains explosive attack capabilities but is not waging a consistent insurgency, instead launching intermittent attacks on security forces. (See Figure 11.) Its trajectory demonstrates the limits of pursuing a territorial insurgency that draws too much support from external organizations and a global narrative. IS-Libya is not defunct, however, and continues to play an amplifying role by providing trainers to militants in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Shabaab in Somalia Builds Skills over Years.&lt;/strong&gt; Al Shabaab’s greatest asset may be time. The group has persisted thanks to a combination of its own strategy and innovation and its adversaries’ failure to sustain an effective effort against it. This persistence has allowed the group to entwine itself into Somalia’s political economy. Al Shabaab has also increased its military and technical skills and its organizational sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab developed out of Somalia’s civil war and has benefited and survived thanks to its ability to exploit a fragmented Somali society. The militant wing of the Islamic Courts Union that took over Somalia in the early 2000s, al Shabaab capitalized on the 2006 Ethiopian intervention to garner popular support. (See Figure 12.) This support waned when the intervention ended, but al Shabaab weathered the transition, largely because Somalia’s fractious political environment did not yield an effective alternative or sufficient armed force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9kRE97k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab adapted to military setbacks. It successfully transitioned to a rural insurgency after losing control of major cities in 2011 and 2012. (See Figure 13.) This setback may have ironically preserved the al Shabaab insurgency by relieving from it the potentially delegitimizing challenge of needing to govern densely populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sXVvzBP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab has also weathered particularly fractious internal dynamics. Internecine squabbles and even significant defections have not destroyed the group, but rather they have concentrated control with its most hard-line leaders. The group has thus far demonstrated the capability to crush dissent and suppress rivals, notably the Islamic State. The current Somali government’s efforts to include al Shabaab defectors in government may challenge al Shabaab in certain regions, but there is not yet evidence of growing internal divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab has deeply enmeshed itself in the Somali economy, particularly in south and south-central Somalia. The group makes as much revenue as the Somali federal government — enough to surpass AQIM as al Qaeda’s richest affiliate. Al Shabaab’s many moneymaking endeavors include the black-market charcoal trade, widespread extortion of Somali businesses, and taxation of the populations it controls. Al Shabaab also manipulates humanitarian aid in famine-hit Somalia, sometimes blocking distribution but other times stealing and redistributing supplies. (See Figure 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j6oy49T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab’s access to relatively secure havens and its now decade-long fighting experience have created ample opportunity for it to increase its military and technical capability over time. (See Figure 15.) It has gained expertise from the al Qaeda network, particularly al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in nearby Yemen. Iraq may have been the source for al Shabaab’s development of armor-piercing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VJue0In.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula’s expertise likely supported al Shabaab’s 2016 use of a laptop bomb in a botched attempt to destroy a passenger airplane leaving Mogadishu. Al Shabaab has also adapted to gain access to explosive power to support its military campaigns. It has increasingly relied on manufacturing its own homemade explosives from industrial precursors, instead of scavenging explosives, since 2017. Further, al Shabaab has demonstrated the capability to integrate IED attacks into complex military operations. The group, like other Salafi-jihadi groups on the continent and elsewhere, has begun to adopt drones for surveillance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab maintains specialized units to conduct regional terror attacks and pursue transnational operations. Elite al Shabaab units focus on internal security and external operations, including infamous attacks in Kenya such as the 2013 Westgate Mall attack, the 2015 Garissa University attack, and the 2019 DusitD2 hotel attack. The planner of the Camp Simba attack in 2020, al Shabaab’s first on a US military installation in Kenya, also coordinated an external attack network. (See Figure 16.) The group has shown more ambition in recent years, including dispatching members to pilot training in the early stages of planning a 9/11-style attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab and IS-Somalia both support Salafi-jihadi networks across East Africa. Fighters who became part of the current Islamic State–linked insurgency in Mozambique trained in Somalia, for example. IS-Somalia, though contained in Somalia by al Shabaab, serves as a coordination unit for Islamic State affiliates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Nigeria Learns from Its Network.&lt;/strong&gt; Salafi-jihadi militants in Nigeria have transformed from a brutal but localized threat into a potential regional and global threat as they have become increasingly enmeshed in the Islamic State’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group known as Boko Haram started on the margins of the global Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Qaeda expressed interest in a relationship, but personal and ideological conflicts prevented Boko Haram from officially joining. Boko Haram’s leader from 2009 to 2021, Abubakr Shekau, broke with al Qaeda’s teaching on several key issues, most importantly by defining any Muslim who did not support Boko Haram as a lawful target. (See Figure 17.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A2BmWZF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shekau’s ideological divergences with al Qaeda and his brutality helped set up a relationship with the Islamic State. Islamic State leaders, focused on building their global network, supported Boko Haram’s mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in 2014 and the group’s focus on holding territory and immediately implementing shari’a. The Islamic State’s objectives aligned with Shekau’s search for legitimacy and possibly other Boko Haram leaders’ desire to moderate him. Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in March 2015, becoming the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining the Islamic State accelerated organizational changes in ISWAP and gave the group funding and training from the Islamic State network. Recognizing Shekau’s ungovernability, Islamic State central backed an effort to oust him. ISWAP then rebranded to bolster its popular support, including announcing a focus on military — not civilian — targets. The Islamic State also provided money and capabilities directly, including giving more than a million dollars in 2017 and linking ISWAP to a network of trainers and IS officials operating predominantly in Libya through northern and western Africa. Islamic State leaders directly engage in ISWAP leadership affairs, including at least one potential instance of backing the murder of an ISWAP official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISWAP has continued to draw legitimacy and some concrete benefits from its Islamic State membership, even as the Islamic State has weakened in its core terrain and likely lost the ability to give significant cash transfusions to its African branches. ISWAP received training on small-arms tactics that improved its military effectiveness. The group has also begun using drones for surveillance thanks to training from the Islamic State network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State in turn uses ISWAP — which is still the largest, deadliest, and most active among its African affiliates — to bolster its self-reported statistics when many other affiliates and the core group are relatively less active. (See Figure 18.) Islamic State media frequently highlights ISWAP in its major publications. An Islamic State periodical even called for hijra (migration) to Africa, reflecting its greater focus on this theater as a key part of the group’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic State in Tunisia: Tied to Regional Circumstances. The rise and decline of the Islamic State in Tunisia demonstrates the potential fragility of Salafi-jihadi insurgencies that rely heavily on external support and cross-border havens. This case is also a warning, because Tunisia continues to suffer from many of the dynamics that yielded significant Islamic State recruitment, indicating that latent terror networks likely remain a potent threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring period created an opportunity for jihadi experimentation and innovation in Tunisia. Ansar al Shari’a in Tunisia, an al Qaeda associate, capitalized on the mobilization of society during and after the revolution to convert itself from a covert network to a social movement. The Syrian civil war also proved a potent mobilizer, with nearly 30,000 Tunisians attempting to travel to Syria and several thousand succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State’s infrastructure in Syria, and particularly in Libya, proved effective for exporting violence back to Tunisia. The Islamic State was particularly effective at targeting Tunisian tourism, with major attacks in 2014 and 2015 that cratered the Tunisian tourism industry. (See Figure 19.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State’s assault on Tunisia peaked in 2016 with an incident that underscored the group’s ambitions and shortcomings. A large contingent of militants based in northwestern Libya attempted a cross-border assault to seize the Tunisian town of Ben Guerdane. (See Figure 20.) The assault failed, however, reflecting several changes that made Tunisia a less permissible environment for a major Islamic State campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Tunisian military and security forces had become more effective, thanks to government and foreign partner initiatives since 2015. The local population resisted the Islamic State assault — to the group’s surprise — and received backup from security forces. The Ben Guerdane attack also catalyzed another surge of Western foreign military aid. Tunisia has also significantly hardened its border with Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Islamic State had begun to lose its secure haven in Libya. A month before the Ben Guerdane attack, a US air strike killed a major Tunisian Islamic State leader in northwestern Libya, near the Tunisian border. Local power brokers soon decided to oust the Islamic State presence from the area, denying the group the base it had used to coordinate prior attacks in Tunisia. The Islamic State’s position in Libya continued to split throughout 2016, culminating in the group’s loss of its primary foothold in Sirte. While the Islamic State still has a presence in remote southwestern Libya, it lacks access to populated areas and accessible cross-border routes into Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State is no longer visible as an organized group in Tunisia. It likely has remnants in remote areas in the country’s interior, where insurgents are often based, and there are indications of terror and radicalization networks in the more populated coastal areas. The group has not conducted a major attack in years, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Tunisia still faces a serious latent threat. The underlying grievances that fed the Islamic State’s recruitment drive in the country have not resolved and may even worsen, given current economic woes and political crackdowns. Tunisia also faces the challenge of foreign fighters returning from Libya and Syria and a large, radicalized prison population. IS-Tunisia thus likely has the human resources it needs to reactivate, particularly if the Tunisian state destabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;takeaways-the-local-context-for-jihad&quot;&gt;Takeaways: The Local Context for Jihad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis describes a set of circumstances from which Salafi-jihadi groups draw potential energy that they can use to react to setbacks or exploit opportunities. US policy largely treats these groups as threats to partner countries only because their demonstrated capabilities do not yet threaten the US homeland. But this view misunderstands the interdependence between the local and global contexts for jihad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistence and spread of regional Salafi-jihadi insurgencies sustains global networks and repeatedly erodes or even reverses the effects of counterterrorism interventions, which focus on removing groups’ military capabilities. Counterterrorism operations aimed at eliminating threat nodes are similarly reactive and will not prevent “locally focused” Salafi-jihadi groups from turning their capabilities and resources toward transnational goals as opportunities arise. The groups that pose the most serious long-term threat are adaptable organizations that embed in local contexts and can capitalize on changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability.&lt;/strong&gt; The groups that have strengthened over time are adaptive, learning organizations that can shift in response to setbacks and opportunities. One version of adaptability that successful groups practice is shifting between a “territorial” and “semi-territorial” presence. Al Shabaab in Somalia and AQIM in Mali both survived military losses in the early 2010s by shifting from overt territorial control to rural insurgency, a transformation that allowed them to entrench themselves into economic networks and prepare to capitalize on moments of state weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups have demonstrated a wide range of adaptations, including deploying strategic ambiguity and plausible deniability to avoid attracting a Western counterterrorism response. Highly adaptable groups are more likely to survive and gain the capabilities and resources to become a regional or even global threat — particularly if they demonstrate an ability to balance localized political dynamics while maintaining a relationship with transnational jihadist networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embeddedness.&lt;/strong&gt; Local dynamics — and militants’ attenuation to them — primarily determine a group’s trajectory. Groups that receive heavy support from a global jihadist outfit, such as IS-Libya or IS-Tunisia, may struggle to recover from setbacks if they lack a robust local support base. Groups that are more rooted in local armed conflicts can benefit from targeted infusions of expertise and money to increase their effectiveness in military operations and strategic communications, as demonstrated by the Islamic State’s support for its West and Central Africa Provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous group is therefore one that is primarily oriented on its local governance objective and has demonstrated skill at exploiting the local context but can simultaneously absorb high-end capabilities from the global network. Among current African groups, al Shabaab most emulates this model, given its enduring haven and access to expertise from within the al Qaeda network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunism.&lt;/strong&gt; Salafi-jihadi insurgencies form when governance and security gaps are already present. They benefit from and sometimes accelerate these conditions but do not initiate them. Likewise, the greatest opportunities for jihadists to succeed come from collapsing governance and security conditions, not groups’ own huge leaps in capability or ambition. For example, ISWAP has expanded its area of operations outside its core areas in northeastern Nigeria by taking advantage of the destabilization of the northwest and proliferation of non-state armed actors there. This adaptation indicates that ISWAP is building its capability to threaten the Nigerian capital while counterbalancing military pressure in its main havens, in northeastern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communal violence, civil wars, violent uprisings, and any other major destabilizing incident creates an opportunity for jihadist expansion wherever insurgencies are already established or jihadist networks are latent. Heavy-handed security responses intended to quell or crush unrest also feed the grievances that fuel Salafi-jihadi insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis points to a necessary rethink in US policy to counter the Salafi-jihadi movement. The United States’ counterterrorism policy and the counterterrorism policies of its allies and partners are missing the opening to stop Salafi-jihadi insurgencies from forming and becoming entrenched. At worst, bad counterterrorism policies — particularly when militaries and vigilantes conduct human rights abuses — hasten jihadist entrenchment by allowing groups to install themselves as security providers and defenders of vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterterrorism properly understood refers to both largely kinetic efforts to destroy the parts of groups that plan and execute external terror attacks and homeland security defenses to disrupt active terror plots. Counterterrorism is a necessary part of the national security tool kit for countering extant or emerging threat nodes, but it is not a substitute for removing the group’s base of support. Military campaigns may be disproportionately effective in cases in which the Salafi-jihadi support base is limited, as in the case of IS-Libya and IS-Tunisia’s Libya-based contingent. But when Salafi-jihadi insurgencies are more embedded, military-forward counterterrorism efforts at best temporarily suppress militant activity and at worst cause popular backlash on which militants can capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavily kinetic counterterrorism tool kit cannot defeat Salafi-jihadi insurgencies because it does not fill the governance gaps that allowed for jihadist entrenchment in the first place. And counterterrorism is inherently reactive — responding to a threat after that threat has already formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US should instead focus on policies to prevent Salafi-jihadi groups from taking root. Orienting an interagency focus on this goal requires transforming foreign assistance to emphasize “conflict prevention, stabilization, and peace building.” A key challenge is mobilizing conflict prevention and governance-building resources into the areas most at risk, which are often peripherals prone to conflict and lacking positive or effective ties to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has prioritized providing military training and support for anti-Salafi-jihadi forces. More attention must be placed on improving these actors’ ability to outcompete Salafi-jihadi groups through governance — for example, through providing impartial dispute-resolution mechanisms and overseeing implementation of basic social services and aid distribution. Surging governance and aid to areas affected by violence is especially important to preempt Salafi-jihadi groups from taking root or re-forming after losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US agencies should make institutional changes, including accepting a higher degree of calculated risk to diplomatic and military personnel pursuing their missions. Proactive policy also requires streamlining and coordinating US assistance across multiple agencies to avoid fatal delays in which much money is spent but no action taken until a jihadist insurgency has already destabilized the at-risk region in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers have an opportunity in motion to pursue these changes, if senior officials are willing to back real change. The 2019 Global Fragility Act (GFA) initiates a framework for an integrated and prevention-focused approach to countering state fragility, with the goal of closing off opportunities to not only Salafi-jihadi groups but also other malign actors, including criminal actors and state adversaries and their proxies. The US government has already selected countries for GFA plans, including Libya, Mozambique, and five coastal West African countries. The primary risk is that these plans will relabel existing initiatives and fail to implement the integration that the GFA seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges in implementation. The GFA aims to create new flexible and long-term funding mechanisms, but its implementers warn of impediments to their ability to move money quickly to launch programs before conditions deteriorate beyond prevention. The GFA presents an opportunity to implement US lessons learned from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars; senior officials should not let this opportunity pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A policy focused on closing space to adversaries, including the Salafi-jihadi movement, requires a serious focus on increasing US diplomatic capability beyond what the GFA alone can deliver. Countering fragility targets areas not yet or not currently afflicted by an entrenched Salafi-jihadi insurgency, and it is worthwhile, particularly because many countries in Africa are in this at-risk stage. But counter-fragility approaches come too late for the countries that are already fighting long-running wars with al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates, such as Somalia and Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy so far has focused on supporting and training partner militaries, with mixed results because of the weaknesses of the Somali and Malian states. In Somalia, the renewed US deployment has bolstered a Somali offensive against al Shabaab that is the most promising push against the group in years. There has not been a complementary increase in US diplomatic energy, however, which is necessary to support the Somali government through the long-term challenge of outcompeting al Shabaab governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US needs to reframe its involvement in these counterterrorism fights to prioritize conflict resolution and diplomacy, with military engagement subordinated to this larger goal. Likewise, the US should accept risk on short-term military victories — with mitigations in place — for the sake of bringing necessary pressure to bear on regimes that need to reform their approach. Only resolving the conflicts and their underlying grievances will create conditions for the long-term defeat of entrenched Salafi-jihadi insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers also need to recognize the significant overlap of counterterrorism, counter-fragility efforts, and the geostrategic competition problem sets. Fragile environments create opportunities for state and non-state actors alike. The presence of Salafi-jihadis in particular creates cover for malign actors pursuing other goals. For example, the Wagner Group’s deployments in Africa can be seen as a sanctions evasion scheme and regime preservation-for-hire often cloaked in the language of counterterrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is seeking stronger partnerships in Africa to counter the expansion of Russian and particularly Chinese influence there. US presence and relationships are crucial to having the partnerships and positions necessary to compete over time, and engaging on countering the Salafi-jihadi movement is both an independent goal and a way to sustain and enhance the US position on the continent. European security also cannot be divorced from African security; humanitarian crises and conflicts in Africa, as well as jihadist and criminal activity, affect European security and political cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government faces an obvious prioritization challenge because it lacks the resources and bandwidth to counter fragility everywhere. Policymakers should therefore improve US analytical capabilities to facilitate prioritization and early recognition. New Salafi-jihadi groups do not form and existing groups do not embark on dangerous trajectories without notice, and their development does not pose a particularly difficult analytical puzzle. Rather, the US intelligence community faces a challenge of collection, processing, and synthesis. Analysts working on Africa and other non-priority areas are spread thin and often responsible for covering many countries and regions simultaneously, a trend that the prioritization of East Asia and the Russian invasion of Ukraine will only exacerbate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classified collection assets, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), are limited, and the huge amount of available open-source information goes underutilized due to bandwidth constraints, linguistic limitations, and institutional cultures favoring classified sourcing. Senior leaders should dedicate resources and shift incentives to encourage the intelligence community to maintain an ongoing picture of potential threats in fragile environments. A broader, deeper, and more sustained approach to collection and analysis will help the US government identify threshold-crossing jihadist insurgencies and gain awareness of — and the ability to counter — the actions of geopolitical competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming US policy to deny resources and opportunities to the Salafi-jihadi movement will take time, and Salafi-jihadi groups are already reaching new thresholds of capability in many cases. US officials should therefore identify and pursue mitigations while the larger policy transformation occurs. These mitigations should include investing in the collection and analysis of intelligence on the Salafi-jihadi movement. This is primarily a resource question, particularly as high-demand intelligence assets are shifted to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should prioritize increasing the US military and intelligence communities’ acquisition of ISR assets to meet this demand. Increased investments in human intelligence and open-source and language capabilities are necessary to avoid strategic surprise. Increased focus on diplomatic engagement in at-risk countries will also improve the intelligence picture. Sustaining this intelligence picture should also feed robust crisis-response planning for future state collapses, including expected periods of increased instability during governmental transition. This planning should include working with partner countries to secure critical infrastructure and materials in the event of instability and a Salafi-jihadi surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are too high for US policymakers to ignore African security, no matter how much they may want to. The Salafi-jihadi movement is a virulent movement that is not declining and will likely enter a new phase marked by increased global terror attacks. It will overlap in fragile areas and strategic terrain with geostrategic competition, particularly in East Africa and increasingly along the West African Atlantic coast. The growth of illiberal movements, including the Salafi-jihadi movement and autocratic and illiberal regimes, threatens the US-led world order that undergirds US power and prosperity. The US must be forward-thinking, not reactive, in Africa and recognize that failing to partner with Africans in a more secure and prosperous future will harm US security in the coming decades. A status quo, wait-and-see approach will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix-a-salafi-jihadi-group-reference-guide&quot;&gt;Appendix A. Salafi-Jihadi Group Reference Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appendix defines the groups named in the report, in the order in which they appear in the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Algeria Province (IS-Algeria).&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State recognized this wilayah (province) in Algeria in 2014. Security pressure has rendered this group largely defunct since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).&lt;/strong&gt; AQIM originated in 1998 during the Algerian civil war. It took on its current name when it affiliated with al Qaeda in 2006. The tables in this report use “AQIM” to refer to the North African components of the group, including AQIM activity in Algeria and AQIM-linked groups in Libya and Tunisia, including the Uqba ibn Nafa’a Brigade. AQIM and its affiliates are also active in the Sahel. The tables use “JNIM and allies” to denote AQIM and AQIM-linked organizations in the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State in Tunisia (IS-Tunisia).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Tunisia refers to the network of Islamic State members and sympathizers in Tunisia. The Islamic State never declared an official wilayah in Tunisia but produces media about Islamic State–linked activity in Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Libya Province (IS-Libya).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Libya refers to the Islamic State’s Libya Province. The Islamic State declared three Libya provinces — Tarablus (Tripoli), Barqah (Cyrenaica), and Fezzan — in 2014. The Islamic State shifted to referring to thegroup as its Libya Province in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Sinai Province (IS-Sinai).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Sinai is a former al Qaeda affiliate active in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula since 2011. It pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harakat al Shabaab al Mujahideen (al Shabaab).&lt;/strong&gt; Al Shabaab is al Qaeda’s primary affiliate in East Africa. It is based in Somalia but also active in Kenya and has attacked in Ethiopia and Uganda. The group formed as an armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. Al Qaeda recognized al Shabaab as an affiliate in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Somalia Province (IS-Somalia).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Somalia is an al Shabaab splinter group that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015. Islamic State leadership accepted this pledge in 2017. IS-Somalia operates primarily in Puntland in northern Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Central Africa Province–Democratic Republic of Congo (ISCAP-DRC).&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State announced its Central Africa Province in 2019, incorporating Salafi-jihadi insurgent groups active in the DRC and Mozambique. These groups operated independently, despite their shared name. The DRC branch of ISCAP developed from the Allied Democratic Forces, an insurgent group that originated in Uganda in the early 1990s and has been based in the DRC since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Mozambique Province (IS-Mozambique).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Mozambique is active in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado Province. It officially joined the Islamic State as part of the Central Africa Province in 2019. The Islamic State began referring to IS-Mozambique separately from ISCAP-DRC in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen (JNIM) and Allies.&lt;/strong&gt; JNIM is AQIM’s affiliate in the Sahel and the successor of AQIM’s networks that became prominent in Mali in 2012. It formed in 2017 from a merger of several AQIM-linked groups: AQIM’s Sahara Emirate, Ansar al Din, al Murabitoun, and the Macina Liberation Front (MLF). “Allies” refers to smaller brigades active within JNIM’s orbit and Ansar al Islam, a Burkina Faso–based group that cooperates with JNIM. JNIM is active in Mali and Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Sahel Province, or Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).&lt;/strong&gt; ISGS is a commonly used name for the Islamic State’s affiliate in the Sahel. The group’s founder, the prior leader of a splinter group that had broken from AQIM, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015. The Islamic State formally accepted this pledge in 2019, recognizing the group under the umbrella of its Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), though the Sahel branch continued to function independently. The Islamic State recognized ISGS as an independent unit, the Islamic State Sahel Province, in 2022. ISGS operates in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Jama’at Ahl al Sunna lil Da’wa wal Jihad (Boko Haram).&lt;/strong&gt; Boko Haram formed as a religious movement in northeastern Nigeria and transitioned to an armed uprising in 2009. The group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, changing its name to ISWAP. A subsequent schism divided the group. ISWAP largely overtook the rump Boko Haram in 2021. ISWAP and the Boko Haram remnants operate in northern Nigeria, particularly the northeast, and border regions of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jama’at Ansar al Muslimeen fi Bilad al Sudan (Ansaru).&lt;/strong&gt; Ansaru is an al Qaeda–aligned group that splintered from Boko Haram in 2012. Ansaru resumed attacks in northwestern Nigeria in 2020 after a multi-year dormancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix-b-matrix-definitions&quot;&gt;Appendix B. Matrix Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appendix defines criteria for assessing Salafi-jihadi groups’ capabilities and access to opportunities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;governance-factors&quot;&gt;Governance Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors assess a group’s interaction with its audience, particularly the local population but also potential recruits regionally and globally. These criteria consider a group’s capacity to bend a population to its will by either force or persuasion and the local conditions that create opportunities for armed groups to influence communities. This analysis is a rough proxy for criteria that are difficult to judge, including popular sentiment and other hyperlocal dynamics, which should be studied for a deeper understanding of Salafi-jihadi groups’ effectiveness across local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide Social Services.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to deliver services to a target population. Groups are categorized according to the highest level of service they provide, even if they also provide fewer or no services in other parts of their area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group functions as the de facto state through direct rule. It provides services such as health care, education, dispute resolution, and security. It conducts large-scale, organized taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group functions as a de facto state in combination with local authorities. It provides services and enforces some rules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group provides intermittent services, such as dispute resolution, justice, and some rule setting. It may have set up internal governance structures serving its members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group provides no services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Social Control.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to control the behavior of a target population. Groups are categorized according to the highest level of control they exert, even if they exert a lesser level of control or influence in other parts of their area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group is capable of declaring and enforcing modes of living unilaterally in some areas, including public executions and other mandatory events. It rapidly quells dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has a looser control structure and may exert influence through preexisting local organizations and leadership networks. It can change some modes of living through a combination of force and negotiation. The group may tolerate or negotiate some dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group engages in intermittent engagements to shape a population’s behavior, including preaching and violence such as kidnapping or assassination. It may extract taxes. Rival governing structures and security forces contest the group’s ability to exercise social control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is not in regular contact with communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Propaganda.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to spread its message and cause effects through distributing media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group or its partners distribute high-quality media that reaches global and local audiences. This media may have inspired attacks in locations outside its area of operations or attracted foreign fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group or its partners distribute high-quality media for a local audience, including videos. The group features in jihadist propaganda outside its local area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group or its partners distribute low-quality media for a local audience. Global jihadist outlets cover its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group distributes no media. Global jihadist outlets may mention it irregularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploitation of Local Networks.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to suppress or exploit local political and security networks toward its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group can suppress and deter rivals. There is no significant rival for providing security or governance inside its control or support zones. The group is integrated into human networks and the local economy. It does not need to collaborate with non–ideologically aligned groups at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group is taking steps to integrate with the local community, including intermarriage and alliance formation. It may work to undermine rivals by stoking or participating in communal conflict or aligning itself with particular populations. It may cooperate with other armed groups, including non–ideologically aligned groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: As a territorial insurgency, the group can deny access to terrain and prey on local populations but does not integrate with local networks and operates in remote areas. Alternately, as a clandestine network,103 the group can maintain covert terror cells and safe houses in populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has largely hostile encounters with the local population and can only exist in a remote area without state power. The population may perceive it as foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilization of Population.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the level of grievance that elements of the population hold against either state authorities or other segments of the population. This analysis assumes that a degree of population mobilization and poor governance is a requirement for the survival of a Salafi-jihadi insurgency, particularly one that seeks to hold terrain. This factor approximates popular mobilization by combining three criteria defined in The Underestimated Insurgency: African States at Risk for Salafi-Jihadi Insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use of Conflict.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion refers to the prevalence of conflict as a means to resolve political disputes. It considers the national level, including civil war, armed takeovers of government, and the projected risk of mass killing in which the state is the perpetrator or is unable or unwilling to prevent mass conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Civil war or internal military conflict is ongoing or occurred in the past six months, a military coup occurred in the past six months, or mass killing is assessed as ongoing or at increasing risk of happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Civil war or internal military conflict or coup occurred in the past year or period of expected civil war averted in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Civil war or internal military conflict or coup occurred in the past two years or period of expected civil war averted in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abusive Security Forces.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion approximates harmful security force behavior toward civilians by comparing current reporting on human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Security forces regularly abuse civilians and prisoners (e.g., summary executions and collective punishment) with overt or tacit government support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: There are intermittent security force abuses (e.g., violently dispersing protesters).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: There is abusive use of detention but less tendency to use violence against civilians. Security forces fail to respond to protect civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Security forces generally work professionally and in the population’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intergroup Grievances.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion approximates the level of hostility between population groups using the “group grievance” indicator from the Fragile States Index 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: 7.5–10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: 5.0–7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: 2.5–4.9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: 0–2.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-and-technical-factors&quot;&gt;Military and Technical Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors analyze an armed group’s ability to build, acquire, and use tools for making war. They consider both conventional and unconventional military effectiveness and terror attack capability ranging from local to transnational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bomb Making.&lt;/strong&gt; Improvised explosive device (IED) development is one indicator of a group’s growing lethality. This factor is important for assessing not only the development of a group’s terror attack capabilities but also its asymmetric military capabilities. Salafi-jihadi militants regularly use explosives to increase the effectiveness of their ground assaults in lieu of conventional weaponry. Drivable suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (SVBIEDs) require technical skill and relatively long logistical chains to make, and groups use them to augment conventional attacks and conduct targeted bombings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group builds IEDs locally, including drivable SVBIEDs. A known master bomb maker may be present. There may be evidence of research and development for weapons of mass destruction, demonstrated success at technical innovation, and use of SVBIED waves and major explosives as part of a coordinated military offensive or defensive operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group builds IEDs locally, possibly including drivable and up-armored SVBIEDs, or there may be evidence of training or studying from a master bomb maker or demonstrated attempts to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group employs remote-detonated or other immobile IEDs; uses found explosives, land mines, and suicide vests; or has demonstrated capability at the “red” or “orange” level more than three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group does not use explosive devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Weapons Systems.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s access to and ability to use weapons systems effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group modifies drones to drop explosives or has confirmed or is likely to access man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group demonstrated access to weapons systems at the “red” level more than three years ago. It may have access to MANPADs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group uses commercial drones for surveillance. It has used rockets, mortars, or other heavy fires in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group uses small arms only.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophisticated Tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor approximates the group’s level of military sophistication as a ground force. Groups may develop more advanced tactics with time — for example, combining skilled-fire teams with vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) to breach hard targets. Sophisticated tactics in theater also potentially indicate a latent transnational terror attack capability. The 2015 Islamic State Paris attack is an example of trained fighters from specialized military units adapting their skills for terror attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group uses VBIEDs and drones to support large-scale infantry operations. It may have effectively exported tactical teams to another country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group conducts complex attacks combining explosives and tactical teams to breach hard targets or coordinate attacks with multiple VBIEDs and other increasingly complex attacks, such as secondary bombings targeting first responders and geographically separated attacks on hard targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group conducts simultaneous small-arms attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is not using sophisticated tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Force Projection (Within Country).&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s ability to conduct military operations and terror attacks beyond its immediate area of operations within a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group can sustain ground offensives in multiple distinct geographic areas, or it credibly threatens population centers of high priority to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group can wage a ground insurgency in one area and conduct intermittent terror attacks or raids in other areas, or it can sustain operations across a large geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group can conduct brief simultaneous attacks in geographically separate locations, has demonstrated a recent but now suppressed capability to sustain attacks in multiple locations, or can sustain a terror network while under pressure in its primary area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is constrained to a local area, and any terror networks it maintains in other areas are largely dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Force Projection (Cross Border).&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s ability to conduct terror attacks and conventional military operations across international borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group sustains a consistent insurgency across an international border or has expanded across international borders and established new enduring bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group makes cross-border incursions or runs terror networks in neighboring countries from its primary area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group uses smuggling routes or support zones in a border region and has not attacked in a neighboring country in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group’s activities are confined to a single country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Terror Attack Capability.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates whether a group is capable of transnational terror attacks beyond its immediate country or region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has conducted or directly facilitated an attack outside its region on an international or transnational target in the past three years, or more than one successful individual attacker has credited the group for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has actively attempted one or more attacks outside its region, including advanced plots interdicted in early stages, or an individual attacker has credited the group for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group or individuals connected to it have attempted poorly designed attacks abroad, or the group conducted or directly facilitated one or more transnational terror attacks more than three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has not been connected to any attacks abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Units.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the presence of military units to carry out more specialized and sensitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has one or more units focused on external terror attacks either regionally or transnationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has one or more units focused on specialized functions such as counterintelligence, innovation and weapons development, or training, including either training foreign fighters for other conflicts or dispatching trainers to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group has a unit with special attack capabilities in either conventional fighting or terror attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has no specialized units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the group’s ability to access resources to sustain or enhance its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has a tax base and access to or dominance of economic networks. It likely has excess funds for operational planning or supporting other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has access to economic networks, or it may receive funds from other Salafi-jihadi groups or financiers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group’s economic resources are likely limited but sufficient for survival and baseline recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is isolated and struggles to access sufficient resources to sustain its membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissive Environment.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the group’s access to areas with ineffective security forces and havens outside state control. It also considers recent man-made or natural crises that create a window of vulnerability for all or part of the population. This factor approximates whether an environment is permissive by combining three criteria defined in &lt;em&gt;The Underestimated Insurgency: African States at Risk for Salafi-Jihadi Insurgencies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ineffective Security Forces.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion uses a measure of a country’s monopoly on the use of force as a proxy for security force capability. These data are from 2020. Where indicated, the author has adjusted the assessment to 2022 to account for overt changes in the use of force in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Monopoly on use of force ranking in the range of 0–2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: 2.6–5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: 5.1–7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: 7.6–10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncontrolled Areas.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion considers the degree to which a state controls the territory in its borders. It also considers the relative importance of that territory and the state’s degree of access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Terrain actively controlled by a force hostile to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Populated terrain with limited access for government forces and personnel, with government and insurgent forces contesting control of that terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Sparsely populated terrain outside government control and ongoing intercommunal conflicts that the government cannot or chooses not to intervene in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulnerability Window.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion refers to a recent change in position or security for all or part of the population, including armed conflict, mass political unrest, natural disasters, and humanitarian crises. This criterion also considers influxes of refugees and migrants as potentially destabilizing incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Man-made or natural crisis in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Man-made or natural crisis in the past year or forecast crisis with medium-high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Man-made or natural crisis in the past two years or forecast crisis with low-medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-factors&quot;&gt;Organizational Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors consider a group’s ability to coordinate people toward its goals, both by managing its internal processes and through its interactions with other organizations. These criteria also consider groups’ contributions to the broader Salafi-jihadi movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Generation.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers a group’s ability to build and regenerate a fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has training camps, possibly with foreign recruits, and there is evidence of growing membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Limited information indicates that the group may have training camps, foreign recruits, or growing membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group’s size is steady, there is no significant indication of membership growing or decreasing, or there is insufficient data to judge group size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is losing members to arrests, attacks, or defections, or the group suffered significant losses in recent years and does not appear to be recovering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience or Adaptability.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers whether a group has overcome a major military setback or adapted in response to pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has overcome a setback, such as the loss of terrain or its initial leaders, and returned at a level equal to or above preceding the setback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group lost capability in its initial area of operations but shifted elsewhere, or it has sustained a territorial insurgency under significant military pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group has lost military capability but sustains as a terror attack network, or it encountered pressure and significantly reduced its area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has not yet come under pressure, or it has become dormant for at least a year after coming under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Integration and Amplification.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers whether a group effectively draws on or contributes to larger Salafi-jihadi networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group sends fighters to other groups and helps start or seed new Salafi-jihadi franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group sends trainers, media expertise, and weapons experts to other groups; receives foreign fighters for training; or plays a coordinating role for other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group receives training, delegations, media coordination or amplification, and money or weapons from other groups. It may have changed its name or formal affiliation or rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group may receive superficial media attention from Salafi-jihadi publications but otherwise receives no support from other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitors and Infighting.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the role of intergroup relations. Competition between Salafi-jihadi groups can be destructive and constrain a group’s ability to pursue its governance and military goals, but it can also empower more radical factions and encourage defections between groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group is collaborating or deconflicting with Salafi-jihadi rivals against shared adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has a local Salafi-jihadi rival but is either successfully repressing or absorbing its rival or increasing its overall rate and scale of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group is dedicating some energy to quelling infighting but has not split, or it has no local Salafi-jihadi rivals or apparent infighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is primarily preoccupied with infighting, including targeting spies and defectors, or it is suppressed by rival Salafi-jihadi groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Resilience should be reconceptualized as the individual and collective capacity to withstand, fight through, and quickly recover from disruption caused by military and non-military threats to Euro-Atlantic security from authoritarian actors and strategic competitors as well as global challenges. It merits a top priority in NATO and national planning, significant investment in building Europe’s credible resilience posture, and new approaches to amplifying allies’ combined capacity to tackle shared challenges and threats as well as increasing vigilance amid heightened tensions. Creating a NATO Resilience Planning Process akin to the NATO Defence Planning Process will be instrumental in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong collective response. In addition, a high-level resilience task force should be created to identify multidimensional resilience lessons from Ukraine across the spectrum of conventional, hybrid, and societal threats, as well as to make recommendations for future policies and investments that will bolster European resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-resilience-in-light-of-russias-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;European Resilience in Light of Russia’s War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has been the trigger for a reshaping of European self-defense. Confronted with the immediate danger Russia represents, European nations have begun rethinking national security objectives and commitments, reinforcing military strength, and providing political and financial support as well as an unprecedented supply of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership, after decades (in the case of Finland) or even centuries (for Sweden) of neutrality. Denmark has lifted its 30-year opt-out from the EU Common Security and Defence Policy. Germany is planning to beef up its defense spending and modernize its forces after years of underspending and neglect. Poland is making unparalleled investments in its defense capabilities, doubling its army from 150,000 to 300,000 soldiers and championing military aid to Ukraine. And Ukraine itself has been granted official EU candidate nation status and applied for accelerated NATO accession. In effect, a common threat has served to unite NATO and the European Union in a way that previous debates about developing a common security policy had not. Epitomized by German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s characterization of this development as “Zeitenwende” — a historic turning point — in his address to the Bundestag’s emergency session on February 27, this resurgence of traditional security threats brings defense collaboration to the top of the political agenda in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reshaping of European self-defense thus creates an opportunity for innovation that goes beyond measuring nations’ investments into their capabilities and forces. While European nations have individual policies about their defense forces and resources, there are many benefits that accrue from identifying, considering, and building on interdependencies and interconnectedness. Deepening collaboration between like-minded nations can provide credible military options and faster decisionmaking to respond to a wide range of contingencies, both in peacetime and at times of crisis or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these interdependencies align with questions about resilience. The concept of resilience — incorporating military capacity, civil preparedness, and emergency planning — was central to the Cold War narrative as a first line of defense against the Soviet Union. Moored into Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, it committed allies to “separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, . . . maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, concerns about resilience took a back seat to other issues. They have a new salience today. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine joins the Covid-19 pandemic, intensified geostrategic competition with China, technological advancement, and climate change to underscore the need to better prepare for disruption, pervasive instability, strategic shocks, emerging vulnerabilities, and persistent threats. By their very nature, those overwhelming systemic challenges are far greater than any nation can address on its own and involve interests vital to the security and well-being of all European and North American allies. Moreover, as Ganesh Sitaraman observed in his 2020 Foreign Affairs essay, “what unites those seemingly disparate threats is that each is not so much a battle to be won as a challenge to be weathered.” Enduring them requires constant adaptation and agility, as well as the ability to understand shortfalls and vulnerabilities and the willingness and means to address them head-on. And while not free of cost, it is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current crisis makes a clear case for building and bolstering resilience in peacetime and coordinating resources, capabilities, supply chains, and logistics across the alliance. Allocating adequate resources to enhancing the ability to absorb strategic shocks can make a crucial difference in winning a war before it begins. Thus, resilience — while primarily a national responsibility that requires political commitment, investment, supporting organization, and prioritization — must become a collective imperative, especially since many resilience challenges cross national borders. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy (NDS) advances a focus on resilience and collaboration with allies and partners to deter aggression and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. Moreover, the NDS broadens the concept of NATO collective security commitment to include — on top of conventional deterrence and defense — working alongside allies to build resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This signals a major shift toward embracing resilience as essential to amplifying the combined capacity of allied nations to tackle shared challenges and threats. Consequently, resilience cannot be solely defined as a function of society’s ability to resist and recover from shocks as it is set forth by NATO in current documents. Rather, reflecting the North Atlantic Treaty obligations and the prevailing threat landscape, resilience should be conceptualized as the alliance members’ individual and collective capacity to withstand, fight through, and quickly recover from disruption caused by military and non-military threats to Euro-Atlantic security from authoritarian actors and strategic competitors as well as global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-nato-resilience-efforts&quot;&gt;Existing NATO Resilience Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has brought into sharper focus the fact that military resilience overlaps with broader societal resilience requirements. It has highlighted the pressing need to address these wider interdependencies and identify vulnerabilities to disruption that can have cascading effects across societies and economies. In his October 2020 speech, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg observed that “having a strong military is fundamental to our security, but our military cannot be strong if our societies are weak.” Ukraine’s heroic fight underscores that a robust national resistance strategy based on a whole-of-society ability to signal strength to the adversary while augmenting the effects of posture can make a crucial difference in responding to acute crises and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is existing groundwork for pursuing new thinking about resilience. Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its increasingly aggressive tactics shattered the 1989 vision offered by President George H.W. Bush of a Europe “whole, free, and at peace” facing little threat of a conventional attack. After two decades of shifting its role from collective deterrence and territorial defense against the Soviet Union to undertaking crisis management operations outside its traditional operational theater, NATO was confronted with Russia’s heightened threat to Euro-Atlantic security and stability. And it was woefully underprepared to handle a crisis unfolding on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the alliance embarked on reinforcing its posture. A growing number of allies also began to recognize resilience as essential to developing effective deterrence and reassurance measures, which can be part of a comprehensive security strategy as well as instrumental to tackling mounting societal vulnerabilities. At the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw, the alliance’s Heads of State and Government noted that “civil preparedness is a central pillar of Allies’ resilience and a critical enabler for Alliance collective defense.” To improve civil preparedness, allies agreed on seven NATO baseline requirements (see text box) for national resilience that serve also as a framework to support the effective enablement of NATO forces to ensure the collective defense and security of all allies. These are centered around continuity of government, essential services to the population, and civil support to the military that must be maintained in times of crisis. In addition, at the 2021 Brussels summit, allies endorsed the Strengthened Resilience Commitment and Proposal 3 for improved resilience under the NATO 2030 Agenda. This acted as an acknowledgment that safeguarding the alliance’s societies, populations, and shared values requires a new and broader understanding of the importance of national and collective resilience as well as civil preparedness. To address specific challenges, allies agreed to intensify efforts to secure and diversify supply chains, ensure the resilience of critical infrastructure and key industries, and direct attention to the impact of natural hazards compounded by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assured continuity of government and critical government services: for instance the ability to make decisions, communicate them and enforce them in a crisis;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient energy supplies: back-up plans and power grids, internally and across borders;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ability to deal effectively with uncontrolled movement of people, and to de-conflict these movements from NATO’s military deployments;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient food and water resources: ensuring these supplies are safe from disruption or sabotage;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ability to deal with mass casualties and disruptive health crises: ensuring that civilian health systems can cope and that sufficient medical supplies are stocked and secure;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient civil communications systems: ensuring that telecommunications and cyber networks function even under crisis conditions, with sufficient back-up capacity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient transport systems: ensuring that NATO forces can move across Alliance territory rapidly and that civilian services can rely on transportation networks, even in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience was also prominently featured in the discussions leading to the adoption of the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept, which serves as blueprint that will profoundly shape how NATO and its allies think about addressing security challenges for a decade to come. Some experts argued that building comprehensive resilience to disruptive threats to allied societies should be added as a core task for the alliance — alongside collective defense, cooperative security, and crisis management. The new Strategic Concept agreed upon by the NATO Heads of State and Government at the Madrid summit in June 2022 acknowledges resilience as a key issue for the alliance. Although it falls short of explicitly designating it as a fourth core task, it highlights the need to “pursue a more robust, integrated, and coherent approach to building national and alliance-wide resilience.” The Strategic Concept also notes that resilience is critical to tackling both military and non-military threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-a-nato-resilience-planning-process&quot;&gt;Establishing a NATO Resilience Planning Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadth of these efforts at the highest political levels of the alliance is an indicator of the nations’ and NATO’s understanding of the importance of resilience. However, these mostly top-down policy-focused statements lack robust implementation plans to achieve a desired strategic and operational intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has developed an initial set of evaluation criteria to facilitate national resilience self-assessment efforts, and it has been appraising the state of the alliance’s resilience every two years since 2018. However, many shortfalls remain. The inability to effectively tackle the persistent challenges of increasingly contested logistics, vulnerable transport infrastructure, dependence on Russian gas supplies, and the emergence of cyber and hybrid threats points to the stressors across the alliance. Left unaddressed, these challenges will almost certainly result in weakening NATO’s response to unfolding crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is therefore confronted with the urgent task of operationalizing collective resilience objectives and enacting nationally developed goals as well as robust follow-through mechanisms to assess, review, and monitor progress. Recent decisions to voluntarily share data on national policies and plans are encouraging, but their nonmandatory and discretionary nature makes it difficult to identify existing national resilience shortfalls and generate a comprehensive and complete picture of the stress points that can undermine shared resilience. Moreover, the majority of NATO allies do not have resilience plans, nor do they have resilience organization in place. The fragmented and uneven nature of resilience building efforts, policies, investments, and activities across the alliance shows that these priorities need to be aligned in a more integrated manner — and tailored to specific threats and challenges — in order to combine and coordinate allies’ strengths to maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO is therefore confronted with the urgent task of operationalizing collective resilience objectives and enacting nationally developed goals as well as robust follow-through mechanisms to assess, review, and monitor progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a system in place that can be used as a model for new resilience policies. The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) works to “provide a framework within which national and Alliance defence planning activities can be harmonised to enable Allies to provide the required forces and capabilities in the most effective way.” However, if incorporated directly into NDPP — a complex and already overstretched process encompassing 14 different defense planning domains — resilience will always take a back seat and not receive the attention it requires. Moreover, the problem set and the expertise needed to address resilience requirements are different. Therefore the development of a new NATO Resilience Planning Process following the NDPP methodology would be much more effective in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong and collective resilience posture. A key goal of the NATO Resilience Planning Process would be to ensure that the new process can drive both national and collective resilience requirements and help achieve more effective unity of effort. As planning for resilience, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, goes beyond the realm of defense budgets, standing up a distinct — yet familiar — framework will help convert political will into tangible commitments and increased resilience capabilities. Alliance-wide resilience planning will be vital in helping to influence national behaviors and allocate adequate resources by incorporating NATO resilience guidelines into national strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the NATO Resilience Planning Process could hew closely to the NDPP’s five-step approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-establish-political-guidance-and-set-priorities&quot;&gt;STEP 1: ESTABLISH POLITICAL GUIDANCE AND SET PRIORITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to incorporate resilience questions into top-level political guidance documents, which NATO produces every four years. The political guidance derives from higher-level strategic policy and is a single cohesive framework that lays out the overall aims and objectives that the alliance must meet in the next five to ten years. Future political guidance documents — including the upcoming 2023 political guidance — should include specific objectives for resilience. Along with the operational level of ambition (defined as the number, scale, and nature of the operations that the alliance should be able to conduct in the future, along with the capability requirements needed to support them and the associated priorities and timelines), it should include a resilience level of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-determine-requirements-to-meet-nato-resilience-level-of-ambition&quot;&gt;STEP 2: DETERMINE REQUIREMENTS TO MEET NATO RESILIENCE LEVEL OF AMBITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic work will be necessary for developing and defining a consolidated list of minimum resilience requirements. This should be the full set of resilience capabilities and assets that NATO needs if it is to support the effective enablement of its forces to ensure the collective defense and security of all allies. Juxtaposing these requirements with existing or already planned capabilities (national, multinational, or common-funded) will be instrumental in identifying resilience shortfalls across the alliance. This should include baseline national requirements and recommendations for cross-cutting layered resilience across national borders. The requirements should be updated every four years, following the recommendations in the political guidance documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-apportion-resilience-requirements-and-set-targets&quot;&gt;STEP 3: APPORTION RESILIENCE REQUIREMENTS AND SET TARGETS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next step starts the implementation process by defining specific goals. These minimum resilience requirement targets should have associated priorities and timelines and should allow for innovative solutions rather than requiring specific approaches. They can be allocated to allies either individually, multinationally, or collectively, and they should follow the principles of fair burden sharing and reasonable challenge to determine the contributions of individual nations. The NATO resource committee can decide which resilience investments are eligible for common funding so as to provide additional support for the goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-4-facilitate-implementation&quot;&gt;STEP 4: FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework will provide a new context for resilience activities. Investments in capabilities like energy and cybersecurity are not new to the allies, but connecting them into an overarching capability framework will require new approaches to implementation and measurement. This will be most effective if NATO can provide continuous assistance to allies in implementing the targets. This can include facilitating multinational initiatives and streamlining NATO efforts to help nations address priority resilience shortfalls and share best practices. NATO may need to invest in a new central resilience organization to support national efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-5-review-results-and-offer-additional-support-where-needed&quot;&gt;STEP 5: REVIEW RESULTS AND OFFER ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WHERE NEEDED&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting clear goals should facilitate periodic assessments of how NATO’s resilience objectives, ambitions, and targets are being met. The goals of this assessment can include identifying shortfalls, which may mean that new strategies or support structures will be needed — and that allies will require financial support to overcome these shortfalls. However, a periodic assessment could also offer a pathway for seeking out success stories and useful insights on a regular basis, lessons that will then be able to be rolled out to other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-resources-and-strategies-needed-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Additional Resources and Strategies Needed for Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Step 4 suggests, facilitating implementation will require support structures, both at the NATO level and at the national level. Allies will need to invest in NATO’s capacity to provide a platform for political consultation and collective action on resilience, support resilience efforts on an alliance level, and strengthen national capabilities, especially when it comes to smaller states. The recently established NATO Resilience Committee is one approach. Chaired by the assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning and reporting directly to the North Atlantic Council, the committee should be further strengthened and given a clear mandate to provide strategic and policy advice and planning guidance, as well as coherence for resilience activities across NATO. But NATO committees often face system- and process-level constraints that limit their ability to act with authority. To overcome these, NATO needs empowered senior leadership and champions from both senior military and civilian officials to give resilience issues greater visibility and accountability and drive forward progress, including identifying and naming a senior official with the specific responsibility and authority to oversee and ensure coherence between civilian and military collective resilience efforts. Senior national officials for resilience, who met for the first time on November 16, 2022, should focus on coordinating interagency efforts at national levels and on developing concrete deliverables for NATO and allies. Moreover, clearly defining collective objectives that the alliance must pursue to strengthen resilience will be key to ensuring tangible and timely progress — and this needs to happen before the NATO Vilnius summit next July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A next step would be to ensure that NATO can draw on national resilience capabilities in crisis situations and create a rapid response capability or crisis center focused on resilience support in emergency situations or contingencies. NATO has existing models for this, including a NATO rapid reaction team designed to fight cyberattacks. It also recently sent counter hybrid warfare support teams to both Lithuania and Montenegro. The creation of policies to support the creation of similar resilience-focused crisis response teams that could be deployed within 24 hours would speed recovery from disruption. This resilience rapid response capability should be exercised regularly to develop and ensure efficacy, with the goal of becoming part of Europe’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these efforts span multiple domains and involve cross-cutting issues, improved civil-military coordination amid increasing demands on NATO forces and the civil sector in times of crises to ensure uninterrupted provision of vital services is key. While NATO continues to cope with day-to day resilience challenges, such as cyberattacks or acts of sabotage against critical infrastructure, it is time to also lay the foundation for a longer-term resilience strategy. This will allow NATO to be more proactive and better prepared to more effectively build enduring resilience, rather than focusing on being reactive to crises. In addition, embedding military resilience in the broader context of collective resilience will be vital to absorb the full range of future threats. In order to help ensure greater coherence across military and civilian dimension of resilience, more synergies are needed with the military concepts that set the direction for NATO’s ongoing adaptation: the Concept for Deterrence and Defense of the Euro-Atlantic Area, which focuses on force employment to deter and defend today, and the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, which outlines a vision to guide the alliance’s long-term warfare development. In particular, NATO should further leverage efforts undertaken by the Allied Command Transformation to develop the notion of layered resilience, as part of the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept. Encompassing logistics, warfighting capability, perseverance, military infrastructure, situational awareness, command and control, and response planning, layered resilience underscores the interconnected nature of military and civilian resilience. Both are necessary — and mutually reinforcing — to build the ability to withstand immediate shocks and disruptions over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attack on Ukraine has led to the largest war in Europe since 1945. This conflict is the most recent and most relevant operation of its kind, and it possesses an unprecedented potential to develop useful lessons for building resilience against further Russian aggression and gray zone coercion. However, this will not happen without sustained, deliberate, and focused effort. To ensure that it is done effectively, the North Atlantic Council should stand up a high-level resilience task force to identify preliminary resilience lessons from Ukraine across the spectrum of conventional, hybrid, and societal threats, as well as to make recommendations for future policies and investments that can bolster European resilience. Alternatively, the United States could take the lead on creating such a task force with the goal of bolstering European resilience and strengthening NATO’s ability to respond to crises, allowing the United States to take more of a “reinsurer” role under Article 3 rather than acting as a first line of defense. The FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, currently in deliberations, could be the opportunity to initiate such a task force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serious implementation concern is always funding. New policies and organizational structures are never free. However, developing the required policies and structures for increased resilience represents a marginal cost when compared to national efforts already in place or required by NATO guidance. While NATO HQ and International Staff funding can be contentious, at the end of the day, NATO nations get value from their investments. Resilience is too important a task to be absorbed by existing staff and processes, and NATO members must be prepared to allocate the marginal resources needed to support efforts to strengthen resilience. New capital investments in ensuring operational resilience will be the greater cost — but NATO has shown that it is willing to make investments to support its priorities, including the recent standup of a €1 billion innovation fund. The Defense Investment Pledge (DIP), adopted by NATO leaders in 2014, framed the political narrative on transatlantic burden sharing and committed allies to spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense within the next decade. At the Madrid summit, allies decided to build on that pledge to ensure that increased national defense spending and NATO common funding would be “commensurate with the challenges of a more contested security order.” One question for NATO to decide as an alliance within the next year is to what extent subsequent commitments beyond 2024 should reflect resilience. Investing in resilience should be a priority and resilience expenditures should be in addition to other commitments, and this may require the development of a robust methodology to determine national contributions to collective resilience. This also spotlights an opportunity to shift the political narrative from transatlantic burden sharing to a more unified alliance prepared to share the responsibilities and risks flowing from a volatile security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing Russia’s threat requires not only refocusing allied nations’ capabilities and military readiness but also reframing collective resilience as something centered around the same principles as collective defense — which “binds its members together, committing them to protect each other and setting a spirit of solidarity within the alliance.” Thus, building capacity along Europe’s eastern flank and further strengthening resilience would benefit from the creation of a NATO Resilience Fund. Such a fund, established to directly support the resilience capacity of the most vulnerable allies and priority partner nations, would also significantly contribute to reinforcing deterrence, including deterrence in the face of Russian threat. As the European Union is increasingly acting in a complementary role to NATO’s security objectives, improved cooperation between EU institutions and NATO will help enhance the efficacy of resilience initiatives in Europe. Identifying concrete steps and effective synergies — especially between NATO’s baseline requirements for national resilience and the European Union’s critical entities resilience directive — as well as continuing work within a formal structured dialogue on resilience and civil preparedness will further increase the coherence of efforts in an already constrained environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective and creative ideas can come from many places, and many solutions are likely to be offered by and sourced from industry, especially as many resilience assets are owned by the private sector. Setting up a NATO-industry resilience partnership early will ensure that the government requirement-setting process benefits from a clear understanding of current capabilities, knowledge of industry trends, and access to private sector resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As observed by General Christopher G. Cavoli, NATO’s supreme allied commander, Europe, the Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that these complex and interrelated challenges demand “whole-of-government, whole-of-nation, whole-of-alliance efforts.” NATO as an alliance and its member nations have the rare opportunity to learn from a serious conflict with a persistent adversary in their own backyard. Focusing on lessons learned is a strategic imperative, both for planning for future warfighting operations and for understanding how and where to invest in resilience to ensure that allies can “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack,” as called for in Article 3. The need to respond to multiple contingencies at short notice, while building up the ability to withstand and recover quickly from disruptions, has become the new normal amid strategic competition. This newfound urgency to act decisively — not in the distant future but in the next few years — requires not only political will but also sustained commitment and considerable resources, as well as improved coordination at national and alliance levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the pronounced imbalance between high-level political statements and current resilience posture, a robust, coherent, and purpose-driven process is needed to achieve the strategic and operational intent of decisions taken at NATO summits and ministerial meetings. Collective resilience is not only a function of burden sharing. It entails high levels of responsibility and risk sharing, and it deserves a distinct approach. Creating a NATO Resilience Planning Process will be instrumental in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong collective response. Following the model of the NATO Defense Planning Process will allow the new approach to align with an accepted strategy that has organizational support, which will help smooth the path to effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to resilience must also embrace additional resources and strategies, notably development of clearly defined objectives, creation of a rapid response capability, improved civil-military coordination, and robust investment. Implementation should include the establishment of a high-level resilience task force overseen by a new senior official with the specific responsibility and authority to ensure coherence between civilian and military collective resilience efforts. As Russia and other strategic competitors continue to aggressively exploit vulnerabilities, a lack of appropriate urgency in bolstering collective resilience in Europe will imperil the alliance’s ability to effectively address the looming threats.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a supportive policy environment can help high-potential businesses accelerate. Creating such an environment is a shared responsibility of both the central government and India’s 28 states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many state governments in India have piecemeal policies and programs to support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). About one-third of India’s states have worked to craft multifaceted and supportive policies and practices to encourage MSME growth. This paper reviews the ideas already enacted in different Indian states, as well as in national and subnational governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a single comprehensive MSME policy is an effective approach for a state-level government to consider. It allows small firms to find policy incentives and programs in a single place, and perhaps most importantly, it allows a state to directly consider a range of intertwined incentives that can work together. This will maximize the positive impact to small firms that are poised for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitating the growth of MSMEs will have a much wider impact on India’s job growth overall. The large multinational manufacturers that India hopes to attract to invest through programs like Make in India require a diverse and efficient network of suppliers. Supporting MSME growth can create a multiplier effect — driving new investment and employment generation by larger firms. The central government has affirmed a 25 percent target of gross domestic product (GDP) for manufacturing, up from approximately14 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper provides leading international examples in the promotion of small businesses, while also enumerating best practices from Indian states’ MSME policies. The final section lays out the 30 elements commonly utilized by Indian states to offer targeted assistance to MSMEs as a roadmap for other states that want to provide best-in-class policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In some instances, in this paper, the term small and medium enterprises (SME) is used instead of MSME. SME removes the “micro” sized firms which often have specific needs and are too small to avail some support programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elements-and-impacts-of-comprehensive-msme-policies&quot;&gt;Elements and Impacts of Comprehensive MSME Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-small-businesses&quot;&gt;The Importance of Small Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small business policies are considered an important part of most countries’ industrial policy due to MSMEs’ job generation capacity. The Indian government estimates the nation hosts around 60 million MSMEs, which collectively employ 111 million people — around 25 percent of total national employment. MSMEs contribute 28 percent of GDP and 40 percent of India’s exports. Of these categories, “micro” firms (less than 600,000 USD in turnover) make up approximately 95 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job creation is crucial as India slowly undertakes agricultural reforms. Today, India’s agriculture sector employs approximately 43 percent of workers, yet produces less than 17 percent of GDP. While the Indian government backed down from a package of agriculture reforms in 2021, smaller reforms continue to provide space for Indian farmers to expand and improve productivity. This would likely cause further reductions in farm workers — and a widening pool of semi-skilled and unskilled laborers that will need to be absorbed by other parts of the economy. Some initial reports about “post-Covid-19” economic shifts indicate that seasonal workers are finding lower-paying roles than in previous off-seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is in the middle of a substantial realignment of global supply chains. Rising labor costs, trade imbalances, and security concerns have all collided to force companies to consider supply hubs outside of China. Often, Indian officials seek to court large manufacturers to consider new investments. They note the steady liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, India’s improved rankings in global business indices, and the growing domestic market. However, another element large manufacturers must consider is the health of the supplier ecosystem. For example, Ford Motor Company notes that they have around 1,200 Tier 1 production suppliers. Boeing has over 11,000 Tier 1 suppliers globally. Lockheed Martin notes a network of 15,800 active suppliers. Procter &amp;amp; Gamble boasts of a network of more than 60,000 suppliers. For firms like these, having a network of suppliers ready to grow commensurately can improve Indian states’ overall attractiveness as a manufacturing hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s state governments should also carefully consider policies that support young MSMEs but do not create constraints to continued growth. Globally, older small firms have less impact on job creation than either young firms or larger firms, so governments should choose policy options that avoid creating a “growth trap.” Policies should be framed in a manner as to encourage continued growth instead of stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-specialized-needs-of-smaller-firms&quot;&gt;The Specialized Needs of Smaller Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after 30 years of liberalization, firms of every size in India can list a range of issues that preclude their growth. Some of these are policy issues, while others are operational issues such as low quality infrastructure. While much of this list is shared with larger firms, some of these factors have a more acute impact on smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key examples of the operational barriers that often have an outsized impact on smaller firms include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weak electric power grids: Larger firms may have the capacity to invest in independent electric power sources. Smaller firms are less likely to be able to invest in such capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Water systems: Many industries require purified water as part of their manufacturing processes. Larger firms may have the capacity to invest in improved water sources or in improving the quality of municipal water, while smaller firms are less likely to be able to do so. This is also true for the treatment of effluent discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal restitution of business disputes: As business disputes occur, larger firms have more negotiating clout and may be able to resolve disputes before going to court. If they do go to court, larger firms have the capacity to hire the best legal counsel and wait longer periods for decisions. For smaller firms, securing legal restitution through the courts can cause tremendous hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to information: Indian state policies can be difficult to find, even online. Smaller firms may not be aware of government policies and programs meant to accelerate their growth and improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State compliances: Larger firms are more likely to have a focused team that can complete state compliances in areas such as taxation, labor, and environmental regulation. For smaller firms, such compliances place a real burden on management, distracting from other critical operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to resources or inputs: Larger firms will have a greater capacity to negotiate with resource and input providers. Larger firms may offer advantages to a supplier such as pricing, transparency, size of supply contract, length of supply contract, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation: As governments increase actions to combat the sources of climate change, firms may be asked to bear short-term expenses to reduce emissions. This could deeply impact smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is far from exhaustive but provides some idea of how the business environment impacts firms of different sizes differently. Some surveys of MSMEs expand this list much further — studying topics such as labor unrest, availability of raw materials, and other issues where supportive government policies will need to be more creative and nuanced. Government policymakers should bear this in mind when looking for ways to boost job creation. Compared to large firms, smaller firms may not have the capacity to regularly petition the government on business affairs, so it will take greater effort to learn about the constraints smaller firms face — and how interventions can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent surveys of small businesses in various geographies point to the difficulties faced by small firms and the effectiveness of various government interventions. Naturally, recent surveys must take into account the unusual factor of the Covid-19 pandemic. But across geographies and national income levels, it is striking — despite different types of questions, firms, and more — that similar issues are prioritized by MSMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-policy-interventions-of-indian-states&quot;&gt;Existing Policy Interventions of Indian States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten of India’s 28 states have overarching MSME policies, either as standalone policies or as a focus section in the state’s larger industrial policy framework. Of these 10, 4 are expired and others were drafted by previous governments. The five states with “live” policies drafted by the incumbent governments are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat MSME policy incentives are included in these states’ wider industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, every Indian state offers programmatic and policy support to nurture MSMEs, but such policies are rarely developed as part of an overarching MSME policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;State-by-State Breakdown of Existing MSME Policy Interventions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five themes are commonly found in existing states’ MSME policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial Support: Assisting with MSME finances through funding support, reimbursements, and financial incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance and Regulatory Support: Offering measures to reduce the burden and cost of compliance. This often takes the forms of reduced paperwork or subsidies related to costs like registrations, certifications, power charges, state taxes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure Support: Improving MSME infrastructure access through MSME cluster or park development. Also, offering concessions for availing infrastructure or providing a seat in existing state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketing Support: Improving MSME’s marketing efforts through state procurement and market linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boosting Central Government MSME Programs: Strengthening MSME development institutes and facilitating central MSME schemes, including funding schemes and distressed asset schemes specifically. Also includes establishing or strengthening MSME facilitation councils in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating policies to support small firms is not unique to India. Many national and subnational governments around the world have targeted support programs to help smaller firms accelerate growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-of-msme-intervention-successes&quot;&gt;Examples of MSME Intervention Successes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies and programs require regular monitoring and impact assessments to ensure that they are being carried out successfully at the envisioned scale and are positively impacting the desired groups. The ultimate goal is facilitating business survival, business expansion, and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best programs and administrators ensure that monitoring mechanisms require relatively low effort beyond the initial setup. For instance, several U.S. states integrate public procurement portals with small business targeting programs so that progress dashboards are easy to track, and course corrections can be made. An example is the Statewide Procurement Data Dashboards from California — which is made publicly available to improve accountability. Another example is the COSTARS program in Pennsylvania, which connects buyers and sellers and has built-in tools to track the types of firms that are winning contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some country-wide examples of policy and programmatic interventions that have been linked to positive outcomes for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brazil&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs receiving credit support experienced a 15 percent increase in their number of workers (three jobs per establishment on average).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs participating in a credit program observed a 2.4 percent increase in wages and an increase in the value of exports and trademark registrations. For every 1,000 firms receiving credit support, on average, about two of them registered a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs receiving export support increased employees by 11 percent on average and created an average of 2.6 jobs per establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, export support led to six additional trademarks registered for every 1,000 establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;argentina&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Argentine SME support programs increased employment, real wages, and the probability of exporting by 14.3 percent, 1.4 percent, and 1.8 percent respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SME policies on innovation found that access to capital, regional innovation programs, and institution-industry collaboration led to greater innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nigeria&quot;&gt;Nigeria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 2015 World Bank report notes the successes of Nigeria’s Youth Enterprise with Innovation (YouWiN) program for start-ups, which awards companies a $50,000 prize. Existing firms that have won the contest have a 20 percent higher likelihood of being operational three years later, a 21 percent higher chance that the firm crosses the 10-employee threshold, and a 25 percent increase in profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sri-lanka&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 2012 study published in Science indicates one-time transfers to microenterprises in Srilanka is linked to higher survival rates and higher profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-key-elements-of-a-state-msme-policy&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations: Key Elements of a State MSME Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The states should survey small firms to gauge the primary areas where policy reform and programmatic support will have the biggest impact. They should further build a framework that incorporates accountability tools to track implementation and create a review mechanism to assess the impact of the policy on business survival, business growth, and job creation. The states should also consider appropriate methods for educating the public about these initiatives so that they are taken up by small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSME model policy constituents:&lt;/strong&gt; The model MSME policy contains various elements emanating from the six policy pillars outlined earlier in this report. Indian states are highly encouraged to implement a comprehensive policy encompassing all 30 elements listed below, prioritizing areas that are recognized as particularly crucial in individual states. Within a state, some policies may be reserved or augmented for targeted classes of individuals or less-developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support&quot;&gt;Financial Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce fees for initial company registration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer direct subsidies for new investments in plants, property, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer rebates on state taxes, such as stamp duty and state GST.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or rebates on interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish mandatory procurement preferences for MSMEs. This can include a target percentage and other incentives outlined in an earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse employers’ contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have state agencies prioritize payments to MSME suppliers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compliance-and-regulatory-support&quot;&gt;Compliance and Regulatory Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow self-declaration to a single state agency to allow a firm to start operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide a “graduated system” of reporting — micro firms have the fewest document submissions, followed by small firms, medium firms, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a digital land bank with incentives for MSMEs to acquire or lease land.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove less critical compliances for the first three years of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for domestic and international certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for submitting domestic and international patent applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the acquisition of equipment related to required product testing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create district-level “facilitation cells” that help local MSMEs through their approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure-support&quot;&gt;Infrastructure Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create “clusters” with common infrastructure, especially for related industries, with key features covered in an earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse some percentage of the cost of electricity for business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse or subsidize costs with securing additional sources of electric power, including rooftop solar panels and generators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse or subsidize land costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse or subsidize land conversion fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the cost of upgrading information and communications technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for energy and water audits that can help the company save costs and increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the costs of equipment related to energy and water audits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marketing-support&quot;&gt;Marketing Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for renting a stall at a trade fair or exhibition. This can be for both domestic and international shows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tutor MSMEs on the central government MSME procurement mandate, helping them win orders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create programs to teach MSMEs how to get online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;boosting-central-government-msme-programs&quot;&gt;Boosting Central Government MSME Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subsidize the cost for MSMEs to list on SME exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a targeted plan with the National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) to link states’ needs with central government training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-ideas&quot;&gt;Other Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Raw Materials: Many MSMEs highlight the lack of availability of raw materials. The state can look at information tools to help link MSMEs with available stocks of raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skilling: As with Haryana, the state can cover some of the costs MSMEs incur in training and skilling employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

However, there still remain impediments that prevent this cooperative relationship from morphing into a wholehearted alliance.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This report examines the writings of Chinese and Russian strategic thinkers to explore Sino-Russian cooperation across four main areas: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics. The core sources used for this report have never before been translated into English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic thinkers in both countries recognize that while Russia currently faces increasing diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation, China’s global position and strength continues to grow. This widening gulf between the economic and technological capabilities of each country will increase the inequality in their relationship and in turn impact its bilateral dynamic. While Russia used to be the more advanced partner in terms of arms sales and technology transfers, China’s rapid development in these areas has put the two partners on more of an equal footing. China and Russia have increased their engagement in the realm of joint military exercises, and this collaboration is expected to continue. Regarding their work together on issues connected to space and cyber, engagement is more limited and is focused more on technical cooperation and joint diplomatic efforts to oppose perceived moves by the United States to militarize space. While China and Russia each recognize the importance of hybrid warfare in contemporary geopolitics, for now they lack a shared strategy of how best to counter Western hybrid capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens the long-term ability of the Kremlin to carry its weight in its partnership with Beijing. On the other hand, Russian efforts to react to Western-led economic sanctions and support for Ukraine could provide the Chinese leadership with an important guide as to how their own country could resist Western pressure during a crisis in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;max-bergmann-and-andrew-lohsen&quot;&gt;Max Bergmann and Andrew Lohsen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early February 2022, Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China met in person for the first time in two years for bilateral talks in advance of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The summit concluded with a joint statement in which the leaders announced a partnership “with no forbidden areas of cooperation.” This was a pivotal moment in the Sino-Russian relationship. Coming amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West triggered by Russia’s buildup of military forces along the Ukrainian border, the detailed statement demonstrated a joint commitment to building a stronger bilateral partnership. The meeting affirmed that not only do Putin and Xi both perceive the prevailing global order as Western-dominated and designed to constrain their ability to pursue their strategic interests, they also have a shared desire to challenge the existing global order. It demonstrated their mutual understanding that each country had something to gain from the other in the effort to move the world toward multipolarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began only 20 days after the summit, immediately put to the test the proclamation that there were “no limits” to the Sino-Russian partnership. Yet, while Western officials may have hoped that the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty would drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, such expectations so far have proven overly optimistic. China has neither provided extensive military aid nor indicated a broad willingness to help Russia circumvent sanctions, but its leaders have refused to condemn Russia’s actions and instead blame the United States and the West for the war due to their enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance in disregard of Russia’s security concerns. Moreover, bilateral trade has intensified as Russia pivots away from European markets, and the countries continue to engage in joint military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders of both Russia and China have also made confident statements regarding the robustness of their countries’ partnership. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi remarked in July that bilateral relations were characterized by their “strong resilience and strategic determination” amid uncertain geopolitical conditions, while his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov indicated that cooperation with China would not be subject to “external interference.” In short, the overall framework of the relationship as an anti-Western partnership remains intact, and the two countries continue to find opportunities for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military sphere provides fertile ground for Russia and China to strengthen their relationship. Bilateral military ties have grown substantially since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its proxy war in eastern Ukraine set it on a trajectory of confrontation with — and isolation from — the West. Cooperation has occurred along several vectors; for example, arms sales between the countries involve increasingly sensitive and complex technologies, the tempo and scope of military exercises has increased, and the two countries are collaborating on satellite navigation, which has substantial military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Western analysts have closely examined Sino-Russian military cooperation in an effort to understand the factors that either perpetuate or limit the alignment of their strategic competitors. Yet, the perspectives of strategic thinkers from within Russia and China are often missing from the conversation, despite their obvious analytical value. To bridge this gap, CSIS has curated and translated strategically important primary-source materials from China and Russia to ascertain how strategic thinkers in each country expect bilateral military cooperation to develop in the coming years. These documents, which have been analyzed by leading defense and foreign policy specialists in the United States and Europe, contribute to a more complete understanding of China and Russia’s intentions, actions, and capabilities with regard to military cooperation. This knowledge is essential for defense officials and policymakers in Washington, Brussels, and other European capitals to develop realistic forecasts and create more effective plans to manage the implications of the alignment of these two geopolitical actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain a wide-ranging view of how Russian and Chinese thinkers expect the bilateral military relationship to develop, CSIS has selected four areas of cooperation for close examination: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics (such as influence operations). Translations of the Russian- and Chinese-language documents commenting upon cooperation in these areas are published on the website of the CSIS Interpret: China project, an online, interactive digital platform that uses previously untranslated primary source material to drive in-depth discussions and debates on strategic topics relating to U.S.-China relations and the broader topic of China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notable-findings&quot;&gt;Notable Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the four areas of cooperation, Russian and Chinese strategic thinkers recognize the importance of joint activities to advance the shared geopolitical goal of challenging Western hegemony in global affairs. The authors of the source documents cited in this project perceive that the “strategic triangle” their countries form with the United States is out of balance, and the significant advantage enjoyed by the United States and its allies in terms of force, technology, and the ability to set “the rules of the game” through international norms and legal frameworks is the main driver of global instability. Framing competition with the United States in zero-sum terms, the strategic communities in Russia and China suggest that eroding the West’s dominant position is necessary to create a more just and sustainable global order defined by the parity of major powers. In this context, bilateral cooperation is advantageous not only for its practical benefits (e.g., access to advanced technology, capacity development) but also for the signal that it sends to the West: each country is dissatisfied with the status quo and intends to change it. They apparently hope that the United States will eventually heed this message and demonstrate “respect” through self-deterrence (e.g., not responding to provocative messaging or actions by Russia or China in areas where they claim to have privileged interests, and thus gradually ceding their self-declared spheres of influence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the Russian and Chinese authors highlight the importance of using military cooperation to improve mutual trust and, by extension, strengthen the underpinnings of the Sino-Russian alignment. They also share an awareness of inequality within the relationship, with China continuing to develop its defense industrial capacity, advanced technological capabilities, and economic base to boost its major power status at a time when Russia is experiencing stagnation and seems headed for a prolonged period of decline. As China continues to develop, it will have less need for the expertise that Russia currently provides, but Russia will continue to require Chinese resources — especially if its diplomatic and economic isolation continues. To Russian and Chinese thinkers, the growing imbalance within the relationship does not necessarily mean cooperation will come to a halt; as long as Russian and Chinese leaders believe that the United States is trying to weaken or contain them as geopolitical competitors, there is something to be gained from further joint activities. Yet, the nature of the relationship is bound to change. Russia seems destined to play a supporting role to China should the “strategic triangle” transform into bipolar confrontation between China and the West — an outcome that some Russian authors struggle to accept. However, considering the key trends unique to each of the four aforementioned aspects of military cooperation, it would be premature to relegate Russia to “junior partner” status too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arms sales and technology transfers:&lt;/strong&gt; Both strategic communities recognize that the advancement of China’s defense industry has reduced the need to import military equipment from Russia, and accordingly, the commercial importance of arms sales has waned. As Chinese production capabilities catch up with Russia in certain areas and exceed it in others, what used to be a one-sided relationship is now on roughly equal footing. Although historical cases of Chinese reverse engineering and intellectual property theft — along with China’s potential to challenge Russia for primacy on the global arms market — have contributed to mistrust, each state desires greater access to technology to compete more effectively with the West. As such, strategic thinkers expect cooperation to continue and even deepen in the coming years as the two countries engage in the joint development of advanced systems (e.g., missile defense). The relatively equal standing of Russia and China in the field of arms sales and technology transfers — celebrated by Chinese thinkers in particular — may be fleeting, however, as both communities recognize that China is unlikely to share its most advanced technologies with Russia once it outpaces its former patron.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; The pace and complexity of joint exercises has increased steadily over the past decade, and both strategic communities expect Russia and China to maintain robust cooperation in this sphere. This is primarily driven by the need to send a message to the West about the growing military strength of their partnership. Strategic thinkers in both countries see military exercises as being particularly important for deterrence signaling in the Asia-Pacific region, where intensified strategic competition with Western powers appears inevitable. There is a shared recognition that military exercises are critical to trust building, as the two militaries become more familiar with the strengths, weaknesses, and capacities of the other’s equipment. Russian authors tend to be more sanguine about the practical military benefits of these exercises, claiming, for example, that they have resulted in the increased interoperability of forces but offering little evidence to back their claims. While their assessments may have shifted since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chinese writers recognize that they have much to learn from the Russian military, which has more recent experience conducting large-scale warfare, confronting adversaries trained by the West and equipped with Western arms, and competing with the United States in general.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and cyber:&lt;/strong&gt; Open-source materials analyzing Russian and Chinese space cooperation tend to concentrate on two areas of activity: technical cooperation and diplomacy. The recent growth of China’s domestic space industry and healthy levels of funding for research suggest that Beijing is rapidly heading toward self-sufficiency when it comes to conducting space missions. Meanwhile, Russia’s status as a space-faring nation, recognized by Russian and Chinese authors as central to its sense of national pride, appears tenuous due to shrinking budgets, restrictions on imports, and aging equipment and personnel. The ambition of some technical cooperation programs, including plans to build a lunar research station together, appear out of sync with Russia’s ability to deliver, and it may only be a matter of time before Russia’s fears of being left behind in the space race are realized. Nonetheless, according to the authors of the source materials, there are still areas where Russia and China stand to benefit from cooperation, including diplomatic efforts to counter what they perceive as U.S. attempts to militarize space. (The potential for jointly developing counter-space capabilities is largely unexplored, despite comments by some authors that the West was triggering an arms race in space.) Chinese and Russian authors also appreciate the importance of developing alternatives to the West’s attempts to set rules in international fora on activities in space, seeing this as an imperative to retain sovereignty. They apply similar logic to cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; In stark contrast to Western perceptions, strategic thinkers in both countries believe that the concept of hybrid warfare originated in the United States as a means to undermine U.S. competitors. As such, experts from both China and Russia believe they must learn from the West and develop appropriate countermeasures to defend themselves against this threat. This defensive framing portends growing cooperation between Russia and China, but it is unclear whether the strategic communities of these countries have developed a shared language that would guide their response to the perceived maliciousness of the West. Chinese thinkers surveyed in this report distinguish between hybrid warfare, which attempts to create controlled chaos on the periphery of great powers as a means to balance their influence, and gray zone competition, which establishes narratives to justify the pursuit of certain aims. Understanding how to apply these distinct but complementary approaches is critical to the survival of rising powers in competition with the West. Russian scholars, meanwhile, emphasize the need to prepare the country for “mental war” — a form of total war in which states aim to destroy the foundation of each other’s strategic cultures. In this respect, protecting one’s information space becomes paramount; otherwise, states risk the erosion of the “core idea” underpinning their civilization. With regard to cooperation, strategic thinkers in Russia and China see regional organizations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping as a possible way to coordinate mutual activities to defend against Western hybrid aggression. They also focus on developing stronger information security measures and piloting new frameworks for cyberspace governance in hopes of mitigating the West’s perceived advantage in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the source material for this report was gathered prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — a transformative and disruptive event that challenges many of the key assumptions laid out in the texts. In the following chapters, Western authors reviewing these source materials recognize the potential for the war to cause both positive and negative changes to the course to cooperation. Writing about military exercises, one expert noted that the Russian and Chinese strategic communities “made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory” and cautioned that continuity is not a given. This warning could well apply to cooperation in other spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine poses contradictory implications for the course of Sino-Russian alignment. Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield — particularly in the early days of the invasion — has raised questions about the quality of Russian military technology and the Kremlin’s ability to pursue its strategic aims effectively. Due to wide-ranging Western sanctions, Russia is cut off from critical supply chains and funding sources, and it is ostracized in certain international fora. These factors could lead Beijing to reassess the nature of its ties with Russia. On the other hand, Russia’s experience in attempting to counter and overcome these impacts could prove valuable to Beijing as it girds itself for increased confrontation with the West in the Asia-Pacific region. In this case, the war in Ukraine could contribute to deeper cooperation between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may sustain reputational damage from partnering with Moscow at a time when Russia has trampled upon international norms and principles, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in the affairs of foreign states. However, the overall contours of strategic competition with the West as part of a “strategic triangle” have not changed, and Beijing may find itself in a stronger position to set the terms of the relationship to a partner with few other friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, when relations with the West deteriorated significantly due to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its undeclared proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Russia accelerated its pivot to Asia. This pivot affected all areas of Sino-Russian bilateral cooperation, but it was particularly noticeable in the arms trade, where a softening of Russian export restrictions allowed for a revitalization of military-technological cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, only weeks before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian and Chinese presidents stated that their relationship had never been better and that it knew “no limits.” Despite this proclamation, members of the Russian security community are much more modest in their assessments of the partnership than their leaders, usually describing it as an “armed friendship” or a “partnership with limitations.” The dominant view among Russian military experts is that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation is mainly military-political in character, motivated by the countries’ common opposition to what they perceive as the United States’ global hegemony. Mutual distrust and diverging local and regional interests make it seem less likely that China and Russia’s military-technological cooperation will turn into an alliance any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sino-russian-military-cooperation-past-and-present&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian Military Cooperation: Past and Present&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts consider arms trade the cornerstone of modern Sino-Russian security cooperation. When China was banned from importing Western military equipment after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Russia became the country’s main source for advanced equipment. During the 1990s, China imported approximately 30 percent of all Russian arms exports, illustrated in Figure 1. At the same time, the Russian defense budget deteriorated in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, and the Russian defense industry became dependent upon export earnings for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ejVr2pI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

Source: Data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in the mid-2000s, Chinese interest in Russian military technology fell as its own defense industrial capabilities rose. The rapid advancement of China’s domestic arms industry in recent years has narrowed bilateral cooperation on arms sales to the extent that China is now only interested in cooperating with Russia in the fields where Russia retains advantages and can offer world-leading technology. A countervailing influence on the relationship is that Russia has tended to refrain from exporting its most advanced military technology. For many years, security concerns led Russia to adopt a more restrictive export policy toward China than toward its other major military-technological partner, India. However, a shift in Russia’s policy was observed in 2015 when Russia agreed to sell China some of its most advanced military equipment, namely the Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 air defense systems. Since 2015, China has purchased more newly developed equipment than any other importer of Russian arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts attribute the change in policy partly to the increased technological capabilities of the Chinese defense industry — which has made Beijing disinclined to purchase Russia’s second-best equipment — and partly to Russia’s weakened trade position following the fallout with the West. They assess that refusing to share technology with China will protect the Russian defense industry’s market position only in the short run. As Figure 2 shows, China has spent more than Russia on defense for more than 20 years. China is already ahead of Russia when it comes to fourth-generation technologies, electronics, composites, advanced materials, and shipbuilding. It is likely only a matter of time before China also catches up with Russia in the fields of air defense and aviation engine technologies. One Russian military expert considers it possible that the Chinese defense industry may start serial production of fifth-generation fighters before Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nyvFWZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the shift in policy, China’s share of Russian exported capabilities has increased, as illustrated in Figure 1. It should be noted, however, that the “amount of capabilities” does not reflect financial value, and the delivery years may be imprecise. This can be discerned by comparing capability exports with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) financial value of arms transfers database, which shows that the value of Russian arms exports was stable in 2012–2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has once again become an important market for Russian arms exports, the arms trade with China is no longer important to Russia for economic reasons, as the structure of Sino-Russian trade has changed over the last decades. Machinery and equipment, which made up a third of Russia’s exports to China in the 1990s, has fallen to the low single digits, while the share of hydrocarbons has significantly increased. Nevertheless, exports may still be important for companies within the Russian defense industry, if it allows them to maintain a wide spectrum of production lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospects-for-future-cooperation&quot;&gt;Prospects for Future Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world. Since the relationship is based on mutualism, rather than ideology, future cooperation depends on the extent to which each of the parties can offer something that allows the other to achieve its objectives. The Chinese defense industry has not yet caught up with Russian producers of air defense systems, radar equipment, submarine technology, and aircraft engines. China is therefore likely to remain interested in cooperation with Russia in these fields. China has also shown interest in the new Russian Burak-M buoy for submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia is becoming increasingly interested in Chinese technology. Limitations on the import of Western components have led to delays in the development of many of the new generation Russian weapon systems, including the upgraded fourth-generation fighter MiG-35, the fifth-generation fighter Sukhoi Su-57, and the main battle tank T-14 Armata. In addition to establishing import substitution programs, Russia most likely will seek to replace some Western technological components with Chinese equivalents. The Russian strategic community sees prospects for further cooperation particularly in the field of automated control systems and robotics. Russia has also imported unpiloted aerial vehicles, Haval off-road vehicles, and naval diesel engines from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Russia and China have shown an interest in cooperating on the development of strategic armaments, including joint work on China’s new missile launch detection system. The system, which is based on Russian Tundra satellites and Voronezh ground-based radar stations, was reported to be close to completion in 2020. Since both Russian and Chinese strategic capabilities are intended mainly to deter the United States and its allies, the Russian strategic community sees cooperation in this field as financially and technologically beneficial, while posing minimal national security risks. As for now, Russian and Chinese missile defense capabilities are not integrated, but Vassily Kashin, a Russian expert on China’s military-industrial complex, believes integration is a possible next step. Integration would be mutually beneficial, he argues, since it gives both countries a longer warning time in the event of a ballistic missile launch by the United States. Other possible strategic cooperation projects include hypersonic technology and the construction of nuclear submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-trust-still-limits-technological-transfers&quot;&gt;Lack of Trust Still Limits Technological Transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite political assurances of a partnership that knows no limits, the Russian strategic community assesses that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation continues to suffer from a lack of trust. Although the Russian strategic community has generally been open to the possibility of exporting military hardware to China, budding cooperation on arms sales has introduced significant security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, conservative members of the security community have raised fears that China would seek to expand into Russian territory or its areas of interest and that access to Russian weapons would help it achieve this goal. Although the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Russia’s Far East is currently considered far less likely than it was 15 years ago, new concerns have emerged in recent years about China’s interests in the Arctic and its military presence in Central Asia. Some Russian military experts also worry that China could exploit bilateral military-technological cooperation to contain Russia in the case of a future clash of interests in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some experts and officials are concerned that China could outperform Russia in the global arms trade by exporting copied matériel at a lower cost to markets traditionally served by Russia. Within the Russian strategic community, China is perceived as highly competitive, using its economic advantage to gain access to Russia’s most advanced technology while protecting its own. In September 2020, editors of the industry’s leading newspaper, Military-Industrial Courier, warned that the arms trade with China was unlikely to result in Russia gaining new technological know-how, yet Russian arms producers would be pressured to give away their own expertise. They further cautioned that, by pursuing a policy of replacing Western components in its weapons with Chinese parts, Russia is merely transferring its dependency on one foreign power to another. In the editors’ view, Russia would be better served by developing its own defense industry than by seeking closer cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter assessments reflect the ambivalent attitude of Russian experts regarding the increased capability of the Chinese defense industry. On one hand, Russian experts are generally impressed with China’s achievements and frequently credit Russia for the quick modernization of the Chinese military. According to one assessment, it was due to Russian assistance that the Chinese military machine “made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas.” On the other hand, Russian experts claim that China’s modern fighter planes are the result of reverse engineering of Russia’s Su-27. The Sukhoi case and other perceived Chinese infringements of intellectual property rights have fostered a deep mistrust of China among members of the Russian strategic community and have led to predictions of new infringements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-operations-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO Operations and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s rationale for enhancing military-technological cooperation with China in the 1990s and 2000s was the need for income, it has now evolved to include access to technology. Collaboration gives the two partners access to technology that they would not get independently. China’s imports of the S-400 air defense system and Su-35S fighter could give it an advantage in controlling the airspace above Taiwan. A technologically advanced People’s Liberation Army could pose military challenges for the United States in the Pacific region, forcing Washington to turn its focus more firmly toward Asia while leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with the primary responsibility of protecting Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from 2015, bilateral cooperation was also expanded to include joint military exercises. In recent years, China has participated in Russia’s strategic exercises, and the countries have carried out joint naval maneuvers in the East and South China Seas, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Baltic Sea, as well as joint air patrols over the Sea of Japan. As a result, the two militaries have become more compatible and synchronized in weapon systems as well as in communications, tactics, and military doctrine. As pointed out above, the Russian strategic community nevertheless assesses that the military significance of Sino-Russian military cooperation should not be overestimated. Critical voices have argued that bilateral military ties are less deep and comprehensive than Sino-Pakistani cooperation, for instance, noting the limited scale of Sino-Russian joint exercises, the lack of joint programs for equipment repair, and the small number of joint technology development projects. While the possible integration of Russian and Chinese early warning systems could strengthen each country’s deterrence capabilities, Dmitri Trenin points out that the system itself poses a limited threat to transatlantic security and could actually improve global strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian cooperation also limits the impact of Western sanctions on the Russian arms industry and ensures Russia’s access to technologies that it is no longer able to obtain from the West. For example, imports of Chinese electronic components and engines make it possible for Russia to complete designs that it lacks the inputs or ability to produce itself. Few, if any, nations other than China have sufficient economic leverage to deter Western economic statecraft, which means that Beijing is unlikely to abandon its arms trade with Russia in the near term. However, the disruptive potential of Western sanctions on Russia’s arms industry should not be underestimated. In 2017, the United States imposed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which states that any country that has significant transactions with Iran, North Korea, or Russia could be sanctioned by the United States. This has hindered some countries’ willingness to trade arms with Russia. Since the law took effect, Egypt, Indonesia, and Algeria withdrew from plans to buy the Su-35S fighter jet. The tense political climate following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may further dampen the enthusiasm of potential buyers who are averse to testing the willingness of the United States to enforce secondary sanctions. In March 2022, for example, India canceled its orders of MiG-29 aircraft, helicopters, and anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Russia, while a partnership with China might extend a lifeline to its defense industry, it is unlikely to revitalize it, as Russian strategic thinkers doubt that China would find it beneficial to share its most advanced technology with Russia. It also remains unclear whether the relationship is strong enough to overcome the dramatic measures imposed on Russia since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. New sanctions imposed by the West are much more severe than the previous iterations, and large reductions of EU imports of Russian gas and oil will have consequences for Russian GDP and public income. Consequently, the Russian state and its defense industry may become even more dependent upon China for their future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community assesses that China is a prudent partner, pursuing its own foreign policy interests that only partly coincide with Russia’s. The limits to their partnership are evident in terms of the two countries’ relations with Ukraine. Russian experts on China acknowledge that China has interests on both sides of the war. As one scholar summarizes: “China supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine, calls on the parties to conclude peace as soon as possible, does not plan to sever economic and political ties with neither Western countries nor Ukraine, but is also sharing Russia’s concerns about NATO expansion and will not join the sanctions against Moscow.” While some Russian experts assume that China will support the Russian economy in practice if not in words, others assess that China will try to use the situation to strengthen its economic presence in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian experts generally approve of Russia’s “pivot to China,” they admit that China is economically stronger and that Russia falls under a certain dependence. As long as China has stronger economic muscles and continues to close the gap in military technology, it will be much more likely for Russia to have to adapt to Chinese foreign policy goals than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian relationship has grown increasingly close in recent years, though it still falls short of a formal alliance. In addition to military-political and military-operational cooperation, bilateral cooperation on military technology through arms sales and limited joint development projects has increased as China’s defense technological and industrial bases have modernized. The partnership, according to Chinese analysts, has moved from one in which China imported Russian weapons and platforms to one that is of greater equality between the two countries. While Chinese analysts point to like-minded geopolitical justifications for heightened cooperation in areas of military technology, they also acknowledge ongoing tensions and a lack of trust between the two countries that will prevent further deepening of the relationship. The bilateral military-technical cooperation between China and Russia should be of concern for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO). China’s policy of military-civil fusion gives it access to industrial secrets and technological innovation from national economies within the NATO alliance through illicit means — such as industrial espionage — as well as through legal means, such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, foreign direct investment, and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) collaboration. This information could potentially be shared with Russia, with Russia also reciprocating. However, persistent political distrust between Russia and China could mean that each country will continue to reserve its most strategic capabilities, as well as information gained from sensitive espionage efforts, for national use only. Further research should be directed at whether this may change depending on how the Russian economy fares following the sanctions imposed on it as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-of-the-deepening-sino-russian-political-and-military-relationship&quot;&gt;Context of the Deepening Sino-Russian Political and Military Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepening Sino-Russian ties in the area of arms sales and technology transfers fall within the wider context of an overall deepening bilateral relationship between the two countries. On February 4, 2022, Russia and China publicized a joint statement on their common positions with regards to the world order and their “limitless” bilateral strategic partnership. The statement seems to have marked the formalization of a new phase in their relationship, though many of the points covered in the document were already present in their existing bilateral relationship. Even following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated that “China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era.” According to some Chinese academics, the bilateral relationship has turned a corner; whereas China was once heavily dependent on the Soviet Union, it has gradually developed a partnership of relative equals with the Russian Federation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The relationship has moved from a period in which the two sides recognized each other as friendly countries in the early 1990s to a comprehensive strategic partnership in the second decade of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese views of the Sino-Russian partnership are often also framed within the larger context of common strategic interests and competition with the United States. Hou Aijun from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for example, states that since the 1990s, both China and Russia have acted as stabilizing forces and geopolitical balancing factors in a world order that is unjust and excludes the Global South, and which is “constantly eroded and destroyed” by a revisionist United States seeking to stave off its inevitable decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strong sentiment of deep partnership between Russia and China, such as that expressed by Hou, Chinese academics acknowledge that the bilateral relationship is not truly “limitless.” Hou, for example, explains that areas of mistrust include border security, differences in each other’s political systems, historical grievances, and China’s economic expansion into Central Asia. Some thinkers, like Zhang Deguang, former secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have highlighted areas of concern about Russia’s future trajectory in international relations, although Zhang was generally optimistic despite Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and technology diplomacy has been a significant part of the bilateral relationship since before the fall of the Soviet Union, and against the backdrop of U.S.-China technological competition, it serves China’s geopolitical goal of becoming a global technological leader. According to Luo Hui, former director of the Innovation Strategy Research Institute of the China Association for Science and Technology, science and technology diplomacy helps advance China’s overall innovation strategy while also fulfilling larger diplomatic goals. However, Chinese thinkers ascribe Russia’s pursuit of technological cooperation to public diplomacy efforts to “increase mutual understanding between people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-views-of-deepening-military-technological-relationship&quot;&gt;Chinese Views of Deepening Military-Technological Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military-technological cooperation between China and Russia also dates back to the Soviet era, starting in the 1950s with secondments of Soviet experts to job placements in China and the signing of cooperation agreements on issues such as nuclear energy and weapons technologies. Although China today no longer relies on Russia as its primary source of military weapons and platforms procurement following China’s advancement in science and technology and the modernization of its own defense technological and industrial base, Chinese academics still point to Russia’s “profound accumulation of basic scientific research” in areas such as materials science, mathematics, physics, aerospace, power efficiency, polar exploration, space science, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Li Shuyin, director and researcher with the European Military Research Office of the Department of Foreign Military Studies at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, Chinese and Russian military-technological cooperation forms part of their “three-in-one” relationship, which also encompasses military-political and military-operational aspects. The military-political relationship is based on regular meetings between heads of state, as well as mechanisms for regular meetings at the defense ministerial level and general staff strategic consultations. The military-operational relationship is founded on regular joint exercises, such as the “Peace Mission” series, which seek to build cooperation and mutual trust between each country’s armed forces. Lastly, arms sales, technology transfers, and (to a lesser extent) R&amp;amp;D collaboration form the “core of China-Russia military cooperation.” This aspect of the relationship has significant historical roots that have shaped modern bilateral ties. China was an important destination for Russian weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as during the Western arms embargo that followed China’s crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Despite the rapid modernization of China’s defense industry, in 2021, the country remained Russia’s second-largest destination for arms exports, following India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military-technological relationship is governed by the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technological Cooperation, which meets yearly and focuses on the procurement of various technologies from each country. In 2015, it was reported the Chinese side was focused on purchases of modern warplanes, ships, and new land equipment, while the Russian side was focused on air and missile defense systems. Chinese arms transfers from Russia also include, in some instances, production licenses, as was considered for the Su aircraft series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These imports have served the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in multiple ways. They are politically symbolic of support in Moscow and Beijing for the deepening bilateral relationship, while also providing opportunities for China’s defense industry to learn about specific aspects of Russian technology to integrate into its own capabilities, such as thrust vector control in Russian aircraft engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical benefit to the PLA from these types of imports should not be underestimated, nor should arms imports be conflated with trust within the relationship, for reasons outlined further below. Similar to the science and technology partnership, Chinese academics characterize the bilateral military-technological relationship as serving national interests and, ultimately, the country’s strategic goals. As Li Shuyin states: “From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially in naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shuyin argues that arms sales have been an important source of funding and foreign currency for the Russian military-industrial complex. Accordingly, as both sides perceive that they are benefiting from their partnership in the field of military-technological cooperation, analysts expect this relationship to continue into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of this cooperation, however, is transforming from one-sided procurement to equal learning. Just as the general science and technological cooperative relationship has moved on from being characterized primarily by China acquiring knowledge from the Soviet Union (and then Russia), so too has the military-technological relationship. Li Shuyin points to the links between Chinese national sentiment and the historical relationship between China and the Soviet Union, stating that the “Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power,” which allowed it to determine the nature and amount of military cooperation with China at any time. China’s economic and technological rise has allowed it to assert its equality within the relationship more confidently and to push back against this perceived Russian chauvinism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the relationship has also evolved as the innovative potential of each defense industrial complex has strengthened. Authors like Li Dapeng, from the Naval Engineering University, already argued in 2015 that “the context of Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation should shift from focusing on procurement of weapons systems, equipment and components to focusing on cooperative R&amp;amp;D and joint manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Chinese analysts also point to obstacles in the deepening of defense technological cooperation between Russia and China. Li Dapeng indirectly references concerns in Russia about Chinese reverse engineering of Russian weapons, stating that “some Chinese-made weapons have similarities with Russian-made weapons in technical genes.” In one relevant case, Moscow suspended the production of the second batch of J-11A/SU-27SK fighters following Beijing’s alleged violation of the coproduction agreement with Russia. Given that Russia is a major player in the global arms trade, China’s relative advantage in terms of manufacturing capacity and production costs could pose problems for Moscow if Beijing ramps up production of its variants of Russia-derived weapons for export. As Li Dapeng notes, Russia’s concern about losing market share as Chinese exports become more cost-effective is a “major obstacle to deepening and expanding Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation.” The modernization of China’s defense industrial base and economic power has afforded Beijing the capacity to manufacture weapons and platforms for export or transfer at subsidized prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, arms sales volumes are likely to decline in the future, as China’s defense industry becomes more capable, efficient, and competitive. China and Russia may continue to cooperate instead on the joint development of emerging and disruptive technologies, or on a missile early warning system — technologies that fit into China’s military modernization goals of catching up and overtaking the United States militarily. However, as a result of the war in Ukraine, Chinese military-technological cooperation with Russia becomes more complicated, as it puts Beijing at risk of being targeted with secondary sanctions. Furthermore, Russia’s tech industry is experiencing brain drain as a result of the invasion, which may complicate the two countries’ cooperation in the field of emerging and disruptive technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Sino-Russian military cooperation is based on mutual self-interest, which includes tilting regional and global balances of strategic power in favor of Moscow and Beijing. While geopolitics will play a major role in the propelling this relationship forward, they also generate certain disruptions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its actions in the early months of the war are exemplary of the potential drawbacks of a “relationship with no limits,” as Beijing has been forced to carefully craft a balanced position to not criticize Russia while also upholding its self-declared principles of non-interference and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the greater political-military relationship, Sino-Russian cooperation is guided primarily by mutual trust, which according to Li Shuyin remains insufficient. Li Shuyin notes that geopolitics contributes to the lack of trust between the two countries, as “some people in China . . . voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc. China and Russia have already moved to cooperate on R&amp;amp;D in areas of emerging technology with defense applications, such as artificial intelligence. The overall alignment of each side’s interests for geopolitical and financial reasons signals that there is little prospect to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow in their effort to deepen defense technological engagement. NATO thus potentially faces an adversary and systemic competitor who can combine significant resources in areas of technological R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of this changing relationship is also cause for concern regarding NATO’s own defense innovation strengths in the future. China’s efforts to integrate foreign innovation into its defense technological and industrial base go beyond the Sino-Russian relationship. Indeed, existing research has shown that Chinese military institutions continue to engage with foreign academic and research institutions to develop sensitive technologies with military applications and to improve the skills of Chinese military researchers in relevant techniques and processes. If Russia and China’s military-technological cooperation deepens in the area of R&amp;amp;D, then NATO ally-originating innovation could also transfer via China to Russia’s military industrial complex, thereby enhancing Russian defense capabilities and weakening the alliance’s technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Chinese analysts have also pointed out, military-technological cooperation within the bilateral Sino-Russian relationship is not without its obstacles. Lack of mutual trust still plagues the relationship; from a Chinese perspective, it prevents further deepening of the existing relationship. It is therefore unclear whether the reported collaboration on R&amp;amp;D for weapons and capabilities will continue to provide significant strategic value to either military in the long term. Lastly, the question of how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will impact Sino-Russian defense technological cooperation remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The View from Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;paul-schwartz&quot;&gt;Paul Schwartz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-Chinese joint military exercises have expanded dramatically since the two countries held their first Peace Mission exercise in 2004, and they are of growing concern in the Western analytical community. This article reviews four recent papers written by Russian military experts which offer fresh insights on these joint exercises from the Russian perspective. The experts agree that Russia-China joint exercises are expanding in scope, scale, and intensity, and they provide new details on just how they are expanding. They highlight recent trends such as the increase in holding larger strategic exercises on each other’s territory, the addition of joint air patrols, and the likelihood of future joint air and naval deployments. They also discuss Russia’s growing interest in using joint exercises to assess Chinese innovations, and (less persuasively) the growing emphasis on interoperability in joint exercises. In the process, the authors offer additional particulars on the expanding scope of joint exercises to include inter alia mountain and winter warfare and combined air-ground assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlight the importance of messaging in joint exercises, which are often designed expressly to demonstrate the two countries’ growing military power and the strength of their strategic partnership. In doing so, the authors seem intent on reinforcing the messaging effect by overstating the psychological impact of joint exercises on the West, thus departing to some extent from objective analysis. The authors also highlight that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence. While they agree that the two countries are not currently in an alliance, they emphasize that military relations have expanded and now exceed the bounds of a “normal” relationship. Collectively, the authors’ views are fairly representative of the Russian security community, although they also offer insights of their own on joint exercises. While the papers are not wholly objective — overstating the importance of interoperability, for example, as well as the potential for joint operations against the West — they offer valuable details on the nature and objectives of joint exercises and on the views (and hopes) of the Russian analytical community regarding their future direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nature-and-trajectory-of-russia-china-joint-military-exercises&quot;&gt;Nature and Trajectory of Russia-China Joint Military Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community has commented extensively on the continuing expansion of Russia-China joint military exercises, which have increased markedly in terms of their scope, scale, and frequency and through the addition of new exercise series. Russian experts tend to view these trends as further evidence of a growing military convergence between the two countries. The Russian authors covered in this paper are no exception, although they each highlight different dimensions to illustrate this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Vinokurov, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and vice president of the League of Military Diplomats, reports that Russia and China held two major joint exercises in just a three-month span in 2019: the first in July followed by the Tsentr strategic exercises in September. He notes that these were viewed as regular, routine events, indicating that joint exercises are growing in both scale and frequency. This is further evidence of what he sees as a general strengthening of connections in the military sphere. Alexander Yermakov, an independent military analyst and member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), likewise highlights the growing frequency of joint exercises, pointing to the recent Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic multi-country exercises held in August 2021 followed just one month later by Peace Mission counterterrorism exercises held in September. Coming in such close proximity, these exercises reflect a deepening of cooperation between the two sides in the sphere of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov notes that joint exercises are increasing not only in frequency but in scale: for instance, Zapad/Interaction-2021 involved 13,000 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops, 200 armored vehicles, 90 artillery pieces, a Russian motorized rifle unit, and more than 100 planes and helicopters. A recent RIA Novosti article on Russia-China military relations adds that joint exercises are now held at sea, on land, and in the air, having expanded to encompass all of the principal military domains. More ominously, this article also notes that recent joint exercises are placing greater emphasis on joint repulsion of enemy attacks, citing the West as the likely target of these efforts. The article then quotes Vasiliy Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, who argues that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech as well. As further evidence, the article points to the recent flurry of joint exercises such as the Vostok-2018 and Tsentr-2019 strategic exercises held in Russia and the Joint Sea naval exercises held in the Baltic and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov and Ruslan Polonchuk, a military expert at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA), both highlight the recent joint air patrols conducted over disputed waters in the East China Sea. They contend that joint air patrols represent an expansion of Russian-Chinese joint exercises to include joint deployments. By joint deployments, they are likely referring to a range of potential activities that the two sides could undertake, including combined air and naval patrols, port visits, search and rescue operations, and other joint peacetime activities. Vinokurov indicates that these are likely to become a routine part of the Russia-China joint exercise program, since they demonstrate the two countries’ readiness for further collaboration in this area. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that joint activities will expand even further to include joint naval “show-the-flag” deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk also highlights the recent expansion of Russia-China joint naval exercises to include new participants — most notably Iran — as another important development. He argues that joint naval maneuvers with Iran demonstrated a growing coordination on joint maritime activities between the three countries with a distinctly anti-American character, coming as they did amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of experts cited above indicate that joint exercises are becoming more important for both China and Russia. Polonchuk notes, for example, that joint exercises have increased in importance over the last several years, while arms sales between the two sides have declined, indicating that joint exercises may eventually become the main line of effort in Russia-China military affairs. The PLA’s willingness to continue joint exercises with Russia despite Covid-19 risks was cited separately as evidence of their growing importance to China. Yeramakov marks the recent trend to appoint high-ranking military commanders to lead joint exercises as further evidence of their increasing importance. As an example, he cites the appointment of Li Zuochen, a member of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Central Military Commission, to command Chinese forces during Zapad/Interaction-2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all agree that the recent expansion of Russia-China joint exercises is contributing to a growing strategic partnership between the two countries, a trend that is likely to continue. The RIA Novosti article views this as part of a larger trend toward increased defense cooperation, which has now reached a “level unprecedented over the past half-century.” It further claims that joint exercises are so ingrained that they have now become a “tradition” — a novel though not unreasonable way of characterizing joint exercises, given their growing scope, scale, and frequency. In any event, all of these factors imply that joint exercises are likely to continue on their current trajectory, with important implications for the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are correct that joint exercises are expanding as the two countries have continued to add new series of exercises. They are also correct in highlighting that joint exercises are increasing in scope, scale, and frequency. The authors go further, offering valuable insights on just how joint exercises are expanding, all of which warrants further attention. For example, Polonchuk could well be correct in projecting an increase in joint deployments, which offer yet another way for the two sides to engage in joint military activities at low cost and to achieve political and military effects, with important implications for Asia-Pacific and transatlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are also quite correct that joint exercises are a critical component of the Russia-China strategic partnership, complementing arms sales, key leader engagements, and defense research and development as the main forms of military cooperation. As joint exercises have developed, each country has become the other’s most important joint exercise partner. Joint exercises in turn reflect a growing convergence at the strategic level, with Moscow and Beijing now aligned on the most important issues facing them in the international arena. This includes a shared desire to limit U.S. power and to usher in a multipolar world order. In the military sphere, this convergence is reflected in their joint opposition to U.S. missile defense, prompt global strike, and the militarization of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this light, joint military exercises are part of a larger combined effort by Russia and China to improve their respective military capabilities and expand their influence, while simultaneously signaling their displeasure with U.S. and Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-objectives-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Military Objectives of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of these four papers also emphasize that military exercises are an effective means to build experience and to promote knowledge transfer. As an example, Vinokurov discusses the recent Tsentr 2019 exercises held in central Russia, where Russian and Chinese bombers practiced joint interdiction of opposing ground forces, exposing the two sides to their respective methods of attack. The RIA Novosti article highlights the use of joint exercises to develop certain specialized capabilities. As examples, it discusses two recent joint exercises in which Russian and Chinese forces practiced winter and alpine combat operations. It then quotes Kashin, who notes that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech, while focusing increasingly on operations of the kind needed to confront an advanced foreign adversary, which he says could only be the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk agrees, even though he asserts that China is benefiting militarily more than Russia from such exercises, a view shared by most Western analysts. He notes, for example, that the Joint Sea naval exercises have been especially important for the PLA Navy, since they are designed to focus more on tasks facing the PRC, while exposing the PLA Navy to the methods used by the more experienced Russian navy. Polonchuk likewise points out that China is using Peace Mission exercises to prepare the PLA for counterterrorist actions in Central Asia, which he notes could be used against the PRC’s indigenous Uighur population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Polonchuk argues that this trend is changing, and that combined military exercises are becoming more balanced, or more “multi-vectored” as he puts it. Whereas before, they were used mainly as a means for the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian military, joint exercises are increasingly benefiting both sides. He notes, for example, that Russian ground forces gained important insights from their exposure to Chinese motorized rifle units during recent joint exercises. Based on this, he advocates for the two to hold additional joint exercises involving motorized rifle units so they can hone their skills in urban combat. He also suggests that Russian forces hold additional joint exercises on Chinese ranges as they did during Zapad/Interaction-2021, both to gain more exposure to the PLA’s new theater command system and to weigh its pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov concurs, claiming that Zapad/Interaction-2021, held in China, “showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations of both nations,” with Russian units exercising for the first time using Chinese systems — especially the PLA’s new wheeled armored vehicle, a system for which there is no current analog in the Russian military. Yermakov notes that “the careful study and use of Chinese technology in maneuvers made up the innovative aspect of this drill.” Moreover, he notes that the study of Chinese experimental weapons by the army was extremely useful and should therefore be continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two papers commented on the growing emphasis on interoperability in recent joint military exercises, a subject that has attracted a good deal of Western attention as well. Kashin contends, for example, that joint exercises are focused increasingly on interoperability, which enhances the potential for joint operations against a major foreign adversary. He provides little support for this claim, however. Yermakov likewise highlights the new levels of military integration achieved during Zapad/Interaction-2021, which he cites as the main innovation of these exercises. Specifically, he notes that the two sides established a joint headquarters, with a unified command and control system to guide operations, which enabled them to carry out coordinated air strikes and joint helicopter-borne assaults. However, Yermakov seems to carry his argument a bit too far by implying that, as a result, Russian-Chinese joint exercises now exhibit a demonstrable level of mutual cooperation comparable to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), although he cites a Chinese source to convey this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts tend to give greater weight to the military benefits of joint PRC exercises than do many Western analysts, who are more prone to believe that such exercises are carried out primarily for their messaging effects, with less emphasis on their military benefits. Western analysts have pointed out, for example, that Russia-China joint exercises have in some cases been carefully scripted, and at times conducted in parallel in what were essentially separate side-by-side exercises. They also tend to believe that the Chinese military benefits more from joint exercises than its Russian counterpart, by allowing the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western analysts also tend to be more skeptical of claims of increased interoperability in Russia-China joint exercises, finding it hard to take them seriously in light of the extremely low likelihood that the two countries would actually engage in joint operations. Such views are reinforced by exaggerated claims such as the one cited by Yermakov, as there is virtually no evidence that Russia and China have anything close to the kind of joint command and control systems and interoperability standards employed by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-and-messaging-effects-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Political and Messaging Effects of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the views of the Russian security community, the authors of the four articles under discussion also recognize that Russia-China joint exercises have an important messaging component, one that benefits both countries by demonstrating the growing military strength of their strategic partnership, even though such messages are not always directed toward the West. The authors stress that achieving strategic and political effects remains an important driver for joint exercises. Polonchuk, for example, notes that the PLA uses joint exercises to demonstrate its growing ability to combat both traditional and nontraditional threats. He also indicates that Peace Mission exercises have had a stabilizing effect on the situation in Central Asia by reassuring the countries in the region of Russian and Chinese support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all tend to agree, however, that one of the primary purposes of joint exercises is to send a message to the West about the growing strength of Russian-Chinese military relations. Polonchuk argues, for example, that holding joint naval drills in locations outside of one or both sides’ traditional operating areas — such as the Baltic Sea, in the case of China — displays the growing military power of the two countries for Western audiences. Likewise, Vinokurov notes that the recent joint air patrols over the East China Sea “elicited an unpleasant reaction from U.S. allies” by demonstrating the growing military collaboration between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concurs, citing joint air patrols as an important tool for achieving long-term political goals in the Asia-Pacific region, although he does not specify what these goals are. The RIA Novosti articles goes even further, arguing that joint exercises are used to convey to potential adversaries the two countries’ growing ability to counter common enemies. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that Moscow and Beijing will continue to pursue one-time events (i.e., joint exercises and deployments) that have strong signaling effects but carry a low probability of causing unwanted escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that the authors often use their own papers as vehicles to reinforce the messaging effects of joint military exercises. To avoid attribution, however, they often use the rhetorical device of citing Western or Chinese sources when discussing the growing threat from Russia-China military relations. Thus, while these papers contain much useful information, they should not be considered wholly objective in their characterization of Sino-Russian joint exercises, which are used to some extent to amplify the signaling effects of the actual joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Vinokurov cites a recent New York Times article to claim indirectly that the “the West . . . is particularly disturbed by the military-technical cooperation (MTC) of Russia and China.” He takes pains to show that the West has good reason to be concerned by discussing the many recent measures taken by Russian and China to strengthen cooperation in the security sphere, including new joint agreements, summit meetings, and of course joint exercises. He concludes by citing U.S. Fleet Admiral Philip S. Davidson — then commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet — who said that Russia continues to be an existential threat to the United States and that by the middle of the next decade the United States could lose its leading edge to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the Russian security community tends to play up the implications of Russia-China joint exercises beyond their actual effects. Russian analysts often suggest by various means that Moscow and Beijing will increase their counterbalancing efforts toward the West should relations between Russia, China, and the West deteriorate further. They also imply that at some point joint exercises could expand to include serious preparations for joint military operations against the West. In the view of most Western analysts, however, such claims tend to lack credibility given the two countries’ demonstrated unwillingness to become entangled in each other’s principal security disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-joint-exercises-for-russia-china-relations&quot;&gt;Implications of Joint Exercises for Russia-China Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian security community tends to agree that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence between Russia and China, which is driven primarily by their increasing confrontation with the West. The authors of these articles likewise acknowledge that joint exercises are contributing to a growing strategic partnership between Russia and China, though none of the authors believe that an outright military alliance is imminent. The four authors differ, however, regarding the degree to which current military relations are already approaching an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concedes that Russian-Chinese military relations cannot be considered a military alliance either in theory or in practice, mainly because an alliance would be counterproductive. Today, for example, the Kremlin is in a position to mediate tensions between China and India, but this would no longer be possible if Russia and China were in a true alliance. Yet, he implies that recent joint naval exercises between Russia, China, and Iran should be considered a show of solidarity amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov asserts that the two countries are far from being involved in a true military alliance, and are not working toward one either, although he offers no explanation for why this is the case. At the same time, he notes correctly that the frequent and complex military drills held by both countries should put to rest recurring claims in the West that conflict between Russia and China is inevitable due to persistent mistrust. Kashin points out that joint exercises have helped to build trust between the two sides, noting for example that Russian and Chinese soldiers and officers have grown well acquainted with each other through recent joint exercises. He adds that this growing awareness of each other’s military capabilities “allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, [and] understand what capabilities they are actually developing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov appears more optimistic about the possibility of alliance. He notes that China and Russia have developed their connections to the level of mutual partnership and strategic cooperation, and that joint military activities now “exceed the bounds of normal military cooperation.”37 This he attributes to the two countries’ deteriorating relations with the United States. He argues, however, that talk of an alliance is premature, mainly because China is not yet ready for one — perhaps implying indirectly that Russia is more open to an alliance, although he falls short of stating this outright. Interestingly, he claims that President Xi himself recently ruled out an alliance with Russia during a speech before the PRC Central Committee. At the same time, Vinokurov claims that the national security of Moscow and Beijing are now understood as a common interest. As a consequence, they can be expected to “react effectively to [counter] new or well-established threats.” Thus, faced with the growing threat from the United States, at some point further military rapprochement if not an outright alliance would become inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RIA Novosti article carries this argument the furthest, implying that the two already have an alliance of sorts. According to this article, “although the countries do not intend in principle to enter into a formal military alliance, it is sometimes referred to as an ‘undeclared’ one.” While conceding that joint exercises are not directed against third countries, at the same time, it discusses Russia and China’s “growing ability to rebuff a common threat,” while contending that the recent increase in joint strategic exercises is intended to work out “the [repulsion] of potential aggression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ views on the potential for an outright military alliance are characteristic of Russian discourse in this area, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West. Thus, talk of an impending or outright military alliance with real mutual defense commitments should be considered mainly as a messaging exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding that these diverging views on the contribution of joint exercises to a growing military partnership between Russia and China are quite typical for both the Russian and Western analytical communities. They reflect ongoing debates within both communities about how best to characterize Russia-China relations and where they are ultimately heading. Despite the increasing levels of defense cooperation between the two countries, military relations still fall well short of an outright alliance. For example, Moscow and Beijing have not agreed to collective defense commitments, and there is little prospect that they will do so. There is likewise little prospect that the two would conduct joint military operations anytime soon, with the possible exception of Central Asia where they could conceivably act jointly to combat an armed terrorist threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, neither country has any desire to become embroiled in key disputes involving the other. Russia has no interest, for example, of becoming embroiled in a future conflict with the United States over Taiwan. China likewise has no desire of being drawn into an armed conflict with the West, for instance over Ukraine. Nor do the two countries rely on each other for extended deterrence, since both are quite capable of deterring attacks on their homelands. Based on this, the likelihood of an alliance remains low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as Vinokurov points out, military relations between Russia and China have grown beyond the “bounds of normal military cooperation,” indicating quite correctly that the two countries have grown much closer both strategically and militarily than is typical of a purely transactional relationship. Instead, military cooperation has broadened and deepened, and has become increasingly become institutionalized as both sides have continued to benefit from joint activities. Military relations are complementary, helping to strengthen the armed forces and defense industries of both countries if often in different ways. This continuing ambiguity has made it difficult for analysts in both Russia and the West to characterize Russia-China military relations and to say definitively where they are heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four articles reviewed in this paper, which are fairly representative of the Russian security community, offer fresh perspectives on Russia-China joint military exercises, even though much of what they say is already familiar to Western scholars. Most Western analysts would agree with the authors that joint exercises between the two countries are expanding. However, their papers offer deeper insights on just how they are expanding and what that portends for the future. Based on their findings, for example, they have argued persuasively that we should expect to see more joint deployments, including joint naval deployments and deployments in the transatlantic region, to highlight the growing reach of Russian and Chinese military power. They have also argued quite plausibly that we can expect joint exercises to become more balanced and more strategic in their focus, including an increase in joint exercises held on Russian and Chinese territory. They also argue quite reasonably that we can expect to see more exercises involving third parties, such as Iran. The recent joint naval exercises involving Russia, China, and South Africa are a good case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ predictions about the future direction of Russia-China joint exercises also seem quite sound, at least based on the conditions in effect when these papers were first written. At the time, joint exercises appeared poised to continue at high levels and to expand even further, and the authors have made good arguments on just how they would do so. The authors have also focused quite appropriately on the importance of messaging in joint exercises to achieve political effects, which will continue to drive and shape joint exercises. Discussions of the military benefits of joint exercises are also quite useful in highlighting aspects of joint exercises that have received less attention in the West, such as the incorporation of aerial interdiction and winter warfare. The authors have also argued persuasively that exercises are becoming more strategic while taking on greater importance for both sides, even though they have tended to overstate the importance of interoperability and the likelihood of joint operations against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the authors made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory. This is no longer a given, however, since the four articles discussed here were all written prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The events in Ukraine have a high likelihood of altering the course of Russia-China joint military exercises, if not necessarily in ways that one might expect. In the short run, Russia is likely to remain too distracted by the Ukraine conflict to sustain joint exercises with China at pre-conflict levels. In addition, the continuing drain on Russian resources, including loss of equipment and personnel, will make it more difficult for Moscow to free up forces to participate in military drills with China, although this will likely impact large-scale joint ground force exercises more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such limitations, given their military and political importance joint exercises are almost certain to continue, although they are likely to be channeled into areas less affected by the Ukraine conflict — such as counterterrorism, joint naval exercises, and table-top exercises. Based on the PRC’s continuing focus on its maritime territorial disputes and its reluctance to become embroiled in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, we could very well see an increase in joint naval exercises and joint air patrols in the Western Pacific. In this regard, the recent joint air patrols held by the two sides in May 2022 over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea are a good indication of the direction future cooperation may take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the impact on joint exercises is more uncertain. It would be easy to conclude that China would have less interest in exercising with a Russian military that has failed to perform that effectively in Ukraine. While this is possible, countervailing factors make this outcome less likely. First, for all its faults, the Russian military has acquired a great deal of hard-earned combat experience in Ukraine, especially in high-end combat operations. Even though Russian forces have suffered a number of major reverses, they have also had notable successes in Ukraine, especially in the south and increasingly in the Donbas region as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Russia’s combat experience in Ukraine especially valuable is the fact that it has been acquired against an adversary that has received extensive training and equipment from the United States and its allies. When added to its recent military experience in Syria, the low-scale war it waged in Ukraine from 2014 until February 2022, and its 2008 campaign in Georgia, Russia will have much to offer China regarding the latest U.S./NATO weapons and tactics. These lessons would be especially valuable for the PRC, a country that has not engaged in serious armed conflict since its 1979 campaign in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are few countries outside of Russia that could serve as an effective partner for China for conducting complex joint military exercises. No other country willing to exercise with China has anywhere near the kinds of military capabilities and experience held by the Russia military. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the very military challenges that Russia has encountered in Ukraine — so clearly linked to the vigorous Western military backing received by Ukraine — represent a common security challenge for both Russia and China. Developing realistic military solutions to counter future direct or proxy confrontations with the West as informed by the Ukraine conflict will provide a strong incentive for Russia and China to maintain or even expand their current level of defense cooperation, with joint exercises likely to play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed a considerable strengthening of relations between China and Russia. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s decision to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin and issue a historic joint statement in February 2022 — just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine — was widely seen as a signal that China is doubling down on the China-Russia relationship. Beijing’s subsequent refusal to criticize Russia’s invasion further solidified this view in the United States and its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military cooperation through joint exercises has been an important driver behind the strengthening of the China-Russia bilateral relationship. Unlike Russian arms sales to China, which have waxed and waned in importance over the years, China-Russia joint military exercises have remained a robust area of military cooperation. Between 2003 and 2021, the two countries participated in over 60 military exercises, including both bilateral and multilateral exercises. The overwhelming majority of these were held since 2013. Early signs indicate that Beijing and Moscow are continuing to prioritize joint exercises, even in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: the two countries participated in a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Western Pacific just three months after the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several different factors drive China’s participation in joint exercises with Russia. First, Chinese strategists consider joint exercises a unique means for the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to gain overseas operational experience. In the early years of China-Russia joint exercises, the PLA focused on learning from the more experienced Russian military, but it has increasingly positioned itself to gain experience as an equal — or even more senior — partner. Second, authoritative Chinese writings make clear that, despite officials’ claims that exercises are not aimed at “third parties,” Beijing considers joint exercises with Russia to be an important tool of deterrence vis-à-vis the United States and its allies and partners. In recent years, the two sides have timed and positioned their exercises in response to specific geopolitical developments to maximize signaling power. Third, exercises provide a means of collectively shaping security dynamics within the region, especially through exercises linked to the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Chinese thinkers specifically see opportunities to use multilateral SCO exercises with Russia to improve China’s image among regional countries and reassure China’s neighbors about Beijing’s willingness to play a supportive role in the region. Finally, Chinese experts repeatedly point out that joint exercises with Russia play an important role in strengthening and sustaining the broader bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines each of these elements, with a focus on analyzing recent texts and statements from authoritative sources and Chinese analysts. It concludes with an examination of broader implications and potential trends that may emerge within China-Russia joint military exercises, especially in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaining-military-experience&quot;&gt;Gaining Military Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, which has not engaged in a large-scale military conflict in more than four decades, military exercises with Russia are a unique opportunity to gain military experience. Science of Military Strategy, an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University, details the benefits of joint exercises to China’s broader military modernization efforts. It notes that, through joint exercises, the PLA “can not only understand the geographical conditions or sea conditions of overseas mission areas, but also accumulate troop training experience, cultivate joint operations awareness, and improve the organization and command capabilities of command agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting joint exercises with Russia enables the PLA to gain experience in operating in areas far beyond China’s borders. In 2015, the two countries participated in joint naval drills in the Mediterranean Sea focused on navigation safety, at-sea replenishment, escort missions, and live fire exercises. China and Russia had previously held naval exercises in the waters of the Pacific but had not ventured as far as the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises also offer the PLA opportunities to gain operational experience in a growing variety of domains. The first several exercises between China and Russia were largely land-based and focused on counterterrorism operations. However, recent years have seen China and Russia significantly widen the aperture of their exercises. The two countries held their first joint naval exercise in 2012 and have conducted several since. In October 2021, China and Russia conducted their first joint naval patrol, which Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy, described as being of “vital importance” for practicing real-world drills. China and Russia also expanded their cooperation into conducting joint aerial patrols over the Western Pacific Ocean. The first of these came in 2019, with three additional patrols in 2020, 2021, and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts do not consider joint exercises to be vanity projects; they describe the exercises as having substantive value. An article in the Chinese military magazine Tanks and Armored Vehicles describes joint exercises with Russia as “highly practical” and featuring “joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities.” Chinese experts also frequently emphasize the benefits that the PLA can reap by learning from the Russian military’s decades of experience competing with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this dynamic is evolving as the PLA’s capabilities grow and as China widens its lead over Russia in terms of overall national power. Instead of focusing on how China can learn from Russia, Chinese commentators now often emphasize that both sides can benefit from military exercises, with Russia learning from operating with China’s more modernized forces. For example, a 2016 commentary notes that the Russian naval fleet is largely comprised of outdated Soviet-era vessels and equipment, while Chinese vessels have largely been built in the twenty-first century. Another Chinese expert argues that Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.” This analysis concludes, “[Chinese] composite battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance,” but it acknowledges Russian BTGs have the advantage of being battle-tested, while Chinese battalions do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, China has begun to flip the status quo by taking on a leading role in exercises while Russia participates from a more junior position. The “Zapad/Interaction-2021” exercise (also known in Chinese as “Western-Joint 2021”) was the first major example of this. Official PLA media described it as the first time that Russian forces participated in exercises held entirely in China and led by the PLA, and that Russian forces used Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and an expert on Russian military issues, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction-2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and an opportunity to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-the-united-states-and-its-allies&quot;&gt;Deterring the United States and Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend in China-Russia joint exercises is an increased willingness to use the exercises in a more provocative manner to signal to third parties. Chinese officials and state-run media sources have frequently asserted that joint exercises with Russia are for bilateral purposes and not aimed at third parties. In the runup to the first China-Russia bilateral exercise, Peace Mission 2005, China’s then-defense minister Cao Gangchuan stated that military cooperation (including joint exercises) “is not targeted at any third party,” and instead it “serves the interest of regional and world peace.” China’s Ministry of National Defense spokesman Wu Qian made very similar statements about a recent May 2022 joint air patrol, emphasizing the patrol “did not target any third party, and has nothing to do with the current international and regional situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, authoritative sources indicate the opposite is true. China’s Science of Military Strategy includes an entire section on the role of military exercises within its chapter on strategic deterrence. The 2020 version of the textbook states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military exercises against specific threats are not only effective methods of military training but also an important way to implement strategic deterrence . . . The exercise not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions and making it difficult to determine whether we are conducting routine training, maintaining close diplomatic relations, or taking the opportunity to move into actual combat operations, thereby causing psychological panic and conduct a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts and commentators also frequently contradict official statements. Qin An, director of the China Institute of Cyberspace Strategy and a frequent commentator on foreign policy issues, notes that large-scale exercises with Russia showcase the countries’ “determination and will” and play a role in deterring adversaries. He specifically highlights the “strategic significance” of the exercises in warning the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals. Amid negotiations over the first China-Russia bilateral exercise (Peace Mission 2005), Beijing sought to hold the exercise in Fujian Province, the closest mainland Chinese province to Taiwan. Russia pushed back in fear of escalation and being pulled into a Taiwan Strait conflict, and the two sides eventually settled on holding exercises in Shandong Province, well to the north of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid growing tensions with the United States and its allies, China and Russia have demonstrated their willingness to use joint exercises in more targeted ways in response to specific geopolitical developments. Just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, a naval military exercise, in the South China Sea. Both countries stated this exercise was not directed at a third country, but the uniqueness of the exercise and its timing were widely seen as a response to the tribunal’s ruling; Joint Sea 2016 remains the only naval exercise the two countries have held in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (Quad) in Tokyo. The patrol — which included four Chinese H-6 bombers, two Russian Tu-95 bombers, and one Russian Il-20 electronic intelligence aircraft — passed through the air defense identification zones of Japan and South Korea, leading both countries to scramble their own planes. Chinese officials maintain this was a regular exercise that has taken place every year since 2019. However, the timing of the patrol, coupled with the fact that all three previous aerial patrols were held in the second half of the year, made it clear the exercises were directed at the Quad summit. The patrol was also the first joint exercise since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and was therefore widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s continued alignment with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shoring-up-regional-stability-and-security&quot;&gt;Shoring Up Regional Stability and Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third major driver for China is a desire to use joint exercises with Russia to shape security dynamics within China and along its periphery. This includes deterring perceived terrorist or separatist threats and reassuring neighboring countries of Chinese and Russian intentions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deterring the United States and its allies, China and Russia both seek to use joint exercises to deter perceived internal and external threats from terrorism and separatism. Beijing and Moscow share similar threat assessments that the United States and its allies aim to encircle and isolate China and Russia and undermine them by provoking “color revolutions.” China is particularly worried about the possibility of instability or separatist activity spilling over from Central and South Asia into its western Xinjiang and Tibet regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SCO is an important part of Beijing’s efforts to counter these perceived threats. China’s Science of Military Strategy predicts that counterterrorism will continually grow in importance for China, and it notes that strengthening SCO-related counterterrorism exercises will be a key factor in responding to the threat. From Beijing’s perspective, large and complex exercises with Russia (and other SCO countries) help to prepare China and partner countries to deal with these issues while also deterring would-be terrorist or separatist groups that might threaten stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, bilateral and multilateral exercises with Russia play a role in shaping perceptions within governments in the region. First and foremost, they aim to help convince neighboring countries that China and Russia have both the capability and the will to address threats to security and stability in the region. Joint exercises simultaneously aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s intentions. China’s Science of Military Strategy emphasizes that China must go to lengths to ensure that it adheres to international laws, norms, and procedures in conducting exercises with regional partners, since doing so increases those countries’ perceptions that China respects them and their interests. In this light, joint exercises are viewed by China as not just a practical means of enhancing operational capabilities but also an important tool for peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supporting-the-broader-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Supporting the Broader China-Russia Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Chinese commentary puts it, joint exercises are “the most sensitive activity two countries can partake in.” Thus, they naturally play an important role in building trust between the Chinese and Russian strategic communities and strengthening the broader China-Russia bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese and Russian leaders have repeatedly stressed that they share a strong relationship, there is nevertheless a considerable amount of distrust between them. In particular, Moscow harbors concerns about Chinese theft of Russian intellectual property (IP) with respect to military technologies and worries that China may ultimately seek to capitalize on its IP thefts to compete with Russia in the global arms market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises can overcome some distrust by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels between the Chinese and Russian military and strategic communities. Recent joint exercises such as Zapad/Interaction-2021 witnessed the two militaries not just jointly conducting exercises but actively collaborating in planning and commanding the exercises. Exercises also afford opportunities for the two countries’ military leaders to meet and publicly demonstrate high-level cooperation. Following major military exercises in 2018, Central Military Commission vice chairman Zhang Youxia and Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu met for talks in Beijing. In a statement following the meeting, Zhang commented that the “China–Russia comprehensive strategic coordination partnership has reached an all-time high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercises also enable China and Russia to increase trust and transparency by demonstrating their military equipment to each other, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of their forces. Several important Chinese platforms participated in the Zapad/Interaction-2021, including the KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones. All in all, official Chinese media note that more than 80 percent of the Chinese equipment used in the exercise was new, giving Russia a close-up look at some of China’s most advanced systems. Russia has taken this a step further by intentionally using certain equipment, such as the advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in exercises with China with the hopes of selling those items to the PLA. In this way, exercises play an important part in building trust and transparency within the broader bilateral relationship, but they also directly facilitate other forms of military-to-military cooperation, such as arms sales and high-level exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that there are limitations at play. One issue is the language barrier that exists between their militaries. Unlike North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, which typically conduct exercises in a shared language (English), China and Russia communicate using their respective languages. The PLA has insisted this is a non-issue and that “soldiers from the two countries could communicate with body language, simple English and even eye contact.” There have also been reports of Chinese officers learning Russian for certain joint military exercises. However, during the Zapad/Interaction-2021 exercises, the two countries used a bilingual command information system to ensure that both sides were able to fully understand commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-and-potential-emerging-trends&quot;&gt;Implications and Potential Emerging Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises remain an important and enduring element of the China-Russia relationship. Analysts of both China and Russia should continue monitoring China-Russia exercises for new and emergent trends. This is especially important in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine — the impacts of which continue to ripple around the world. So far, there is no evidence that the war has had any specific effect on joint exercises. The timing and nature of the May 2022 joint aerial patrol suggest that, for now, the two sides are compartmentalizing the war so as not to disrupt exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, however, that the war could have consequences for China-Russia joint exercises in the medium to long term. The Russian military has performed remarkably poorly in Ukraine — even after revising its initial disastrous approach to focus on more limited aims — and the war has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Beijing assesses Russia’s performance in Ukraine to be bad enough, that could compel China to rethink the educational and training value of joint exercises with Russia. It may even lead China to question the overall value of its strategic ties with Russia. In the long term, a deeply weakened and overstretched Russian military could compound this by lacking the capacity to carry out large-scale exercises with any frequency. In one scenario, this may lead China and Russia to pivot toward narrower, smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling — like the recent aerial patrols. In another scenario, the two sides could continue with their existing pace and scale of exercises, but with China more consistently leading as the senior military partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth noting that China and Russia may face an increasingly competitive environment with respect to military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region as European countries step up their military and security presence there. In 2021, the United Kingdom sent a carrier strike group to the region for the first time since 1997. The deployment saw Royal Navy vessels participating in multilateral exercises in the Philippine Sea, alongside U.S., Japanese, Canadian, Dutch, and New Zealand naval forces. The war in Ukraine could unexpectedly catalyze Europe’s turn to the Asia-Pacific region: when NATO foreign ministers met in April 2022 to address the war in Ukraine, they also voiced calls to counter Russian aggression in the Asia-Pacific by partnering with regional countries on issues including cybersecurity, emerging technologies, and maritime security (among others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased European presence in the region — on top of the already large U.S. and allied presence — would be an unwelcome development for Beijing and Moscow and could ultimately impact China-Russia joint exercises in the area going forward. If exercises become more politically focused and both countries are facing what they view to be a more hostile and competitive environment, it is possible they could ramp up the frequency of exercises to demonstrate their joint resolve and unity in the face of perceived threats — assuming that Russia has the capacity. If both countries continue to deepen their strategic relationship and partnership, they may also be open to engaging in exercises in areas that they may have previously deemed too sensitive, such as those closer to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sino-russian-space-cooperation-and-what-it-means-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian Space Cooperation and What It Means for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late February 2022, during the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian space agency Roscosmos made several announcements that weakened space relations with the United States and European countries. The agency canceled a launch of British commercial satellites unless certain conditions were met, including the UK government’s financial withdrawal from the company. It also announced it was suspending cooperation with European partners in organizing space launches from French Guinea. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the agency, said that the United States could no longer participate in a planned Russian mission to Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by statements from Rogozin and the agency, the rapid deterioration of relations with the West since February 2022 has accelerated a trend of increased Sino-Russian collaboration in space. Instead of partnering with the United States, Rogozin ordered his team to coordinate with Beijing for deep space missions. When discussing sanctions from Western countries that would target supplies of microelectronics necessary for spacecraft, he also emphasized Russia’s relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, this intensifying cooperation poses several challenges. Heightened Russian and Chinese space collaboration could enable U.S. strategic competitors to achieve more capable and integrated space systems and could complicate agreements on space security issues. However, the development is not all negative. Like the United States, China has pursued international space partnerships in recent years. Given Russia’s reduced standing in the world as a result of its war in Ukraine, Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow could make it harder for China to recruit other countries to collaborate. This dynamic could eventually push China away from Russia, opening possibilities for more negotiations on space security issues between Washington and Beijing. In short, the space relationship between Russia and China could take different turns, which could present challenges and opportunities for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-and-chinas-space-collaboration&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Space Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Chinese space collaboration falls into two categories: (1) technology and capability development and (2) space diplomacy. While some of the joint space diplomatic efforts date back at least to the early 2000s, much of the technology and capability development collaboration has been more recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-and-capability-development&quot;&gt;Technology and Capability Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s cooperation on space technology and capabilities has grown partly out of necessity. U.S. and Russian scholars and experts attribute this increasing cooperation, at least in part, to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Prior to that, the United States and Russia had enjoyed an effective and expansive space partnership, highlighted in 1993 when President Bill Clinton invited Russia to join the International Space Station (ISS) program as a full partner. Although the countries remained partners on the ISS after the Crimea invasion, their broader space relationship has suffered. Reduced U.S.-Russian space collaboration created an opening for China, which the United States had excluded from the ISS and from other joint civil space activity. Since 2014, space cooperation between Russia and China has, according to Russian space experts, “further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined.” The technical collaboration has made sense: China has ample resources and has been willing to engage extensively with Russia, and Russia has 70 years of experience and expertise to offer Beijing’s rapidly developing space program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early area for cooperation was on navigation satellites. Both Russia and China have global navigation satellite systems: GLONASS (Russian) and BeiDou (Chinese). In 2014, the two countries established a senior-level committee on “strategic cooperation in satellite navigation.” The committee formed working groups that covered compatibility and interoperability, augmentation and station construction, monitoring and assessment, and joint applications. In 2019, the two countries jointly developed a multi-frequency radio chip designed to support both satellite constellations. In the same year, Russia passed a law establishing cooperation between Russia and China on using GLONASS and BeiDou for peaceful purposes. In 2021, the Russian space agency announced that Russia would start placing GLONASS ground stations in China, while China would start placing BeiDou ground stations in Russia. This cooperation reflects increasing partnership on capabilities that are important for both civil and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where Russia and China have collaborated recently is deep space. In March 2021, the two countries signed a historic agreement to build a base on the moon together. They have also signed agreements to create a joint lunar and deep space data center with hubs in both Russia and China, and they plan to cooperate on each other’s missions to survey the lunar south pole. As some Russian thinkers argue, Russia’s deepening links with China in this area may be driven by a desire to not get left behind technologically as other powers pay closer attention to space beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit for scientific and military purposes. This collaboration is also striking because space exploration has historically been an area in which Russia and the United States have collaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sino-Russian space partnership could also be extending to strategic military capabilities. Both Russian and Chinese outlets have reported that Russia is helping China develop a space-based missile warning system. Currently, only the United States and Russia have space-based missile warning systems, although other countries have expressed interest in developing their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of burgeoning Russian and Chinese space cooperation. In August 2017, Russia and China signed a five-year agreement to continue collaborating in space from 2018 to 2022. In a 2019 meeting on space cooperation, they reaffirmed support for mutual endeavors in remote sensing, rocket engines and launch vehicles, and low-orbit satellite communications systems. The two countries reportedly are nearing another five-year agreement, to be signed in 2023, to outline their commitment to continue working together in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way in which Russia and China have cooperated on space issues is through diplomacy. In 2002, the two countries submitted a joint working paper focused on preventing the deployment of weapons in space to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. The working paper served as the basis for a draft treaty that Russia and China introduced in 2008 called the “Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects,” commonly known as PPWT. In 2014, Russia reintroduced a revised version of PPWT. Due to objections from the United States and other countries, these proposals have not made progress in the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine that PPWT could ever turn into an international agreement. The aim of the proposal is to prohibit weapons from being deployed in space but not to ban weapons that could target objects in space. The treaty would omit any restriction on ground-based anti-satellite weapons, which both Russia and China have tested in the last two decades and which are often characterized as the most likely kinetic threat to space systems. Further, prohibiting weapons in space is difficult to verify because virtually anything in space could be used as a weapon. Space robots can refuel spacecraft to extend a satellite’s life — or tear the solar panels off to kill it. Lasers can provide rapid and secure communications — or destroy sensors and other delicate satellite systems. More generally, given the speeds with which objects travel in space, something as small as five centimeters in diameter could produce an amount of energy comparable to being hit by a bus. Given these limitations, the United States and other countries will likely remain unpersuaded by PPWT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it will likely never become a treaty, PPWT has become a political tool for Russia and China. In 2014, 125 countries voted for PPWT; in contrast, only three countries voted with the United States against it. Both Russia and China point to the proposal as evidence that they support peaceful purposes of outer space in contrast with the United States, which they accuse of “weaponizing” space. They have used the treaty and their rhetoric to deflect from their own activities. After Russia’s anti-satellite weapon test in November 2021, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on the United States to negotiate over PPWT, a document that “Russia and China are proposing to prevent this arms race and which the U.S. cannot accept.” In May 2021, China’s space policies drew criticism because a Chinese rocket body was falling uncontrollably back to Earth, which could have caused damage depending on where it crashed. Asked about the measures China was taking to deal with the falling rocket, a Chinese spokesperson responded: “As a principle, China is committed to the peaceful use of outer space and believes we should conduct international cooperation in this area.” Of course, a commitment to peaceful uses of outer space has little to do with inappropriate disposal of a space launch vehicle that then comes hurtling back to Earth. In both these cases, PPWT and a supposed commitment to peaceful purposes of outer space provided Russia and China a rhetorical means to deflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing Sino-Russian space cooperation has concerning implications for transatlantic security. It means these U.S. competitors are becoming more capable and integrated. It also makes it harder for the United States and its allies to negotiate with either country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear complication for the United States of Sino-Russian space cooperation is that China benefits from Russia’s expertise, and Russia benefits from China’s resources. Another complication is that this technical cooperation could lead to more integrated capabilities that could be used in war. If a war extended to space, both countries could interpret an attack on the same asset as an attack on both countries. Perhaps most worryingly, this integration could also progress to the countries collaborating on counter-space. “Defense planners need to look for indications that suggest Russia and China are moving toward cooperation in the counter-space field out of a growing fear of U.S. dominance in space,” writes Jeffrey Edmonds of the Center for Naval Analyses, warning that joint Russian-Chinese counter-space exercises “should not be discounted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian diplomatic front means that finding compromise may require convincing both countries collectively rather than convincing each one individually. Further, part of why PPWT has generated international support is that both powers have been committed to it, and in turn this international support may make both countries more likely to dismiss alternatives to PPWT — even if those alternatives are in their interest. One such alternative was introduced by the United Kingdom: a 2021 UN resolution to establish an open-ended working group that would “make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by States to space systems.” The resolution passed in a 163-8 vote, with nine abstentions. Those opposed were Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Syria. Given that they are both space powers, Russia and China would benefit from participating in such an effort; it would seem to be in everyone’s interest to consider issues like the types of behaviors that may be perceived as threatening if not accompanied by advance notice and protocols that could be put in place to lessen the likelihood of unintentional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s concerted diplomacy also leads them to defend each other’s worst actions. Russia’s 2021 anti-satellite test is a case in point. The test created thousands of pieces of debris, much of which remains in orbit; the presence of the debris degrades the operating environment for all space actors. Because the United States has the most satellites in orbit, such degradation creates a higher likelihood that one of its assets could be affected. It is also particularly harmful for China, which has the second most satellites in orbit. In fact, in January 2022, a Chinese satellite was reported to have experienced a near miss with a piece of debris created by Russia’s test. But even in this instance, China refrained from publicly blaming its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-dynamic&quot;&gt;Evolving Dynamic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space dynamic between Russia, China, and the United States — which has changed considerably in recent years — could change further because of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine. According to some Russian space experts, Russia’s interest in close collaboration with China on space issues is likely to remain strong. The partnership has brought Russia more resources for space ventures and more support for arms control proposals targeted at the United States. Any rupture in this partnership could undermine Russia’s goal of remaining a leading space nation and weaken its space diplomatic agenda. What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the desire to continue along a course of cooperation with China is driven in part by necessity. Sanctions levied against Russian companies are bound to limit Russia’s capacity to provide commercial space services — which some Russian thinkers considered as a way to sustain Russia’s space program in the long term — and the already low level of state funding for space ventures could attenuate further as Russia’s economy contracts. In this context, funding from China — and to a lesser extent, other countries with nascent space programs — is crucial for Russia to meet its space ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, there is a considerable downside to further integration with Russia’s space efforts. China is actively pursuing space partnerships and wants to be recognized as a world leader in space. It has space research cooperative agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, France, and Malaysia, among other countries. Such partnerships offer important advantages, including being able to spread the cost of operating in space or the cost of developing a capability. Also, in a crisis or war, a country may be less likely to attack a spacecraft that could be owned by or supporting multiple countries than a spacecraft that is owned by and supporting only one country. Because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, countries and companies are severing ties with Russia. As a result, the more China integrates with Russia in space — the more the two countries are perceived as inseparable — the harder it may be for China to recruit new partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, China could follow the precedent set in 2014. When Russia annexed Crimea, China seized the opportunity, establishing more technical cooperation with Russia on space and filling the void left by the United States and others. Because integration with Russia could weaken China’s ability to become a global leader in space, however, China could distance itself from Russia instead. China may not need as much technical assistance as it did in 2014, and Russia’s standing in the world is much lower now than it was then. Along these lines, Todd Harrison, then the director for the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “China seems to be very tactical and pragmatic with the agreements that they make, and I don’t know that Russia has that much to offer anymore, especially after this [invasion of Ukraine]. . . . And there’s a lot of baggage that’s going to come with partnering with Russia from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China did reduce its space cooperation with Russia, that could offer an opportunity for more dialogue with the United States. This is not going to lessen all tensions between the two countries, but it could create some meaningful discussions on space. Newsweek reported in December 2021 that the Biden administration is considering approaching China on bilateral space arms control. Less ambitious measures could be valuable as well. With the amount of activity in space increasing dramatically, the need for mundane principles and rules — along the lines of maritime right-of-way rules — is becoming more important, particularly between the two countries with the most assets in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should pay close attention to the space relationship between Russia and China. A tighter connection will pose considerable challenges, such as potential adversaries developing more sophisticated and integrated systems and maintaining a diplomatic front that impedes efforts to establish norms, rules, and principles on space behavior. A more detached relationship could create auspicious circumstances for bilateral negotiation between China and the United States. The United States would benefit from considering the options and consequences that come with these different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality behind the Speeches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;marc-julienne&quot;&gt;Marc Julienne&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia cooperation in space has been increasing for the past two decades. This cooperation accelerated after the Crimea crisis in 2014 and culminated with the announcement in 2021 of the joint construction of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Yet, behind the hype around the countries’ “rock-solid friendship,” the reality of this bilateral cooperation is more complex. Space cooperation is very strong when it comes to diplomacy, but it has proven to be limited in technical terms. Overall, the ambitious space partnership touted by China and Russia may well be exaggerated, considering three factors: Russian space budgets have been declining for years; the war in Ukraine will most likely undermine Russia’s budget and technical means for space even further; and China and Russia have persisting mistrust that tends to slow down any real, integrated technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly based on Chinese sources, this paper intends to assess the bilateral partnership in space from a Chinese perspective, going through the historical background, the current cooperation programs, and the two countries’ common front in space diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-history-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-space&quot;&gt;The History of China-Russia Cooperation in Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many other domains of the China-Russia bilateral relationship, there are two distinctive phases of cooperation: before and after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade of intense scientific and technical cooperation in the 1950s, all cooperation abruptly ceased as a result of the Sino-Soviet split in 1960. It was not until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that both countries embraced a fresh start. In 1992, they signed the intergovernmental “Agreement about the Cooperation on Research and Peaceful use of Outer Space,” which was followed by a similar protocol signed between the China National Space Agency (CNSA) and the Russian Space Agency (now known as the Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos) in 1994. A cooperation agreement on piloted spaceflight was signed in 1996, just four years after China launched its piloted space program. This represented a much more concrete step compared to the two previous agreements. It allowed China to benefit from Russia’s assistance for the development of its own spacecraft — the Shenzhou — based on the Soyuz design, as well as space suits and training for Chinese taikonauts. This cooperation enabled China to conduct four unmanned flight tests of the Shenzhou spacecraft between 1999 and 2003 and its first manned mission, Shenzhou-5, in October 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of closer cooperation in space continued throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2000, the two countries brought their space dialogue to a more regular basis with the establishment of the China-Russia Space Cooperation Sub-Committee, held during the annual meetings of their prime ministers. In 2007, they signed an agreement on the joint exploration of Mars, with China being a minor contributor. The Russian Fobos-Grunt mission consisted of a sample return from the Martian moon Phobos; it was supposed to carry a Chinese probe (Yinghuo-1) into Mars’s orbit, but it failed shortly after launch in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bilateral cooperation developed effectively from the 1990s to the 2010s, it remained a mostly commercially oriented relationship, wherein Russia sold technology and know-how to China within certain limits. As He Qisong and Ye Nishan from the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai noted in an August 2021 paper, China-Russia space cooperation “lacked depth” before 2014 and did not match the level of the political engagement officially declared by the two sides; it existed merely at a “superficial level” (浅层次).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for limited cooperation at the time was Russia’s lack of will to engage in a close partnership with China. Moscow simply did not want China to progress too quickly and eventually catch up and outperform Russia. Wang Ye and Zhou Yuan, from the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), write that “the Russian government became increasingly cautious about cooperating with China’s space program, mainly for fear of creating a formidable space competitor, and also for the fear of angering the United States, the most important space partner at the time.” A December 2006 public statement by the then-head of Roscosmos, Anatoly Perminov, confirmed this assessment: “Russia will cooperate with China on space projects but will not transfer sensitive technologies that could enable Beijing to become a rival in a future space race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a major turn in Russia’s overall relationship with China. Moscow found itself isolated diplomatically and faced a wave of sanctions from Western countries as well as from Japan, which were directed in part against its space industry. Moscow then turned to Beijing for political and economic support — albeit at the cost of several concessions, like the transfer of technology in sensitive sectors, including weaponry and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China had a significant interest in collaborating more closely with Russia, as the Wolf Amendment passed by the U.S. Congress in 2011 excluded China from any project involving NASA (including the International Space Station), and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) prohibited any export or reexport of U.S. space technology or components to China. As the Russian space industry found itself targeted by sanctions after 2014 and Russia-U.S. space cooperation was drastically undermined, Moscow had an incentive to seek deeper cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contemporary-space-cooperation-great-announcements-but-limited-technical-cooperation&quot;&gt;Contemporary Space Cooperation: Great Announcements but Limited Technical Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Crimea crisis, the two countries pushed forward their cooperation in space in the fields of global navigation satellite systems, lunar exploration, and military space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIDOU-GLONASS SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, Moscow and Beijing established the Russia-China Project Committee on Important Strategic Cooperation in Satellite Navigation, which convenes annually to study the integration potential of BeiDou and GLONASS constellations. The committee is divided into four working groups: compatibility and interoperability, enhanced system and station construction, monitoring and evaluation, and joint application. This led to the signature by Prime Ministers Li Keqiang and Dimitry Medvedev in November 2018 of the Cooperation Agreement on the Peaceful Use of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which aimed to guide joint work on the compatibility (ability to use one system or another) and interoperability (ability to use both systems at the same time, providing better accuracy) of the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, the two countries adopted the “2021–2025 China-Russia Roadmap for Cooperation in Satellite Navigation” to further advance their joint work in this field. According to the road map, each country is expected to deploy BeiDou and GLONASS ground stations in the other country. Roscosmos announced that Russian ground stations would be located in Shanghai, Urumqi (northwestern Xinjiang region), and Changchun (northeastern Jilin Province), while Chinese ground stations would be placed at Obninsk (near Moscow), Irkutsk (Baikal Lake area), and Petropavlovsk-Kamtchatski (Kamchatka Peninsula). A further step toward the integration of Russian and Chinese satellite constellations took place with the signature of the Cooperation Agreement on Time Interoperability of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which occurred on the sidelines of the bilateral summit between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin in Beijing on February 4, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite guiding a range of joint Sino-Russian activities in space, few details are available on the 2021–2025 roadmap. It remains unclear how the two countries will overcome the important technical obstacles to achieve full interoperability between the two constellations. Nevertheless, if successfully achieved, the interoperability between BeiDou and GLONASS would allow better performance and a wider range (GLONASS covering higher northern regions and BeiDou lower southern regions), which could have an effect on each country’s military capabilities, as it would improve missile guidance and positioning for troops, military vehicles, and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOON EXPLORATION: THE ILRS PROJECT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most emblematic aspect of space cooperation between China and Russia is exploration of the moon, under the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. The two countries have discussed the possibility of cooperation in this area for more than 15 years, but it materialized only in March 2021 with the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Construction of the ILRS. The project is highly ambitious, consisting of lunar-orbit and lunar-based facilities for a manned mission, with the first modules to be launched in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the project has attracted significant attention, an analysis of available official documentation on the ILRS reveals certain important inconsistencies. First, the plan provided by the CNSA and Roscosmos to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) in August 2021 schedules five lunar missions (two Chinese, three Russian) by 2025. This sounds rather ambitious, considering the state of Russian space industry and budget — and the fact that Russia’s last moon mission, Luna 24, took place in 1976. Nonetheless, during a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in April 2022, Putin reaffirmed that he would “restore the moon program” and that “by the third quarter [of this year] the Luna-25 mission must be complete” (although it was initially planned for 2016). This may prove to be a challenge for Russia, considering the global geopolitical context and the sanctions against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, according to the plan, the first ILRS module (launched by a Chinese rocket) is expected to land on the moon in the early 2030s. All following modules (ILRS-2 through ILRS-5) will be launched alternatively by Russian and Chinese launchers by 2035. Among these five ILRS missions, the emphasis is put on lunar surface facilities, but little is said about the circumlunar space station, which would be instrumental to developing facilities on the surface of the moon and would need to be constructed in advance of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides claim that they will cooperate on all aspects of the program, including the coordination of scientific and technical research, development, design, modeling, testing, validation, assembly of the ILRS component parts, and the launching and operation of the facilities. However, it remains unclear what specific tasks and technology each side is going to provide or how much funding each side is ready to dedicate. This raises questions about the sustainability of the program if one of the stakeholders is unable to fulfill its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these unresolved issues, in late December 2021, Roscosmos announced that China and Russia would sign in 2022 a new space cooperation program for 2023–2027, which should include further details on the plan to develop the ILRS by 2035. However, the war in Ukraine will most likely impact both the ILRS project schedule and the overall nature of bilateral cooperation in space, at least in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might wonder why China and Russia did not start by cooperating on an Earth orbit joint space laboratory before aiming at the moon. Both countries have experience and ongoing or future projects in this field. Moreover, it could have been a more easily achievable project and could have had a nearer completion date. There are several potential explanations. First, it seems that both China and Russia want to have their own independent space laboratory. Second, China wants to demonstrate that it is capable of building a space station by itself. Third, Russia may also want to maintain a degree of autonomy in space, and this is one of the few areas where it can still do so. Nevertheless, both sides have expressed willingness to cooperate in this field. In June 2021, Dimitry Rogozin revealed that talks with China are ongoing to send Russian cosmonauts onboard the Chinese Tiangong station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHINA-RUSSIA MILITARY COOPERATION IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Beijing claim to be improving their military space cooperation, though it is difficult to assess its depth and nature. One component is the information exchange mechanism provided by the 2009 Agreement on Mutual Notification of Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Vehicle Launches. By preventing miscalculation, this agreement favors mutual trust and security between the two countries. It was extended for 10 years in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia claim to cooperate in two very strategic and sensitive domains: anti-ballistic missiles and early warning systems. During the annual conference of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019, Putin revealed that Russia was helping China to build an early warning ballistic system, which would “fundamentally enhance the defense capability of China.” It is also well known that both militaries conducted joint exercises on computer-simulated ballistic missile interception in 2016, 2017, and 2019. While this is consistent with the fact that Russia has provided China with ballistic missile defense software, it remains uncertain whether Moscow would go as far as to help China develop an early warning satellite constellation or ground-based radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, from where the space dialogue started in the 1990s until today, the discourse and announcements by Russian and Chinese leaders on their flourishing cooperation does not yet match the reality of their technical collaboration, nor does it reflect their ability to commit to their joint programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy-china-russia-alignment-against-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy: China-Russia Alignment against the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to technical and scientific cooperation, space diplomacy is a field where close cooperation between China and Russia has been taking place since the end of the Cold War. Chinese experts on space emphasize this aspect of their cooperation with Russia more than they do the technical side. He and Ye’s August 2021 article, “An analysis of space cooperation between China and Russia,” devotes only 4 of its 24 pages to technical cooperation, while the rest tackles the issues of space diplomacy, space law, and the geopolitics of space. In their view, China-Russia cooperation in space is the result of improving political bilateral relations and, most importantly, changing geopolitical challenges in space, with “the U.S. strategy of space hegemony” at the top of them. The main goal of China and Russia would be to “maintain the multipolarity of space and the overall stability of the China-U.S.-Russia triangular space relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first threat China and Russia want to address is “the weaponization of space and an arms race in outer space.” The two countries blame the United States for a series of actions that they consider undermining security and stability, both in outer space and on Earth. The U.S. withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2001 and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 are cited as examples of such actions. They also condemn Washington for the development of ABM systems and their proliferation, space-based early warning sensors, and space-based missile interceptors, which they characterize as deeply destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Russia and China have been very active within multilateral forums such as the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Conference on Disarmament, and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to promote resolutions and treaties against the weaponization of outer space. The main initiative in this field is the draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT), which was first submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in 2008, where it was blocked by the U.S. delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the UNGA, Russia and China submit annual resolutions on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, the prevention of an arms race in outer space, transparency, and confidence-building measures in outer space, no first placement (NFP) of weapons in outer space, and further practical measures for the prevention of a space arms race. These resolutions are generally adopted with a large majority but are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main point of opposition that Russia and China have against the U.S. role in space is the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources, especially on the moon. They fear that the United States is seeking de facto sovereignty over the moon and other celestial bodies. He and Ye analyze that the U.S. government has adopted a four-step approach to this end. The first step was to grant ownership rights to “nongovernmental” (i.e., commercial) entities to exploit space resources through the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015. The second was to change the legal status of the moon and other celestial bodies through the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2018, which provides that “outer space shall not be considered a global commons.” The third step, according to He and Ye, was President Trump’s executive order on April 6, 2020, that rejected the Moon Agreement of 1979 (which the United States did not sign) as a customary law and confirmed that the United States does not view space as a global commons. The fourth step was the introduction of the bilateral Artemis Accords in 2020, which set a new U.S.-led framework for moon exploration. For He and Ye, these accords “constitute a ‘space version of NATO’ in an attempt to seize lunar sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chinese experts, however, the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources does not seem to be as important as the weaponization of space. In fact, some scholars, including international law professor Ma Chengyuan from China University of Political Science and Law, are rather understanding of the U.S. position, pointing to loopholes in international law on the question of exploitation of extraterrestrial resources. They also acknowledge that formulating a new treaty in the next few years is unrealistic, considering the expected opposition from countries that lack the ability to exploit such resources. This rather soft approach on resource exploitation was also reflected by the lack of any mention of this issue in the China-Russia joint statement of February 4, 2022 — whereas the document devoted two full paragraphs to the prevention of weaponizing outer space. This can be explained by the fact that both China and the United States are well aware that counting on international law is a dead end to legally exploit space resources. In this sense, the U.S. unilateral approach to lunar exploitation is an example that is likely to be replicated by China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;three-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Three Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERSISTING MISTRUST BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind what China presents as a “rock-solid friendship,” it is worth keeping in mind that Sino-Russian relations are not without divergences. The relationship is often described in official discourse as “at its best in history.” However, as Yang Cheng, professor at the Shanghai International Studies University and a specialist on China-Russia relations, notes: “‘the best’ does not mean that there are no flaws in the cooperation.” Considering the rocky history of bilateral ties in the Soviet era, the relationship has indeed improved significantly, but it is still far from an alliance. It is closer to tactical solidarity than mutual trust, and in the field of space, it is closer to a diplomatic alignment than full scientific and technical integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis. He and Ye, for instance, underline that “the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry, and the aging and loss of scientific and technical personnel, including in the space field, have further led to the slow development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and even to difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities. The progress of space projects, especially large-scale ones, is lagging behind expectations, or even seriously behind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, He and Ye note, the number of Russian satellites in orbit has not increased by much in the past few years (about 8 more satellites a year), while the number of U.S. and Chinese satellites has risen drastically (about 266 and 47 more satellites a year, respectively). Li Ziguo and Li Yan, both researchers at the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), also note that “according to the Global Innovation Index reports released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in recent years, China’s world ranking has continued to rise, from 29th in 2015 to 14th in 2020,” while Russia had been hovering at the 45th place between 2015 and 2019 before downgrading to 47th out of 131 countries in 2020. However, they lucidly recognize Russian excellence in basic science (six Fields Medals and five Nobel Prizes in Physics since 1991), and consider that, with limited access to Western technologies, “deepening the scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries is an inevitable choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this feeling of superiority, China also has doubts about its Russian partner. One major doubt is about Moscow’s will and means to fulfill its commitments with China. Chinese experts note that since Russia is unable to implement its own national space program, cooperative projects with China are all the more uncertain. Beijing is also aware that its space partnership with Russia depends on the state of the cooperation between Moscow and Washington; any improvement in Russia’s cooperation with Washington would mean a distancing from Beijing. Finally, Russia also cooperates with India in space. Indeed, as an emerging space power, India is very interested in Russia’s know-how, and it is an attractive partner for Russia in turn. As illustrated by the December 2021 joint statement by Putin and Narendra Modi, the two sides have committed to cooperate in human spaceflight and satellite navigation, which may represent a source of concern for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE IMPACT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2014 Crimea crisis accelerated overall cooperation between China and Russia — including in space — one may wonder about the potential consequences of the war in Ukraine for the future of the bilateral partnership. Will it open a new phase of deepening cooperation, or will it slow it down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Russia will become even more dependent on China if it wants to stay in the space race, and China will have another useful lever to impose on the orientations and the scope of the partnership. Despite the Chinese narrative of “win-win cooperation” in space, and despite the fact that Chinese experts present bilateral cooperation as “highly complementary,” one should expect that Russian cooperation with China will mostly fuel the latter’s space program and ambitions, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the war in Ukraine may also put a stop to China-Russia cooperation in space, and to the ILRS project more specifically. Russia’s space industry was already in a dire situation before the war, and now it is in a critical position after new waves of sanctions and being cut off from cooperation with Western space powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE NEED FOR MULTILATERALISM AND STRONGER WESTERN ALTERNATIVES IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian rapprochement in space geopolitics has taken advantage of the vacuum left by the United States and other space powers in international forums. While the joint PPWT proposal is far from acceptable due to its many loopholes (e.g., the lack of definition of a weapon in outer space, the exclusion of ground-based anti-space weapons, and the absence of a control mechanism), no alternative was offered by Western countries to develop an international legislative framework to address the weaponization of space. The sole exception is the European Union International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, which was submitted in 2010 but remains in limbo today. The lack of counterproposal to the PPWT fuels Moscow and Beijing’s narrative of the United States’ unilateral weaponization of outer space — a view that is widely supported at the UNGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the United States is indeed taking a unilateral path — by adopting federal laws on celestial bodies. This approach undermines international law and multilateralism. Denying space as a global commons, in a time when the importance of protecting the environment — including in outer space — is matter of survival, is a dangerously anachronistic approach. This perspective encourages the perception of outer space as a “new frontier” to conquer and colonize, which legitimizes the unregulated space race. It harms multilateralism and threatens the preservation of peace and stability in outer space and on Earth. To meet the challenges brought by the Sino-Russian rapprochement in space affairs, an approach that emphasizes more transatlantic coordination and multilateralism is far more likely to succeed than the current unilateral framework embraced by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “global hybrid war” is a vision of future global war led by the United States and its allies primarily against Russia, but in a later phase also targeting China. As defined by Alexandr Bartosh, a corresponding member of the Academy of Military Science and the most visible advocate of the hybrid war concept in Russia, the global hybrid war is a protracted, multilevel military conflict between civilizations. The term “hybrid” refers to the simultaneous and coordinated use of military and non-military (e.g., economic, financial, technological, or informational) means of warfare. In general, this type of war is about control of natural resources, spheres of political influence, and competition over technological leadership in the greater Eurasian region, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In a narrower sense, argues Bartosh, the global hybrid war aims to achieve the “liquidation of the Russian statehood, its disintegration and external control of the country.” In his view, the next targets after Russia will be China and India, the two geopolitical contenders that would remain on the sidelines of the conflict between Russia and the West. Bartosh argues that “Russia and its allies should carefully study global hybrid warfare and develop corresponding offensive and defensive strategies in the interests of ensuring national and international security.” But what does this suggestion for closer cooperation in the hybrid sphere mean in practical terms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of questions explored in this article considers China’s role in this arrangement. For example, if the global hybrid war is ultimately a conflict between civilizations, as Bartosh suggests, does this imply a potential conflict between Russia and China as well? Or is this difficult question omitted, and cooperation is legitimized on the basis of traditional great power interests? Recently, Russian scholars have put an emphasis on “mental war” fought against “real” sovereign states, but what role do alliances play in counteracting this type of aggression? Is Russia alone in this struggle, or could China play a role in helping Russia to defend its culture, values, and traditions? An analysis of the material reveals that cooperation with China is framed positively, yet vaguely, leaving many questions still open. Before turning to a more detailed analysis of Sino-Russian cooperation in this area, it is necessary to explore the concept of global hybrid warfare and its place in Russia’s strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hybrid-war-as-a-code-word-for-the-kremlins-worldview&quot;&gt;The Hybrid War as a Code Word for the Kremlin’s Worldview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing transformation of Russia’s political environment toward a more authoritarian — even totalitarian — system, it is possible to argue that the concept of global hybrid war has evolved into a “floating signifier” similar to the concept of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet period. In his work on the history of Soviet cybernetics, Slava Gerovitch shows how Soviet science was flooded with these code words — a kind of newspeak that “blended description with evaluation,” where the meaning of each code word could “shift and change according to context and usage.” However, code words did not acquire their meaning at random; Soviet ideological language had a specific structure whereby certain phenomena or actions were assigned a strong positive or negative value. Cultural theorist Mikhail Epstein conceptualized such words as ideologemes (i.e., a fundamental unit of ideology) that “were not simply words, but concealed judgements that take the form of words.” The Soviet ideological language consisted of three different types of ideologemes (contrastive, conversive, and correlative pairs of words) that, taken together, formed a model of “Soviet Marxist ideolanguage.” The essence of the ideological language, as Epstein shows, was not to exchange information, but to control thinking and action in the Soviet politics. The Soviet regime not only defined the correct use of ideolanguage but also played it against all opponents, and thus acquired full control of the political space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis developed here is that the concept of hybrid war — and other code words related to it — is used like Soviet-era ideologemes to shape perceptions about external and internal threats toward Russia. In this context, it is possible to identify pairs of words that carry positive meaning (denoting what Russia does) and negative meaning (actions by the West).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Hybrid war&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Soviet ideological language, the meaning of these contemporary word pairs is based not on a specific school of thought but on a combination of political realism (great powers have a right to rule over others), strategic culture (Russia’s imperial legacy and self-perception of exceptionalism), and what one influential analyst deemed the “Barbarossa mentality” (Russia’s traditional fear of encirclement and expectation of decisive surprise attack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power. It considers Russia’s internal political and economic weaknesses and the assumption that foreign powers are building their capabilities to further weaken Russia. This seems counterintuitive, taking into account Russia’s attempted and successful jailing, repressions, and assassinations of dissenters and its hostile operations against foreign countries. However, in the Russian view, these operations (if they are acknowledged at all) are part of the country’s “active defense” against attempts by foreign powers to subjugate Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-role-of-china-in-global-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;What Is the Role of China in Global Hybrid Warfare?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already indicated, the Russian debate on hybrid war operationalizes the sovereignty-versus-subordination dichotomy and places it in the context of global competition between the United States, China, and Russia. In an article published in 2017, Bartosh underlines how the scale of hybrid warfare encompasses not just particular countries but the entire system of international security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The growing scale of hybrid warfare waged against Russia makes this type of interstate geopolitical confrontation one of the most acute threats to national and international security. Moreover, the use of a complex of hybrid threats as an instrument of external pressure to create instability within the state is no longer just a threat to national security but a powerful destabilizing factor for the entire system of international security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In articles written after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Bartosh argues that “hybrid war is evolving into a ‘multi-dimensional inter-civilizational military conflict,’” which he calls the “global hybrid war.” Here, Bartosh draws from Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” argumentation when he asserts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;modern conflicts are moving from the classical linear paradigm to a new type of non-linear wars. The highest form of modern war is “the war of civilizations, that is, the war of the meanings of their existence.” The winner in the war of meanings does not win space or even the right to dispose of the resources of the defeated state, but wins the right to determine its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Bartosh echoes Russian official parlance that distinguishes between states with “real” sovereignty and states that are only “formally” sovereign — meaning that, in reality, they are proxies of a hegemonic power. Currently, the Kremlin uses this dichotomy primarily to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty (representing the country as a U.S. proxy). However, it also reveals an important aspect of the Kremlin worldview, according to which only the strong (“real”) states survive. Given Russia’s inherent political instability (e.g., the problem of succession), the Kremlin cannot attain the level of security it expects from “real sovereign” countries. This feeling of weakness might explain its interest in “mental warfare” and “mental security” as a new trend in contemporary warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bartosh, the two main instruments of the global hybrid war are proxy wars and color revolutions. The term proxy war is mainly used to frame Russia’s war in Ukraine (like any local conflict in Russia’s vicinity) as a conflict between the United States and Russia. Meanwhile, color revolution refers to political instability (e.g., in Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Venezuela) created by external actors that ultimately aims to weaken Russia’s position within its sphere of influence. With this framing, Russia is represented as the victim of hostilities, and the countermeasures it deploys are justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian thinkers, China appears in this arrangement as the next potential “target” of the West due to its rising status as a major power. It is also seen as Russia’s strategic partner. Russia’s relations with China are explained with reference to similarities in their “strategic culture,” such as “the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict.” This idea is far from claiming any civilizational affinity between the two countries. Instead, Sino-Russian cooperation is framed in terms of national interest and great power competition. Bartosh defines relations between the United States, Russia, and China as an increasingly unstable triangle, formed by three pairs of relations: the U.S.-China and subsequent U.S.-Russia rivalries and the Sino-Russian cooperation framework. Although the West is identified as the main source of instability and chaos due to the United States’ desire to maintain its hegemonic position, Bartosh does not consider Sino-Russian cooperation inevitable. In October 2019, he writes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Russia’s cooperation with China is framed as part of “a long-term strategy for a joint struggle” against the West. The affirmation of Sino-Russian partnership by presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in February 2022 echoes this sentiment and makes the case for increased cooperation in countering interference by outside forces. In 2019 — preceding the joint statement — Bartosh identified counteraction against hybrid aggression “as one of the steps to deepen the relations between China and Russia.” Another Russian scholar, Alexander Isaev, went further in 2018, when he argued that “there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations.” According to Isaev, this applies especially to thematic dialogues between different government agencies that ultimately “may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace.” The February 2022 joint statement includes many references to increased cooperation within the United Nations and bilaterally in the cyber sphere, which could be interpreted as confirmation of Isaev’s earlier argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in 2017, Bartosh advocated for coordinated counteraction against hybrid threats in the context of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The broad scope of collaboration could include “strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to counter hybrid threats,” he writes. Bartosh underlines the importance of the cooperation by arguing: “We should submit this as a priority project on adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO and ensuring response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions.” However, he does not develop these ideas further; instead, he calls for the more efficient use of Russia’s internal administrative and intellectual resources. His main concerns seem to be linked to insufficient doctrinal development (e.g., creating a model of hybrid warfare) and problems with inter-agency cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-limits-of-sino-russian-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Limits of Sino-Russian Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Global hybrid war” can be thought of as a code word that has multiple meanings depending on the context. Although it does not carry the weight that “Marxism-Leninism” did in Soviet ideology, certain resemblances to Soviet ideological language help explain how this concept is being used in the current context. The notion of global hybrid war reveals core assumptions regarding global politics and the perception of threats toward Russia’s national interests and security. In other words, it offers a general explanation for recurring tensions and conflicts between Russia and the West, along with the perception of enmity — or even hostility — of Western actors toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of China in this arrangement is clear, although few details on possible Sino-Russian cooperation were outlined by the authors of the materials reviewed for this chapter. China is represented as Russia’s strategic partner and the West’s potential “next target.” An interpretation of China as a potential next target places Russia at the center of the ongoing power struggle, thereby upgrading the country’s importance on the global stage. Although Russian authors frame the “global hybrid war” as a conflict between civilizations, they do not elaborate on cultural-strategic similarities between Russia and China, but rather frame the conflict in traditional security and political terms. For example, the concept of strategic culture is defined very broadly, as an attribute of Russia’s (and China’s) alleged defensive posture and the subsequent prioritization of preventing military conflicts (so-called active defense). Counteraction against hybrid threats is listed as one of the potential areas of cooperation between China and Russia. In the material studied for this chapter, the authors identify specific agencies (Ministries of Defense and Military Academies of both countries) and areas (e.g., cyber security or strategic communications) where that cooperation could take place, but they do not elaborate on possible obstacles. The recurring emphasis on improving Russia’s own capabilities in the hybrid sphere can be interpreted as a sign that Russian thinkers have low expectations for what Sino-Russian cooperation can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail that might also outline the limits of Sino-Russian cooperation is the emphasis among Russian military scholars on “mental warfare.” The concept of mental warfare carries with it an idea of total war aimed at the complete paralysis of the target country and the destruction of its political and moral will to resist conquest by a foreign power. Consequently, with the subjugation of national culture, values, and traditions, a country’s sovereignty is liquidated, and it becomes a colony or otherwise ceases to exist. In the Russian literature on mental warfare analyzed for this article, it is assumed that each country has its own “core idea”: a set of moral-ethical values and traditions, the destruction of which would lead to the loss of real sovereignty. Advocates of the mental warfare concept call for both preventative actions against presumed Western hostilities (“active defense”) and the securitization of Russia’s domestic sphere — its development in terms of Russian cultural-political traditions. Although this type of development does not exclude cooperation with foreign partners in the technological sphere (e.g., the adaptation of Chinese cyber security models into the Russian context), the center of gravity in mental warfare is Russia’s cultural-political cohesion and its ability to secure its own “real” sovereignty. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the traditional realist view of state sovereignty also limits Russia’s potential for alliance formation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-3&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of the joint Sino-Russian statement on February 4, 2022, raised the level of the two countries’ commitment to developing bilateral ties. The statement built upon an existing trend of increased cooperation in recent years, which had been further formalized in 2019 during the meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. The joint statement specifically indicated that Sino-Russian cooperation had now no forbidden areas. Its wording suggested nonetheless that Xi was setting a framework that would first and foremost serve his long-term ambitions for China’s process of rejuvenation. This implies that the scope of cooperation going forward — including in areas such as hybrid and gray zone tactics — is likely to be informed by Chinese ambitions and objectives over Russian ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, cooperation between China and Russia is likely to remain strategic and focused on advancing the two countries’ quest for international relevance, if not primacy as great powers. In particular, while assessments about the underlying strength of the relationship vary, developments in bilateral exercises conducted in 2021 — demonstrating greater Sino-Russian command integration — and the conduct of joint patrol activities, especially in East Asia, confirm that the military relationship is growing closer. In particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing is the senior partner in this evolving relationship. Indeed, very recently China and Russia held their annual joint exercise in the region, and this despite resource-based pressure on Russia deriving from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. These developments pose two important questions: What do recent changes in Sino-Russian military ties mean for cooperation regarding the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics, and conversely, how will hybrid and gray zone tactics help create opportunities to further advance cooperation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Chinese perspective, the answer to this line of questioning is significant, and the outcome of the war in Ukraine will inevitably affect it. Much to Chinese surprise, Russian performance in the early stages of the invasion has failed to meet Beijing’s initial expectations. As well-informed foreign observers have noted, for Beijing, Russian military operations in the opening stages of the war were inconsistent with the country’s military doctrine. In particular, the Chinese leadership has likely taken note of Russia’s failure to accurately assess potential Ukrainian opposition, not to mention the lack of adequate preparation in terms of information operations and the wider cognitive dimensions of the war. This, in turn, might lead the Chinese leadership to reconsider whether and to what extent “some limits” to cooperation on hybrid tactics are desirable, if not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the degree of cooperation between Russia and China will be affected by the outcome of the unfolding war, it is nonetheless possible to assess two relevant aspects of this question in the interim. First, it is possible to review how Chinese writers on strategy conceptualize hybrid tactics, and to what extent — if at all — they draw a distinction between hybrid and gray zone operations. Second, it is also possible to assess the extent to which such an understanding creates clear areas of opportunity in terms of cooperation with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-warfare-and-gray-zones-as-geopolitical-competition&quot;&gt;Hybrid Warfare and Gray Zones as Geopolitical Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample of Chinese writers surveyed in this project presents “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition as two different, albeit complementary, tools of geopolitical competition among states. In particular, Han Aiyong, an associate professor at the Institute of International Strategic Studies of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School, pointed out that “hybrid warfare is essentially closer to a competitive means by which great powers use indirect, low-intensity conflict to seek geopolitical advantage.” By contrast, the same author suggested that competition in the gray zone focuses more on cognitive forms of conflict, with “psychological warfare, media warfare, legal warfare, economic coercion, and even diplomatic warfare . . . intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the internal ills of competitors’ economic and social development, and to create ideological confusion and even social unrest in their favor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this conceptual framework, hybrid and gray zone tactics represent two sides of the same coin. The key difference is that hybrid tactics are designed to address the conduct of limited proxy wars, whereas gray zone tactics oversee the conduct of non-kinetic operations directly against an enemy or competitor. Such preliminary observations come with two caveats, however. First, the notions of “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition are foreign ideas imported into Russian and Chinese strategic thinking, making clear reference to their original development in the United States. Second, both concepts are presented as methods through which great powers engage in competition with each other — and specifically, how the United States engages with competitors such as Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main body of English-language literature, however, the notions of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of competition are used to capture a distinctive set of Russian and Chinese behaviors. For instance, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) vocabulary, the former term refers to forms of Russian sub-threshold coercive actions drawing upon the integration of different tools of statecraft (e.g., military, diplomatic, economic, as well as information and legal). Insofar as gray zone activities are concerned, English-language literature tends to emphasize how this concept is helpful in specifically identifying Chinese actions that are seemingly designed to remain beneath the threshold of open war. Except for very limited attempts at reconciling this intellectual separation, in the English-language literature, hybrid tactics are the prerogative of the Russian state, while the gray zone is that of China. However, this distinction finds no correlation in the Chinese presentation of these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Chinese approach to the understanding of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of conflict is based on the assumption that international relations are a persistent struggle — in other words, that they are a zero-sum interaction. As a result, Chinese authors regard these methods of competition as desirable — or even necessary — ways to enable the shaping of the international order in a fashion that is favorable to authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. This idea can be clearly inferred by the Chinese claim that the United States and its allies have developed these concepts to undermine strategic competitors in the first place, with specific attention to China and Russia. Thus, China should be able to master and respond to these forms of behavior. In one sense, however, such an intellectual approach, gauging a strong Leninist thinking, implies that China is already “at war” and that hybrid and gray area conflicts are inherent to this state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Chinese scholarship reviewed in this project, hybrid forms of conflict are designed to avoid direct confrontation among major powers. They target strategically important state actors that can either expand or maintain the reach and influence of any major power. In this respect, however, the authors draw a clear distinction about the intent behind the use of hybrid tactics. The intent behind U.S. “hybrid wars” is “offensive” and “globalist,” as the application of these tactics is designed to support and expand the country’s influence at the expense of strategic competitors like China or Russia. Russian hybrid tactics are instead defensive in nature, informed by a more limited aim of preserving Russia’s influence. Relatedly, hybrid wars, because they take actions at the periphery of major power competition, would seem to make low-intensity conflict a reality in the contemporary world. Chinese writers seem to expect low-intensity conflicts to be a component of major power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, from this perspective, a Chinese writer observes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this conceptualization, the Chinese government’s tolerance for conflict is high because it is assumed that it can be kept at acceptable levels. In part, this is acceptable because the core actions are taking place away from a major power’s territory. The same author also added that in a hybrid context, new technologies and “non-contact” forms of competition — notably conflict in digital information spaces, which includes both conflict to disrupt or manipulate network systems and conflict conducted through social media — add to the possibilities and potential of the “controlled chaos” created by hybrid tactics. In other words, these new tools allow for a more integrated and wider-ranging capacity for the conduct of hybrid wars. By the same token, new technologies also increase the likelihood of hybrid tactics being employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray zone competition shares with hybrid tactics a heightened importance of integrating and synergizing different levers of national power. Similarly, both put considerable emphasis on the advantages of non-kinetic tools for the pursuit of competition. On the other hand, gray zone competition also has two features that make it very distinct from hybrid tactics. First, its core focus rests on the creation and management — both in defensive and offensive ways — of plausible legal and political narratives to enable the pursuit of specific courses of action. Indeed, legal narratives are a significant aspect of gray zone competition in that they relate to the advantageous use of established rules and norms to constrain, shape, and sanction behavior in the pursuit of national objectives. Within this context, competition in gray areas is about manipulating and exploiting ambiguities in international frameworks to craft a favorable narrative, while discrediting or undermining those set forth by competitors. From a Chinese perspective, therefore, gray zone conflict would seemingly fall first and foremost within the realm of psychological, political, and legal warfare — a key feature of Chinese strategic thinking about war and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second distinctive aspect of gray area competition concerns the development of political narratives that specifically reinforce — or at least do not undermine — Beijing’s moral standing. In gray zone conflict, the core aim is to gain an advantage by justifying one’s actions. This is not meant solely to paralyze or limit responses to these actions; it is also meant to erode wider support that might be given to one’s competitors. This sheds new light on how Chinese writers view the utility of Beijing’s participation in multilateral institutions: they consider Chinese efforts to increase influence in these organizations as a way to guide the development of the organizations’ internal mechanisms and approaches in ways that favor Beijing’s preferences. This creates another clear distinction between gray zone activities and the objectives behind the mobilization of legal narratives in a “hybrid” conflict. As the same Chinese author remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pursuit of ambiguity in the gray zone is the use of the ambiguous space of rules and the international law system to justify one’s own behavior. Hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is to find a soft restraint on violence by established rules between the regulations of traditional and non-traditional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authors seem to understand the concept of hybrid tactics as involving competition for influence in states of strategic relevance in a competitive global environment, whereas gray zone competition may focus more directly on the competing powers themselves. Within this context, competition in the gray zone is intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the domestic and internal challenges of a major power. The idea is to weaken the competitor from within through political confusion and social unrest. The significance of such a conceptualization of gray zone competition rests also in the inference that, for Chinese authors, this type of competition is actively conducted against China, thus reinforcing their zero-sum understanding of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-against-destabilization-as-cooperation&quot;&gt;Resilience against Destabilization as Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas. The methods for such cooperation are likely to include a degree of coordination on military activities; yet, new technologies — such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence — and their potential application in shaping public audiences’ perceptions are also likely to become a primary area of Sino-Russian cooperation. Chinese authors, at least, view this type of cooperation as particularly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Chinese authors view the use of social media and information networks as essential to enhance the effect of information dissemination to create favorable international public opinion and to affect the psychological conditions of public audiences in competing countries. These tools can also be very helpful in support of other political, economic, and military means of conflict in the conduct of hybrid wars. Within this context, technology is considered an invaluable tool to reduce gaps between developing and advanced powers — and, crucially, a way to afford precision in the targeting of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts seem keen to prioritize Sino-Russian cooperation to address the risks of political destabilization abroad and at home. In particular, one author focused on the challenge of “color revolutions,” defined as Western-sponsored attempts at destabilizing countries with the ambition to promote regime change. The same author identified states along the periphery of Russia and China as the first targets of a wider attempt at directly undermining Moscow and Beijing. In the Chinese view, purported attempts at regime change in North Africa and Central Asia, as well as presumed Western support for “separatist activities” in places like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, reinforce the need for Russia and China to cooperate closely. A perceived increase in the “violence” of these movements — as the case of the 2019 protests in Hong Kong highlights — also adds to such a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographically, Sino-Russian cooperation on hybrid and gray zone tactics should focus on enhancing public perceptions of Moscow and Beijing among other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Cooperation should cover political, economic, and cultural aspects, with the aim of strengthening political trust and a perceived sense of friendship. Chinese authors are convinced that dedicated cultural exchange activities that reward cultural differences but reinforce an emotional link to China and Russia should be coordinated with political and economic initiatives. For these Chinese authors, improving public perceptions of Russia and China also includes cultivating ties with elites in CIS and SCO countries. However, they note that strategic competitors like the United States might try to cultivate ties with Russian and Chinese elites in turn, with the aim of undermining the two countries’ governments. As a result, Chinese authors emphasize the need for bilateral cooperation to minimize the risk of domestic corruption. Their solution is to promote cooperation to achieve greater monitoring of domestic elites and senior officials, while also seeking to promote positive incentives to ensure loyalty — or at the very least obedience — to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of military affairs, Chinese scholars view joint exercises as a potential hybrid tool to counter the risk of “color revolutions.” Exercises are not hybrid tactics per se; yet, Chinese authors stress the political value of them as a hybrid tactic. One major example in this context is the joint exercise Unbreakable Brotherhood 2020, conducted at a time of acute instability in Belarus. The exercise was a response to perceived NATO provocations in the country and was intended to both strengthen ties with the regime in Belarus and enhance the cohesiveness within domestic audiences around the importance of supporting the Belarus authorities. Chinese specialists, therefore, regard exercises as potential hybrid tactics insofar as their desired effects are designed to shape, manipulate, and counter Western actions in the Russian and Chinese peripheries. Especially in the context of the SCO, the Chinese aim is to strengthen the combined Sino-Russian capacity for conducting exercises so that they can be used on short notice if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the literature surveyed for this project, governance in cyberspace is another area of prime relevance in Sino-Russian cooperation. In this domain too, Chinese authors perceive a clear sense of challenge mounted by Western power — notably the United States. The Western approach to cyber governance fundamentally undermines the Russian and Chinese approaches to sovereignty in this domain. From their perspective, cooperation should aim at promoting the Sino-Russian view that respect for sovereignty should guide developments in governance. In this context, Sino-Russian cooperation is important for shaping support within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, and regional organizations such as the SCO, for a specific understanding of governance in cyberspace. Through these organizations, China and Russia can promote mechanisms to safeguard national laws and combat cybercrime as they see fit, while developing shared technical solutions and wider collaboration with other emerging powers to widen their influence. Unsurprisingly, cooperation assumes that in Russia and China private companies and the state work with each other, with business accepting subordination to national authorities in a fashion consistent with the ambitions of the Chinese civil-military fusion doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-hybrid-and-gray-zone-tactics-as-war-by-other-means&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Hybrid and Gray Zone Tactics as War by Other Means?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars envision cooperation with Russia as an inherent part of Beijing’s ascent on the international stage. In a world that is understood to be antagonistic toward China, with the United States perceived as engaging in the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics to destabilize and weaken Russia and China, these tactics are seen as necessary for China to survive and grow as a major power. The Chinese approach to international affairs as a struggle for survival invites three broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, notwithstanding conceptual differences, among Chinese scholars both hybrid and gray zone tactics are about asymmetric forms of competition. The intellectual distinction in English-language literature — between hybridity as a form of conduct that pertains to Russia and gray zone as a form of competition relevant to understanding Chinese behavior — is not reflected in the Chinese literature. For them, the key distinction would seem to be that hybrid tactics involve higher levels of tolerance in terms of military engagement and destruction, while gray zone tactics put more stress on non-kinetic means. Further, gray zone tactics are directly applied against an opposing major power, whereas hybrid tactics apply to countries of strategic value in which low-intensity wars are acceptable. For Chinese scholars, gray zone tactics are clearly a priority area of cooperation. They view hybrid tactics, on the other hand, as a space of cooperation specially meant to prevent the loss of influence in areas of strategic significance in the CIS and SCO contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, new technologies and their impact on the structures, perceptions, and political stability of societies are an invaluable addition to the pursuit of asymmetry in hybrid and gray zone tactics. Cyberspace, internet networks, and social media are crucial means to manipulate, destabilize, and weaken other major powers, directly or by seeking to undermine their influence. In this respect, Chinese authors consider the improvement of China’s international image as a key area of gray zone cooperation, together with aggressive actions to politically destabilize competing major powers. Cooperation in developing the means to degrade — and, if necessary, destroy — the physical infrastructure enabling a competing major power’s cyber activities seemingly falls within the category of hybrid tactics. Against this background, the establishment of plausible legal and political narratives as a way to maintain or develop positive perceptions of China and Russia are also more “active” ways to take advantage of these means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese thinking about hybrid and gray zone tactics creates a predisposition for pursuing greater resilience against tactics of a similar nature from being deployed against Beijing and Moscow. For Chinese observers, destabilization and regime change are fundamental risks against which both Russia and China need to shield themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken altogether, these conclusions suggest that, while doubts remain over the extent of Chinese cooperation with Russia after the latter’s invasion of Ukraine, the content and perceived needs of this relationship are understood in similar terms by Moscow and Beijing. In fact, Chinese scholars view the political world as one of struggle — one in which hybrid and gray zone tactics may very well provide an asymmetric edge to tilt the scales of the international order in China’s favor toward a more authoritarian balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main Conclusions: In the 1990s, Chinese orders ensured the survival of the Russian defense industry (which had suffered from the collapse of the USSR) and preserved its global competitiveness. In turn, after Western sanctions were imposed in 1989, Russia became the main source of advanced weapons for China. Thanks to Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation, China was able to radically transform its armed forces into a modern military machine. The leaders of the Russian military-industrial complex (MIC) understood that the weapons sold to China would eventually be copied. Nevertheless, Moscow exported weapons to China in an effort to preserve the defense industry and earn money to build new-generation weapons systems. The country’s military and political leadership blocked deliveries of the most sensitive systems, which could ensure a rapid breakthrough of the Chinese military-industrial complex and undermine the competitiveness of Russian arms manufacturers. On the whole, this approach turned out to be justified. In the mid-2000s, the supply of weapons from Russia to China noticeably decreased. The reasons were the saturation of the Chinese market, the progress of the military-industrial complex in the PRC itself, and the increased concerns of the Russian leadership about Chinese copying and potential competition in the markets of third countries. Some Russian leaders have expressed fears about the growth of Chinese military capabilities near Russia’s Siberian and far eastern borders. Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China resumed growth in the 2010s, but a major breakthrough occurred in 2014. After the sharp deterioration in relations with the West, the Russian leadership conducted a systematic assessment of the risks of partnership with the PRC, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. Moscow concluded that the risks of cooperation with China were much lower than was commonly believed. The Chinese military industrial complex is less and less dependent on the unlicensed copying of Russian equipment and more and more reliant on its own developments. Fears of “Chinese invasion east of the Urals” have also turned out to be exaggerated. In these circumstances, Moscow has decided to sell such advanced systems as S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighter jets. Military-technical cooperation does not play a significant role in the trade between the two countries, accounting for no more than 5 percent of trade turnover. For the Russian military-industrial complex, arms sales to China are no longer a vital necessity, although China remains one of its most important export markets. However, the military-industrial complex plays an important political role, ensuring the strategic depth of the Russian-Chinese partnership. Russia still maintains serious advantages over China in a number of military production sectors. These are the creation of air defense equipment and some types of radar equipment, aircraft engine construction, underwater shipbuilding, and so on. However, in other areas China is now ahead of Russia, especially in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles. Overall, for the Chinese armed forces, buying weapons from Russia is a reliable way to quickly increase their military power (particularly given the possible escalation of conflicts in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait). The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and Western sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have increased Moscow’s interest in importing Chinese military technology and equipment. There are isolated examples of the purchase of Chinese military technology for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces, but this phenomenon has not yet become large-scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis around Ukraine, which broke out in early 2014, marked the beginning of a new stage in Russia’s relations with the outside world. In the face of U.S. and EU sanctions, Moscow began to deepen its partnership with China, the largest country that did not publicly condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine and did not join the sanctions regime. By that time, the political relations between Moscow and Beijing already had the official status of a strategic partnership, and since 2010, China had become Russia’s largest trading partner after the European Union. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian crisis has raised cooperation between the two largest powers in Eurasia to a new level. One of the most important elements of this partnership was the development and deepening of military-technical cooperation (MTC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, Moscow conducted a comprehensive study of the potential risks that a deeper partnership with China could entail, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. The results of the analysis convinced the Kremlin that the risks of such cooperation had previously been exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the relatively small volume of transactions in monetary terms (about US$3 billion per year), the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is of great importance for both sides. Although today Russia’s defense industry is not as dependent on Chinese purchases as it used to be, China remains a major export market for the Russian defense industry, and demand from the PLA has spurred the interest of other buyers. For Beijing, the Russian defense industry is the quickest way to obtain systems that can strengthen the PLA’s advantage at strategic points where military tensions between China and U.S. allies are possible. Finally, cooperation in such a sensitive area as arms serves as an important factor in strengthening the Moscow-Beijing political axis at a time when the parties are not seeking a formal military alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance for the Soviet Union of resuming military-technical cooperation with China is demonstrated by the following fact: China, which used to be one of Moscow’s main rivals, was the first foreign buyer of the most advanced Soviet aircraft, while its traditional allies settled for the less advanced MiG-29. The memoirs of Chinese military leaders published in recent years indicate that the Chinese were given fairly broad access to see Soviet military innovations. Moscow even had preliminary talks with Beijing about the possibility of supplying an aircraft carrier and carrier-based aircraft. Apparently, the Soviets assumed that close ties with China would be necessary for successful development after the end of the Cold War, and they were willing to use military technology exports to strengthen relations with Beijing. The Russian Federation thus became only a natural extension of this line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased military contacts and reduced tensions in border areas contributed to the gradual removal of obstacles to the export of increasingly sophisticated military equipment to China and the transfer of Russian technology there. Opposition to such cooperation on the part of the Russian military gradually weakened in the 1990s. China’s interest in military cooperation with Russia increased sharply in the late 1980s due to China’s restricted access to Western sources of military and dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of these factors led to the fact that after the collapse of the USSR, the Russian leadership immediately began to create the legal basis and organizational infrastructure for military-technical cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important feature of the military-technical cooperation of Russia and China was the rather strict formal requirements of the Chinese side to the secrecy of transactions, even in cases where the secrecy was clearly meaningless and even absurd. As a result, Russian and Chinese officials often refuse to discuss projects in the field of military-technical cooperation, even when the whole world knows about them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s attitude towards military issues changed radically under the influence of the war in the Persian Gulf (1990–1991), when the United States and its allies defeated and expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait with minimal losses and in a short period of time. Saddam Hussein’s army of 1990, apart from its rich military experience, was far superior to the PLA in technical equipment. The war demonstrated the growing role of new types of weapons and military equipment, in the development of which China lagged particularly behind: electronic warfare systems, technical reconnaissance, guided weapons, air defense systems, etc. China’s military leadership had to deeply rethink new trends in military affairs and the country’s military construction priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese side was well aware of the complexities of the Russian situation. Significant purchases of new weapons for the Russian general-purpose forces were curtailed in 1992–1993 and resumed only after 2008–2009. The Russian military-industrial complex survived on exports, and amid the global decline in military spending in the 1990s, the Chinese and Indian markets were the main targets. Thus, when negotiating with Russia, the Chinese had enormous market power and used it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first major deals reflected China’s priorities in ensuring its defense capabilities and were primarily related to combat aircraft and aviation weapons. China felt the weakest in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the story of Russian supplies of Su fighters to China may be viewed as a success. Russia was able to preserve and partly even modernize a critical part of its own military-industrial complex during the difficult period, while the damage caused by the Chinese violation of Russian intellectual property rights was not too great and was limited to the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the evolution of Russia’s foreign policy and deterioration of Russia’s economy in the 1990s have appreciably affected the expansion and deepening of military cooperation with China. The poor state of MIC enterprises forced the managers of specific factories, as well as captains of Russia’s defense industry, to lobby more and more actively for the development of ties with China. The end of optimism about relations with the West that was characteristic of the first years of Russia’s foreign policy is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation in the 1990s covered almost all areas of arms and military equipment production for general-purpose forces. The result was a frontal rearmament of the entire Chinese military machine, which, with Russian help, made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas. This process was generally ignored in the United States and other Western countries, which assessed the Russian industry too negatively, exaggerating the depth of its decline, and were particularly arrogant of China’s efforts to modernize its military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, due to cooperation with Russia, in the 1990s to early 2000s China was able to radically upgrade PLA and receive considerably more modern armed forces which are better suited for combat operations in the twenty-first century. At the same time, military-technical cooperation with Moscow enabled Beijing to significantly enhance the potential of its own military-industrial complex through the purchase of licenses, unlicensed copying of equipment, as well as training by Russian specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-2000s, there was stagnation in Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This situation is explained by a whole complex of reasons affecting China, Russia, and relations between Moscow and Beijing. First of all, for the Russian military-industrial complex, exports to China are no longer a vital necessity. Having retained key defense enterprises in the 1990s, Russia began to plan a largescale rearmament of its own armed forces as early as the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;he importance of the Chinese market for the domestic military-industrial complex was declining not only due to the growth of effective demand for Russian military equipment on the part of the Russian Armed Forces; it was also facilitated by the diversification of arms exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, rising hydrocarbon prices and a significant inflow of petrodollars into the Russian treasury provided Moscow with additional financial resources. The state had no trouble covering its social obligations and expanding them with the help of oil and gas revenues. It was now possible to be more selective about other sources of income, including arms exports to China. In addition, the role of military-technical cooperation for the stability of relations between Moscow and Beijing, which had been one of the pillars of the Russia-China partnership in the 1990s, began to diminish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid the rapid growth of mutual trade, the share of military-technical cooperation in its structure was decreasing, making arms trade one of the many elements of cooperation rather than the basis of bilateral economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has paid much more attention to risk analysis. The Russian side was increasingly concerned, first, about the problem of the scale of unlicensed copying of the equipment received from Russia, and second, about the potential of future competition from the Chinese military-industrial complex in the newly acquired markets, especially in North Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the final resolution of the border issue with China in 2004–2006, the Russian leadership rekindled discussions on the possibility of Chinese economic, demographic and, in the distant future, military expansion into the sparsely populated contiguous areas of the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential connection between the restriction of export of advanced weapons systems to China and Moscow’s concern over the PLA’s intentions is also confirmed by the informal statements of the leaders of the Russian military industrial complex. These discussions apparently resulted in the decision not to rush to sell to China the latest systems, like S-400 air defense systems or Su-35 fighters, but to insist on the most favorable (and not necessarily acceptable to China) terms. The absence of a deal at that time was better than a deal that did not satisfy Moscow’s growing demands for bilateral military-technical cooperation. In China, there was also a complex of reasons that, in the middle and second half of the 2000s, temporarily reduced Beijing’s interest in purchasing Russian equipment. After the programs of licensed production of Su-27SK fighters ended in 2003–2004 and the main supplies of Su-30MKK fighters ended, China began to gradually reduce the import of Russian weapons. This was the result of the increased self-confidence of the captains of the Chinese military-industrial complex, who made obviously unrealistic promises to their leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gradual recovery in the volume of military-technical cooperation was recorded in the early 2010s, when the Chinese side was forced to admit the limited capabilities of its industry and its dependence on Russia for some critical components. Moscow also became more optimistic about the prospects for profitable cooperation with China, partly as a result of the economic crisis, which once again raised the issue of diversifying the sources of budget revenues. However, the Ukrainian crisis of 2014 had a decisive influence on the deepening of Russia-China military-technical cooperation at the present stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Ukrainian events that accelerated Russia’s “pivot to the East”: after the introduction of sanctions, Moscow began to intensively search for opportunities to increase ties with its Asian partners in order to compensate for the reduced volume of loans and investments due to sanctions, as well as to provide access to technology. The only obvious candidate for the role of a “friend in need” was Beijing. China was the only major economy that did not impose sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need to strengthen its partnership with China, in the spring of 2014 various Russian agencies analyzed the potential risks of cooperation with China. Before rushing to embrace Beijing, Moscow wanted to understand the limits of the giant neighbor’s safe participation in the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, the analysis of the situation with the Chinese presence beyond the Urals showed that Russia should not be afraid of China’s “creeping demographic expansion” into vacant territories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has come to the conclusion that the perceptions in the Russian media, the expert community, and some of the authorities about the dangers of Chinese migration to the Russian Far East proved to be overly alarmist, and that the scenario of the future “annexation” of Russian territories by China according to the “Crimean scenario” was completely unrealistic. In addition, the Russian leadership has gained a more adequate understanding of the internal transformation of the Chinese economy: the aging population, a shrinking workforce, and a policy to reduce the consumption of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly aware of the problems that Chinese arms manufacturers face and will face, Moscow came to the conclusion that in the long term China will become less dependent on the Russian military industry and that, as the Chinese defense industry develops without Russian participation through direct sales of equipment, transfer of licenses and possibly joint arms development, in the future Russian opportunities to make money in the Chinese arms market will become increasingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change in approach was evidenced by a program interview with Rosoboronexport CEO Anatoly Isaikin in April 2015 in the Kommersant newspaper, in which, among other things, the contract for the sale of S-400 air defense systems to China was announced. In response to a reporter’s question about whether Russian enterprises are not afraid to enter into cooperation with PRC enterprises, Isaikin replied: “I believe that if we work in China’s interests, we also work in our own interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result of this analysis, Moscow’s attitude to the development of military cooperation with China has changed to a more open one. Selling advanced weapons to China became part of the strategy of rapprochement with Beijing in response to the systemic crisis in relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow agreed to more actively help China build up its military power and capabilities in light of the PLA’s tasks in the Pacific (of course, not disinterestedly), expecting in return that China would help Russia more easily survive the most acute period of confrontation with the West through investments and loans, as well as the necessary technology (also not for free). On the whole, this approach worked. Of course, China did not help Russia on a large scale for a whole complex of reasons, among them the consequences of the anti-corruption campaign in China, which paralyzed the decision-making process at many state enterprises; the drop in commodity prices; and the slowdown of the Chinese economy itself. In addition, PRC companies operating in global markets have been attentive to Western sanctions. However, despite this, Beijing has made several important investments in projects prioritized by Russian president Vladimir Putin, as well as providing a number of Russian companies with access to cheap financing. The most significant symbolic gesture of support from Beijing was the participation of Chinese companies in the construction of a power bridge to Crimea, despite Western sanctions. In the field of military-technical cooperation, major shifts took place in the fall of 2014, shortly after the U.S. and EU sectoral sanctions came into effect. Moscow and Beijing completed years of negotiations on the supply of four divisions of Russia’s latest S-400 air defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the volume of military goods and services sold to China in 2016 exceeded USD $3 billion, and the total portfolio of Chinese orders is about USD $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having made serious progress in independent development and system integration of complex equipment, the Chinese continue to suffer from disproportionate development of various components of their huge military industrial complex and lag behind many suppliers of critical materials and components. Russia fills these gaps by carrying out both relevant R&amp;amp;D and supply in China’s interests. Today, cooperation is primarily not a small number of large arms supply contracts, but dozens or hundreds of small agreements, hardly identifiable by the media. The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have led not only to an increase in Russian arms supplies to China, but also to an increase in Russian interest in imports of Chinese technology and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some areas of military equipment production, China is already ahead of Russia. Unmanned aerial vehicles are a typical example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two years after the Ukrainian crisis, we can say that the deepening of military-technical cooperation between Russia and China is evident. This is evidenced not only by structural shifts in cooperation, but also by its increased volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia retains serious advantages over China in many areas of military production due to significant state investments, which have resumed since the late 2000s. This is true of air defense equipment, aircraft engines, a number of types of radar technology, submarine shipbuilding, and so on. However, there are also areas where Russia has begun to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighters sold by Moscow could in the future significantly enhance the PLA’s combat capabilities in critical areas in the Pacific, where China increasingly needs to demonstrate its deterrence capability against the United States and its allies, or where there is a risk of limited military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task of curtailing Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is impossible; the United States and Japan can only try to correct the course of the Russian Federation, inducing Russia to refuse to expand cooperation to other sensitive areas like space technology or missile warning systems. However, given the recent tightening of anti-Russian sanctions by the U.S. Congress, the opportunities for Washington and Tokyo to play in this field are limited, and therefore they can only closely monitor the development of military-technical cooperation between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Товарищество пока на доверии: Военно-техническое сотрудничество России и Китая требует совершенствования” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/60886&quot;&gt;A Partnership Based on Trust So Far: Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China needs improvement, Военно-промышленный Kурьер Military-Industrial Courier, February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of Chinese military and technical publications shows that Beijing positively evaluates the opportunities for a progressive increase in bilateral military-technical cooperation in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, in practice Beijing is striving to gradually abandon the purchase of large quantities of Russian arms and military equipment and to transfer bilateral military-technical cooperation to a qualitatively new level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, China’s leadership officially has no doubts about the importance of further deepening military-technical cooperation with Russia. At the same time, as Russia’s economic potential grows in the long term, contradictions may arise in Russian-Chinese relations due to the mutual desire to expand their spheres of interests in the Asia-Pacific region and in Central Asia. Such a scenario could lead China to contain Russia, including in the field of military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Russia faces a difficult choice: provide China with advanced technologies, realizing that they are likely to be copied, or refuse to sell weapons, knowing that Chinese defense industry enterprises will develop comparable systems on their own in the near future. The former strategy of Russian arms exports, which consisted of selling “secondary” technologies, is no longer viable. China’s military industry has sufficiently caught up with Russia’s, so now the Chinese are interested only in the most modern weapons we have.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems expedient to further diversify Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation and supplement it with the joint development of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shuyin, “对中俄军事合作的历史考察与思考” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://elsxk.hlju.edu.cn/info/1054/1543.htm&quot;&gt;Investigation and consideration of the history of China-Russia military cooperation, Academic Journal of Russian Studies, no. 3 (2016): 5–8&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The growing maturity of Sino-Russian state relations and the deepening of political mutual trust between the two countries provide the political prerequisites for carrying out military cooperation. China’s growing economic strength and urgent need for defense modernization, as well as Russia’s still strong military and technological capabilities, provide the practical requirements and technical prerequisites for bilateral military cooperation, allowing both countries to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the similarity of their military establishments provides facilitative conditions for military cooperation between the two countries. In the current international security situation, both countries face security pressures to deal with various traditional and nontraditional threats, and they have common interests in opposing hegemony, maintaining world and regional peace, combating the “three evils,” and safeguarding their national interests. This pursuit of security in turn provides internal momentum for the deepening of military cooperation between China and Russia, giving it long-lasting vitality and impetus. On this foundation, China and Russia have now formed a “three-in-one” — military-political, military-technical, and military-operational — military cooperation relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the arms embargo imposed on China by the European Union and the United States, Russia has now become China’s most important source of advanced military equipment, and as a result, China has also become the second-largest export destination of Russian weapons after India. According to Russian media estimates, arms exports to China account for an average of 20 percent of Russia’s total exports, and in individual years account for 40 to 50 percent of all Russian arms exports. To ensure that military-technical cooperation goes smoothly, China and Russia have established the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation, which meets annually in the two countries on a rotating basis. Currently, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is focused on China’s purchase of modern warplanes, ships, new land equipment, and air and missile defense weapons from the Russian side. According to public reports in Russian and Chinese media, China has become the world’s largest user of the Su series of combat aircraft. Between 1990 and 2005, Russia sold China nearly 200 combat aircraft of various types, 12 battalions of C-300 anti-aircraft missiles, a number of Tor missile systems, four Hyundai-class destroyers, and 12 Sovremenny-class destroyers. China was the largest importer of Russian weapons until 2006, when India replaced it. According to the Russian newspaper Red Star, the two sides signed a USD $5 billion arms contract in September 2005, under which Russia would supply, over a three-year period, Su-30MKK multi-purpose fighters, Kilo 636 diesel-electric submarines, 956 and modified 956 Sovremenny-class destroyers, and S-300PMU air defense missile systems. More importantly, China has purchased production licenses for Su series fighters, flamethrowers, and other military products. In addition, China and Russia have cooperated in the aerospace field, jointly carrying out scientific research and experimental design work. Recently, the two countries’ defense ministries have been negotiating the export of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defense missiles to China. Since 2014, with the intensification of Western economic sanctions against Russia, Sino-Russian military cooperation has become increasingly complementary, ushering in a “golden age” of China-Russia military-technical cooperation. On November 26, 2015, at a regular press conference of China’s Ministry of Defense, spokesperson Wu Qian said that China and Russia had achieved “milestones” in cooperation projects for Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 anti-missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of coordination, China Russia military cooperation will maintain strong development momentum for a considerable time to come. From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces. As a country that both possesses relatively advanced military technology and weapons and enjoys the right to sell and transfer military technology on its own, Russia has naturally become China’s first choice for military cooperation. From Russia’s point of view, strengthening cooperation with China in the military field is also of strategic importance. Facing serious threats on its western and southern fronts, Russia is bound to seek strategic mutual trust between Russia and China and strengthen China-Russia military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the level of mutual trust between China and Russia continues to rise, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is moving to the highest stage — joint development of high-tech weapons and equipment — and Russia has even begun buying military products from the Chinese side. China has now started to provide the Russian side electronic components for aerospace, diesel engines for ships, and seaborne supply systems for ocean-going supply ships. [Additionally,] the subject of cooperation will be more sensitive. This is reflected in China and Russia sending their most advanced technical equipment to participate in the “Peace Mission” and “Joint Sea” joint military exercises, as well as in the continuous development of China-Russia military-technical cooperation toward the field of key and sophisticated weapons, especially in the increasingly strong trend toward joint development of modern equipment. Examples include cooperation in nuclear submarine design and manufacturing, space, and missile attack warning. In short, China-Russia military cooperation will be higher-level, deeper in content, and more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that some problems still exist in the field of China-Russia military cooperation. The first is that mutual trust between the two sides remains insufficient. In Russia, some people who start out from a Cold War “China threat” mentality maintain that military cooperation with China, especially military-technical cooperation, will have a negative impact on Russia’s long-term security, and that Russia should “hold back a few tricks” from China. Some people in China, on the other hand, voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination. The second is that improvement is still needed in the specific modalities of military-technical cooperation. For a long time, China-Russia military-technical cooperation has mainly been a buyer-seller relationship with China buying and Russia selling. China hopes to change this kind of cooperative relationship dominated by buying and selling into one of technology exchange and cooperation, with joint research and development and mutual benefits, in order to effectively raise the level of China’s military modernization equipment and maintain national security. Russia, for its part, has frequently criticized China’s imitation of Russian-made weapons. Since 2000, along with the rapid advancement of China’s military technology, its advanced weapons development capabilities have grown increasingly strong. Breakthroughs have been achieved in some fields and key technologies, and the defense industry is now able to meet the nation’s needs for weapons and equipment updating, upgrading, and modernization. Therefore, in the field of military-technical cooperation, there will be a greater shift toward purchasing key technologies and sophisticated weaponry, and the emergence of a new situation in which China even exports equipment to Russia is not to be ruled out. The third problem is that a competitive relationship between China and Russia will form in the arms export market in the future. As Chinese-made weapons continue to go global and the two countries’ weapons and equipment become more “homogeneous” in terms of design concepts, use characteristics, and prices, Russia fears that China will crowd out Russian weapons from the market, thus affecting Russian exports of advanced military technology to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the history of Sino-Soviet relations, the disparity in power between the two militaries objectively caused an asymmetry in bilateral relations and an imbalance in military cooperation, while the Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power, positioning military cooperation between the two sides as a relationship of guiding and being guided, giving and receiving, repeatedly disrespecting the interests of the other side and imposing itself on others, threatening to cancel military aid at every turn, and seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “extended family” style of military cooperation relationship that draws ideological boundaries and transcends normal national interests is doomed to be short-lived and will eventually harm the relationship between the two countries due to its high degree of political sensitivity. The fundamental reason why China and the Soviet Union turned from alliance to confrontation in the 1950s and 1960s was the dislocation between ideology and actual national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current military cooperation between China and Russia is subordinate to and serves the modernization of the Chinese military, creating a safe surrounding environment for defending national interests during a time of important strategic opportunity, but it also conforms to Russia’s strategic need to stabilize its neighborhood and ensure the global balance of strategic power, as well as the idea of using arms sales to drive economic development. Consequently, military cooperation will become an important factor in promoting the healthy development of bilateral relations and maintaining regional and world stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proves that placing the emphasis on foreign technical assistance or the purchase of foreign weapons inevitably results in the dependence of China’s national defense undertakings. Fundamentally enhancing military strength, on the other hand, requires instead the selective and focused introduction of key foreign equipment and technologies while adhering to self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Vinokurov, “Глобальное совместное патрулирование Россия – Китай: стратегическое взаимодействие или военно-политический союз?” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/52737&quot;&gt;Global Cooperative Patrol: Russia &amp;amp; China: Strategic Cooperation or a Military-Political Alliance? Military-Industrial Courier, September 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, the deputy chairman of the Central Military Committee of the PRC, Zhang Yuxia, and Russian minister of defense, Sergei Shoigu, signed an agreement on the further strengthening of cooperation. According to information from the Committee of the Federation Council on the defense and security of the Russian Federation, the agreement may include the exchange of technology and the Chinese use of elements of the Russian Federation’s anti-aircraft defense systems in the Far East, which testifies to a high level of mutual trust. In the White Book of defense published by Beijing on July 24, it is written that military cooperation with Russia has developed to a high level and plays a significant role in supporting global strategic stability. It is also highlighted that military cooperation is not directed against any third party and will include air, land, and sea forces. Beginning in 2012, officers in both armies have conducted eight rounds of strategic consultations. In 2017, Russia and China organized their first collective naval maneuvers in the Baltic Sea. In 2018, a formation of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army participated in the “Vostok” strategic exercises. In April–May of the same year “Naval Interaction (Joint Sea)” took place in the region of Qingdao.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 23, the Russian and Chinese Air forces carried out their first cooperation air patrol with long range aircraft over the water around Japan and the East China Sea, eliciting an unpleasant reaction from military allies of the United States in the Far East and in other regions of the world. Western experts viewed these actions not as just a regular routine exercise, but as a kind of demonstration of Russian and Chinese readiness for further military collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on official statements by China’s top leaders, they adhere to a policy of non-alignment, exclude military alliances with anyone, oppose the use of force, and favor a peaceful resolution of disputed issues. So, presenting to the members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the PRC and high-ranking officials with a speech on the country’s foreign politics, Xi Jinping declared that China would not enter a military block with Russia or any other country. This would tie Beijing’s hands. China would expand its influence in the world and form a network of allies on all continents through soft power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A military alliance between two such powerful countries would change the entire strategic position of the world. This disturbance is caused not only by the above-mentioned actions in the military and military-technical spheres, but by the fact that the two countries hold identical or similar positions in the majority of international problems and demonstrate them collectively on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These and certain other factors provide a context for the development of mutually beneficial relations between these countries in the interest of mutual opposition to the threats and challenges of modernity and the strengthening of the world order. The question of a military alliance is evidently not entirely imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, conversations on the creation of an official military-political union are premature. This is entirely understandable. Such unions, not to mention states, are not historically threatening to anyone, conducted only in anticipation of extreme circumstances, and created with defense in mind. In other words, the activities of Moscow and Beijing in this sphere will depend largely on the activities of the West and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Военное сотрудничество России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=44888630&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Military Cooperation, Ethnosocium and Multinational Society 1 (2021): 95–105&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2015–2020, Russia and China continued their military-technical policy. Russia and China continued meetings between top military officials. At the same time, the focus of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing was distinctly “anti-American.” One of the most important areas of military cooperation during this period was joint Russian-Chinese military exercises. Strategic command and staff exercises (SSCE) were held regularly from 2015 to 2020. One of the most ambitious maneuvers was “Vostok-2018,” with the participation of Chinese servicemen. The SSCE was organized under the personal leadership of Russian defense minister Army General S.K. Shoigu. At five ranges and water areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the Bering Sea, 300,000 servicemen, more than 1,000 aircraft, 36,000 tanks, and up to 80 ships and support vessels participated. According to the Defense Ministry of China, China sent about 1,600 soldiers, more than 300 vehicles, and 30 aircraft and helicopters for the exercise “Vostok-2018,” and then the same the following year for “Center-2019” as well. About 100 servicemen of the PLA and 18 vehicles were involved in the “Caucasus 2020” SSCE. The naval exercises known as “Maritime Cooperation” are planned and coordinated by the PLA Command with the specific political tasks facing the PRC in mind. Joint naval maneuvers have been held annually since 2015 in the South China Sea and the Baltic Sea. According to PLA commanders, the varied geography of the exercises is a way to mark the growing military power of the two countries. The Chinese and Russian navies have also been involved in the exercises. In December 2019, China, Russia, and Iran jointly conducted a three-day naval exercise in the Gulf of Oman. The maneuvers were held to demonstrate a high level of coordination of joint maritime activities amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. The naval exercises were aimed at two main tasks: to demonstrate the increased capabilities of the PLA to combat traditional and non-traditional threats and to obtain information on the training methods and specifics of the Russian Navy. Anti-terrorist exercises have become a topical area for strengthening military ties with Russia in the fight against international terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism, both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The anti-terrorist exercise “Peace Mission” of the Armed Forces of the SCO member countries has received considerable attention. According to Chinese commanders, this exercise has a stabilizing effect on the regional situation and prepares the country’s armed forces for counterterrorist actions in the territory of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In October 2019, Novosibirsk Oblast hosted the “Cooperation-2019” exercise of anti-terrorist units of the Russian Federal Guard Service and People’s Armed Militia of the People’s Republic of China, where joint actions against international terrorist groups were practiced. The peculiarity of anti-terrorist exercises of Russia and China is that they practiced interaction between battalion-tactical groups, while Sino-Pakistani and Sino-Thai exercises of similar orientation involve units of marines and PLA Airborne Forces numbering from 150 to 250 servicemen. Joint air patrols in the Asia-Pacific region by Chinese and Russian bombers are becoming a new tool for achieving long-term political goals in the region. At the end of December 2020, the Russian Air Force and PLA Air Force conducted the second joint air patrol by long-range aircraft. The air group, consisting of two strategic bombers TU-95 MS (Russia) and four H-6K (PRC), carried out air patrols over the waters of the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. During the patrols, the aviation strictly adhered to international law without violating the airspace of foreign states. The computer-based missile defense (BMD) “Aerospace Security” exercise is seen by the Chinese leadership as a response to the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea. According to Beijing, their main purpose is to demonstrate to regional rivals the high level of relations with Russia. The peculiarity of the Russian-Chinese exercises, which began in 2017, is the use of computer simulations of the missile defense system of the two countries. Let’s specify that the work in real conditions is not possible because of the high level of secrecy and prohibition of access to the facilities of the national missile defense systems. Engineering and design problems at this stage make it impossible for Chinese engineers to develop their own missile defense system, which is confirmed by the unrelenting interest of Chinese specialists in Russian S-400 and S-500 systems, which could eventually form the basis of a Chinese missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian-Chinese military-political cooperation, we should note the multi-vector orientation of the ongoing military exercises. In accordance with the requirements of modern military art, it seems advisable to continue to conduct joint maneuvers of motorized infantry units, which would help military personnel to master the skills of combat in urban areas. At the same time, it would be most appropriate to conduct them at PRC ranges, in order to get acquainted in practice with the pros and cons of the theater command system created in 2016 in the PRC according to the U.S. model. Given the rapid development of PLA naval forces, it is possible to organize Russian-Chinese naval patrols to jointly carry out flag demonstration tasks in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasiliy Kashin and Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, “Совместная оборона. Против кого дружат военные России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://ria.ru/20210705/oborona-1739958628.html&quot;&gt;Joint Defense. Russian and Chinese militaries are friends against whom?, RIA Novosti, July 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military experts emphasize that although the possibility of a military conflict with NATO countries is extremely unlikely, it exists. Therefore, neighboring states need to work out the reflection of potential aggression. “Any such maneuvers are designed to work out the real situation. We have to watch the reaction of the West, especially the Pentagon, but not bow our heads to them and ask their permission,” says Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, former head of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Defense Ministry. In the early 2000s, the joint exercises were declared to be anti-terrorist, but now they have taken on a high-tech, advanced nature, Vasily Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, reminded. “Obviously, they are aimed at transferring experience and increasing interoperability when confronting a major foreign adversary, which can only be the United States,” he believes. In this sense, Moscow and Beijing are certainly pushing back on the American factor, but it is not the only one. “There is, for example, a factor of concern about stability in Central Asia and the desire to maintain military ties to ensure transparency of mutual trust in defense. In addition, in the course of exercises and exchange of delegations, our and Chinese military get a huge amount of knowledge about each other, and, unlike the United States, our Ministry of Defense does not publish its assessments of Chinese military power. However, they stand high on the level of awareness thanks to such wide connections, it allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, understand what capabilities they are actually developing,” the expert adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Yermakov, “Учения и интеграция военных групп: Как Россия и Китай готовятся к защите от НАТО” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasia.expert/kak-rossiya-i-kitay-gotovyatsya-k-zashchite-ot-nato&quot;&gt;Exercises and Military Group Integration: How Russia and China Prepare to Defend Against NATO, Eurasia Expert, October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russo-Chinese military drill “Zapad/Interaction-2021,” held in the Ninxia Hui Autonomous Region in the northern part of the PRC, showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Russian soldiers underwent an express course in the use of new Chinese wheeled armored cars: the heavy wheeled infantry ZBL-08 and the ZTL-11 mobile assault gun (in the Chinese classification — the contemporary Western convention refers to them as “Wheeled Tanks.”) Both are comparatively new machines without direct Russian or Soviet predecessors, which would make their introduction especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the present moment, the Russian army has no contemporary armored vehicles, let alone a unified family as the moment demands. The BTR-80/82 is a vehicle with roots in the Cold War, with entirely different goals. This situation should soon begin to change: following a drill in the beginning of the Army-2021 exhibition, the development of the Bumerang family of armored vehicles was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, from a political and educational point of view, the most important thing in these drills was achieving a new level of integration in these countries’ military action. A cooperation staff was formed which guided the activity of soldiers through a single guiding information system. Following orders passed through this system, Russian paratroopers and Chinese servicemen carried out landings from Chinese helicopters (admittedly Russian-produced) and seized important objectives held by hypothetical “terrorists”, and the Russian SU-30SM enacted practice bombing runs on orders from the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally both parties are far from being involved in a military alliance, and they are not working towards one: despite the best attempts of both sides of the Russo-Chinese friendship, the U.S. State Department does not hold the most benevolent policy towards these countries. However the increasingly frequent and complex military drills by both countries, such as the one described here (and for China, this is the first drill with foreign soldiers since the beginning of the pandemic), testifies to the intention of these parties to demonstrate that there is no chance of realizing the fantasies of a gang of analysts from the 1990s about an “inescapable conflict” or “the impossibility of close integration because of their fundamental distrust for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“中俄联演 — 演习有何亮点看点？军事专家为你深入解读” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.thepaper.cn/baijiahao_13973728&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian joint exercise — What are the highlights of the exercise? Military experts give you an in-depth interpretation, The Paper, August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the highlights of the Zapad/Interaction-2021 military exercise? How will the Chinese and Russian military forces carry out joint combat operations? China Media Group reporter Wang Ruitao held an exclusive interview at Qintongxia Contract Tactical Training Base with Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and expert on Russian military affairs, who was observing the military exercise on site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qingtongxia Training Base is located in the foothills of the Helan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The terrain consists mainly of the Gobi Desert and hilly ground, with an elevation variation that is largely within 30 meters. It could be described as gentle slopes and level ground. It is a training base representative of combat in Gobi Desert and cold plateau conditions. It is suitable for simulating land where terrorists hide and operate. The climate here is similar to Central Asia; both are dry, with little rain. This makes this base highly suitable for training for desert and plateau combat operations such as anti-terrorist operations and special operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the Peace Mission exercise held by China and Russia in 2005, there have been 16 years of exercises held under the Sino-Russian bilateral framework. The current one, I feel, differs from previous exercises such as the Peace Mission and Joint Sea exercises, in the following areas. First, a change in roles. Instead of a Russian-led strategic exercise which to participate in them Chinese army had to leave Chinese territory, it is an exercise led by China on Chinese territory. The main objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the joint combat characteristics of the Chinese military, particularly the improvements to the joint combat capabilities of our military forces since the national defense and military force reforms. At the same time, this is an effort to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on our military. Second, a change in approach. In previous joint exercises, the Chinese and Russian sides would plan independently and organize independent groups under the same combat plan, largely demonstrating the relatively independent operations of each side under a single combat plan and in the same battlefield environment. This joint exercise, in contrast, has achieved combined planning, mixed formations, and joint training. Third, changes in content. From the perspective of training subjects, there is more joint content, and it is more practical. It presents systemic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unity” has always been a keyword in Sino-Russian joint exercises. By performing a comparative analysis vis-à-vis the previous few exercises, we can see that there has been further improvement in the level of unity in this exercise. I feel that the way to measure the level of unity in the two countries’ joint exercises is to look at their planning and command. In this exercise, a term that we often use is “combined planning.” First of all, a Russian military command branch center was established under joint command, and we developed a unified, Chinese-Russian bilingual joint information system. By building a Chinese-Russian joint command information system, we can more effectively achieve video and data links and communication with the Russian army, allowing us to share data and situation information, while unifying combat rules and laying a good foundation for joint operations by the two armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This training content enables us to experience the improvement in Chinese military training skills and the new breakthroughs in warfare. There have also been new breakthroughs in joint command combat capabilities. By relying on network information systems, the participating officers and soldiers build command links that operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, this exercise amply embodies the high level of friendly Sino-Russian cooperation and embodies friendship and trust between the two militaries, unconstrained by time or place and unaffected by the pandemic. We know that this exercise was held against a background of a coronavirus pandemic that is continuing to spread and that is becoming more complex. There are many major activities that have been delayed or canceled — yet normalized, institutionalized Sino-Russian joint exercises not only have not been interrupted but are still continuously undergoing quality improvements and innovations. This demonstrates that the comprehensive Sino-Russian strategic collaborative partnership and the friendly relationship between the two militaries are continuously ascending to higher stages. In addition, this exercise demonstrates to the whole world the firm resolve of the Chinese and Russian militaries to uphold world peace and regional stability. China and Russia have always worked together to construct a fairer, more reasonable international order. As responsible powers, China and Russia are demonstrating to the world their resolve to continue to be defenders and upholders of regional peace and stability, while also providing a fright to those terroristic forces that wait for opportunities to manufacture terror incidents and disturb regional stability — and to the supporters behind such forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Military cooperation, including military exercises, is an important part of state relations and is the easiest way for outsiders to observe whether two countries are “allies.” From the participation of the J-20 to the amazingly open weapons interoperability, the concluded China-Russia Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic exercise presented many new points, highlighting the orderly and in-depth military cooperation between China and Russia in the new era and conveying to the outside world in a highly complex form that “China and Russia are not allies but are better than allies.” However, while the strategic significance of this high-level joint military exercise has been the subject of numerous analytical articles in various media, there are very few voices interpreting it from a purely military operational perspective. In fact, this joint Chinese-Russian military exercise was highly practical. The exercises included joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities. In particular, the two armies exhibited a greater degree of pragmatism in their participation in each other’s strategic exercises, where they were mixed and where they planned together to test the capabilities of troop reconnaissance, early warnings, and electronic information attacks. This article is a detailed review of the “dry goods” of the Chinese-Russian military exercise, using “battalion tactical group (BTG) tactics” as the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in addition to the United States and China, the Russian military is also exploring the construction of similar “synthetic battalions” and is likely to be carrying out battlefield practice in such places as Syria and eastern Ukraine. These practical experiences will be invaluable to the PLA in exploring the tactical use of synthetic battalions and making further adjustments to their construction. Although Chinese forces were invited to participate in Russia’s East 2018, Central 2019, and Caucasus 2020 strategic exercises, this indicates that the cooperation between Russian and Chinese armies in the field of joint exercises has entered a new stage and reached a new level. It also means that the PLA will enter a new level of understanding of Russian “BTG tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tactics of Russian BTGs, which have been refined on the battlefield, are not only evident in past Chinese-Russian joint military exercises but also in some unusual changes in the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise can be considered, to some extent, as “an experiment in supporting three to four battalion-sized tactical groups with tactical-level fire support and security forces in a high-intensity but limited-purpose battlefield confrontation.” The relevance of this model is precisely that these are the shortcomings of Russian BTG tactics that have been revealed in actual combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these new BTGs have demonstrated a relatively high level of combat capability during their involvement in Ukraine and Syria and have changed the stereotypical and conservative image of the Russian military, they are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and they are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military. They are prone to be paralyzed by advanced adversaries like the U.S. Army in high-intensity battlefields by knocking out their nodes. Although our synthetic battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance and even possess many weapons and equipment that the Russians do not, their digitization and informatization capabilities are close to those of the U.S. military, and their command and combat systems are very similar to those of the U.S. military, [but] it is difficult to verify their tactical rationality because they have not been hardened by combat. Considering that both militaries need to deal with high-intensity ground warfare and even face a common strategic competitor, the China-Russian Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise provides an opportunity for the two militaries to learn from each other’s strengths and complement each other’s weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military exercises are the most sensitive activity in the relationship between two countries, and mutual participation in internal strategic exercises is the highest level of military cooperation. In recent years, the PLA has been advancing at a rapid pace that is visible to the naked eye. Synthetic battalions have become the main combat force of the PLA’s ground forces, integrating many advantages such as miniaturization, versatility, streamlining, and modularity, [while] highlighting the concepts of information dominance, system support, elite combat, and joint victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this new quality of combat capability still requires the lubrication of actual battlefield experience to realize its military competitive value more effectively. That is why it was significant to exchange in-depth tactical “experiences” with the Russian Army through the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise, which is also an excellent reflection of the fact that “there is no limit, no forbidden zone, no upper limit” for Chinese-Russian strategic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relations between China and Russia in the space industry have intensified sharply in recent years. The two powers have their own rockets and launch sites, are building their own satellites, and are planning an interplanetary expedition, but without joint cooperation, neither Moscow nor Beijing will be able to solve a number of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space program has become a top priority for China: its budget and ambition leave no doubt that Beijing intends to significantly strengthen its position in the space industry over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secret of success is large financial injections, persistence, and Russian technology, which helped the Chinese space program to make a significant leap in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between Russia and China in the space industry is based on two documents: an intergovernmental agreement of December 18, 1992, and an interagency agreement of March 25, 1994. Since the early 2000s, the parties have promoted the idea of joint research and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, but for a long time there was no talk about a breakthrough cooperation. The situation began to change in 2014, when after the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the United States vetoed the supply of high-tech products; a ban was also imposed on the electronic component base that was used in satellite construction. The space industry had some reserves, but it was necessary to look for a complete substitute for U.S. products in the short term. A suitable replacement was found in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Russia and China discussed the possibility of creating a joint space station. However, N. Eismont of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences notes that space exploration cannot be a purely national task. According to him, the Chinese side, which plans to start building a multi-module space station in the next few years, is interested in the Russian experience of long-term space flights and construction of large space objects. In addition, Beijing lacks a number of important technologies and is ready to offer its partnership to Moscow in exchange for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, in a sense, due to the U.S. position, China is in a kind of isolation. For many years now, the United States has been doing everything possible to prevent the development of science and technology in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why China is looking for other partners, and the result of this search, to a large extent, is the cooperation that the Russian Federation is developing/offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, the space sector [of cooperation] was [following] the general trend of development of Russian-Chinese relations, which began to sharply improve after the sanctions against Russia were imposed by Europe and the United States. China is extremely interested in buying Russian RD180 engines, which could be used in Chinese rocket production, while Russia is interested in supplying Chinese space radio-electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both sides have shown considerable interest in such cooperation. In summer 2016, the governments of Russia and China signed an agreement on measures to protect technologies in the exploration and use of outer space: in other words, the Chinese side will not be able to engage in unlicensed copying of Russian products. This was the main condition that Moscow put forward for the beginning of substantive negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the logic of this decision is simple: with a huge number of opponents and lack of like-minded people, it is necessary to be friends with China. All the more so because in the conditions of economic recession, when industry funding is constantly being sequestered, it is almost impossible for Russia to implement projects like the lunar or Mars missions on its own. The success of China’s space program raises the legal question of whether it will compete with Russia. After all, Russia’s position in space is not only one of the undeniable reasons of national pride, but also a significant source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, according to V. Kashin, a leading researcher of the Institute of Air Force Development of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russians do not consider the Chinese as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are no concerns about being squeezed out of the commercial launch sector. Production costs in China are already higher than in our country. At the same time, salaries in dollar terms in the Chinese rocket industry are several times higher. This became especially obvious after the devaluation of the ruble.” A. Ionin, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics named after A.A. Tsiolkovsky, believes that the Chinese are simply not interested in the commercial cosmonautics market. “They have too many national tasks, and commercial launches are not the main priority here. China does not need the money.” In addition, China is still under U.S. sanctions, and this prevents it from reaching the most profitable customers from Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Malchushkin, “Перспективы российско-китайского сотрудничества в космической отрасли в 2020-е годы” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=44055870&quot;&gt;Prospects for Russian-Chinese Cooperation in the Space Sector in the 2020s, Blagoveshchenskii State Pedagogical University, 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editor’s Note: This article is not written by leading Russian scholars; however, the authors cover strategic goals and challenges and provide a useful framework for understanding the negative and positive outcomes of Russian-Chinese cooperation in space (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current trends in the world aerospace field allow us to speak about the beginning of a new space race. The key feature of the increased interest in exploration of extraterrestrial spaces is a significant expansion of private sector capabilities in the field of design and launch of transport and manned spacecraft — we are talking primarily about large non-state corporations of this industry (for example, the “Space Exploration Technologies Corporation” of American entrepreneur Elon Musk, “Blue Origin” of American billionaire Jeffrey Bezos, or “Boeing,” the transnational aviation giant).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Russian Federation, maintaining and expanding its existing position in the space industry is one of the highest priorities at the moment. The significance of the issue lies not only in the need for Russia to retain its status as a space power, which it inherited together with the technical potential of the Soviet Union as the legal successor of the latter. The developed world’s close attention to near-Earth space and other planets for the purposes of scientific study and possible militarization determines the desire of Russia to at least prevent a technological lag in space exploration, and at most claim equal participation in the use of extraterrestrial resources. The complicated geopolitical situation that developed in the mid-2010s forces Russia to strengthen cooperation in the space sphere with its strategic partners, among which the People’s Republic of China has traditionally occupied a key position recently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For China, which in many ways faces similar foreign policy realities as Russia, space is also of great value. The space program of the “Celestial Empire,” despite its relatively short existence, has already demonstrated significant success in the field of space robotics and communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, China naturally faces the question of whether it should maintain cooperation with Russia in the aerospace industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has a significant material and resource base for the implementation of the space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, however, China fully covers the technological needs for the design and modernization of the rocket fleet with its own production; development of a reusable spacecraft (the “Shenlong”) is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;External and internal destabilizing factors have no significant impact on the implementation of China’s space projects. The COVID-19 epidemic, which began in China in late 2019, has not prevented CASC from conducting four rocket launches since the beginning of 2020. In terms of foreign policy, China’s space ambitions also meet little resistance from Western countries, especially the United States, due to the latter’s increased attention to Mars exploration. If the current conditions remain unchanged, it is safe to say that China is highly likely to achieve its goals of launching its own space station and landing taikonauts on the lunar surface. As for Russia, the foundation of the Russian space industry was laid during the Soviet Union, and by the beginning of the 2020s, Russia managed to be firmly entrenched in the top three space powers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The level of technical development of the Russian space industry meets the requirements for maintaining a position in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning to the most urgent problems of Russian cosmonautics, we emphasize that in recent years there has been a negative trend towards stagnation in the rate of rocket launches relative to other leading space powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to preserving the number of launches, a significant problem at present is the pronounced costliness of the industry and the corruption of related enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the growing competition on the part of private U.S. corporations, it is possible that in the future Russian rockets will be unprofitable to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the prospects for Russian-Chinese cooperation, let us review current joint space arrangements. In September 2019, at a regular meeting of the heads of the governments of Russia and China, Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Rogozin and CNSA head Zhang Kejian agreed to cooperate in the creation of a data center for lunar projects and deep space, as well as in the coordination of the “LunaResource-1” space mission in 2022 and “Chang’e-7” in 2023. A year earlier, there had been talks about bilateral participation in the creation of a Chinese orbital station, and in November 2017, Russian and Chinese state corporations signed a program of cooperation in the space field for 2018–2022. Despite the largely declarative nature of these statements, there is a clear trend towards strengthening the partnership between Russia and China, which is due to the aggressive external environment and long-term cooperation in this industry. What are the possible scenarios for the development of cooperation between Russia and China in the foreseeable future? Despite a declared commitment to a productive dialogue, the rapid technological growth of the Celestial Empire in rocket and space exploration is obvious, and its ambitions to explore other planets and outer space question the necessity of involving other countries, including Russia. An important factor is the role of external powers that also are aiming to maintain a presence in space: the United States and India, which is actively developing its own space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasily Kashin, “Россия и Китай ответят на создание космических войск США – эксперт,” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasia.expert/rossiya-i-kitay-otvetyat-na-sozdanie-kosmicheskikh-voysk-ssha/&quot;&gt;Russia and China Answer to the Creation of Space Forces by the USA – Expert, Eurasia Expert, September 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outer space has already become a military platform. Space systems are now necessary for a number of key weapon systems, in particular munitions with satellite guidance and unmanned aerial vehicles with long flight times. These weapons systems do not live without space at all, but all the rest also depend on space to some degree. Accordingly, ensuring the operation of the entire space infrastructure, including space-based communications, positioning, and reconnaissance assets, becomes a priority issue. The development of means to combat space objects is also becoming a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States has lost much of its former military superiority in many other areas, but so far no one can match them in space. Trump’s decision to create a separate kind of military force is designed to maximize U.S. superiority and achieve overwhelming dominance in space. Other countries, including China and Russia, will have to respond to it to some degree, and so there will be an arms race in space. The placement of weapons in space will not necessarily come immediately. It may not happen for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is building up its forces very strongly now, and it is the number two power in the world (Russia is number three) in terms of satellite constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space is becoming increasingly important precisely because of the development of new types of weapons: drones, satellite-guided precision munitions, and space reconnaissance systems. In the Cold War era, these means were much more primitive and had longer reaction times, but now you have the opportunity to take them to another level. An important factor in the future will be the development of artificial intelligence technologies, which will allow a new level of processing of space reconnaissance data, dramatically increase its effectiveness, and possibly change the approaches to nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space remains primarily in the military [domain]. All this piloted space flight is ornamentation, while military space operations are on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prestige reasons, China is promoting the development of science, and we are lagging behind here. We have no resources, and there is only a weak organizational capability. We are able to solve some military tasks, but we cannot compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have cooperation, of course. The golden age was in the 1990s and 2000s, when China’s manned program and many other programs rose largely due to Russian technology. Now the Chinese are already sensing their own strength and “advancement,” and maybe their need for cooperation with us is no longer so high, although it continues. At the dawn of the crisis and the aggravation of relations with the West in 2014, when we were cut off from the supply of components, there was talk that we would supply new types of powerful rocket engines to China, and that the Chinese would help us establish production of electronic parts and components for space. It is not clear where that went — apparently it hasn’t worked out yet, but these are usually long negotiations. We will see more and more closure of these cooperation programs, because the U.S. sanctions pressure on Russia and China is growing. However, cooperation will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main goal is to create the information infrastructure that enables the use of weapons on Earth. That is, it is the provision of reconnaissance and positioning resources, without which the effective use of high-precision weapons is impossible. Accordingly, the use of high-precision weapons spurs the development of space systems, and new capabilities of space systems, in turn, lead to new high-precision weapons. In the future, demand will increase further by the development of robotic complexes and systems and the further development of unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the other side will have an even greater need, first, to interfere with satellite positioning and communication systems and reconnaissance, and second, to be able to shoot down these satellites. This will all develop at an increasing rate for the foreseeable future. An additional factor that affects the arms race in space is the development of missile defense systems, since ground-based missiles for hitting targets are a side effect of the development of missile defense. They are often just a variant of a missile defense application that sometimes needs some small change in software. And, because, again, missile defense is developing at a high rate in several countries, we will see an increase in the number of threats to satellites and, therefore, attempts to protect them. At some point, we will also see the placement of weapons in space, but that probably won’t be the first thing that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a priority for China to push science forward, because their main field of competition with the United States is in science and technology. Through this, China greatly increases its national prestige, because they are already the second country in the world in the field of space research. Since their investments and potential are growing, they have a chance of someday standing on an equal footing and competing for primacy. In many ways, this reproduces the picture of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-documents-on-sino-russian-cooperation-in-space-and-cyber&quot;&gt;Chinese Documents on Sino-Russian Cooperation in Space and Cyber&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He Qisong and Ye Nishan, “中国与俄罗斯太空合作分析” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://r.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=ELSY202104008&amp;amp;dbcode=CFJD&amp;amp;dbname=CFJDTEMP&quot;&gt;Analysis of Space Cooperation between China and Russia, Russian Studies Journal, no. 4, August 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this overall background, bilateral space cooperation has gradually intensified and is a concrete expression of the improvement and upgrading of relations between the two countries. In order to preserve space security, national security, and the stability of the international strategic landscape, China and Russia maintain close cooperation on space diplomacy, the objective being to create an external environment conducive to national development. When it comes to space technology cooperation, geopolitical factors play an important role. The space development dynamics of China and Russia, as well as the U.S. strategy of space hegemony (including space weaponization policies and practices), are the key variables in space technology cooperation between the two sides. The expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation dovetails with the development of political relations between the two countries in response to changes in space geopolitics and also has an impact on the shaping of space geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an overall perspective, China-Russia space technology cooperation since the end of the Cold War can be roughly divided into two stages, with the Ukraine crisis in 2014 as the dividing line. The first stage was one of shallow cooperation, mainly in the form of a bilateral “buying and selling relationship.” After the Ukraine crisis, space cooperation between the two countries further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined. In 1970, China successfully launched the “Dongfanghong-1” satellite, thus entering the space club. Although this achievement was the result of China’s self-reliance and hard work, it should not be overlooked that China’s move into space also benefited from the assistance of the Soviet Union: China’s launch vehicle technology originated from Soviet assistance in ballistic missile technology, and the Soviet Union trained a number of young scientists and engineers for the development of China’s aerospace endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the resolution of border issues between China and Russia in the 1990s, bilateral relations were gradually improved and enhanced, and space cooperation could be realized. The 1992 agreement on intergovernmental space cooperation between China and Russia and the 1994 cooperation agreement between the space ministries of the two countries were the beginnings of bilateral space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral space cooperation after the Cold War began in the manned spaceflight field. After China established its manned space program, Russia provided the reference for China’s design of the Shenzhou series of spacecraft. The Russian side not only supplied China with spacesuits but also trained Chinese astronauts and provided technical support for their first spaceflight activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until 2006, the two countries generally cooperated in three areas: satellites, space science, and basic components. In 2007, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement on the joint exploration of Mars — with the Russian Mars probe “Phobos-Grunt” (Фобос-Грунт) to carry the Chinese probe “Yinghuo-1,” and the Russian space-based observatory to be used for joint deep space exploration — but the project was scrubbed due to the failure of the Russian launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before 2014, however, China-Russia space technology cooperation still lagged behind the two countries’ political engagement. After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, space cooperation between the two sides entered a new phase in which cooperation not only expanded in breadth but also increased in depth. Cooperation on positioning and navigation satellites was the starting point of the new phase of cooperation between the two countries. The United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia under the pretext of the Ukraine crisis, including a ban on the export to Russia of satellite-borne electronic equipment, which is precisely one of Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During President Putin’s visit to China in 2016, the Russian and Chinese governments signed an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in the field of space technology, clearing away legal barriers to the development of in-depth cooperation in space technology between the two countries. In September 2017, the two countries finalized the Outline of China-Russia Space Cooperation for 2018–2022, which includes projects on lunar and deep space development, rocket engine and satellite-borne electronic equipment transactions, etc. This is the first five-year agreement between the two countries. It is within this framework that the two countries have realized the vision of cooperation agreed upon several years ago: the purchase of Russian RD-180 rocket engines by China and the export of satellite electronics to Russia. The two countries also held negotiations in 2018 on the joint production of RD-180 rocket engines. A key point in the implementation of the five-year outline of space cooperation is to take substantial steps in lunar and other deep-space exploration fields. After the United States and other Western countries closed the door to cooperation with it, Russia has clearly strengthened its willingness to engage in lunar exploration with China, looking to make up for its failure to go to the moon during the Cold War era with a successful lunar landing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, the two countries discussed the possibility of cooperation in lunar research and deep space exploration, and in 2019 they signed an agreement to establish a data center for lunar and deep space exploration to share relevant information, including on the moon and Mars. . . . This is a historic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia have also taken important steps in cooperation involving the space security field. If the above-mentioned cooperation in space is limited to the peaceful use of space, cooperation between the two countries in the anti-missile and missile early warning system fields is cooperation on space security. Following cyber anti-missile exercises in 2016 and 2017, President Putin announced at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system, which will significantly increase China’s defense capabilities. Only Russia and the United States currently possess missile early warning systems, which include both space-based and ground-based systems. Russia’s assistance on China’s construction of a missile early warning system, whether by helping China develop space-based sensors, building ground-based radar systems, or sharing software and information for space-based and ground-based warning systems, will enhance China’s anti-missile capabilities and sky monitoring capabilities. In addition, in December 2020, China and Russia extended their agreement on mutual notification of missile launches. Given the U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty and the global arms control regime suffering another setback, the continued strengthening of China-Russia cooperation and coordination on mutual notification of ballistic missiles and on-launch vehicles contributes to global strategic stability and security. If in the previous phase of China-Russia space cooperation the two countries only cooperated at a superficial level, the recent phase of space cooperation between the two sides has significantly expanded and deepened. It not only includes the sale of components but has also deepened into cooperation in space technology and space science and further expanded into the field of space security. China-Russia space cooperation has thus taken substantial steps. As China’s space technology continues to make strides, large-scale space projects — including the BeiDou system and deep space exploration on the moon and Mars — are advancing steadily and making great achievements, while Russia is under sanctions from the United States and other Western countries and its space budget is restricted. This has affected the progress of space projects, making Russia change its past “strong” posture and negotiate with China on an equal footing, which in turn reflects the win-win nature of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While one can say that the above China-Russia space technology cooperation is divided into two phases, before and after [the 2014 Ukraine crisis], space diplomacy cooperation between the two countries has maintained a close posture ever since the end of the Cold War, because space is tightly linked to international security and national security. As is well known, the advent of the space age was closely tied to the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race. Space is the “eyes and ears” of strategic nuclear forces and is an extremely important aid in strategic deterrence. With the development of space technology, satellites not only became information platforms that provide services and facilitation for military operations — such as communications, weather, and navigation — but also firepower platforms or firepower delivery platforms. As a result, satellites became military force “multipliers” and “enablers,” and a space dominance doctrine also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under circumstances where diplomatic efforts were unable to curb the U.S. weaponization of space, some countries had to take countermeasures, developing and stockpiling anti-satellite weapons, and thus opening the curtain on a new round of the space arms race. Space-based and ground-based kinetic anti-satellite weapons, directed energy anti-satellite weapons, and cyber and radio frequency anti-satellite weapons have emerged or will soon emerge. Given the irreplaceable role of space and its technologies for economic and social development, the weaponization of space not only threatens the safety of satellites operating in orbit but also has serious negative effects on economic development and social welfare. Furthermore, the increasingly close integration of space with the command and control systems of a country’s military leads to potentially huge threats to national security. More importantly, the integration of space and nuclear strategic forces, along with the weaponization of space, can have serious and potentially disruptive effects on international strategic balance and stability. In short, the weaponization of space is a threat to world peace and can also cause enormous damage to economic development and social welfare. To strengthen national security and promote economic development, as well as to maintain international security, China and Russia cooperate with each other in summit diplomacy and in multilateral processes, taking practical actions to prevent the arms race in space and the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the United States moved to implement theater missile defense systems and a national missile defense system, China and Russia judged that the United States was likely to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and therefore called on the United States to comply with it. The November 1998 Joint Statement on Sino-Russian Relations at the Turn of the Century, the December 1999 Sino-Russian Joint Statement, and the July 2000 Joint Statement on Anti-Ballistic Missile Issues all emphasized that the ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of international strategic stability, and that the U.S. development of a national missile defense system and construction of ABM systems would have destructive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, the United States has not only expanded its ABM system in spite of the international community’s opposition, but it has also deployed the “Shore-based Aegis” system and the “SAD” system in Europe and Asia, and further developed and stockpiled space weapons, sharply increasing the threat that space will be weaponized and turned into a zone of military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2019, the heads of state of China and Russia once again expressed their concerns and worries. Calling on all countries to work to ban the weaponization of space, they said that U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty undermines strategic stability and triggers an arms race; the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and especially “the development of its strategic anti-missile systems, and its plans to deploy them in different regions of the world and in space, continue to have serious negative repercussions for international and regional strategic balance, and security stability,” and “the real prospect of an arms race in space, and its evolution into a frontier of military conflict, threaten strategic stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the originator of the weaponization of space in the post-Cold War era was the United States, and the goal of preventing an arms race in space and controlling space armaments can only be truly achieved by reaching a legally binding international treaty with the United States prohibiting the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral relations have made a qualitative leap, and a new type of Sino relations has been established that is “non-Russian aligned, nonconfrontational, and not targeted at third parties,” and political friendship and trust have laid a firm foundation for in-depth cooperation between the two countries in various fields. China-Russia space technology cooperation is the result of the deepening development of relations between China and Russia, whether that cooperation is in space equipment (e.g., rockets, satellite-borne electronics), joint technology research (e.g., space materials), data cooperation (e.g., deep space exploration information), or technical and policy cooperation involving space security. It is a concrete manifestation of the close relationship between the two countries. The expansion and deepening of once nonexistent space cooperation between the two countries also resulted from the respective space development dynamics of China and Russia, while the United States has been a key variable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, at times of great achievements in China’s manned spaceflight, BeiDou system, and lunar exploration projects, or when they were about to make great achievements or afterwards, Russia significantly slowed down the process of space cooperation with China. “This kind of cooperation was modest in scale in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and this momentum has waned since then.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty in advancing such cooperation lay partly in the fact that Russia and China had yet to sign an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in space fields, but the real reason was that Russia considered itself technologically advanced in space and feared that “serious” cooperation with China would develop China into a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is well known, launch vehicle engines are indeed the core technical components of missiles. Russia banned the export of RD-180 rocket engines to China on the grounds that doing so would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime. Russia let the engines be sold to the United States, however, and even after being subjected to U.S. sanctions, it did not use the mechanism mentioned above to initiate counter-sanctions. This once again showed that Russia did not want to promote the improvement of Chinese space technology through cooperation and turn China into a competitor. On the one hand, in the first phase Russia generally considered its space technology superior to China’s, so cooperation in space was a “gift” to China. On the other hand, with the development of Chinese space technology, including manned spaceflight, Russia was wary of cooperation because it feared that China would overtake it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the existence of a significant portion of pro-Western forces within Russia and the sowing of discord between Russia and China by the United States and the West, from a power transfer point of view, Russia’s decline from Soviet-era superpower to one of the world’s top powers resulted in a significant psychological disconnect, and feelings about China’s rise were complicated. Therefore, in the first phase of China-Russia space cooperation, Russia did not have a sincere desire to cooperate with China. At that time, Russia preferred to cooperate with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, although Russia extended an olive branch of space cooperation to China to promote Sino-Russian relations and alleviate the strategic pressure exerted on it by the United States, the European Union, and NATO, it feared that cooperation between the two countries would promote China’s technological progress in space, thereby diminishing its voice in Sino-Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the technological gap, the degree of Russian-Chinese space cooperation was not as high as Russian-U.S. space cooperation, so Russian-Chinese space cooperation was limited to a buying and selling relationship for some time. More importantly, Russia’s fear that China’s rise would impinge upon its political and economic interests led to further conservatism in China-Russia cooperation in science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis in Ukraine — and especially the annexation of Crimea by Russia — led the West to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, once again demonstrating that the West fundamentally distrusts Russia and still sees Russia as a security threat, especially with Biden having called Putin a “killer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the influence of Western sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry and the aging and loss of S&amp;amp;T personnel — including in the space field — have combined to further slow the development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and there are even difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, development of China’s space industry has been rapid, especially in the twenty-first century, and China’s space technology has become increasingly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development of China’s space technology and industry and the advancement of its space program have propelled China’s rapid space power development. Russia’s space technology, industry, and program have progressed more slowly, and the pace of its development has been far below China’s. China’s leap in space technology has led to a relatively substantial reduction in Russia’s overall space advantage, and its sense of superiority has fallen along with it. While Russia still has certain advantages, by expanding and deepening cooperation with China and mutually complementing advantages with China in the fields of deep space exploration and navigation satellites Russia can exchange its advantages for technologies and equipment it does not have, based on the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, Russia decided to cooperate in the field of positioning and navigation satellites, which was a breakthrough in space cooperation with China. In this second stage, Russia is cooperating with China in space technology on an equal footing, with almost no sense of superiority, and it has provided China with missile early warning system technology while China has given Russia corresponding assistance in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the process of China-Russia space cooperation, there are three aspects that indeed surpass the geopolitical considerations between China and Russia, and this is beyond doubt. First, China-Russia space cooperation promotes the development of space technology in both countries and plays an important role in forming a stable China-U.S.-Russia triangular relationship in space, which is in the interests of both countries. . . . Secondly, the two countries’ close cooperation on launch vehicle engines and global navigation systems, and their commitment to cooperation on an international lunar station, etc., will not only contribute to the joint progress of Russian and Chinese space technology but will also help in building strategic stability and a balanced landscape in space, in making space a common heritage of all mankind, and in striving to put into practice the principles and purposes of the peaceful uses of space as established in the preamble and Article I of the Outer Space Treaty. And thirdly, space cooperation between the two countries will be conducive to the development of the space production chains of both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, they can also give full play to their comparative advantages in the space field, expand and extend production chains, form a new division of labor system, drive the development of technology overall, and enhance their ability to resist Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space cooperation between China and Russia has enhanced mutual political trust between the two countries and further deepened their strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between the two countries on space diplomacy will further consolidate and deepen the strategic partnership. China and Russia alike face strategic pressure from U.S. antimissile systems and space weapons, and the two countries have cooperated with each other at the United Nations, the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the Conference on Disarmament, making ceaseless efforts to prevent an arms race in space and contribute to the maintenance of global strategic stability, as well as making arduous efforts to build a fair and just space governance system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation is the result of space geopolitics, and space cooperation between the two countries will likewise reshape space geopolitics. It will contribute to the relative stability of the space order, specifically by contributing to the multipolarity of space; prevent celestial bodies such as the moon from being enclosed by the United States and other countries; and prevent the weaponization of space, which will have an important impact on the formation of the future rules of space governance and the shaping of the future space landscape. The key to maintaining a multipolar space hinges on a relatively stable China-U.S.-Russia space triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with the outbreak of the [2014] crisis in Ukraine, and especially since the Trump administration took office, the space landscape has taken on an asymmetrical character, with an almost entirely one-sided tilt toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend is detrimental to the stability of the space landscape. With the expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation, there is bound to be rapid development of mutual cooperation between their research institutes and enterprises, whether in state-led space projects or in commercial space projects, and the number of state-owned satellites and commercial satellite constellations launched by the two countries will certainly increase a great deal, narrowing the gap with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In view of the attempts of the United States and other Western countries to seek sovereignty over celestial bodies under the pretext of deep space exploration and planetary resource development, China and Russia have repeatedly signed agreements on deep space exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies, jointly exploring and landing on the moon, establishing their own lunar bases, and setting up a joint lunar research station open to the world. This indicates to the world that any attempt by any country to use advanced technology to enclose the moon and Mars will be strongly opposed by China and Russia, which are determined to preserve the status and properties of the moon and other celestial bodies as a global commons and the common heritage of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weaponization of space by the United States and its allies in NATO and elsewhere is undoubtedly causing damage to the peaceful use of space, as well as to global strategic stability and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, China and Russia possess some degree of antisatellite capability, and they have held joint cyber anti-missile exercises as a direct response to the United States’ weaponization of space and refusal to conclude an international treaty banning the weaponization of space. Although the two countries’ space cooperation does not directly involve anti-satellite content, cooperation in the field of space technology, which is dual-use technology, has a strong connotations of a military alliance in space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, President Putin announced in 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system. This was a strong signal that the two countries are cooperating substantively in the military space field, enhancing the defense partnership between Russia and China, and potentially forming a joint Sino-Russian anti-missile system. The possibility of Russia exporting to China S-500 anti-missile systems with anti-space weapon capabilities in the event of a deteriorating space situation is not ruled out, nor is the possibility of China-Russia cooperation in anti-space technology. According to U.S. reports, China and Russia have different anti-missile capabilities and technologies, with Russia’s space-based co-orbital “nesting doll” anti-satellite technology and China’s mid-range anti-missile technology and antisatellite technology each having its own advantages. Cooperation between China and Russia on anti-satellite technology could be a nightmare for U.S. satellites. Until there is a treaty banning the weaponization of space, China-Russia space cooperation, especially military cooperation in space, is a strong cornerstone for preventing space from being weaponized and turned into a battlefield. The highly developed Sino-Russian military relationship is a key factor in promoting global strategic stability, and it has played an important role in maintaining global and regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the imbalance in Chinese, U.S., and Russian space power, neither China nor Russia alone can stop the United States from pursuing its stated strategies and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation, especially the establishment of a joint lunar research station, is a concrete attempt to implement the concept of global governance of ”negotiation, joint construction, and sharing” and to build a community of human destiny in space, and it is also a way for China to provide Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom for changing space governance. As to whether the above goals can be achieved, or whether there will be one pole in space led by the United States and another pole with China and Russia jointly, depends to some extent on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-documents-on-sino-russian-understandings-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Russian Documents on Sino-Russian Understandings of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Китай и Россию сближает угроза гибридной войны: Медведь и панда на службе миру” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/53176&quot;&gt;China and Russia Are Brought Closer by the Threat of a Hybrid War: Bear and Panda in the Service of the World, Military-Industrial Courier, October 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The correlation between the concepts of “cultural focus” and “strategic culture” is an important subject for another study. Let me merely point out the closeness of the cultural focuses of Russia and China, which reflects the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict. An important step in strengthening the strategic partnership was the decision of the Russian Federation to deploy a Missile Defense Alarm System (MIDAS) in the PRC. Until now, only the United States and Russia had such a system. Now, China will join them. The decision testifies to the real depth of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation and the degree of trust between Moscow and Beijing. The latter will have at its disposal a complex of special technical means for detecting ballistic missiles, calculating their trajectory, and transmitting information to the command center, which is then reported as an attack on the state with the use of missile weapons, prompting an urgent decision on the response. There are also other steps to deepen the relations, particularly in terms of the development of measures to counter any hybrid aggression from the United States and the West as a whole, which may aim at both our countries. In this context, it would be interesting to study the approaches of Russia and China to confronting a hybrid war and a “color revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opinions of authoritative Russian experts on hybrid warfare can be summarized as follows: the term is of Western origin. The theory of hybrid warfare, which was developed in the West, is now being tested all over the world. Its essence lies in the complex use of hard and soft power tools, in erasing the differences between war and peace, which is an important feature of the conflicts of the twenty-first century. . . . Hybrid warfare is characterized by high adaptability to the conditions in which it is prepared and conducted; a continuity and connection with “color revolutions”; and multidimensional struggle in the military, informational, economic, political, socio-cultural, and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov. . . . Our response is based on active defense, which relies on theoretical studies and substantiation of a set of measures primarily aimed at the preventive neutralization of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the type of interstate confrontation studied by Sun Tzu is what we call “hybrid warfare.” The Chinese strategist formulated its conceptual essence: to achieve victory over the enemy without fighting it, by avoiding direct military clashes with enemy armies. He argued that the best war is waged this way: first, by breaking the plans of the enemy; second, by breaking their alliances; and only then, by breaking their troops. For millennia, the essence of Chinese technologies to “live and survive” has been the desire to achieve the necessary results with as little effort and material costs as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technologies of the “color revolution” that Sun Tzu spoke about naturally interact with the hybrid warfare strategy. According to his plan, the main objective of a geopolitical attack during wars should, in fact, be the ruling elite of the enemy state — the ruler himself, his inner circle, and the military leaders, who must be actively influenced by various means — so as to “outplay them with a plan” and thus “prevent them from winning.” Geopolitical adversaries are trying to assign the authorship of the hybrid warfare strategy to Russia and China, arguing that today the all-encompassing integral strategy of geopolitical struggle — hybrid warfare and “color revolution” — are used by China in its competitive struggle with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it is the United States and its satellites that have long been trying to break up Russia and China, relying on the “fifth column” and other subversive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confrontation in the public mind is an important element of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the support of the armed forces, attack and defense are carried out in areas such as social media-based public opinion, electronic means of dissemination of information, psychology, and cyberattacks. Overwhelming advantage is then achieved through the use of a large number of precision weapons in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the assessments of hybrid warfare strategies made by Russian and Chinese experts are very similar. From a political point of view, it is important to have a common understanding that the initiators of hybrid warfare and “color revolutions” against geopolitical competitors have been invariably the United States and Western countries. Any recognition of a single source of threats to the national security of Russia and China should serve as a unifying factor in developing a strategy for joint countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To summarize, we should note that, for Russia’s relations with China in the context of the geopolitical confrontation with the United States and the West, it seems to be extremely important that we take into account one of the distinguishing features of the Chinese logic of thinking, which has shaped its national strategic culture. Its essence is that “a unity may split in two forces, but changes would follow through a combination of not two but three forces.” Thus, by the Chinese logic, one has to find and attract a third force in the face of a clear confrontation between two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktor Murakhovsky, “Безопасность страны как фундамент развития” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arsenal-otechestva.ru/article/1414-bezopasnost-strany-kak-fundament-razvitiya&quot;&gt;National Security as a Foundation for National Development, interview with Andrei Ilnitsky, Homeland’s Arsenal Journal, 51, no. 1, March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, under the influence of various currents of Western ideology, Russian society distressingly and increasingly crumbled from within. Today, we can see that part of both the Russian elite and society is ready to lean on currently fashionable Western ideological trends and lifestyles. Americans do not differentiate between informational, psychological, cyber operations, and electronic warfare, considering them as an equitable domain of a joint battle space in multidomain operations along with space, air, land, and water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, has unleashed an information-hybrid war against Russia. Its task is to overstrain Russia, to knock us off our targets, to unbalance the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this creates a new type of warfare. While in a classical war, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s manpower, in today’s cyberwars, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s infrastructure. In fact, the goal of the new warfare is to destroy the opponent’s identity and to change the mental and civilizational basis of the opponent’s society. I would call this type of warfare mental. Furthermore, if the manpower and infrastructure can at least be restored, the evolution of identity is an irreversible process, especially if the consequences of such mental warfare emerge only gradually — and only by skipping at least a generation, when it is too late to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the main weapon here is the World Wide Web; so, whoever owns it and provides its content has a strategic advantage. Unfortunately, we must admit that in this case the advantage is not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the merging of manipulative and cyber-strike means, followed by their gradual legalization as tools of influence against competitors and potential adversaries during peacetime, we urgently need to clarify the role that the Russian Armed Forces should play in such a setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital platforms and artificial intelligence technologies can also be actively used in the desovereignization of Russia by creating gaps in national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts know that, in the information war, there is only one tactic for victory — an offensive. So, to repel any aggressive attacks on our country, we should bring down the opponent’s agenda and seize the initiative. Now, should we then completely break off the cooperation with the West?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, no! We need a dialogue. The dialogue should not be just for the sake of a dialogue but from the platform of national interests, an example of which Putin gave at the Davos Club when he outlined our vision of the ways and scenarios of world development. I think and hope that, in the near future, “red lines” will be drawn on the geopolitical field, with the mapping of the landmarks of Russia’s national interests, which no one will be allowed to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just a few of the most important countermeasures: Internet sovereignty [and] strict blocking of the activities of foreign social media for spreading any information about unauthorized rallies and for any provocation of a protest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, avoids a direct military confrontation with Russia, as Russia is capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on them. The concept of a rapid global strike and the U.S. National Defense Strategy frankly states that the “hot war” should be preceded or completely replaced by the so-called proxy or hybrid war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Russia “does not change the minds” of our opponents, does not counteract or frustrate the aggressive plans of the United States and NATO, it will lose the initiative and be forced to maintain a passive defense in extremely unfavorable conditions. Inaction actually dooms our country to existence under the agenda imposed by Americans and their agents of influence. And this categorically does not correspond to Russia’s sovereign choice. Unfortunately, in Russia, the expert analytical support of the national security policy is far from optimal. We have not yet created an effective system corresponding to the new hybrid challenges. And the existing institutional and semantic field is broken down by departments and disciplines, which has left it unbalanced. We do not have an integrative center for development and decision making in national security, and we haven’t established a network of expert analytical institutions (think tanks) working and competing under a common government strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main task is to take measures to protect the space of our vital interests, primarily in the territories of our neighbors, many of which have been turned into theaters of a hybrid war against Russia. It is necessary to develop a strategy for a long-term confrontation in each direction, to look for a strong ally-partner to counter, who is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of a long-term strategy for joint struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, an important place should be given to maintaining, improving, and building up our intelligence potential, along with its mining and analytical structures, which are capable of carrying out systematic work to preempt enemy actions with the timely detection of non-traditional threats and the preparation of operational recommendations for their neutralization. The potential of forces and means of counterintelligence, special information structures, a well-established mechanism of military-civilian interaction and means of territorial defense should be able to guarantee the internal security of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to consider that the sources of advantage on the battlefield will shift from traditional factors, such as the size of forces and the level of weapons, to factors such as increased efficiency in obtaining and processing intelligence information based on modern forces and means as well as the computing power used in analysis, ensuring the security of strategic management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Разведка России в противостоянии гибридным угрозам” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nvo.ng.ru/nvo/2017-10-06/1_968_scouting.html&quot;&gt;The Role of Russian Intelligence in Countering Hybrid Wars, Independent Military Digest, June 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together with the CSTO, CIS, and SCO allies, we should take steps to update and coordinate our capabilities of implementing preventive strategic communication and optimize our use of monitoring to counter hybrid threats, including any indicators that enable quick predictions and recognition of any threatening situations in the administrative, political, socio-economic and cultural, and ideological areas. A priority area of our joint activities together with the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO should be to ensure our ability to reveal and fend off any threats of color revolutions in a timely fashion and to work ahead of the curve. To this end, within the framework of our joint strategy, we should develop plans to prepare for repelling any threat, introduce information exchange methods for allies and partners, and take joint steps to combat the financing of color revolutions. We should submit this as a priority project: adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO, and ensuring a response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions. We should explore military responses to hybrid threats by developing an appropriate regulatory framework through dialog, strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to countering hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Стратегии сдерживания и принуждения как инструменты дипломатии XXI века” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nic-pnb.ru/analytics/strategii-sderzhivani-ya-i-prinuzhdeniya-kak-instrumenty-diplomatii-xxi-veka/&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Coercion Strategies as Instruments of 21st Century Diplomacy, Scientific Research Center for Problems of National Security, April 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian–Chinese relations, we can attest to the advancement in their bilateral and multilateral interactions. Russia and China have developed a working mechanism for cooperation in the fields of information technology and cybersecurity. Their main working areas are: activities of the Russian–Chinese Subcommittee on Communications and Information Technologies (these concern the diversification of high-tech technology supply channels, including data storage systems and telecommunication equipment; the strengthening of network security; the improvement of management efficiency; and the development of the global information space); . . . interactions within the UN, SCO, and BRICS; . . . cooperation between the defense departments of the Russian Federation and China; . . . [and] dialogs and interactions among experts. . . . An important element in this mechanism has been the Russian–Chinese Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Ensuring International Information Security, signed in May 2015, which defines the areas of interaction in the information and digital areas. According to the document, countries will jointly respond to the most acute threats to international information security, while opposing any uses of information and communication technologies that may assist in any terrorist acts and/or interfere with internal affairs, undermine sovereignty or political stability, or incite ethnic or religious hatred, etc. This agreement has been of fundamental importance for the countries’ bilateral relations, despite its framework nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the process of solving any practical issues of cybersecurity, even within the SCO framework, has been quite complicated and confusing, despite the continual contacts and the existing agreement on cooperation between the countries. Cyber incidents have happened even between full members of the Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need to extend confidence-building measures to cyberspace are also dictated by the current state of affairs within the SCO, the RIC, and in the areas where the interests of the Eurasian countries, trying to build a new type of relations, generally intersect. However, achieving mutual trust in cyberspace has been one of the most difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been some progress in this direction. The defense departments of the Russian Federation and China have taken certain practical measures. These include, for example, staff network exercises. In December 2017, Russia and China held their second joint computer-aided command-and-staff missile defense exercise, Aerospace Security 2017. The first such exercises were held in May 2016 by the Central Research Institute of the Aerospace Defense Troops of the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in the summer of 2017, information appeared in the media about the study of technical capabilities for creating a joint Russian–Chinese technological platform for repelling cyber threats and reducing risks in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations. Today, the partners have created favorable conditions for further thematic dialogs through diplomatic, military, and other channels, and for exchanging information and communication technology products. All this may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace. The sphere of information and digital interaction between the parties has been gradually expanding. It involves the participation in the global management of the information environment, while observing one’s own interests and understanding that one’s partner has similar aspirations. The countries have also been working on creating the conditions for cooperation in the technological sphere and in the development and creation of modern technical means for counteracting and repelling cyber threats. Thus, despite the extreme complexity and inconsistency of the international conditions, Russia and China have managed to build positive cooperative interactions in the digital sphere and to accumulate constructive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Aiyong, “大国地缘政治竞争的新嬗变——以混合战争和灰色地带为例” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDAUTO&amp;amp;filename=JWDP202202007&quot;&gt;The New Transmutation of Geopolitical Competition among Great Powers – The Example of Hybrid Warfare and Gray Areas, Teaching and Research Journal, 2022, original version 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of targeting, hybrid warfare does not seek a head-to-head conflict between the great powers, but rather focuses on how to win hearts and minds. More specifically, U.S. hybrid warfare serves the need to preserve global hegemony, and its logic is offensive and globalist. Russian hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is used to restore Russia’s glory as a Eurasian power, and its logic is defensive and Eurasian. Both point to two key fringes: strategic pivot countries and the periphery of the great powers. The competition for strategic pivot states is intended to maintain and expand the international political influence of the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be seen that hybrid warfare has a distinct political attribute of serving the needs of great power competition; that is, it does not seek head-to-head confrontation between the great powers, but rather acquires geopolitical advantages by means of proxy wars or proxy destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a means of great power competition, the impact of hybrid warfare on the competitive process is extremely obvious. First, the violent nature of hybrid warfare and the competition for the peripheral zones of the great powers and strategic pivot areas are making indirect low-intensity conflicts between the great powers a reality. Second, the combined use of various instruments in hybrid warfare has forced the great powers to pay more attention to the way they use their forces and their composition while strengthening their armed forces. Third, the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Advisory Council summarizes gray-zone tactics into 10 categories: cyber and information warfare, covert operations, special forces, support for insurgent or terrorist activities, financing of nongovernmental actors, assistance to irregular forces, economic pressure, manipulation and undermining of democratic institutions, deliberate ambiguous actions, and explicit or implicit threats of force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic connotation of hybrid warfare also refers to the combined use of various means of destruction. The second aspect is the combined use of unconventional and conventional tools. A common tactic in gray-zone competition is the use of historical narratives, civilian intervention, fait accompli, psychological warfare, legal warfare, and other unconventional tools, which are coordinated with conventional tools such as alliance building, forward force presence, economic sanctions, and support for opposition forces to form a combined competitive force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geographic areas where great powers engage in geopolitical competition are usually on the periphery of another great power — that is, the strategic pivot areas and the periphery of the great powers — and in this respect, hybrid warfare, gray zones, and traditional great power competition are not dissimilar. The new twist, however, is that the great powers are increasingly focused on using “color revolutions,” cyberattacks, and narrative reshaping to induce changes within their rivals in their favor. For example, the “color revolution” as a hybrid warfare tandem configuration is an effort to magnify a certain imbalance in the field of economic and social development within the competitor country, support internal opposition and its base of activity — the fifth column, agents of foreign powers, and other forces — to create, when complemented by external forces, systemic crisis events within the competitor country. . . . This then creates the conditions for the use of coercive means to eventually destroy the legitimacy of the government’s actions or even overthrow it. This suggests a shift in the focus of the strategy of the great powers on the periphery of competition toward internal governance and the winning of hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of hybrid warfare and gray zones also poses new challenges and requirements for building national capacity to respond to international crises. Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy in the Ukraine crisis has put NATO’s proudly strong response mechanism into widespread question and caused NATO to be highly alarmed. This suggests that strong military forces alone cannot effectively respond to new crisis patterns and that maximizing the effectiveness of force use depends not only on the force itself but also on the coordination between force components to create maximum synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new transmutation of geopolitical competition among the great powers has brought inspiration to China. It shows that the means of competition are becoming more integrated, the process of competition is becoming increasingly blurred, and although the focus of competition revolves around the international order, the essence of competition is a struggle over the strength and weakness of national governance capacity. This has at least three implications for China’s response to the increasingly fierce geopolitical competition among the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One is to adhere to multilateralism and to mosaic international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;. . . . At the regional level, China can reduce the concerns of its neighbors about China’s rise by embedding its international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms and by using the construction and smooth operation of these mechanisms to realize its own preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second, it is necessary to establish a systemic concept to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers&lt;/em&gt;. . . . As China’s power grows and its international influence expands, it is especially important to fully estimate the possible international and regional spillover effects of domestic policies and to have the necessary response plans. In terms of timing, it is important to integrate current and future interests, to look to the future, and to reserve sufficient space for rules of action after national rejuvenation. In terms of concrete operations, while focusing on building hard and soft power it is also necessary to pay more attention to the organization and structure of forces and the coordinated use of various forces, so that they can demonstrate more flexible and coordinated response capabilities when dealing with emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third, the fundamental strategy to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers lies in “doing our own thing.”&lt;/em&gt; Although geopolitical competition among the great powers is an international phenomenon, it is fundamentally a competition between the strengths and weaknesses of internal governance capabilities of states. This is evident from the use of hybrid warfare and gray zones as a means of competition, focusing on creating psychological and physical chaos within competitors to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Chensheng, “中俄协作网络空间治理的基础与路径分析” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2018&amp;amp;filename=GJXW201709003&quot;&gt;Reflections on the Joint Prevention of ‘Color Revolutions’ in Russia and China, Eurasian Humanities Studies, 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “color revolutions” originally referred specifically to the regime changes that occurred in CIS countries at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the countries where “color revolutions” occurred, the opposition, with the support of Western countries, took advantage of the presidential and parliamentary elections to demonstrate against the government, using flowers, patterns, or clothing of a certain color as symbols in order to force the government leaders to step down and establish a pro-Western regime based on Western values.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be said that the “color revolutions” around the peripheral regions of Russia and China are only “pre-game warm-ups,” and that Russia and China are the ultimate targets of the “color revolutions” carried out by the United States and other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, as the United States and other Western countries have successfully implemented “color revolutions” in Central Asia and other regions, the circle of “color revolutions” against China and Russia has been quietly tightened. While actively promoting it externally, the United States and other Western countries are also trying to find a breakthrough in China and Russia, frequently meddling in the internal affairs of the two countries and staging despicable plays to subvert legitimate regimes in China and Russia. In addition, Biden has issued several tough statements against China and Russia since he took office. All these signs indicate that the threat of “color revolutions” in China and Russia is growing, and it is urgent for the two countries to cooperate to prevent “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and other Western countries, in collusion with reactionary separatists inside and outside of China, have openly fabricated and provoked China’s internal social problems in an attempt to dismantle China from within by means of “color revolutions.” Whether in the separatist activities of “Xinjiang independence” and “Tibet independence,” or in the Occupy Central rallies and “legislative amendment fiasco” in Hong Kon the West is behind them all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Russia has witnessed several large-scale demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin. Although it cannot be ruled out that some of these demonstrations do express some legitimate political demands of the people, the real situation is that the United States wants to use the social contradictions in Russia to fan the flames and maliciously intensify the conflict between the people and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, “color revolutions” tend to involve younger people. Compared to the traditional “color revolution” in which middle-aged people were the main force, the participants of the “color revolution” in recent years tend to be younger and younger, and students have become the vanguard of the “color revolution”. . . . Not only is the use of social media by the opposition much cheaper and more efficient, the instantaneous nature of social media messages is also more insidious and difficult to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One new development that we must pay particular attention to in terms of the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China is the arrival of Democrat Joe Biden in the White House in early 2021. Compared to his predecessor, Donald Trump, the possibility of a “color revolution” in the United States under Biden’s leadership has increased significantly, and the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China, as the main core targets, has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “the more turbulent the world becomes, the more resolute Chinese-Russian cooperation will be.” China and Russia will build a model of strategic mutual trust, firmly support one another in defending their core vital interests, jointly oppose “color revolutions,” combat all kinds of disinformation, and safeguard the autonomy and security of each regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese and Russian media must strengthen cooperation and effectively carry out international public opinion guidance and public opinion struggles. At present, the dominance of international public opinion is firmly held by Western countries led by the United States. . . . Faced with the powerful public opinion offensive of the West, China and Russia should not simply defend themselves and respond passively but should also make joint statements, take the initiative, and actively engage in a war of international public opinion with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SCO and CSTO are both regional security organizations, and maintaining regional security and stability is a common goal for both. At present, most of the SCO and CSTO member states are common members of both organizations, and most of them are countries at high risk of “color revolutions.” Therefore, it is very important for the two to cooperate in dealing with “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should intensify their military exercises to jointly respond to external interventions. During the political crisis in Belarus in 2020, the opposition fled abroad after the failure of the planned “color revolution” only to receive strong support from Western countries, with plans to launch another campaign to seize power from abroad. For example, the leader of the Belarusian opposition, Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Poland, was given an official residence in the capital as a “presidential palace in exile,” while Lithuania helped her set up an opposition coordination committee in the Lithuanian capital. In addition, Europe and the United States have pressured Belarusian authorities to overthrow Lukashenko’s regime through verbal intimidation, threats of sanctions, and leading NATO troops up to the Belarusian border. In the face of dual pressure from the domestic opposition and the external military, the government in power is usually unable to cope. For this reason, the two organizations should focus on strengthening military exercises with emphasis on emergency response in case of intervention by external forces in member states so that member states will have the strength to resist “color revolution” attempts in the face of external intervention. For example, shortly after the outbreak of the Belarusian crisis, the CSTO held the Indestructible Brotherhood 2020 joint military exercise in Belarus in response to NATO’s provocations on the Belarusian border. In the future, the SCO should also strengthen the organization of targeted military exercises in similar emergency situations to prevent external forces from violently interfering in the internal affairs of the organization’s member states. At the same time, the two organizations can attempt to conduct cross-organizational military exercises to jointly defend peace and tranquility in Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should strengthen exchanges and communication between member states and work together to deal with the threat of “color revolutions.” The SCO and CSTO should conduct security dialogues on the topic of “color revolutions” so that countries can share and exchange information within the organization, conduct risk assessments of “color revolutions” in relevant countries, and then formulate countermeasures to mitigate risks as swiftly as possible. Specifically, member states can be organized to exchange experiences on coping with “color revolutions.” For example, Russia has rich experience in dealing with “color revolutions;” in recent years, Russia has not only successfully thwarted several “color revolutions” against its own country but also accumulated a wealth of practical experience in the process of responding to “color revolutions” in CIS countries, with an impressive capacity for maintaining national interests and strategic security in crisis management. In addition, Russia has adopted legislative control over foreign NGOs and news media, as well as strict legal management of parades and assemblies (Jiang Li, 2015: 13). Russia can teach and share the above experience with members of the two organizations. As an important member of the SCO, China can share with other member states its experience in handling the Hong Kong issue in recent years. As the saying goes, preparedness ensures success, unpreparedness spells failure. Only in this way can we address “the weakest link” and can the overall capacity of member states to deal with “color revolutions” be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shan Xiaoying, “关于中俄共同防范“颜色革命”的思考” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2022&amp;amp;filename=OYRW202201004&quot;&gt;An Analysis of the Foundation and Approach of Sino-Russian Cooperation in Cyberspace Governance, Chinese Journal of Journalism and Communications, 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more important basis for collaboration is that both governments share the same perception of “cyber sovereignty” and prefer a government-led “multilateralism” mechanism of cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the issue of the attributes of cyberspace, the United States and other information powers consider cyberspace to be a “public domain” and therefore deny or hold an ambiguous attitude toward “cyber sovereignty.” In contrast, China and Russia consider cyberspace as a new domain of national sovereignty and an extension of national sovereignty in cyberspace and thus insist that “cyber sovereignty” is as sacrosanct as national territory. In December 2012, Russia proposed the initiative of “cyber sovereignty” at the United Nations International Telecommunication Union. China’s New National Security Law clarifies the concept of “sovereignty in cyberspace” through legislation. While there is international controversy over “cyber sovereignty,” it is undeniable that the infrastructure and equipment of the internet, the information that flows through it, and the people who use it are all closely linked to traditional states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, China and Russia face a great crisis in the field of information network technology and security, and both have a strong desire to guarantee national cybersecurity and participate in global cyberspace governance. As emerging countries, China and Russia have advantages in certain cutting-edge technologies, though there are still gaps in their independent research and development capabilities in core technologies, key equipment, and operating systems for information networks compared with information powerhouses such as the United States. Moreover, as the independent controllability of cybersecurity is weak, the hidden dangers of their cybersecurity are also more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both China and Russia have outstanding problems with cybersecurity, and thus the two sides can ensure future cybersecurity by promoting the international cybersecurity regime, strengthening technical exchanges between the two countries, and joint law enforcement and other forms of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian and Chinese governments should also strengthen exchanges and cooperation on cybersecurity technologies, improve the ability of both countries to prevent cybercrimes and information attacks, effectively improve the ability of both countries to guarantee cybersecurity, and work together for the goal of building autonomous and controllable cyber systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Russian government strongly supports the research and development of domestic information security technologies and products and insists on independent innovation. After years of efforts, it has developed its own unique advantages. The Russian companies Kaspersky and Dr.Web have not only taken the lead in the world in terms of market share of antivirus software but also provided strong support to the Russian government in terms of information security. Dr.Web is the Russian Ministry of Defense’s designated information security partner. Russia’s chip design technology is unique and has reached the world’s leading level. Russia is also working on developing its own operating system. In turn, China has accelerated the process of developing localization of network information products since 2014 and has also made significant achievements, such as the production of computer servers, with three domestic vendors in the top five server markets. . . . However, breakthroughs have not yet been achieved in the field of core hardware technologies such as chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia are already cooperating in information security, and Kaspersky Lab has been cooperating with our government enterprises for many years. In the future, if we can further strengthen S&amp;amp;T cooperation in the field of information and cyberspace, as well as jointly carry out research and development of information and communication technologies including increasing the exchange of information and training of personnel between the two sides, it will certainly be beneficial for both sides to improve the construction of cyberspace security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the early stage of the development of the internet, the United States had absolute dominance over the governance of cyberspace due to its technological leadership. With the development of the internet in various countries, especially in a large number of developing countries, there is a demand to construct a fairer and more just cyberspace that is more in line with the common interests of all countries. The game of cyberspace governance is gradually unfolding, and the prominence of cybersecurity issues has intensified the intensity of this game. Some say this is the era of warring states in cyberspace governance, while others say that cyberspace governance is fragmenting. It is obvious that this is an era when the established system is gradually broken and a new system is being formed, and the game is quite intense and full of challenges, but also provides opportunities for emerging countries such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It might make sense to buy time in this way if time favored us. But it does not — time favors our adversaries. Accepting risk now to reduce the risk of worse disaster in the future is the wisest and most prudent course of action for the US, NATO, and Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West faces a choice: it can accept the short-term risks of continuing to support Ukraine’s effort to achieve a sustainable and enduring resolution to the current Russian invasion, or it can push for a premature cessation of hostilities that greatly increases the likelihood of renewed Russian aggression on terms far more favorable to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path forward should be clear — the West must prioritize reducing Russia’s ability to renew a war that the Kremlin is more likely to win and that would carry the same escalation risks as the current war by helping Ukraine use its position of relative advantage now to set conditions to deter future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a vital national security interest in averting future Russian attacks on Ukraine. Russian invasions of Ukraine inevitably harm and endanger Europe and NATO, put the US commitment to defend its NATO allies on the table, and entail the risk of conventional or nuclear escalation. America and its Western allies and partners should not accept, let alone push for, a temporary cessation of hostilities in Ukraine that increases the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion in future years. This consideration must drive decisions about when to seek negotiated compromises and what conditions to encourage Ukraine to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US interests in ending the current war on terms that minimize the risk of future Russian invasion can be fully separated from the moral and humanitarian considerations that motivate many people to support Ukraine. American interests flow from the NATO alliance and the obligations it imposes on the US as well as to the close and vital economic interdependence of the US with Europe. Europe and NATO will be profoundly affected by a future Russian invasion of Ukraine as they have been by this one, and the US will face the same imperative to support its allies in the future as it does today. American policymakers today must focus on the imperative of resolving the current conflict in ways that do not set conditions for renewed war for our own interests, not just Ukraine’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely durability of a cessation of hostilities rests on three fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Russia’s objectives with respect to Ukraine, other former Soviet states, NATO, and the US change?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will the future correlation of forces favor Ukraine once the fighting stops?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Western support for Ukraine remain firm?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to all three questions if hostilities were suspended soon is “no.” Russia’s objectives are not likely to change in the foreseeable future and must be taken as a given. The correlation of forces will begin to move away from favoring Kyiv toward favoring Moscow as soon as the fighting stops, and Western support for Ukraine will almost inevitably begin to fall. Ukraine’s position today is such that a drop in Western support and the shift in the correlation of forces will significantly increase the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stable and sustainable cessation of hostilities can occur only if the West helps Ukraine use its current momentum to secure a sufficiently advantageous position from which it will be able to effectively deter a future Russian attack even as the correlation of forces changes and Western support falls. The imperative of seeking to avert a future war in Ukraine thus requires continuing to help Ukraine fight to make necessary military gains and secure necessary reconstruction assistance rather than seeking to freeze war prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s objective in launching the invasions of 2014 and then 2022 was the destruction of an independent, pro-Western Ukrainian state. His aims have increased over that period rather than moderating. His initial complaints in 2014 revolved around Ukraine’s orientation toward the West and away from Russia. Eight years later, he and his subordinates are engaged in a full-throated denial of the validity of a Ukrainian ethnicity or independent Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has clung to its demands despite battlefield defeats and its rhetoric has only become more extreme as Ukraine has turned the tide of the war against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely unlikely that Putin would accept any reasonable compromise terms because of the domestic price he would likely pay for having obtained relatively little at such a great cost. Putin and those around him are also driving his maximalist position on Ukraine deep into the Kremlin’s ideology and trying to imbue the Russian population with it. There is no evidence to suggest that Putin or any Putinist successor will abandon his maximalist objectives toward Ukraine, even if he or a successor is willing to accept a temporary cessation of hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planning assumption regarding Putin’s and Russia’s objectives toward Ukraine must be that they will remain unchanged — Russia will continue to seek to subjugate Ukraine to its control fully and completely by one means or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must learn the right lesson from the period of the Minsk II Accords from 2014 to 2022. France and Germany, with US support, engaged Russia as a theoretically neutral and non-belligerent mediator in a conflict begun by a Russian invasion. They imposed on Ukraine a set of commitments that amounted to partial surrender of Kyiv’s sovereignty while demanding no formal commitments directly from Russia. They accepted the fiction that Russian proxies in Ukraine were independent of Moscow and pressed Ukraine to uphold its commitments even as the proxies continually violated theirs — and never held Moscow explicitly to account for the actions of proxies that were acting on Russia’s orders and with Russia’s direct support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accords imposed a settlement that was extremely favorable to Russia. They specifically required Ukraine to grant the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk autonomy while at the same time allowing them to participate fully in the Ukrainian political process. Such a move would have created permanent Russian levers to manipulate the Ukrainian political system throughout the country while depriving Kyiv of the ability to control Russian and Russian proxy activities in the Russian-occupied areas. The accords did not require Russia to withdraw its forces from the areas it occupied because they did not recognize that Russia had forces in those areas — even though it clearly did. The theory of the case of those in the West who supported these accords was twofold — first, that “peace” in the form of an incredibly violent and constantly-violated ceasefire was better than open warfare, and second, that the “Minsk process” would somehow, ultimately, mollify Putin and bring him to accept a new status quo highly favorable to Russia permanently. Above all the Western backers of the Minsk II Process thought that Putin was focused only or at least primarily on eastern Ukraine, whereas in fact he continued to seek to regain effective control of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumptions underlying the Minsk II Process have been utterly and completely invalidated. Russia’s proxies deliberately ensured that they never met their commitments under the accords and so made it almost impossible for Ukraine to meet its commitments. The proxies were not out of Russia’s control — they were pursuing Putin’s aims. Because Putin was never satisfied with Minsk II — he wanted more, and he used his proxies to try to renegotiate the accords by force. When that effort failed, he invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden on those who would argue that any agreement between Russia and Ukraine today would not follow a similar path toward renewed Russian invasion is enormous. It is almost impossible, in fact, to see how one could persuasively make such an argument given Russian actions and rhetoric over nearly all of Putin’s tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must instead accept as a planning assumption that Putin will continue to try to renegotiate by force any limited compromise agreement made now, up to and including through renewed Russian full-scale invasion if and when he or his successor decides that circumstances are propitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration then raises the question of the likely trajectory of the correlation of forces between Russia and Ukraine. Some advocates of negotiations now point to the fact that Ukrainian leverage at the moment is high because of Kyiv’s battlefield successes and Western support, on the one hand, and Russia’s struggles and relative isolation, on the other. If negotiations conducted at a moment of high leverage could yield a permanent resolution of conflict, then such an approach can make sense. But if, as in the present case, a negotiated settlement can only be expected to generate a temporary respite, then this approach makes sense only if we can expect the future correlation of forces to favor Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration, in turn, requires a closer examination of the factors that have given Ukraine relatively high leverage at the moment. The key factors are the rallying of Ukrainians behind a full mobilization for war and high levels of Western support, on the one hand, and the catastrophically bad performance of the Russian military and Russian defense industry on the other. None of those factors is likely to change in the next six-to-twelve months if the fighting continues. All of them are likely to change rapidly and to Ukraine’s disadvantage once a ceasefire takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians remain willing to support full national mobilization because they are fighting a war for the survival of their state and people. They know that if they stop fighting, Russian troops will drive deeper into their country and inflict horrors on them, ultimately overthrowing their government and subjugating them. But full mobilization is extraordinarily painful. It will be unsustainable once the immediate threat of defeat is removed. Ukraine will have to demobilize partially and attempt to rebuild, greatly reducing its combat power. The Ukrainian government will be under pressure to do sustain a strong enough military to defend against future Russian invasion and reconstruct a vibrant and prosperous economy. Ukraine is not wealthy enough to do both of those things well, particularly if it must lose much of the territory Russia currently occupies, so it will likely suboptimize both. It will likely seek to stabilize a smaller but higher-quality military while satisfying the economic demands of its people. Ukraine’s organic military capacity will thus drop significantly following a ceasefire, possibly increasing again gradually as more sustainable military practices take hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine’s current military power-driven leverage is temporarily high because of full mobilization, Russia’s is temporarily low because of the series of stupid decisions made by Putin and his generals before and during this war. Putin did not mobilize for this war. He did not put Russia’s defense industry on a war footing. He did not prepare his people for war. He did not even prepare his military for war. Once his initial assumptions about the ease of this invasion were falsified he took many months to order the reserve mobilization he should have ordered at once. But he ordered even that mobilization without adequate preparation or warning, and it, too, became a mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces would have benefitted enormously from a months-long cessation of hostilities or even relaxation of the demand for offensive operations. Any such protracted operational or strategic pause would have given them time to reorganize, refit, and prepare for renewed offensive operations on much better terms. Putin gave them no such time, instead whipping his generals to constant offensives that simply ground the remaining combat power of the Russian military into dust. Putin did not allow his military to concentrate the mobilized reservists into coherent units that could be massed to achieve decisive battlefield effects, but instead demanded that they be hurled into combat piecemeal and unprepared, frittering away yet another opportunity to regain the initiative. All these dynamics continue to this day — the Russian military is consuming combat power as fast as it can be generated and is trying to draw on a defense industrial base only slowly and haltingly creaking into gear and badly hampered by international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of Putin’s bad decisions has been to reduce Russia’s effective combat power to a level far below what Russia could in principle generate. Russia’s military weakness is thus very likely temporary. As soon as the fighting stops the Russian military can begin to reconstitute itself. Lessons can be learned. Bad organization can be rectified. Its defense industry can start to come online and replace essential kit, especially if sanctions are lifted even partially — and it is very hard to imagine Putin accepting any ceasefire that does not include some significant sanctions relief. Conscription and training systems can be improved. Russia can start to generate the kind of military power its population, industrial base, and military organization have the potential to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A protracted ceasefire will thus likely allow Russia to restore the correlation of forces between itself and Ukraine that is the natural result of the countries’ relative sizes and economic capacities — in other words, Russia will likely regain its inherent military advantages over Ukraine in the years following a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support to Ukraine is the key factor in this equation. Russia can regain military superiority over Ukraine, but it cannot establish military superiority over Ukraine backed by the West. So the final question is this: Will Western support for Ukraine increase, decrease, or remain the same following a ceasefire? The answer is obvious: it will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support today is driven partly by Russian actions and partly by the heroic and effective resistance of Ukrainians in the face of initially overwhelming military odds and then the atrocities Russian forces continue to commit. The Russian military continues offensive operations to conquer Ukrainian territory. It uses brutal tactics against the Ukrainian military and is conducting war crimes on a scale amounting to crimes against humanity. It is deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure while conducting ethnic cleansing operations using genocidal rhetoric. Russia has created a massive humanitarian and refugee crisis that obviously demands urgent responses. At the same time Ukrainian forces have fought back bravely and brilliantly, defeating the Russian drive on Kyiv, liberating Kharkiv in a stunning and rapid counteroffensive, and most recently pushing Russian troops out of western Kherson. These factors more than any others have kept Western support for Ukraine strong and created a political environment in most Western states that makes abandoning Ukraine highly unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those dynamics will begin to change rapidly once the fighting stops. Attention will turn to reconstruction, which is inherently far less popular. Reconstruction is also inherently political and will focus attention on Ukrainian domestic politics and the natural and historic limitations of Ukrainian governance effectiveness. Domestic tensions within Ukraine will naturally grow as various groups argue for differential distributions of reconstruction aid and more normal politics returns with all its strife and messiness. Russia’s inherent skill in manipulating the information space, overwhelmed during the fighting by Russia’s failures and brutality, will begin to shape perceptions more effectively once more. The current veneer of near-universal support for Ukraine will vanish, and arguments about how and even whether to continue to support Ukraine will become much more prominent throughout the West. Both military and economic aid to Ukraine will certainly decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few years of the cessation of hostilities, therefore, the following conditions are extremely likely to hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian military power will be lower than it is now&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian military power will be greater than it is now and rising&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western military support for Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western economic support for Ukraine will be insufficient and dropping&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General Western enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal Ukrainian cohesion will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s aims toward Ukraine and the US will remain unchanged&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western leaders and Ukrainians should not simply accept these forecasts as givens, of course. Western political leaders should fight hard to sustain Western support for Ukraine, continuing to make the real and urgent case for defending the West’s interests by helping Ukraine rebuild and deter future Russian invasions. Ukrainians should also fight to rebuild as cohesive a state and society as they can, as well as to sustain the strongest defense posture possible in their post-conflict economic and social conditions. But a sober forecast based on normal historical trends and patterns requires assuming that such efforts will be at best partially acceptable, and future policy should be based on pessimistic sobriety rather than hopeful optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious conclusion follows from these observations: Any territory Ukraine does not retake now will likely be lost to it indefinitely. The de facto borders of Ukraine at a ceasefire in the near term will be the maximum territorial extent of the Ukrainian state for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also recognize that the risks of escalation driving the current push to press Ukraine to make concessions will be just as real whenever Russia renews the attack. Russia will always be a nuclear power. It will always be able to attack NATO with conventional or nuclear forces. Those facts will not be changed by a ceasefire now. If Putin or his successor concludes after a few years of rebuilding that he can try to conquer Ukraine again, NATO will face exactly the same risks then that some are now seeking to avoid by driving Kyiv to concessions. Those concessions will only have made the renewed invasion and return of escalation risks more likely while weakening Ukraine’s ability to deter and defeat another massive attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important conclusion to draw from all these reflections, however, is this: Ukraine’s power and Western support for Ukraine is at or near its peak and can remain there only as long as fighting continues and Ukraine continues to make gains. Both will likely begin to drop rapidly once fighting is halted or conditions of real stalemate descend. Russia’s diminishing power and influence, on the other hand, will likely begin to rise when active combat stops. Success for Ukraine and the West lies in ensuring that Ukraine has secured territorial gains, military capabilities, and economic and reconstruction support while it is at or near its peak that are all great enough to deter a recovering Russia from restarting the war even as Ukraine’s power and Western support drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine should not cash in the leverage it might have now to secure a temporary cessation of hostilities that will leave it in a far more vulnerable condition that will invite future Russian aggression, therefore. Kyiv and its Western supporters, rather, should reinforce Ukraine’s current advantages to consolidate Ukraine’s position during the fighting so that Ukraine — and peace — can survive the inevitable erosion of Kyiv’s current advantages after the conflict’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

ISIS is gradually increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria and will use these capabilities to continue freeing imprisoned members and absorbing expertise and personnel in preparation for a larger resurgence. The group will attempt to exploit weaknesses in US-supported SDF counterinsurgency efforts to create sanctuaries. ISIS will use new sanctuaries to mount larger and more sophisticated attacks to degrade the SDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham is increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS has increased its use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), a capability that requires robust logistics. ISIS’s VBIED use surged during two recent periods, indicating that the group’s attack capabilities are strengthening. The first surge occurred between September 2021 and January 2022. ISIS used five VBIEDs — two of them successful — during this period. The first surge also points to an increase in capability compared to early 2021, when ISIS only mounted motorcycle-borne improvised explosive device (MBIED) attacks in northeast Syria. The second surge occurred in September 2022. ISIS built at least four VBIEDs and one MBIED — employing one VBIED and one MBIED successfully — during the second surge. The group’s ability to construct a similar number of VBIEDs in a shorter time frame indicates a capability increase compared to the first surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS likely used freed fighters and redeployed some preexisting cells to conduct its VBIED surges. ISIS moved fighters from the Syrian desert back to Iraq and northeastern Syria in 2021, contributing to the first VBIED surge in September 2021. ISIS’s January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack freed at least 300 fighters. This prison break likely increased organizational capacity, allowing ISIS to begin a second VBIED surge in September 2022. ISIS also appointed a new Iraqi-born emir in the central Syrian desert in 2022 who was freed during the al Sina’a prison break. The need to reintegrate freed fighters into ISIS’s organizational structure in northeastern Syria may explain the time lag between the prison break and the September VBIED surge. ISIS will continue its effort to free sympathizers and fighters. The group’s attack attempt against al Hol internally displaced people (IDP) camp in September 2022 likely sought to free cells and sympathizers, though a successful attack would also have propaganda value by freeing ISIS families and protecting women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), used VBIED capabilities to free imprisoned fighters and improve the quality of its attack cells.&lt;/strong&gt; AQI prison breaks in 2012 strengthened the group’s capabilities in Iraq. AQI prison breaks likely led to its ability to conduct major VBIED “waves” targeting Iraqi population centers in 2012–13. ISIS today is weaker than AQI was in 2012–13, but ISIS is likely using prison breaks to resuscitate some capabilities. Recent prison breaks and smaller escapes likely improve ISIS’s capabilities by providing experienced fighters for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria in 2022 is less permissive for ISIS than Iraq was in 2011–13. AQI was capable of repeated spectacular attacks targeting civilians in Iraqi cities. AQI used 30 VBIEDs on one day in July 2012, a number far beyond ISIS’s current capabilities in Syria. ISIS does not have the freedom of movement or access to funding required to conduct VBIED attacks at AQI’s 2012–13 rate. ISIS also does not have the same organizational capacity AQI had in 2013. AQI had “reconstituted as a military force” with a “force-level planning cell” that could “task VBIEDs to support a complex, specialized operation” by 2013, while ISIS is a “low-level insurgency” in 2022. There is also greater counterterrorism pressure on ISIS in 2022 compared to that on AQI in 2011–13. The SDF receives greater US support than did Iraq during 2011–13, and the SDF may be more effective than the Iraqi Security Forces were between 2011–13. US special operations forces and air support limited the ISIS prison break at al Sina’a in January 2022. Tribes continue to facilitate US and SDF counterterrorism operations by providing intelligence, despite the risks posed to them by ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS will likely pursue a similar strategy to the one that enabled its predecessor’s resurgence in Iraq in 2011, despite a less permissive environment in Syria today. ISIS is at a very early stage in its resurgence, and it will likely pursue its strategy at a slower rate than AQI did after 2008. AQI sowed division between the government and local population in Sunni areas of Iraq in 2011–13 by targeting tribal “awakening” fighters who successfully rolled back Iraqi counterterrorism gains against al Qaeda in Iraq between 2007 and 2011. ISIS is emulating this effort by attempting to turn SDF-controlled territory into “areas of fear and terror” by assassinating members of the SDF and its allies “at will” to create panic. ISIS is also using Syria’s desert as a sanctuary where it can rebuild its capabilities, similar to AQI use of rural areas in Iraq after 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s increased logistical and operational capacity will allow it to intensify its efforts to target detention facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS’s IED manufacturing sites and major weapons depots ISIS possesses a logistical apparatus that will allow it to conduct further attacks against detention facilities or other high-value targets. ISIS is likely also capable of generating intelligence using SDF and local informants to facilitate attacks and prison breaks. The SDF’s capture of a major weapons depot near Tel Hamis in September 2022 could temporarily stop some attacks, but VBIED attacks are likely to resume unless the SDF arrests the VBIED cell and its more permanent assets, such as manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF’s counter-ISIS operations and new security measures around detention facilities have not removed the threat ISIS poses to these facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The SDF’s failure to secure areas surrounding prisons in northeastern Syria will allow ISIS to continue attack attempts aimed at freeing prisoners. The SDF did move “approximately half” of ISIS detainees to “more secure facilities.” The Defense Intelligence Agency, however, reported in May 2022 that many of the same vulnerabilities that enabled the January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack persist at the prison. ISIS VBIED and sleeper cells likely remain active near major detention sites, such as al Hol IDP Camp and al Sina’a prison. ISIS used sleeper cells and VBIEDs staged nearby to conduct the al Sina’a attack in January 2022. These cells fixed SDF forces in place and prevented SDF units from responding to the al Sina’a attack, increasing the ability of ISIS fighters to escape. In Raqqa, ISIS sleeper cells are likely intentionally “lying low” to avoid US and SDF pressure. The group attempted two prison breaks in Raqqa in fall 2022, and it could use sleeper cells to launch future attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF will prioritize confronting Turkish military activity over counter-ISIS operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Turkey is targeting the SDF with air strikes and threatening a ground incursion in northern Syria. Another Turkish incursion will distract the SDF and cause the SDF to decrease its counterterrorism pressure on ISIS. The SDF’s spokesperson said the group could not deter Turkish attacks and fight ISIS simultaneously and stopped counter-ISIS operations on November 23, though the SDF resumed joint patrols with US forces on December 2. Lifting SDF counterterrorism pressure will provide an opening for ISIS to prepare attacks against key facilities, such as al Hol IDP camp. A Turkish air strike on November 23 near al Hol targeted an SDF base. The air strike did not target al Hol itself, but air strikes against SDF security near al Hol distracts SDF forces tasked with securing al Hol’s surroundings. This could allow ISIS to exploit opportunities to target high-value facilities such as al Hol or other prisons in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a significant Turkish incursion, ISIS will take advantage of the SDF’s counterproductive counterterrorism approach. The current SDF approach relies on mass arrests, counterterrorism raids, and destruction of property. These tactics contribute to popular grievances, which are key to a renewed insurgency. ISIS can recruit through detention centers after mass arrests and encourage retaliation against the SDF for counterterrorism raids and property destruction. ISIS is often able to maintain its presence in areas subject to SDF raids and arrests. ISIS reportedly “owns the night” in areas of northeast Syria and threatens to kill SDF employees for their cooperation with the SDF. The SDF’s approach actively worsens core grievances among the local communities, such as reconstruction and a lack of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could undermine the SDF by sowing division between Arab communities and the SDF in northeastern Syria. The group will aim to expand from desert sanctuaries and attempt to create support zones by assassinating and intimidating SDF civilian and military employees, tribal dignitaries, and other local civilians.[1] The SDF’s counterterrorism approach is overly reliant on mass arrests, while its fails to protect its employees and civilian populations. These shortcomings could drive local communities to support ISIS and provide sanctuary to the group. Poor security and governance already created tension between the SDF and local communities in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Division between the SDF and locals will allow ISIS to use its presence in northeastern Syria to limit the SDF’s freedom of movement and gradually reimpose its governance in areas of northeastern Syria. ISIS has successfully fixed the SDF in place during certain operations, such as the al Sina’a prison break. Increased ISIS capabilities could make a similar effort more successful in the future. Fixing the SDF in place or isolating specific bases could cause the SDF to vacate some areas if SDF reinforcements cannot protect outposts or smaller bases in ISIS attack zones. SDF bases and outposts allow the SDF to protect the surrounding areas. The SDF may also become less capable of targeting ISIS cells as local communities lose faith in the SDF’s security. Local activists in Deir Ezzor said SDF raids sometimes target innocent civilians due to faulty intelligence. Decreased SDF presence and capability would allow ISIS to reimpose its governance gradually in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could strengthen quickly should conditions change, causing Syria to become more permissive for ISIS. The SDF remains reliant on US intelligence support to enable operations, though SDF intelligence collection and exploitation is improving. A US withdrawal could decrease the SDF’s effectiveness by ending US intelligence and logistical support. ISIS could use decreased pressure to strengthen capabilities such as VBIED manufacturing and local recruitment. These capabilities would allow ISIS to mount sophisticated attacks against SDF military positions and detention sites. ISIS is capable of generating funds through smuggling and forced zakat collection. The group could expand these efforts further if competing priorities distract the SDF. Finally, increased ISIS intelligence collection and exploitation may allow ISIS to assassinate and intimidate local leaders to cooperate with ISIS, to the detriment of the SDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The death of ISIS’s leader in mid-October is unlikely to change ISIS’s trajectory in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; Local Syrian armed groups killed ISIS’s leader in southern Syria on October 17. The al Sina’a prison break in January 2022 was likely the last major operation planned by ISIS’s overall leader. ISIS’s emir in northeastern Syria likely has both the authority and resources required to plan and conduct complex attacks against high-value targets in northeastern Syria. An Iraqi militant freed from al Sina’a in January 2022 leads ISIS in the central Syrian desert. His time in al Sina’a indicates he may have significant experience within ISIS before 2019 and may be able to assist planning efforts. ISIS cells in the central Syrian desert likely support ISIS activity in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Carter</name></author><summary type="html">Turkish military activity in Syria will accelerate the strengthening of the ISIS in Iraq and al Sham.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Taiwan Long Game</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-the-taiwan-long-game.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Taiwan Long Game" /><published>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/the-taiwan-long-game</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-the-taiwan-long-game.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For 70 years, China and the United States have managed to avoid disaster over Taiwan. But a consensus is forming in U.S. policy circles that this peace may not last much longer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Many analysts and policymakers now argue that the United States must use all its military power to prepare for war with China in the Taiwan Strait. In October 2022, Mike Gilday, the head of the U.S. Navy, warned that China might be preparing to invade Taiwan before 2024. Members of Congress, including Democratic Representative Seth Moulton and Republican Representative Mike Gallagher, have echoed Gilday’s sentiment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are sound rationales for the United States to focus on defending Taiwan. The U.S. military is bound by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to maintain the capacity to resist the use of force or coercion against Taiwan. Washington also has strong strategic, economic, and moral reasons to stand firm on behalf of the island. As a leading democracy in the heart of Asia, Taiwan sits at the core of global value chains. Its security is a fundamental interest for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, Washington faces a strategic problem with a defense component, not a military problem with a military solution. The more the United States narrows its focus to military fixes, the greater the risk to its own interests, as well as to those of its allies and Taiwan itself. War games held in the Pentagon and in Washington think tanks, meanwhile, risk diverting focus from the sharpest near-term threats and challenges that Beijing presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole metric on which U.S. policy should be judged is whether it helps preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait — not whether it solves the question of Taiwan once and for all or keeps Taiwan permanently in the United States’ camp. Once viewed this way, the real aim becomes clear: to convince leaders in Beijing and Taipei that time is on their side, forestalling conflict. Everything the United States does should be geared toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To preserve peace, the United States must understand what drives China’s anxiety, ensure that Chinese President Xi Jinping is not backed into a corner, and convince Beijing that unification belongs to a distant future. It must also develop a more nuanced understanding of Beijing’s current calculus, one that moves beyond the simplistic and inaccurate speculation that Xi is accelerating plans to invade Taiwan. Support for Taiwan should bolster not only the island’s security but also its resilience and prosperity. Assisting Taiwan will also require new U.S. investments in tools that benefit the island beyond the military realm, including a more holistic deterrence strategy to deal with Beijing’s coercive gray-zone tactics. Critics may contend that this approach sidesteps the hard questions at the root of the confrontation, but that is precisely the point: sometimes, the best policy is to avoid bringing intractable challenges to a head and kick the can down the road instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sea-change&quot;&gt;Sea Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final years of the 1945–49 Chinese Civil War, the losing Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, establishing a mutual defense treaty with the United States in 1954. In 1979, however, Washington severed those ties so it could normalize relations with Beijing. Since then, the United States has worked to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait by blocking the two actions that could lead to outright conflict: a declaration of independence by Taipei and forced unification by Beijing. At times, the United States has reined in Taiwan when it feared the island was tacking too close to independence. In 2003, President George W. Bush stood next to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and publicly opposed “comments and actions” proposed by Taipei that the United States saw as destabilizing. At other times, the United States has flexed its military muscle in front of Beijing, as it did during the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis, when U.S. President Bill Clinton sent an aircraft carrier to the waters off Taiwan in response to a series of Chinese missile tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also important to the U.S. approach have been statements of reassurance. To Taiwan, the United States has made a formal commitment under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to “preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations” with Taiwan and to provide the island “arms of a defensive character.” To Beijing, the United States has consistently stated that it does not support Taiwan’s independence, including in its 2022 National Security Strategy. The goal was to create space for Beijing and Taipei to either indefinitely postpone conflict or reach some sort of political resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, this approach worked well, thanks to three factors. First, the United States maintained a big lead over China when it came to military power, which discouraged Beijing from using conventional force to substantially alter cross-strait relations. Second, China was focused primarily on its own economic development and integration into the global economy, allowing the Taiwan issue to stay on the back burner. Third, the United States dexterously dealt with challenges to cross-strait stability, whether they originated in Taipei or Beijing, thereby tamping down any embers that could ignite a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/47Mv1hM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
▲ Celebrating National Day, Taipei, Taiwan, October 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at least the past decade, however, all three of these factors have evolved dramatically. Perhaps the most obvious change is that China’s military has vastly expanded its capabilities, owing to decades of rising investments and reforms. In 1995, as the United States sailed the USS Nimitz toward the Taiwan Strait, all the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could do was watch in indignation. Since then, the power differential between the two militaries has narrowed significantly, especially in the waters off China’s shoreline. Beijing can now easily strike targets in the waters and airspace around Taiwan, hit U.S. aircraft carriers operating in the region, hobble American assets in space, and threaten U.S. military bases in the western Pacific, including those in Guam and Japan. Because the PLA has little real-world combat experience, its precise effectiveness remains to be seen. Even so, its impressive force-projection capabilities have already given Beijing confidence that in the event of conflict, it could seriously damage the United States’ and Taiwan’s forces operating around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside China’s military upgrades, Beijing is now more willing than ever to tangle with the United States and others in pursuit of its broader ambitions. Xi himself has accumulated greater power than his recent predecessors, and he appears to be more risk-tolerant when it comes to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States has abandoned any pretense of acting as a principled arbiter committed to preserving the status quo and allowing the two sides to come to their own peaceful settlement. The United States’ focus has shifted to countering the threat China poses to Taiwan. Reflecting this shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said that the United States would intervene militarily on behalf of Taiwan in a cross-strait conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ready-set-invade&quot;&gt;Ready, Set, Invade?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving this change in U.S. policy is a growing chorus arguing that Xi has decided to launch an invasion or enforce a blockade of Taiwan in the near future. In 2021, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, predicted that Beijing might move against Taiwan “in the next six years.” That same year, the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro likewise contended, in Foreign Affairs, that “there have been disturbing signals that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach and contemplating armed unification.” In August 2022, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby wrote, also in Foreign Affairs, that the United States must prepare for an imminent war over Taiwan. All these analyses base their judgments on China’s expanding military capabilities. But they fail to grapple with the reasons why China has not used force against Taiwan, given that it already outmatches the island in military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Beijing has stuck to the message that cross-strait relations are moving in the right direction. China’s leaders continue to tell their people that time is on their side and that the balance of power is increasingly tilting toward Beijing. In his speech at the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing in October 2022, Xi declared that “peaceful reunification” remains the “best way to realize reunification across the Taiwan Strait,” and that Beijing has “maintained the initiative and the ability to steer in cross-strait relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, Beijing believes that the United States has all but abandoned its “one China” policy, in which Washington acknowledges China’s position that there is one China and Taiwan is a part of it. Instead, in the eyes of Beijing, the United States has begun using Taiwan as a tool to weaken and divide China. Taiwan’s internal political trends have amplified China’s anxieties. The historically pro-Beijing Kuomintang Party has been marginalized, while the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party has consolidated power. Meanwhile, public opinion in Taiwan has soured on Beijing’s preferred formula for political reconciliation, the “one country, two systems” policy, in which China rules over Taiwan but allows Taipei some room to govern itself economically and administratively. Taiwan’s public became especially skeptical of the idea beginning in 2020, when Beijing abrogated its promise to provide Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” until 2047 by imposing a hard-line national security law. In high-level pronouncements, Beijing has reiterated that “time and momentum” are on its side. But beneath public projections of confidence, China’s leaders likely understand that their “one country, two systems” formula has no purchase in Taiwan and that public opinion trends on the island run against their vision of greater cross-strait integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei has its own sense of urgency, driven by concerns over Beijing’s growing military might and the ongoing worry that U.S. support might diminish if Washington’s attention shifts elsewhere or Americans turn against overseas commitments. The new refrain from the administration of Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen — “Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow” — is both a genuine reflection of Taipei’s worries about Chinese aggression and an attempt to galvanize support that will extend beyond the current geopolitical upheaval. In other words, the one thing that Beijing, Taipei, and Washington seem to agree on is that time is working against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The United States must avoid backing China into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of urgency is to some extent grounded in fact. Beijing does have a clear and long-held ambition to annex Taiwan and has openly threatened to use military force if it concludes that the door to peaceful unification has been closed. Beijing’s protestations that the United States is no longer adhering to understandings on Taiwan are, in some cases, accurate. And for its part, Taipei is right to worry that Beijing is laying the groundwork to suffocate or seize Taiwan. But American anxieties have been intensified by sloppy analysis, including assertions that China could take advantage of the United States’ distraction in Ukraine to seize Taiwan by force or that China is operating along a fixed timeline toward military conquest. The first of these examples has been disproved by reality. The second reflects a misreading of China’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is no conclusive evidence that China is operating on a fixed timeline to seize Taiwan, and the heightened worry in Washington is driven primarily by China’s growing military capabilities rather than any indication that Xi is preparing to attack the island. According to Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, Xi has instructed his military to be prepared for conflict by 2027, and he has declared that progress on unification with Taiwan is a requirement for fulfilling the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” for which he set 2049 as the target date. But any timeline that has a target date nearly three decades in the future is little more than aspirational. Xi, like leaders everywhere, would prefer to preserve his freedom of action on matters of war and peace and not lock himself into plans from which he cannot escape. China’s leadership appears to be spending profligately to secure the option of a military solution to the Taiwan problem, and the United States and Taiwan must not be complacent. By the same token, however, it would be wrong to conclude that the future is foretold and that conflict is inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixating on invasion scenarios pushes U.S. policymakers to develop solutions to the wrong near-term threats. Defense officials prefer to prepare for blockades and invasions because such scenarios line up most favorably with American capabilities and are the easiest to conceptualize and plan for. Yet it is worth recalling that Chinese leaders in the past have chosen options other than military occupation to achieve their objectives, such as building artificial islands in the South China Sea and using lawfare in Hong Kong. Indeed, Taiwan has been defending itself against a wide variety of Chinese gray-zone attacks for years, including cyberattacks, meddling in Taiwan’s electoral politics, and military exercises meant to undermine the island’s confidence in its own defenses and the credibility of U.S. support. China’s response to U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan underlines China’s efforts to erode Taiwan’s psychological confidence in its self-defense. After the visit, Beijing lobbed missiles over Taiwan for the first time, conducted unprecedented air operations across the Taiwan Strait median line, and simulated a blockade of Taiwan’s main ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military threat against Taiwan is real, it is not the onl — or most proximate — challenge the island faces. By focusing narrowly on military problems at the expense of other threats to Taiwan, the United States risks making two serious mistakes: first, overcompensating in ways that do more to escalate tensions than deter conflict; and second, losing sight of broader strategic problems that it is more likely to confront. Beijing is already choking Taiwan’s links to the rest of the world and attempting to persuade the people of Taiwan that their only option for avoiding devastation is to sue for peace on Beijing’s terms. This is not a future hypothetical. It is already an everyday reality. And by hyping the threat of a Chinese invasion, U.S. analysts and officials are unintentionally doing the CCP’s work for it by stoking fears in Taiwan. They are also sending signals to global companies and investors that operating in and around Taiwan brings with it a high risk of being caught in a military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gIUxQRQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ Demonstrating in support of Pelosi’s visit, Taipei, Taiwan, August 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is to presume conflict is unavoidable. By doing so, the United States and Taiwan bind themselves to preparing in every way possible for the impending conflict, precipitating the very outcomes they seek to prevent. If the United States backs China into a corner, for example, by permanently stationing military personnel on Taiwan or making another formal mutual defense commitment with Taipei, Chinese leaders might feel the weight of nationalist pressure and take drastic actions that could devastate the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unilaterally risking a war with the United States over Taiwan would not mesh with Xi’s grand strategy. His vision is to restore China as a leading power on the world stage and to transform China into, as he puts it, a “modern socialist nation.” The imperatives of seizing Taiwan on the one hand and asserting global leadership on the other are thus in direct tension. Any conflict over Taiwan would be catastrophic for China’s future. If Beijing moves militarily on Taiwan, it will alert the rest of the region to China’s comfort with waging war to achieve its objectives, likely triggering other Asian countries to arm and cohere to prevent Chinese domination. Invading Taiwan would also jeopardize Beijing’s access to global finance, data, and markets — ruinous for a country dependent on imports of oil, food, and semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming Beijing could successfully invade and hold Taiwan, China would then face countless problems. Taiwan’s economy would be in tatters, including its globally invaluable semiconductor industry. Untold civilians would be dead or injured, and those who survived the initial conflict would be violently hostile to the invading military power. Beijing would likely face unprecedented diplomatic blowback and sanctions. Conflict just off China’s eastern shoreline would incapacitate one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors, bringing with it disastrous consequences for China’s own export-driven economy. And of course, by invading Taiwan, China would be inviting military engagement with the United States and perhaps other regional powers, including Japan. This would be the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These realities deter China from actively considering an invasion. Xi, like all his predecessors, wants to be the leader who finally annexes Taiwan. But for more than 70 years, Beijing has concluded that the cost of an invasion remains too high, and this explains why China has instead relied largely on economic inducements, and more recently, gray-zone coercions. Far from having a well-thought-out plan to achieve unification, Beijing is, in fact, stuck in a strategic cul-de-sac. After Beijing trampled on Hong Kong’s autonomy, no one can believe that China will solve the crisis in the strait through a policy of “one country, two systems.” China’s hope that the gravitational pull of its economy would be enough to bring Taipei to the negotiating table has likewise been dashed, a victim of both Taiwan’s economic success and Xi’s economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An invasion of Taiwan doesn’t solve any of these problems. Xi would risk it only if he believed that he had no other options. And there are no signs that he is anywhere close to drawing such a conclusion. The United States should try to keep it this way. None of Xi’s speeches resemble the menacing ones that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave in the run-up to his invasion of Ukraine. It is impossible to rule out the chance that Xi might miscalculate or blunder into a conflict. But his statements and behavior do not indicate that he would act so recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hold-your-forces&quot;&gt;Hold Your Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Xi is not yet considering forced unification, the United States must still project sure-footedness in its ability to protect its interests in the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, military decisions must not be allowed to define the United States’ overall approach, as many analysts and policymakers are effectively suggesting they should. The inescapable reality is that no additional increment of U.S. military power that is deployable in the next five years will fundamentally alter the military balance. The United States must rely on statecraft and a broader array of tools to make clear to Beijing the high price of using force to compel unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of a sustainable Taiwan policy should be to preserve peace and stability, with a focus on elongating Beijing’s time horizon such that it sees unification as a “some day” scenario. The United States must especially avoid backing Xi into a corner, preventing a situation in which he no longer treats Taiwan as a long-term objective but as an impending crisis. This different approach would entail an uncomfortable shift in mindset for many analysts and policymakers, who see the United States and China as locked in an inevitable showdown and view any consideration of Beijing’s sensitivities to be a dangerous concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the goal of U.S. policy should be to avoid angering Beijing. There is no evidence that diminished U.S. support for Taiwan would reduce China’s eagerness to absorb the island, which is elemental to the founding narrative of the CCP. But this reality means that the United States should bolster Taiwan’s prosperity, security, and resilience in ways that don’t gratuitously antagonize its powerful neighbor ruled by an increasingly nationalistic leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. support should be dedicated to fortifying Taiwan’s capacity to withstand the full range of pressures the island already contends with from China: cyber, economic, informational, diplomatic, and military. But critically, the United States must be disciplined in declining Taiwan’s requests to provide symbols of sovereignty, such as renaming Taiwan’s diplomatic office in the United States, which would aggravate Beijing without improving security in the Taiwan Strait. Similarly, congressional delegations should be geared toward advancing specific objectives to ensure that benefits exceed costs. The United States should channel its support for Taiwan into areas that concretely address vulnerabilities, such as by helping Taiwan diversify trade flows, acquire asymmetric defensive weapons systems, and stockpile food, fuel, medicine, and munitions that it would need in a crisis. It is a comforting illusion that the solution to cross-strait tensions lies in simply strengthening the military capabilities of Taiwan and the United States such that Beijing decides that it must stand aside and let Taiwan go its own way. In reality, Beijing would not sit idly by as the defense capabilities of the United States and Taiwan grow ever stronger. Indeed, the demonstration of U.S. naval power during the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis had the unintended consequence of provoking a wave of new PLA investments that have eroded U.S. military dominance. Current efforts by Taipei or Washington to prepare for military conflict should account for the PLA’s predictable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The very idea that “strategic clarity” is “clear” is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any approach to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait must begin with understanding how deeply political the issue of Taiwan is for China. It is noteworthy that the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis and the recent spike in tensions over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan were driven by issues of high political visibility — not by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or efforts to back Taipei in international organizations or initiatives to strengthen bilateral economic ties. The lesson is that the United States has more room to concretely support Taiwan when it focuses on substance rather than publicly undercutting Beijing’s core domestic narrative that China is making progress toward unification. Chinese authorities will inevitably grumble about quieter efforts, such as expanding defense dialogues between the United States and Taiwan, but these remain below the threshold of public embarrassment for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, U.S. actions should both meaningfully support Taiwan and give Xi domestic space to proclaim that a path remains open to eventual unification. Examples of such efforts include deepening coordination between the United States and Taiwan on supply chain resilience, diversifying Taiwan’s trade through negotiation of a bilateral trade agreement, strengthening public health coordination, making more asymmetric defensive weapons available to Taiwan, and pooling resources to accelerate innovations on emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence applications. All such efforts would strengthen Taiwan’s capacity to provide for the health, safety, and prosperity of its people without publicly challenging Beijing’s narrative of eventual unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States must back its policy with a credible military posture in the Indo-Pacific, placing greater emphasis on small, dispersed weapons systems in the region and making larger investments in long-range antisurface and antiship missile systems. Such investments could bolster the United States’ ability to deny China opportunities to secure quick military gains on Taiwan. And if the United States sends weapons in a low-key manner, it will frustrate Beijing but leave little room for China to justify the use of force as an appropriate response. In other words, the United States should do more and say less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also resist viewing the Taiwan problem as a contest between authoritarianism and democracy, as some officials in Taipei have urged. Such a framework is understandable, especially in the wake of Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine. It is easier to convince Americans of the value of a safe and prosperous Taiwan when contrasting its liberal democratic identity with Beijing’s deepening autocratic slide. Yet this approach misdiagnoses the problem. The growing challenge to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait stems not from the nature of China’s political system — which has always been deeply illiberal and unapologetically Leninist — but from its increasing ability to project power, combined with the consolidation of power around Xi.&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Footage of PLA military exercises, Beijing, August 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling, this approach boxes Washington in. If the United States paints cross-strait relations with bright ideological lines, it will hinder U.S. policymakers in making nuanced choices in gray areas. As American game theorist Thomas Schelling demonstrated, deterring an adversary requires a blend of credible threats and credible assurances. The assurance requires convincing Beijing that if it refrains from using force, then the United States will hold off on supporting Taiwan’s independence. When U.S. policy on Taiwan becomes infused with ideology, the credibility of American assurances diminishes, and the United States’ willingness to offer assurances to China becomes proscribed. Taking Beijing’s concerns into consideration may not fit the hawkish Zeitgeist in Washington, but this type of strategic empathy is imperative for anticipating an opponent’s calculus and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framing tensions as an ideological struggle risks backing China into a corner, too, because it feeds Beijing’s anxieties that the United States will stand in permanent opposition to any type of resolution to the Taiwan problem. This, in turn, might lead Beijing to conclude that its only choice is to exploit its military strength to override the United States’ opposition and forcibly subsume the island, even at significant economic and political cost. Any Chinese leader would consider Taiwan’s escape from China’s grasp an existential loss. Biden’s comments in September 2022 that the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense if China were to launch an “unprecedented attack” have again sharpened the debate on whether U.S. policy is shifting toward a clearer articulation of when and how it would intervene on Taiwan’s behalf. Yet this debate over “strategic clarity” is a distraction. For one thing, the Chinese military already assumes that the United States would intervene if China were to launch an all-out invasion, so from Beijing’s perspective, U.S. involvement is already factored into military plans. Moreover, in the absence of a mutual defense treaty between the United States and Taiwan, which is not on the table, there is no binding requirement for Washington to intervene, even if a president has suggested that it should do so. What’s more, an outright and unprovoked invasion by the PLA is the least likely scenario the United States will encounter, and so the way in which the United States responds to Beijing’s aggression would inevitably depend on the specific circumstances of a Chinese attack. In this sense, the very idea that “strategic clarity” is “clear” is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than rehashing a decades-old debate over strategic clarity is to focus on how the United States’ “one China” policy should be adapted to meet the new and pressing challenges presented by a vastly more powerful and aggressive China. Simply stating that U.S. policy has not shifted, as the White House did following Biden’s remarks, rings hollow to Beijing and to any honest observer of U.S. policy over the past six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-act&quot;&gt;Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than perpetuate the fiction of constancy, the United States should tell the truth: its decisions are guided by a determination to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait, and if Beijing intensifies pressure on Taipei, Washington will adjust its posture accordingly. And the United States should pledge that it will do the same if Taiwan pursues symbolic steps that erode cross-strait conditions. Such an approach would recognize that the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is dynamic, not fixed. It would recognize Beijing’s agency in either sustaining or undermining peace. Washington should make it clear that if Beijing or Taipei upsets stability in the strait, it would seek to reestablish the equilibrium. But for such an approach to work, the actions and intentions of the United States must be clear, and its commitment to this equilibrium must be credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should be firm and consistent in declaring that it will accept any resolution to cross-strait tensions that is reached peacefully and in accordance with the views of Taiwan’s people. If Xi wants to find a peaceful path to unification, which he and other Chinese leaders still stress is their preference, then he must sell this option to Taiwan’s public. The truth is that such a reconciliation may not come for decades, if ever. But it is nonetheless worth pursuing a peace that allows Taiwan to grow and prosper in a stable regional environment, even if such a goal does not have the sense of finality that many American analysts and policymakers crave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After half a decade of deterioration, the U.S.-Chinese relationship stands at the edge of crisis. Bilateral frictions have moved from trade to technology and, now, to the threat of direct military confrontation. To be sure, Beijing’s threats toward Taiwan are the fundamental cause of the tensions across the strait. But this blunt fact only serves to highlight just how vital it is for the United States to act with foresight, resolve, and dexterity. A direct confrontation between the United States and China would wreak devastation for generations. Success will be measured by each day that the people of Taiwan continue to live in safety and prosperity and enjoy political autonomy. The fundamental objectives of American efforts must be to preserve peace and stability, strengthen Taiwan’s confidence in its future, and credibly demonstrate to Beijing that now is not the time to force a violent confrontation. Achieving these objectives requires elongating timelines, not bringing an intractable challenge to a head. Wise statecraft, more than military strength, offers the best path to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

The vastness of the region is not fully captured in two dimensions: the Arctic Circle spreads across roughly 14.5 million square kilometers, a greater area than any country save Russia.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This fact is not only trivia; it has serious implications for the well-being of the communities who live there, the militaries who monitor it, and the scientists who seek to better predict the coming global impacts of climate change. To perform their functions well, each of these actors seeks tools to compensate for or overcome these vast distances, as well as the harsh environment that makes sustained presence in the Arctic so challenging. Increasingly, these communities — some of which have been in the Arctic for decades, and others for centuries — are coming to understand that artificial intelligence may be essential to monitor the region and predict changes within it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, the authors tackle the implications of this new tool for national security and climate research. Both pieces illustrate how governments, scientists, and Indigenous communities can use artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to better understand key Arctic problem sets, particularly those that involve parsing either a massive amount of data or complex and shifting future scenarios. At the same time, both note that AI/ML, while holding immense potential, remains not entirely proven. In some cases, a lack of funding hinders a robust deployment of AI/ML; in others, it must compete with more established and orthodox methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first essay, Lieutenant Commander Michael Bielby of the Canadian Armed Forces lays out Canada’s incipient efforts to use AI/ML for its domain awareness mission in the far north. He explains the unique physical challenges of the region and the insufficiency of using only crewed resources to monitor it, given the finiteness of those assets and the vast distances involved. Passive and active sensors are the means to compensate for this reality, but as Lt. Commander Bielby notes, this creates a new problem: a “deluge” of data where it is not always possible for human operators to distinguish quickly (enough) between what might be an adversary vessel and what might simply be natural debris. He argues that AI/ML may well be the answer to this riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second contributor is Dr. Lillian “Doc” Alessa, an Arctic and intelligence expert and a member of the National Climate Assessment Team. Dr. Alessa interrogates the applicability of AI/ML for researching the thaw of Arctic permafrost, which underlies 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. The rate at which climate change causes this permafrost to melt has serious consequences for not only local Arctic communities, but the entire world. Dr. Alessa argues that, especially if paired with the knowledge of those local communities, AI-generated models will allow policymakers to better understand permafrost thaw as well as test different scenarios of melting against various tactics for intervention or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsibility of every state is to exercise its sovereignty through the protection of its defined territory from intrusions by foreign states. For that to happen, the state must understand what is happening within those physical spaces. It must have domain awareness. For a number of reasons, this becomes extremely challenging in far northern regions. In recent years, Canada and other Arctic states are increasingly considering how to develop and deploy AI/ML tools to address this domain awareness challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 40 percent of Canada’s land mass, roughly 3.5 million km2, lies north of 60° north latitude. As with most inhabited Arctic regions in North America, Europe, and Russia, it is scarcely populated — in Canada’s case, fewer than 120,000 people, or less than one person per approximately 26 km2. Understandably, it is very difficult to generate the requisite level of domain awareness necessary for the state to exercise sovereignty in this remote territory. The obvious solution is to start generating that awareness before state actors can breach territorial boundaries — in other words, to detect them at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduces a whole new problem set, as Canada’s exclusive economic zone north of 60° encompasses approximately 4 million km2. The economic and logistical feasibility of monitoring such a vast area using crewed resources would be taxing enough, but the task of generating maritime domain awareness becomes financially and logistically untenable when considering the inhospitable climate of the Canadian north, a lack of suitable extant infrastructure, and the fact that infrastructure development projects are plagued by supply chain issues and a shortened building season. To further exacerbate the issue, the finite crewed resources suitable to conduct this mission are also required to deliver similar strategic effects on overseas missions. As such, the only viable option, at this time, for Canada becomes the employment of space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (SB-ISR) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the various factors that complicate maritime activity in northern waters — such as sea state (high sea states result in sea spray and accumulation of ice on the upper decks in sub-zero temperatures, which can affect ship stability and potentially result in a ship sinking or capsizing), icebergs, and the varying constructions of vessels plying those waters — no single SB-ISR sensor type is a panacea. An active sensor may detect the signal return off an object (e.g., metal reflect signals better than fiberglass) but cannot necessarily differentiate between a ship and a bergy bit, and passive sensors can be defeated simply by turning off an emitter. Therefore, a mix of active and passive sensors ensures a greater probability of detecting contacts. However, in solving one problem, another is created: multiple sensor feeds create massive amounts of positional data. The result is that Arctic operators drown in the deluge of data from SB-ISR sensors while starving for domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the deluge of data is framed as a big data issue, there are four variables to consider: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Maritime positional data from various sensor feeds for the approaches to North America and the Arctic exceeds tens of millions of reports daily (volume), is received in a variety of structured and unstructured reporting formats (variety), and arrives continuously (velocity). System operators are not able to keep up with the velocity of the data flow from SB-ISR sensors while performing the necessary quality-control functions (veracity) while also monitoring for anomalous behavior as bad actors attempt to exploit various interstitial gray areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to correlate the volume and variety of data at the velocity in which it is received is through the adoption of AI/ML. This technology will not only solve the operators’ problems but, at machine-to-machine speeds, will be able to cross-cue additional sensors based on the data received, thereby improving the probability of achieving positive identification and subsequent domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is still somewhat of a newcomer to the adoption and implementation of AI/ML to support maritime domain awareness. However, the Royal Canadian Navy’s Innovation Team recently trialed an advanced maritime domain awareness software that uses AI/ML to detect surface vessel traffic acting unusually. In addition, the Royal Canadian Air Force, as the CAF Functional Authority for space, has factored AI/ML requirements into many of the SB-ISR projects currently under way. Given the complexities of the approval process for CAF projects, the implementation of many of these solutions is still a few years off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, the CAF’s most effective AI/ML mitigating strategy has been the reinvigoration of multinational partnerships, such as the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and the (re)establishment of information-sharing agreements among allied nations and partner departments within the Canadian government. Once the data is shared, recipients can process it and notify the broader operational community of any indications and warnings of anomalous behavior. Within national chains of command, or in accordance with extant multinational treaties, this then allows platforms such as aircraft, ships, and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be tasked to conduct ISR missions against specific targets. This is a more efficient use of limited resources for known high-value targets and for missions of national importance. However, the weakness in this strategy is revealed in situations where the military is dealing with contacts that have not been positively identified and whose value is unknown. In such cases, the competition against other national interests and departmental priorities for the allocation of scarce resources makes it difficult to justify ISR missions. This is why this multinational approach, while useful, remains an interim solution at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more that countries depend on SB-ISR in the vast and remote high north to aid in the exercising of sovereignty, the more likely Arctic operators are to drown in a deluge of big data. In the long term, investing in the development of robust AI/ML capabilities that can be employed in the region is the only way for Arctic states to turn big data into domain awareness and ensure their sovereignty is protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the population of the Arctic is only around 4 million people, the region has global significance due to its strategic geography, exploitable natural resources, and rapid rate of climate and environmental change (CEC). It also contains permafrost, which is ground that remains below 0°C for two or more consecutive years, making it frozen and a largely stable foundation for the active layer, which supports above-ground flora, fauna, and built infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous (deep) and discontinuous (shallow) permafrost comprises a full 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere, and current estimates suggest that between 30 and 85 percent of current subsurface permafrost will thaw within a century, depending on global temperature increases. While permafrost thaw is often thought of as a future phenomenon, it has been changing rapidly for roughly the past 40 years. The effects can be readily seen in natural terrain and built infrastructure, where degradation is ultimately placing at risk roughly $15.5 billion in civil infrastructure in the United States alone, much of which supports the defense enterprise. Furthermore, given that permafrost covers approximately 65 percent of the Russian Arctic, it is necessary to understand, with exquisite precision, where and when changes to Russia’s infrastructure will result in opportunities to gain strategic advantage by improving the Department of Defense’s own resilience to a highly variable operating environment. Understanding the complex dynamics of permafrost thaw and its effects on strategic activities such as defense and security requires leveraging all available tools, particularly AI/ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea bucks a deep-seated tradition in Arctic research, where field research is synonymous with the golden era of exploration. However, field research places significant burdens on local communities and funding agencies, which incur high costs for increasingly low returns on investments. Especially when combined with the deep pools of local and place-based knowledge of Indigenous peoples, new tools such as AI/ML are a better means to improve U.S. and allied resilience to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of resilience in Arctic defense is poorly articulated. It is a term often overused and thrown around in strategic intents and policies, holding different meanings for different interest groups. Here it is defined as the ability of three types of integrated systems — (1) social (people, including their cultures and perceptions); (2) ecological (the natural environments in which they live); and (3) technological (the tools and structures used by human organizations) — to maintain desired functions despite climate change. To be achieved, Arctic resilience in this context must include the social elements of cultures and human behavior. Given the many variables and their complicated interactions, it is more critical than ever that social and societal systems be incorporated into permafrost science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML promises to yield the needed insights in time to be proactive and adapt successfully to the unprecedented rate of CEC. A holy grail for permafrost researchers, geopolitical strategists, and military planners alike is the development of data-driven scenarios within which it is possible to forecast potential early warnings of threats and opportunities to guide proactive interventions. AI/ML permits the user to take known interactions of variables (i.e., rule sets) within academic disciplines and apply them to a range of scenarios at landscape and regional scales as an integrated system. Working within these scenarios, AI/ML can process data to visualize the consequences and trade-offs of different CEC conditions and types of interventions at the local scale. Extending this to permafrost and defense, AI/ML creates knowledge of where and when a strategic advantage may be gained and by whom as CEC affects different types of infrastructure and ecological processes. For example, permafrost underlies the majority of Russia’s Arctic coastline and infrastructure in the region. Using AI/ML to model these effects accelerates the ability to accurately gauge, for example, which military bases will be at risk and what the consequences are to the United States and its partners and allies, which can lead to better precision in defense planning and diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML can be used in this context only because extensive funding over the past 30 years has yielded rule sets for permafrost physics, soil biology, and behavior of built environments that are highly precise. This means AI/ML worlds can be used to scale down to individual structures, which can rapidly improve the way infrastructure, logistics, and operations are designed. However, knowledge of how humans will react to such changes is lacking, such as how communities could be held at risk by and respond to the loss of freshwater resources. AI/ML offers a readily available laboratory to run scenarios and understand trade-offs far more quickly, cost effectively, and safely than could ever be accomplished in the past. Its value is increased when it is used as a tool that enhances engagements with diverse human communities. Since it allows multiple variables to run simultaneously, and since these series can be adjusted and amended in real time by human stakeholders and rights-holders, it also helps eliminate much of the uncertainty that policymakers and decisionmakers dislike. For example, it can be used to better identify key water sources and the systems that need to be in place to either protect them or mitigate their loss, in order to ensure their resilience for future use. In short, knowing the likely effects of permafrost on key resources allows affected communities to articulate consequences, trade-offs, and their approaches to dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that AI/ML does not provide answers or solutions, it merely enables the humans tackling these challenges to ask better questions, refine understandings, and then ask the harder questions together. This cycle has traditionally taken months or years but can be done within hours via AI/ML-assisted research. Indeed, the key to addressing the many unknowns of a rapidly changing Arctic and the roadmap to resilience in defense and security is asking the right questions. Using AI/ML offers the freedom to think and do things differently by envisioning scenarios of plausible futures where a diverse range of adaptation interventions can be examined — in collaboration with the people, especially local actors, who will have to carry them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter point underlines yet another benefit of leveraging AI/ML: this process of refining questions simultaneously enhances partnerships. In fact, one of the most critical factors in using AI/ML effectively is close collaboration with rights-holders and stakeholders — ideally at the same time — whether they be local communities or military planners. Models that are not aligned with the perceptions and knowledge that exist at local scales induce higher uncertainties in outcomes. In other words, using AI/ML to understand the consequences of changes in permafrost and develop the interventions to build resilience relies as much on human behaviors as it does on engineering. AI/ML is a key tool to bring the end users, operators, and stakeholders directly into the data-driven scenarios where human perceptions, decisionmaking, and reactions can be incorporated in real time, something that cannot be achieved outside of AI/ML-built worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming evidence that human behaviors and social dynamics are powerful determinants of resilience outcomes, disciplinary approaches in engineering, human factors (i.e., human-machine teaming), and ecology heavily dominate Arctic permafrost research. Alone, these will not deliver the level of adaptation needed to address CEC in the Arctic because adaptation is itself a human endeavor, which requires the integration of the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptation can be accomplished by leveraging the analytic power of AI/ML to integrate the authoritative data available in hand, in order to identify critical gaps in knowledge, training, and preparedness and gain a more precise understanding of resilience. Approaching permafrost in the Arctic as an engineering problem will not lead to resilience if social dynamics are not central to analyses. AI/ML has often been criticized as something that removes humans from the loop, but it is only through engagement with partners — those who must deal with the consequences of changing permafrost, especially the loss of freshwater systems — that it is possible to develop accurate scenarios where decisions can be made and the effects of those decisions can be seen more quickly. Approaching permafrost thaw in the Arctic through AI/ML-assisted scenarios built and amended by stakeholders will result in more effective policies and the acquisition of technologies that are tailored to specific adaptations. For example, instead of trying to move water over long distances, something that requires an enormous amount of fuel, water storage systems can be engineered specific to the locale in which permafrost is changing. Innovation is often met with resistance even at the highest levels, but a growing number of practitioners — including colleagues across academia, Arctic communities, the U.S. government, and partners from the Five Eyes and NATO alliances — recognize the need to shift the approach to science and encourage the use of AI-related tools such as agent-based modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML is clearly a useful tool for permafrost research in the Arctic, and other nations are beating the United States to it. Leveraging it may even lead to ideas for novel applications relevant for questions of Arctic geopolitics, such as Russia’s militarization of the region. Without AI/ML, the United States may not gain insights at the speed of need, and research will remain slow and expensive, yielding models that are less useful to the U.S. defense enterprise and the stakeholders and partners in the Arctic on whom the United States relies. Leveraging AI/ML allows the mess of reality, in all its glorious diversity, to be incorporated into a structured set of analyses and scenarios that are only possible with advanced computational tools. It is the means by which the inputs from diverse stakeholders, whether the defense enterprise or an Indigenous corporation, can be fully included in establishing and maintaining adaptation actions that collectively ensure resilience in a rapidly changing Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure that those drawing lessons from the conflict do so from a solid foundation, this report seeks to outline key lessons, based on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff, from the fighting between February and July 2022. As the underlying source material for much of this report cannot yet be made public, this should be understood as testimony rather than as an academic study. Given the requirements for operational security, it is necessarily incomplete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to invade Ukraine over a 10-day period and thereafter occupy the country to enable annexation by August 2022. The Russian plan presupposed that speed, and the use of deception to keep Ukrainian forces away from Kyiv, could enable the rapid seizure of the capital. The Russian deception plan largely succeeded, and the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage north of Kyiv. The very operational security that enabled the successful deception, however, also led Russian forces to be unprepared at the tactical level to execute the plan effectively. The Russian plan’s greatest deficiency was the lack of reversionary courses of action. As a result, when speed failed to produce the desired results, Russian forces found their positions steadily degraded as Ukraine mobilised. Despite these setbacks, Russia refocused on Donbas and, since Ukraine had largely expended its ammunition supply, proved successful in subsequent operations, slowed by the determination – rather than the capabilities – of Ukrainian troops. From April, the West became Ukraine’s strategic depth, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) only robbed Russia of the initiative once long-range fires brought Russian logistics under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical competence of the Russian military proved significantly inferior compared with the expectations of many observers based within and outside Ukraine and Russia. Nevertheless, Russian weapons systems proved largely effective, and those units with a higher level of experience demonstrated that the AFRF have considerable military potential, even if deficiencies in training and the context of how they were employed meant that the Russian military failed to meet that potential. Factoring in the idiosyncrasies of the Russian campaign, there are five key areas that should be monitored to judge whether the Russian military is making progress in resolving its structural and cultural deficiencies. These areas should be used to inform assessments of Russian combat power in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF currently operate with a hierarchy of jointery in which the priorities of the land component are paramount, and the military as a whole is subordinate to the special services. This creates sub-optimal employment of other branches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF force-generation model is flawed. It proposes the creation of amalgamated combined arms formations in wartime but lacks the strength of junior leadership to knit these units together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a culture of reinforcing failure unless orders are changed at higher levels. This appears less evident in the Russian Aerospace Forces than in the Ground Forces and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF are culturally vulnerable to deception because they lack the ability to rapidly fuse information, are culturally averse to providing those who are executing orders with the context to exercise judgement, and incentivise a dishonest reporting culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF’s capabilities and formations are prone to fratricide. Electronic warfare (EW) systems and other capabilities rarely deconflict, while processes for identifying friend from foe and establishing control measures are inadequate. The result is that capabilities that should magnify one another’s effects must be employed sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond assessments of the Russian armed forces, there are significant lessons to be drawn from the conflict for the British and other NATO militaries. The foremost of these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In due course, it will be possible to extend this study to cover the later phase of the war when Ukraine moved on to offensive operations. As the UAF expend significant ammunition, however, and now depend on their international partners for equipment, it is important that those partners draw the appropriate lessons from the war so far, not least so that they can prepare themselves to deter future threats and to best support Ukraine. Ukraine’s victory is possible, but it requires significant heavy fighting. With appropriate support, Ukraine can prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no sanctuary in modern warfare. The enemy can strike throughout operational depth. Survivability depends on dispersing ammunitions stocks, command and control, maintenance areas and aircraft. Ukraine successfully evaded Russia’s initial wave of strikes by dispersing its arsenals, aircraft and air defences. Conversely, the Russians succeeded in engaging 75% of static defence sites in the first 48 hours of the war. Nor is setting up a headquarters in a civilian building sufficient to make it survivable. The British Army must consider the vulnerability of higher-echelon enablement. The RAF must consider how many deployable spares kits it has to enable dispersion of its fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighting demands large initial stockpiles and significant slack capacity. Despite the prominence of anti-tank guided weapons in the public narrative, Ukraine blunted Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv using massed fires from two artillery brigades. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not as significant at the beginning of the conflict, with just over a 2:1 advantage: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176; and 3,547 multiple-launch rocket systems against 1,680. Ukraine maintained artillery parity for the first month and a half and then began to run low on munitions so that, by June, the AFRF had a 10:1 advantage in volume of fire. Evidently, no country in NATO, other than the US, has sufficient initial weapons stocks for warfighting or the industrial capacity to sustain largescale operations. This must be rectified if deterrence is to be credible and is equally a problem for the RAF and Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS (CUAS) are essential across all branches and at all echelons. Although critical to competitiveness by providing situational awareness, 90% of UAS employed are lost. For the most part, UAS must be cheap and attritable. For land forces, they must be organic to units for the purposes of both situational awareness and target acquisition. The primary means of CUAS is EW. Another critical tactical requirement is to be alerted to the presence of UAS. For the Royal Navy, CUAS is critical for protecting vessels operating beyond the protection of a task force. For the RAF, the provision of look-down sensing to locate UAS to contribute to air defence is critical. This allows defensive resources to be prioritised on the right axes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The force must fight for the right to precision. Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable. Precision weapons, however, are scarce and can be defeated by EW. To enable kill chains to function at the speed of relevance, EW for attack, protection and direction finding is a critical element of modern combined arms operations. Sequencing fires to disrupt EW and create windows of opportunity for precision effects is critical and creates training requirements. In modern warfare, the electromagnetic spectrum is unlikely to be denied, but it is continually disrupted, and forces must endeavour to gain advantage within it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the pervasive ISTAR on the modern battlefield and the layering of multiple sensors at the tactical level make concealment exceedingly difficult to sustain. Survivability is often afforded by being sufficiently dispersed to become an uneconomical target, by moving quickly enough to disrupt the enemy’s kill chain and thereby evade engagement, or by entering hardened structures. Shell scrapes and hasty defences can increase immediate survivability but also risk the force becoming fixed by fire while precision fires and specialist munitions do not leave these positions survivable. Forces instead should prioritise concentrating effects while only concentrating mass under favourable conditions – with an ability to offer mutual support beyond line of sight – and should give precedence to mobility as a critical component of their survivability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has seen the return of conventional warfighting to Europe. This has provided an unparalleled opportunity to assess Russia’s military capabilities and the impacts of a range of modern weapons on the battlefield. Ensuring that the correct lessons are drawn from the conflict is vital in two key respects: for Ukraine, if it is to receive appropriate military support from its international partners; and for NATO members, if they are to ensure they are militarily capable of deterring aggression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debates about the relative merits of armour, anti-armour weapons, electronic warfare (EW) and airpower have been fierce among external observers of the conflict. Most of these debates, however, have lacked any grounding in data. Much of the discourse surrounding the war has drawn on fragmentary online videos that show specific activities detached from a wider tactical or operational context. A great many definitive statements have been made about Russian capabilities based on the propaganda material produced by both sides. There are partial public datasets regarding Russian losses, but there is almost no detailed information on Ukrainian dispositions, actions, decision-making or setbacks. There is, therefore, a high risk that false lessons will be drawn from the war. Given that Ukraine now depends on its international partners for its strategic depth in training and materiel, a reasonable understanding of what transpired and the actual demands of modern combat in the Ukrainian theatre is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to August 2022, when Ukraine was on the defensive against a large-scale and determined Russian offensive, operational security demanded that the Ukrainian government minimise the available information on its forces, dispositions and tactics. This is still the case with the preparation and conduct of offensive operations by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), their preparations to counter newly mobilised Russian units and the effects of Russia’s renewed strike campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. How Ukraine denied Russia its initial theory of victory and how the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) reprioritised to offensive operations in Donbas are now sufficiently historical to allow for a more open discussion of events. This report is an account of the pre-war plans of both Russia and Ukraine, the course of the initial phases of the war between February and July 2022, an overview of what has been learned about the AFRF, and an assessment of the implications for NATO and specifically the UK military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is methodologically problematic. It draws on the operational data accumulated by the General Staff of the UAF during the conflict, which was made available to the authors. A significant proportion of this data cannot be made public but was used to inform the conclusions of this report. A good example is Ukrainian losses, which are factored into the conclusions reached as regards the relative effectiveness of tactics and capabilities but cannot be disclosed as they remain operationally sensitive. Other data that is cited was sometimes obtained through methods and sources of collection that are sensitive. The authors have considered the data in the context of its method of collection and the corresponding confidence in its accuracy. However, these judgements cannot be discussed in the report because the nature of the underlying sources for this data remains classified. For this reason, this report should not be considered a work of academic scholarship and it does not use citations. Rather, it should be considered as testimony based on personal observations of the authors. This includes the direct participation in strategic and operational decision-making during the war by two of the authors: Lieutenant General Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi and Oleksandr V Danylyuk. It also includes extensive interactions and consultations with Ukrainian military and intelligence personnel at all levels and the observation of tactical activities by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, who worked in Ukraine in January, February, April, June, August and October 2022. Although this report is methodologically imperfect, the speed at which Ukraine’s partners must make decisions on procurement, training and capability development to ensure their own preparedness means that it was felt to be more useful to publish an imperfect study than wait for the evidence to be publishable long after its relevance to decision-makers had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to clarify what is and is not considered in this report. The work is intended to properly frame the international understanding of the conventional military aspects of the conflict. It therefore focuses on areas that deserve attention. It is too short to be a comprehensive study of what transpired throughout the conflict. The conclusions are limited to the consideration of conventional operations and do not seek to assess the extensive unconventional campaign waged by Russia against Ukraine. That said, unconventional operations are necessarily described insofar as they provide context for conventional force employment, but conclusions on the lessons to be learned regarding unconventional operations from the war are to be the subject of a separate and adjacent study. It is also important to reiterate that this report does not cover events after July 2022 when the UAF began undertaking offensive operations; these activities have produced additional lessons that are important for a broader appreciation of the challenges on the modern battlefield, even though they are regrettably inappropriate to publicly disclose at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has five chapters. Chapter I outlines Russia’s invasion plan as set out in captured copies of the orders issued to a range of Russian units. Given the criticality of unconventional operations in this plan, and the impact of these activities on the posture and tasks assigned to Russia’s conventional forces, the chapter necessarily describes these in some detail. Since there was exhaustive discussion of the size and capabilities of Russia’s conventional forces around Ukraine prior to the conflict, these details are only described in terms of the alignment of Russian forces to operational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter II sets out Ukraine’s capabilities, assumptions and starting positions at the beginning of the war. One of the major problems with public analysis of the conflict has been the lack of awareness of the capabilities of the UAF. For example, the public obsession with anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) largely ignored the large number of main battle tanks fielded by the UAF at the beginning of the conflict. This chapter, therefore, seeks to partly explain what Ukraine could field at the start of the war, as well as how Ukraine planned to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter III covers the course of the first three phases of the invasion, from 24 February to the beginning of July 2022. It is largely narrative but focuses on the command decisions and key factors that shaped the success or failure of specific tasks undertaken by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. The chapter tries to also explain the concepts of operation employed by the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter IV details observations regarding the performance of the AFRF. Rather than describing Russia’s strengths and shortcomings in context, this chapter endeavours to identify wider cultural and structural challenges for its military that can be tracked to judge whether Russian military performance is improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter V provides a summary of relevant lessons for the British military seeking to refine its capabilities, training and organisation to be prepared for high-intensity warfare in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with recommendations for policymakers. First, consumption rates of munitions, materiel and systems during high-intensity warfighting will be high, and stockpiles are critical to conventional defence being credible; second, national policies, permissions and industrial processes must be adaptable enough to allow change at the speed of relevance; and third, getting the correct mix of and synergies between new and legacy systems is essential to effective modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russias-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;I. Russia’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s strategic objective in its invasion of Ukraine was the subjugation of the Ukrainian state. This plan was formulated first and foremost by Russia’s special services and a core group within the presidential administration, supported by senior officials in the Ministry of Defence. As such, it is necessary to briefly outline the wider context from which the orders to Russia’s conventional forces were derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military build-up against Ukraine began in March 2021 when large numbers of conventional troops were added to existing forces along Ukraine’s borders. This build-up performed three functions. First, it put pressure on Western governments to re-engage in the Minsk II negotiations to encourage Kyiv to make concessions and thereby avert a conflict. Second, it pre-positioned military equipment around Ukraine that would allow for a more rapid build-up of forces when the time came for the invasion. Third, it provided an opportunity for Moscow to assess the reaction of Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners dismissed the threat in spring 2021 because they did not observe the necessary enablers deployed with the Russian formations nor the necessary political shaping of the information environment in Russia to support an invasion. They were correct on both counts – the build-up turned out to be a mobilisation exercise. However, the lesson for the Kremlin was that the enablers could be brought to the formations faster than Ukraine’s partners could bring military capabilities: if these were the indicators that would cause international partners to react, they would do so too late. The Kremlin’s confidence that it could invade Ukraine without significant international interference was an important reason for undertaking the full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, the 9th Section of the 5th Service of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) was enlarged into a directorate and tasked with planning for the occupation of Ukraine. As part of this preparation, the FSB drew on extensive surveys carried out in Ukraine. These surveys painted a picture of a largely politically apathetic Ukrainian society that distrusted its leaders, was primarily concerned about the economy and thought an escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely. Moreover, Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally articulated in an essay in July 2021 his belief that the people of Ukraine viewed Russians favourably and believed they were part of a shared civilisation, cruelly divided by historical political mistakes. The barrier, in his view, to correcting these mistakes was the government in Kyiv, which he accused of being a puppet to external powers hostile to Russia. The Russian military leadership was also confident that it would defeat the UAF after more than a decade of modernisation. Assurances from General Valery Gerasimov on Russia’s military capabilities played a key role in shaping the confidence of Russia’s special services in their plan. As Gerasimov told international interlocutors on the outbreak of the war, ‘I command the second most powerful Army in the world’. Separately Gerasimov told British counterparts that Russia had achieved conventional military parity with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conception of the Russian invasion therefore was developed around several key assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed was critical to success to render the response of the international community irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of Ukraine’s leaders would remove the barrier for pro-Russian Ukrainians to vocalise support for the occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling heating, electricity and finance would be an effective means of controlling the apathetic majority of the Ukrainian population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian military could defeat the Ukrainian military on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these assumptions, the FSB, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Gerasimov and elements within the presidential administration developed their plan to achieve Putin’s strategic goal. The key military-strategic tasks for the Russian military and security forces were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Degrade Ukraine’s ability to defend itself by destroying its air, maritime and air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defeat Ukrainian Ground Forces by fixing them in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffuse Ukraine’s will and capacity to resist by eliminating Ukraine’s political and military leadership and occupying critical centres of political and economic power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deceive the Ukrainian government as to the time, location, scope and scale of Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a tension in this plan between the aim of diffusing Ukraine’s political unity and deceiving Ukraine as to the intent. The former would have required a sustained shaping phase preceding the invasion. The latter demanded speed. It appears that Russian planners succumbed to optimism bias as to the dislocating effect that speed itself could achieve in diffusing Ukraine’s will to resist and therefore opted to undertake a shock and awe campaign with little preliminary shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to commence the invasion with a massive missile and airstrike campaign against Ukraine’s air defences, command and control (C2) infrastructure, airfields and ammunition storage depots. This campaign would not target critical infrastructure such as power stations and railways, because these were vital to Russia’s plans for occupying the country. The elimination of Ukraine’s political leadership would primarily be a task for Russia’s special services. Another line of effort, allocated to Russia’s special forces and air-assault troops, was to capture Ukraine’s power stations, airfields, water supplies, central bank and parliament. The intelligence community of Ukraine believes that Russia also planned to use Belarusian airborne units to capture the Rivne and Khmelnytsky nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable these operations, Russia’s Ground Forces were to simultaneously advance under several groups of forces to clear and occupy administrative centres on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River, along with Kyiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa. Russian groups of forces were built around the military district command posts, with the name of the group of forces corresponding to the military district commanding the direction. This can cause some confusion as the military district names correspond with their geographical position in Russia, but do not correspond with their relative position in Ukraine. The northern axis was the main effort, focused on the encirclement and capture of Kyiv. For this purpose, the Russians formed two groups of forces commanded from the Eastern Military District Command Post. One group was formed in the Gomel region of Belarus and used the tactical sign ‘V’ with orders to attack Kyiv along the right (western) bank of the Dnipro River. The second group was formed in the Bryansk region of Russia and used the tactical sign ‘O’ with orders to surround Kyiv from the left (eastern) bank. The Southern Military District Command Post commanded units with the tactical symbol ‘Z in a square’, ordered to attack from occupied Crimea to establish control over the North Crimean Water Canal, Energodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, surround Mariupol, take control of the bridges over the Dnipro and advance along the right bank to Voznesensk with the aim of seizing the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant. The Western Military District Command Post commanded groups of forces projected from Kursk, Belgorod and Voronezh using the tactical symbol ‘Z’ and tasked with encircling the Ukrainian troops in Donbas along the Lozova–Gulyapole line or the Barvinkovo–Velika Novosilka line. Such an encirclement, combined with fixing operations along the line of control using conscripts from occupied Luhansk and Donetsk, was intended to cut off about 50% of the UAF (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4b41HF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Original Russian Axes of Advance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground forces were assigned sectors and tasks down to the level of the battalion tactical group. For mechanised forces, the intent was often to rapidly occupy and thereafter isolate and screen key objectives. On the axis from Gomel to Kyiv, for example, the force was divided into a screening force that was to establish positions facing west to cut off Kyiv from western Ukraine, and units responsible for pushing into the city. Very little consideration appears to have been given to Ukrainian reserves or the Territorial Defence Forces (TDF). The assertion in Russian planning that Ukraine could generate only 40,000 additional troops appears to be premised on the anticipated speed of the operation rather than an appreciation of Ukraine’s capacity for mobilisation. This emphasis on speed led to units being ordered to advance in administrative column by road and to attempt to bypass any initial resistance. The assumption was that by D+10, Russian units would transition to stabilisation operations. The synchronisation matrix of the 1st Guards Tank Army (Western Military District), for example, captured near Kyiv in March 2022, stated that by D+10 the force would ‘proceed to the blocking and destruction of individual scattered units of the Armed Forces and the remnants of nationalist resistance units’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final grouping of Russian forces comprised the amphibious component and dispositions of the Black Sea Fleet. Two amphibious task groups were created with the intention of conducting landings ahead of advancing Russian ground forces on the Kherson–Mykolaiv–Odesa axis. These were to go in after the initial invasion, preceding the Ground Forces to seize key intersections and chokepoints to enable the rapid onwards movement of troops along the coast after Mykolaiv. In addition to this task, the Black Sea Fleet was to support the massive strike campaign by launching Kalibr cruise missiles throughout the depth of Ukraine, and isolate the theatre by blockading the Ukrainian coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After D+10, the role of Russia’s conventional forces was to transition to a supporting function to Russia’s special services, responsible for establishing occupation administrations on the territories. Since these activities were critical to the Russian theory of victory in the operation, it is important to outline these plans to appropriately contextualise the role of the conventional force. The assumption appears to have been that Ukrainian government officials would either flee or be captured as a result of the speed of the invasion. It was also anticipated that shock would prevent the immediate mobilisation of the population, and that protests and other civil resistance could be managed through the targeted disintegration of Ukrainian civil society. To manage these protests Russian forces would be supported by Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) and riot control units. Meanwhile the FSB was tasked with capturing local officials. The Russian counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories had compiled lists that divided Ukrainians into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those to be physically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those in need of suppression and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those considered neutral who could be induced to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those prepared to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those in the top category, the FSB had conducted wargames with detachments of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) to conduct kill-or-capture missions. In many cases, the purpose of capture was to put individuals involved in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity (often referred to as the Maidan Revolution) on trial to be executed. Although initial lists of persons in the second category existed, the approach was to be more methodical, with the registration of the population through door-to-door sweeps and the use of filtration camps to establish counterintelligence files on large portions of the population in the occupied territories. Filtration would be used to intimidate people, to determine whether they needed to be displaced into Russia, and to lay the groundwork for records to monitor and disrupt resistance networks. Over time, Russia would bring teachers and other officials from Russia itself to engage in the re-education of Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended method of political control had both a regional and national component. The regional component comprised the coerced cooperation of regional governors and local authorities. The national component involved the murder of Ukraine’s executive branch and the capture of parliament. The pro-Russian faction within the parliament would be encouraged to form a Movement for Peace, which other parliamentarians would be encouraged and coerced to support. This Movement for Peace would ban resistance in the name of preserving peace. Regions that resisted could thereafter be cut off from electricity, water and finance from the central bank, following motions through this parliamentary body. Ukraine’s nuclear power plants served three purposes therefore in the invasion plan: to function as reliable shelters for Russia’s troops and military personnel, equipment, command posts and ammunition depots; to gain control over Ukraine’s energy system, because nuclear power plants are responsible for generating more than 60% of Ukraine’s electricity; and to provide the option to obtain leverage for blackmailing European countries with the risk of radiation pollution as a result of possible accidents at nuclear power plants if they attempted to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the seizure of nuclear power plants and scientific facilities engaged in nuclear energy research in Kharkiv and Kyiv was an important element of Russia’s planned war propaganda. While justifying military aggression against Ukraine, Russian propaganda actively spread disinformation among its own population about the alleged threat Ukraine posed to Russia. Along with the narrative about the alleged presence of ‘American Pentagon biolaboratories’ in Ukraine, which were developing biological weapons, Russian propagandists and officials actively spread information about the alleged intention of Ukraine to restore nuclear weapons, which it gave up in 1994 in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the US and the UK as part of the Budapest Memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the Russian invasion were not only ‘denazification’, the destruction of national sovereignty and the banning of Ukrainian identity and ‘demilitarisation’, the destruction and banning of the UAF and the export to Russia of enterprises of the defence industrial complex of Ukraine, but also ‘denuclearisation’, the capture of nuclear power plants and their transfer to the direct management of Rosatom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces massed on the Ukrainian border in autumn 2021 received orders to the effect that they would be away from their barracks for nine months. These orders, issued approximately three to four months before the invasion, demonstrate that the Russian government anticipated having Ukraine under complete control by summer 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian plans for the invasion of Ukraine were detailed and offered solutions to most of the practical problems that Russia would face in occupying Ukraine. If competently executed, these plans could have succeeded. As shall be seen later in this report, they came much closer to doing so than is widely appreciated. Although the assumption that there would be minimal resistance was incorrect, the occupation of southern Ukraine demonstrates that speed did offer a realistic path to asserting control over territory, even without popular support. Furthermore, despite the resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, Russia had the combat power at the beginning of the war to overcome many Ukrainian formations. Beyond the shortcomings in the execution of the plan and the poor performance of Russian combat units, there are fundamental aspects of the plan that must be understood to appreciate the peculiarities of Russia’s operations in Ukraine in the first phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plans were drawn up by a very small group of officials and the intent was directed by Putin. Many officials executing elements of the preparation were unaware of the wider intent. Russian military personnel – even up to deputy heads of branches within the Russian General Staff – were unaware of the intention to invade and occupy Ukraine until days before the invasion, and tactical military units did not receive orders until hours before they entered Ukraine. While this helped to achieve operational surprise – which was no doubt the intent – the tiny pool of personnel involved contributed to a range of false assumptions that appear never to have been challenged. That the Russians overstretched in terms of the number of axes embarked upon, the small size of the force employed for many tasks, and the failure to develop appropriate contingencies is indicative of many contributing technical judgements to the planning not having been fully briefed about the overall context. No independent red teaming appears to have taken place. Instead, the plan itself – while theoretically plausible – compounded optimism bias in each of its stages and, most tellingly, offered no reversionary courses of action, indicated no decision points to determine whether conventional forces should adjust their posture nor envisaged any outcome other than its own success. Neither did the plan account for the needs of those tasked with implementing it, nor afford any agency to Ukraine. The FSB’s inaccurate assessment of the reaction of Ukrainian society is much less consequential in how the plan actually unfolded than the fact that there is no evidence in the Russian planning that anyone had asked what would occur if any of its key assumptions were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ukraines-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;II. Ukraine’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To properly understand what transpired in the opening phases of the conflict, the preparations made by the UAF since 2014 need to be appreciated. Many claims about the impact of Western military-technical assistance – for example – are problematic because they do not contextualise these systems alongside the existing capabilities of the UAF. Appreciating the scale of the conventional fight is important if the right lessons are to be drawn from the fighting. Once the structure and capabilities of the UAF are understood, the posture and dispositions of the force in February 2022 can be discussed in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-brigades-special-forces-and-territorial-defence&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre Brigades, Special Forces and Territorial Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and condition of Ukraine’s infantry and manoeuvre forces is worth considering, less in terms of their technical capabilities than in terms of their mindset, cohesion and C2. To begin, the Ukrainian Ground Forces had been in constant combat since 2014. Such combat may have been low intensity, but with more than 90 Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russian forces in 2021, it nevertheless required soldiers to take their tasks seriously and to prepare for escalation. For officers who rotated through the Joint Forces Operations (JFO) area, they had months to walk the ground, prepare positions and build an intimate understanding of the battlefield. The conversation throughout the UAF was what they would do in the event of a Russian escalation. Putting aside operational-level planning, even down to the level of platoon, the experience of junior officers and soldiers was to observe – for months – Russian positions that posed a threat to them and their comrades. These units had made extensive plans among themselves as to how they would defeat these positions in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at the operational level, it was understood throughout the UAF that Russia may renew its assault on Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian military had tried to seize the country, only to pull back. Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service and other parts of the Russian government had urged a more deliberate aggression against Ukraine in 2015. The possibility, therefore, had been at the forefront of the minds of UAF officers. Wargames and exercises at formation level envisaged a defence against the full capabilities of the Russian military. Ukrainian units were confident that at the tactical level they would be better trained and better prepared than their adversaries. The persistent concern among commanders was the impact of artillery on their freedom to manoeuvre and, crucially, on their lines of supply. This problem was exacerbated by the shortage of personnel. With 10 brigades covering the entire line of contact in the JFO, a brigade frontage at the start of the war was around 20 km. This left a limited reserve and depended on a manoeuvre defence to counterattack against breaches in the line. Each brigade started the war with around 10 days of ammunition, but there was limited confidence – given the threat from artillery – that more would reach the lines if the Russians committed all their capabilities to this axis. Nevertheless, having observed the treatment of Ukrainians in the occupied territories after 2014, Ukrainian forces were also highly motivated in preventing more of the country falling into Russian hands and morale among the troops was therefore high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lkmpCSq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining a sufficient force was a challenge from 2014. The main problem was pay. Although pay had been increased, it did not keep pace with inflation, nor was it competitive with pay in the private sector. Combined with the use of short-term contracts, this contributed to a high turnover of personnel. Prior to 24 February 2022, this created serious problems for the UAF. It not only meant that many units had a shortage of specialists such as communicators, but also that the Ministry of Defence was having to expend disproportionate resources to train new specialists who would rarely be retained in the force. There was a benefit to this situation, however. Ukrainian reservists and wider society contained a very large number of people who had military experience and were trained to perform specialist tasks. One of the major errors in Russian planning for the invasion was its assessment of the number of reservists Ukraine could mobilise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also several brigades and units where retention was less problematic, and these constituted highly experienced formations. Among these units were the seven brigades of the Air Assault Forces, and the Special Operations Forces consisting of two regiments and two special operations centres. In addition, there were the Special Units of Ukraine’s Special Services, including the 10th Special Unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Unit Alpha within the Security Service of Ukraine, the Special Forces of the National Guard, State Border Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service, responsible for operations deep behind enemy lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the TDF was an attempt to capitalise on the depth of Ukraine’s reserves and the will of the population to create mass and therefore resilience. Established as a unified entity in January 2022, the TDF were conceptually promising, and over time have proven a valuable means of creating new combat units that can be trained to support the armed forces. However, even pre-existing Territorial Defence units were created far too close to the invasion to be well established and effective at the beginning of the war. It is important to understand that for the Ukrainian government, Russia’s campaign against the country was continued for almost a decade and the cost of maintaining large territorial defence structures versus their immediate military utility made investment in such a structure a challenge for the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the TDF were only established in 2022, they lacked heavy weapons, or the C2 mechanisms to use them. They also had a limited command structure. While the value of the TDF has steadily increased – progressing from rear-area security to ground holding to contributing manoeuvre brigades to offensive operations – at the beginning of the conflict the lack of integrated C2 for these units made them an impediment in many cases. This is not the fault of the TDF personnel who mobilised to defend Ukraine, but simply reflects that trying to mobilise and coordinate such a large body of personnel with just over a month to establish chains of command and to distribute the necessary communications and training imposed a limit on how effectively they could be integrated into the armed forces. As of 24 February, therefore, the UAF had a limited body of experienced and professional manoeuvre brigades and had to make difficult decisions as to where to prioritise their deployment. They also had a large pool of tactically competent reserves, and a larger pool of willing civilian volunteers, but limited stocks of equipment to provision them. The critical question therefore was whether the professional body of the UAF could hold for long enough for a wider mobilisation to bolster Ukraine’s defences in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery&quot;&gt;Artillery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its manoeuvre forces, Ukraine had systematically attempted to strengthen the combat support for its forces after 2014, recognising the significant fires capabilities of the AFRF. In the eight years of fighting before 2022, artillery had accounted for around 90% of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian government carried out a systematic reduction of missile and artillery troops. Thus, by the time of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian Ground Forces fielded one missile brigade armed with 9K79-1 ‘Tochka-U’ tactical missile complexes, two artillery brigades equipped with 152-mm self-propelled and towed howitzers ‘MSTA-S’ and ‘MSTA-B’, 152-mm self-propelled and towed guns ‘Hyacinth-S’ and ‘Hyacinth-B’, and 203-mm self-propelled guns ‘Pion’. They also fielded three artillery regiments, armed with 220-mm ‘Uragan’ and 300-mm ‘Smerch’ multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). In addition, artillery units of mechanised and tank brigades used 152-mm and 122-mm artillery installations ‘Akatsiya’ and ‘Gvozdika’, as well as 122-mm MLRS ‘Grad’. The units of the Airborne Assault Troops had neither their own artillery nor tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since March 2014, Ukraine has focused on recovering its artillery capabilities. As a result, five new artillery brigades and a separate artillery regiment of the Ground Forces were created, as well as one artillery brigade and a separate artillery regiment of the Navy. The 19th Separate Missile Brigade regenerated two additional battalions with tactical missile complex ‘Tochka-U’. All new combined arms brigades in the Ground Forces, as well as all brigades of the marines, received their own brigade artillery groups. By 2019, the number of artillery battalions had doubled. As of February 2022, the Missile Forces and Artillery (RViA) of the UAF had 10 brigades and one regiment as part of the Ground Forces, as well as one brigade and one regiment as part of the Navy. The UAF had 1,176 barrel artillery systems, of which 742 were 152-mm calibre systems, 421 were 122-mm howitzers, and 13 units were 203-mm systems. The RViA also fielded 1,680 MLRS of all calibres, as well as about 40 tactical missile systems ‘Tochka-U’. In terms of the number of artillery systems, Ukraine fielded the largest artillery force in Europe after Russia. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not so significant at the beginning of the conflict: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176, and 3,547 MLRS against 1,680.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAF had ammunition to support these systems in high-intensity warfighting for just over six weeks. Ammunition had been depleted by regular explosions at Ukrainian arsenals as a result of Russian sabotage. From 2014 to 2018, there were six such explosions, which destroyed more than 210,000 tonnes of ammunition, a large part of which were 152-mm shells and rockets for MLRS. For comparison, during the five years of the war in Donbas, the UAF spent about 70,000 tons of ammunition in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of Ukrainian artillery was not limited to increasing the number of artillery systems and units. A lot of effort was also put into qualitative improvement. Since 2015, all battalions began to receive UAVs ‘Furia’, ‘Leleka’, PD-1 and others, which significantly increased their ISR capabilities. US radars AN/TPQ-36, designed to determine the coordinates of enemy artillery, were transferred to Ukraine as part of US military-technical assistance and strengthened the capabilities for conducting counter-battery fire. The use of the ‘Kropyva’ combat control system – Ukrainian intelligent mapping software – saw an 80% reduction in the deployment time for artillery units. Simultaneously, the amount of time to destroy an unplanned target was reduced by two-thirds, and the time to open counter-battery fire by 90%. Special attention was paid to personnel training. Every year, the armed forces conducted more than 35 field brigade tactical exercises and more than 200 field battalion tactical exercises for artillery. Thus, Ukrainian defence plans aimed at using manoeuvre forces to fix and canalise attackers to enable their destruction by concentrated artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armour&quot;&gt;Armour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role and significance of armour in the conflict must be underpinned by an understanding of the tactical evolution of its employment over the past eight years and the scale at which armour is fielded by the UAF. Counting the two regular and four reserve tank brigades, tank units of mechanised and mountain brigades, as well as brigades of marines and air-assault troops, the UAF fielded about 30 tank battalions at the start of the conflict. A significant part of these tank units was formed between 2014 and 2018, for which 500 tanks were delivered to the UAF. The total number of Ukrainian main battle tanks at the time of the invasion was about 900. For comparison, the Russian armed forces had 2,800 combat-ready tanks in their invasion force, and Russian proxies in Donbas fielded about 400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional tank doctrine would see its employment in the direct fire zone. However, during the years of the war in Donbas, the tankers of the UAF changed traditional approaches and developed techniques for indirect fire. For this task, high-explosive fragmentation projectiles are usually used. This requires the use of special guidance devices – an azimuth pointer and a side level. The use of modern technologies, in the form of graphic and calculation complexes, developed in Ukraine with the function of automated transmission of information to other tanks participating in the combat mission, made it possible to achieve high accuracy at distances of up to 10 km and reduced the time for calculating fire corrections to a few seconds. This technique blurs the line between tanks and artillery. The value of this technique is that it allows tanks to concentrate fire over a wide area while they can manoeuvre without the protection and screening needed by artillery pieces. Ukraine therefore planned to use armour as mobile reserves supporting its formations, capable of offering blunting fire against enemy movements and to support counterattacks if conditions permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Ukraine produces BM ‘Oplot’ and T-84U, the lack of necessary funds forced the UAF to refrain from purchasing new tanks, and they instead chose to modernise their existing fleet. It was calculated that three or even four battalions of modernised tanks could be obtained for the funds required to purchase one battalion of new tanks. The 1st Tank Brigade was armed with T-64B and T-64BM ‘Bulat’ main battle tanks, which are modernised Soviet T-64 tanks. Modernised T-64s are equipped with digital radios, new internal communication and navigation systems, sighting systems with thermal imaging cameras, modified dynamic protection and other necessary options. The T-64BM ‘Bulat’ weapon system also includes the Ukrainian-made TAKO-621 tank missile system, enabling engagement of armoured vehicles, fortifications, helicopters and other targets at a distance of up to 5,000 m using Kombat guided missiles. In addition, the UAF have modernised T-72 and modernised gas turbine T-80BVs, which, due to their higher speed and manoeuvrability, are used by airborne assault troops and marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the UAF fielded a considerable tank fleet, this does not alter the fact that Russian tanks at the beginning of the war generally had better protection and sighting systems and were able to engage targets from a greater distance. For short-range engagements, these differences in protection and sensor performance were less relevant but offered significant technical advantages to Russia in mid-range engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-tank-capabilities&quot;&gt;Anti-Tank Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavy emphasis in international commentary on anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) and especially those provided through military-technical assistance, means that it is vital to appreciate the volume of these capabilities and how they were distributed across the UAF to properly contextualise their impact on the fighting. At the beginning of February 2022, the armed forces received about 150 Javelin ATGW launchers with 1,000–1,200 missiles, 2,000 NLAW, as well as a large number of rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade launchers. Since Ukraine’s partners at that time were persuaded that, in the most optimistic scenarios, hostilities would be centred on street battles in the largest cities, the anti-tank weapons transferred were intended for close combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian anti-tank capabilities were not limited to Western-provided ATGWs, however. After 2014, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine purchased at least 650 launchers for anti-tank missile systems ‘Stugna-P’ and ‘Korsar’ and about 7,000 missiles for them, 150 tower systems for armoured vehicles with dual anti-tank missiles and 900 missiles for them, and 1,600 guided missiles ‘Cobra’ and ‘Kombat’ for tank missile systems. Thus, the anti-tank capabilities of the UAF at the beginning of February 2022 amounted to around 950 ATGW launchers (Javelin, ‘Stugna-P’, ‘Corsar’, ‘Barrier’) and about 9,100 missiles. To this should be added short-ranged systems such as NLAW, Kobra/Kombat missiles, as well as more than a thousand Fagot and Metis ATGWs and several thousand missiles for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appreciate the characteristics of some of these systems, which determined how they were employed. ‘Stugna-P’, developed and manufactured at the Ukrainian state-owned enterprise KB ‘Luch’, is a more powerful equivalent of the Russian ‘Kornet’. The range of both complexes is the same – about 5,100 m – but the armour penetration of ‘Stugna-P’ is better. In addition, among the advantages of ‘Stugna-P’ is a quasi-top attack, a thermal sight that can be used at night at a distance of up to 3,000 m, as well as the ability to remotely control the launcher with a cable several dozen metres long, which significantly increases the survivability of operators on the battlefield. This class of ATGW is highly valuable for defensive operations because it allows for armour to be engaged at the ranges within which Russian armour seeks to conduct ATGW launches against defensive positions. This prevents the enemy establishing a safe overwatch position to support infantry advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these ATGWs was shaped by their relative training burden. Despite its effectiveness, Stugna-P and other wire-guided systems required considerable training time for operators to use the system effectively. This restricted these systems to being used by Ukraine’s existing ground forces. After 2014, a lot of attention had been paid to the training of anti-tank crews in the armed forces, and the School of Anti-Tank Artillery was created at the 184th Training Centre of the National Academy of Ground Forces. It took 30 days to prepare crews arriving from military units to properly employ Stugna-P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javelin, by contrast, was much easier to employ, requiring days to train crews, while personnel could be trained to use NLAW in hours. Because of the wide range of additional uses of the Javelin CLU – such as ISR – these systems were prioritised for Ukrainian special forces and other specialist troops. NLAW, by contrast, was distributed widely to ground-holding units. Although Western training on these systems was excellent, the rapid delivery of training to new units often overlooked maintenance of the weapons – especially for maintaining batteries – and, as a result, there was a widespread problem early in the conflict with Western-supplied ATGWs being unusable when distributed to units. Over time, the appropriate instructions were disseminated to address this problem. The tactical employment of ATGWs by the UAF prior to the conflict was largely aimed at fixing or blunting enemy armoured manoeuvre and for use in raiding by light forces because of the speed with which units with these systems could displace. There were too few missiles, however, for these to be the primary means of attriting enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Air-Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most consequential causes of the international underestimation of Ukraine’s military prospects prior to the conflict arose from a simultaneous overestimation of Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) capabilities and a corresponding lack of familiarity with Ukrainian air-defence capabilities. It is therefore important to understand how Ukrainian air defences were organised and equipped at the beginning of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian aggression in 2014, developing the air-defence capabilities of Ukraine has been a constant priority of its government. The radio engineering troops, tasked with warning of an air attack, reorganised after 2014 to ensure they could detect targets at 300–400 km, and direct fighters and anti-aircraft missile troops against them. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the radio engineering forces of Ukraine consisted of four brigades, whose units maintained continuous radar coverage along the state border and ensured monitoring of the airspace of Ukraine. Their coverage over the Black Sea was less extensive. These units fielded 35D6M and 80K6 radars from KP ‘NVC’ ‘Iskra’, P-18 ‘Malakhit’ from HC ‘Ukrspetstechnika’, ‘Burshtyn-1800’ from NPP ‘Aerotechnika-MLT’, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernised 3D radar station 35D6M, which is also used as a surveillance radar for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile complex, is much more powerful than the outdated Soviet 19Zh6. The 35D6M radar can detect up to 300 air targets simultaneously at 360 km, while the 19Zh6 detects only 32 targets at 150 km. In addition, the Ukrainian radar has a higher accuracy in determining the coordinates, improved trajectory processing parameters and a new cooling system that significantly increases the service life of the klystrons. 35D6M also requires significantly less time to fully deploy or collapse the station, which increases its survivability. These developments had not been fully appreciated by the VKS prior to the invasion, leading to tactical errors in the employment of radio-electronic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance in the UAF of the 80K6 ‘Phoenix’ radar, as well as previous versions of this system, including the 79K6 ‘Pelikan’, allowed the remote operation of the S-300PT(PS) anti-aircraft missile systems. This radar can be deployed in 15 minutes after going static, allowing for tactical redeployment. After 2014, the armed forces also received about 50 mobile ‘Malachite’ radars, which is a Ukrainian modification of the Soviet P-18MU ‘Terek’ radar. ‘Malakhit’ can detect targets moving at a speed of up to 1,000 m/s and tracking up to 256 targets at a distance of up to 400 km. In addition, this system can detect small and inconspicuous targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the war in Donbas was mostly land based, many military-political centres and industrial and energy facilities demanded air defence, which could not be limited only to detecting threats. Five nuclear plants, six dams of the Dnipro Cascade Hydroelectric Power Plant and two dams of the Dniester Cascade, and more than 10 enterprises and facilities of the chemical industry required constant cover by the anti-aircraft missile forces of the UAF, limiting protection for its manoeuvre forces. Since 2015, Ukraine has focused on restoring and increasing its combat capabilities. As of 2016, the anti-aircraft missile forces consisted of five anti-aircraft missile brigades and seven anti-aircraft missile regiments comprising 60 air-defence divisions. A Ukrainian air-defence division holds the equipment of a Western battery along with organic C2 and sustainment capabilities, thereby performing a battlefield task closer to that of a battalion. Overall, the UAF held 35 S-300PS/PT divisions, nine S-125 divisions, three S-300B divisions and 15 divisions of the Buk-M1 air-defence system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical component of the air-defence capabilities of the UAF was the extensive employment of man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) across all units. The saturation of MANPADS in Ukrainian units, bolstered by those that were received as military-technical assistance before the Russian invasion, became an important element of countering Russian dominance in the air. MANPADS were complementary to the air-defence missile complexes because the latter forced enemy aviation to engage at low altitudes, where in turn they fell into the zone of impact of MANPADS. After 2014, Ukraine paid considerable attention to extending the lifespan and modernisation of its own MANPADS. The most common MANPADS in the UAF were the modernised ‘Igla-1’, which were distributed as organic elements to its units. Some were held in the Anti-Aircraft Missile Forces as mobile groups intended to provide protection for air-defence divisions as they displaced. A major problem with this distribution was the lack of access to the common air picture among those MANPADS teams not subordinated to the anti-aircraft missile forces at the beginning of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft&quot;&gt;Aircraft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fighter aircraft were also an important component of the national air-defence system. As of 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force had about 50 MiG-29 fighters in service with the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Vasylkiv and the 114th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Ivano-Frankivsk, as well as about 32 Su-27 fighters operated by the 831st tactical aviation brigade in Myrhorod and the 39th in Ozerny. The air force also flew Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft. After 2014, significant efforts were put into repairing fighters and a large proportion of the fleet was modernised. Although this left the air force with a higher proportion of available fighters, from a technical point of view it was overmatched by the combat aircraft of the VKS in almost every regard. Russian aircraft could generally see and shoot further while their countermeasures were effective against Ukrainian air-to-air munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the technical overmatch of the VKS, the training conducted by the air force prior to 24 February played a role in ensuring its survivability. An important element of the training was working out the survivability of units through the ability to disperse aircraft from the main airfields to operational ones. Special attention was also paid to the training of maintenance crews, their ability to carry out pre-flight preparation of aircraft in field conditions, and a full set of measures necessary for the performance of maintenance and routine repair of aircraft damaged during hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Ukrainian pilots understood the technical limitations of their aircraft, and the fearsome capabilities of Russian anti-aircraft systems, they had trained extensively for low-level flight over Ukrainian territory and were highly familiar with the exploitation of terrain to evade radar detection. Finally, as with other technical specialisms in the air force, Ukraine had struggled to retain pilots prior to 24 February, but consequently had a very large reserve of trained pilots. The critical limitation for the air force was airframes and their serviceability, not trained crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Maritime Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Navy was the least well equipped of the branches of service at the beginning of the war. Nevertheless, noting the economic impact of Russia’s control of the Sea of Azov, the navy had pursued modernisation since 2014 and had made important progress in expanding its capabilities. The first phase of naval modernisation was intended to be completed by 2025 and provided for the establishment of control over the territorial waters of Ukraine, maintaining coverage out to 40 nautical miles from the coast. For this purpose, the navy had to acquire the capabilities necessary for timely detection, identification and defeat of the enemy in this zone. The first step was to restore and modernise the system of ISR of the surface situation, including through the integration of capabilities available in other government agencies. In this context, it is particularly important to note the purchase of the multifunctional radar complex ‘Mineral-U’, created by the Ukrainian State Scientific Research Institute of Radar Systems Quantum-Radiolocation. ‘Mineral-U’ is designed for detection in active and passive modes and classification of surface targets at up to 500–600 km. It is mounted on a truck platform, is highly mobile and adapted for close interaction with the anti-ship missile complex ‘Neptune’, which became widely known after the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva on 13 April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Ukrainian design bureau ‘Luch’, the coastal mobile missile complex RK-360 ‘Neptune’ was an important component of the navy’s modernisation, along with the development of coastal artillery, the provision of mine-blocking actions and the conduct of radio-electronic warfare. With a range of up to 280 km, manoeuvrability and sea-skimming capabilities, the Neptune can be considered a critical element of the overall Ukrainian maritime defence strategy. The first battalion of Neptune complexes was to be received in April 2022. The Russian aggression forced the accelerated transfer of systems but did not allow the full use of the capabilities of the complex in the first weeks of the invasion, as the crew still needed some time for final preparation. A serious challenge for the navy was also the lack of a sufficient number of missiles for the complexes. However, Ukraine’s receipt of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems as part of Western military-technical assistance, which are very similar to the Neptune, solved this problem and provided confidence in the ability of the navy to deter Russia in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessments-and-dispositions&quot;&gt;Assessments and Dispositions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having given an overview of the capabilities of the UAF in some critical areas prior to the invasion, it becomes possible to properly outline the resources available and thus prioritisation decisions that underpinned their dispositions prior to 24 February. The General Staff of the UAF had conducted extensive exercises and wargames to assess how to orchestrate the defence of the country against a wide range of contingencies. Despite having identified methods for defending all relevant axes, however, the limited number of available units without full mobilisation meant that the weighting of units had to be driven by an assessment of enemy intent. It is also important to emphasise that the economic impact of full mobilisation made this very difficult for the Ukrainian government in the face of a sustained threat that could delay major attacks for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until days before the full-scale Russian invasion, the intelligence community of Ukraine broadly assessed that the most dangerous enemy course of action was a high-intensity offensive against Donbas in late February 2022, with the Russians using the destruction of the Ukrainian forces in the JFO area as a means of destabilising the Ukrainian state. The most likely enemy course of action was assessed to be a prolonged period of political destabilisation to create favourable conditions for a military offensive in the early summer, with the main effort being against Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors contributed to the assessment that Donbas would be the main effort, despite extensive warnings from Ukraine’s international partners that Kyiv would be the enemy’s main effort. First, an assessment of Russian forces north of Kyiv concluded that they lacked sufficient troops to effectively isolate and seize the city. The offensive was therefore viewed as a diversionary deployment, aimed at drawing and fixing Ukrainian forces away from Donbas. As the terrain north of Kyiv was highly unfavourable for a major attack, it was assessed that Russia’s attempt to draw Ukraine to concentrate on this axis would make Kyiv disproportionately vulnerable from the east. Second, interception of communications and observation of the Russian units on the Gomel axis confirmed that the personnel did not believe they were going to war and were not prepared for major combat operations. The disconnect between strategic-level discussion that emphasised the threat to Kyiv – shared with Ukraine by Western partners – with this tactical picture, supported the belief that there was a strategic influence campaign that did not reflect the tactical preparations being made by Russian units. In this sense, it is worth emphasising that the Russian deception plan was largely successful through the information security measures taken, but that the impact on the combat effectiveness of Russian troops through a failure to brief them with sufficient time to prepare came at considerable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence of Kyiv was seen as a necessary contingency for the UAF to plan against and, as the conflict came closer, the threat to this axis was perceived to have increased. Nevertheless, since Donbas was anticipated to be the main axis, over 10 combat brigades, constituting around half of the manoeuvre forces of the UAF, were kept in the JFO area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Donbas, Ukraine held forces around Kharkiv, Dnipro, Sumy and Odesa, a manoeuvre brigade and two artillery brigades in Kyiv, and units in training areas. There were no major formations committed forwards on the Gomel axis. Nor were there any major units committed to defend the approach from Crimea, even though this was specified in the national defence plan. The reasons for this are currently subject to an investigation. TDF were nascent, only had light weapons and were not yet fully integrated into the military command. Ukraine’s defence plans therefore aimed at a high-intensity defence in the direction of Donbas lasting six weeks, giving time for full-scale mobilisation of the reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major threat, identified before the conflict, relevant to the defence of Kyiv or Donbas, was Russia’s long-range strike arsenal. As a result, beginning one week prior to the invasion and accelerated 72 hours before, munitions stockpiles were dispersed from the main arsenals. Aircraft and air-defence systems were also dispersed hours before the invasion. As it became apparent that the Gomel axis was the enemy’s main effort and that another group of forces would strike through Chernihiv, a redeployment of Ukrainian forces was ordered approximately seven hours prior to the invasion. This took considerable time. The result was that many Ukrainian units were not at their assigned defensive positions when the invasion began and, especially on the northern axes, were not in prepared positions. Redeployments from the southern axis towards Kyiv also left fewer troops to hold the coast. Ukrainian units found themselves in a meeting engagement with the enemy. The critical point here is that the war started with the AFRF holding the initiative at the operational level but with their tactical units surprised by what they were being ordered to do. The UAF found themselves surprised at the operational level but with tactical units which had been psychologically and practically preparing for this fight for eight years. The interaction between these variables would be decisive in determining the outcome of the first 72 hours of fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-invasion&quot;&gt;III. The Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assessed the plans and dispositions of the opposing forces, this chapter outlines what occurred during the initial phases of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shock-and-mutual-surprise-d03&quot;&gt;Shock and Mutual Surprise: D+0–3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion began with a massive fire-strike campaign across Ukraine. The strikes were preceded by the widespread application of electronic attack to disrupt and damage defensive radar and air-defence installations, along with the extensive use of aerial decoys to saturate the defences. This was followed by the employment of cruise and ballistic missiles launched from sea-, air-, and ground-based launch systems. In addition, Russian aircraft penetrated Ukrainian airspace to strike tactical targets. The Russian High Value Target list quite logically included industrial facilities, fuel and energy storage facilities, air-defence sites, C2 infrastructure, ammunition storage points and troop assembly areas, as consistent with Russian doctrine. It was noted that during the first two weeks, Ukrainian transport infrastructure was not targeted, except when it was required by a tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some peculiarities to the order and effectiveness of this initial Russian fires campaign. For example, while the Russians had accurately mapped a large number of military sites, there were very few engagements against tactical groupings of forces, with the preponderance of strikes being at maximum depth and then working backwards towards Ukraine’s tactical echelons. As the tactical elements were the most mobile, however, this sequencing maximised the time available for tactical elements to displace. Furthermore, the Russian lists appeared to be linear and unresponsive to updated information. Many strikes were struck that had not been military positions for years. Moreover, against moving targets, new detections would apparently be added to the target list, without removing the previous reported location, so that dynamic strikes were often delivered too late. Furthermore, the number of munitions assigned to each target appeared to bear little correlation to the size of the target, suggesting limited familiarity with the effects of these classes of munitions among Russian planners. The result was that within the first 48 hours, approximately 75% of stationary Ukrainian Air Defence sites were engaged. At the same time, the estimated percentage for mobile air-defence sites was only about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the Russian strikes was greater than the number of platforms destroyed, however. Given the orders to redeploy Ukrainian forces, the damage and disruption to C2, the unexpected concentration on the Gomel axis, and the forced displacement of systems, many Ukrainian systems were alive, but uncoordinated for the initial 24 hours. A significant proportion of the air-defence infrastructure survived but was not in a position to conduct a coordinated defence. Instead, it largely delivered pop-up attacks against Russian forces. This suppression effect meant that for the first phase of the war, the success rate of interceptions of Russian cruise missiles, for example, was around 12–18%. Given that this rose to 40–60% in the second phase of the conflict, the effect of both the scale of the Russian strikes and the impact of dislocation on the effectiveness of the defence can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian successes were disproportionately weighted to certain axes. The majority of available air-defence coverage for the southern coast around Kherson and Mykolaiv, for example, was destroyed or suppressed. Two air-defence sites responsible for screening the Dnipro River from the north were also destroyed, opening a gap in the defences which enabled the conduct of an air assault against Hostomel from Belarus. In addition to the dislocation caused by missile strikes, Russian aircraft flew sorties to strike specified targets along the axes of advance for their respective groups of forces. This further dislocated the positions of the air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important element of the Russian plan to disorganise Ukraine’s military C2 system was also to neutralise the top military leadership of the UAF. Thus, in the first days of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian generals received personal messages from Russian military leaders urging them to surrender and assuring them that Russia did not intend to do any harm to Ukraine. Messages of similar content, but sent from anonymous numbers, were received by almost all colonels and other senior officers of the UAF. The strategic importance of this campaign is evidenced by the fact that on the second day of the invasion, Putin publicly appealed to the Ukrainian military to not resist the Russian invasion. This failed campaign also highlights the poor assessment of the psychology of the Ukrainian military by the Russian special services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical weakness of the Russian strike campaign was battle damage assessment. First, the Russian military appears to have presumed that if an action had been ordered and carried out then it had succeeded, unless there was direct evidence to the contrary. Evidence of success appears to have disproportionately relied on three data points: confirmation from pilots that they hit their target; confirmation from Russian satellites that a site showed damage; and confirmation from signals intelligence (SIGINT) that Ukrainians reported a strike and damage to their equipment. Russian satellite reconnaissance proved very limited, even though Russian survey space reconnaissance of Ukraine has been conducted since at least 2012, and detailed reconnaissance, in the interests of invasion planning, since mid-2021. A probable reason for this may be the insufficient number of satellites in the orbital grouping of the VKS and the overestimation of their technical capabilities. Indirect confirmation of this explanation is provided by the fact that the AFRF began buying additional satellite images of the territory of Ukraine and individual military facilities on the world market in April 2022. One of the visible failures of satellite intelligence is the inability to detect on time a significant volume of strategic railway movements by the UAF, which, in March 2022 amounted to three–four echelons per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor Russian battle damage assessment process made the Russian military highly vulnerable to deception, which has been consistent throughout the conflict. Early strikes on Ukrainian airfields, for example, destroyed many hangars. By photographing this damage and printing the resulting pattern on to sheets, it became possible to clear the rubble and erect covers for aircraft to return to the site, sheltering in positions that the Russians would confirm as destroyed. This led – somewhat amusingly – to the Russians debating whether Ukrainian fighter aircraft were operating from subterranean shelters at several sites. Repeated strikes on dummy air-defence positions also saw a considerable wastage of ammunition, while Ukrainian troops could confirm that sites were destroyed over the radio even when they were still functioning, causing Russian aircraft to ignore air-defence systems in their mission planning. The already-publicly reported use of dummy HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket system) later in the war to lure Russian fires is indicative of the systematic use of deception to ensure survivability by the UAF, and it has proven widely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presumption of success caused the Russian military to take several unjustifiable risks in the disposition of its forces during the first 72 hours of the conflict. Aircraft did not fly with EW pods during the opening phase as they were not deemed necessary following the presumed success of the strike campaign. Similarly, Russian manoeuvre forces were not properly supported by air-defence units and Russian air-defence units were told to presume that aircraft were friendly. This enabled a significant number of ground-attack sorties by the Ukrainian Air Force, including using UAVs such as TB2, against Russian formations, even when they had attached air-defence units. Ukraine suffered aircraft losses in air-to-air engagements, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penetration of Ukrainian territory by Russian air-assault units on the first day of the invasion deserves special consideration given its significance in the overall plan. Air-assault troops were landed at Hostomel in two waves, each comprising 10 helicopters. These followed the course of the Dnipro River from Belarus to remain below air-defence coverage and successfully reached their objective. In the first wave, two helicopters were shot down at Hostomel by MANPADS. This incident highlights the vulnerability of helicopters to MANPADS as, even under optimal conditions, there is little ability to prevent losses. The assault on Hostomel also highlights why air assault against positions – rather than axes – is extremely dangerous. Upon landing, the Russian VDV came under heavy artillery fire and were subsequently cleared from the airfield by a mechanised counterattack. Similar operations attempted in southern Ukraine and attempts to insert special forces in western Ukraine were unsuccessful for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of Russian Ground Forces during the first three days of the war – which differed considerably from pre-war expectations, from their orders and from doctrine – require some explanation. For reasons of operational security, orders were not distributed until 24 hours before the invasion to most units. As a result, Russian troops lacked ammunition, fuel, food, maps, properly established communications and, most critically, a clear understanding at the tactical level of how their actions fitted into the overall plan. It is not so much the case that tactical Russian commanders are incapable of initiative or mission command, but rather that they lacked the detailed instructions of their commanders’ intent or their role within the wider battle plan to make such decisions. Instead, by the time instructions reached battalion tactical groups (BTGs), what had begun as detailed operational planning descended into orders to reach specific locations within a specified timeframe. Confirming the notion that the conventional military component of the invasion was intended as a supporting demonstration of power rather than the main effort, Russian units were ordered to proceed in administrative column, and to bypass UAF units. Many Russian soldiers arrived in towns without their weapons loaded. They were – for the most part – not anticipating heavy fighting. Furthermore, old maps and a lack of time to coordinate the activity of tactical units led many units to move along the same roads, rapidly becoming intermingled, choking up key junctions and slowing down the rate of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed and conception of the Russian advance posed grave dangers for the UAF. Russian Ground Forces made rapid progress towards Kyiv from Gomel where there were in any case very few Ukrainian troops. The axis past Chernihiv also posed major challenges as Ukrainian forces were caught between their positions, while the orders to bypass resistance left many Ukrainian units cut off, behind Russian lines. The UAF made three decisions at this stage that proved important. First, a large portion of Ukraine’s special forces and the special units of Ukraine’s Special Services were committed on the Gomel axis. Second, Ukraine mobilised reserve units, which rapidly created new battalions near Kyiv. Third, the UAF mobilised its cadets and the teaching staff of its military academies to force-generate additional infantry battalions. In this way a new group of forces was formed within the opening week of the conflict, supported by the two brigades of artillery held in Kyiv and one mechanised brigade. Even with these efforts, the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage on the Gomel axis. Similarly, around Chernihiv, the 1st Tank Brigade found itself encircled and lacking infantry support, necessarily drawing on territorial defence units and reservists to adopt a position of all-round defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Donbas, the Russian operations to fix the bulk of the UAF proved almost entirely successful. Although the AFRF made little progress against the defensive positions along the line of contact, it proved impossible for Ukrainian troops to be redeployed from this theatre. To the south, the Russian breakout from Crimea proceeded in a manner consistent with the Russian invasion plan, with Melitopol and Kherson seized with minimal fighting and significant progress made in achieving the encirclement of Mariupol to bring the city under a state of siege. Russian progress towards Kharkiv proved entirely contrary to their plan and their forces were repulsed with heavy casualties. Initially Russian special forces entered the city in light vehicles, only to be isolated. When offered an opportunity to surrender, these personnel claimed that the Ukrainian defenders would soon be the ones surrendering once larger combat units arrived. The disparity in preparedness between these special forces’ groups and their conventional supporting units, however, hindered their coordination and the advanced parties were subsequently destroyed, while Russian forces transitioned to a deliberate break-in against the city, supported by widespread artillery strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, it is important to recognise that the Russians achieved surprise and succeeded in bringing about highly favourable force ratios on their main axes. On the second day of the conflict, there was considerable anxiety in the UAF as to the ability to halt the advance from Gomel. In understanding why the Russians stalled, despite having the means and forces to push through the small Ukrainian units in front of them, it is necessary to consider the psychological state of the Russian troops. These troops were largely moving in administrative formations. They lacked a clear understanding of where they were. Whole towns did not exist when the maps they were using were made. They had not anticipated heavy fighting, nor did they have established communications to report the situation or to receive updated instructions. Ukrainian forces found themselves bypassed and often confronted with columns of unprepared Russian troops. Even without higher instructions, the immediate task was clear to these units, and, at the tactical level, Ukrainian forces therefore retained the tactical initiative. For the 1st Tank Brigade, for example, the first days of fighting saw numerous meeting engagements in forests at around 100–200-m range, where restricted movement limited the Russian ability to bring their mass to bear against a specific tactical situation. Better crew training combined with short-ranged engagements where their armament was competitive, and the faster autoloader on the T-64, allowed Ukrainian tank crews to achieve significant damage against surprised Russian units. Another example of the problem was that Russian units would arrive in towns and begin to try to engage with the civilian population to understand where they were. Their position would be reported and the Russian unit would be engaged with artillery. This contrast between expectations and reality induced panic and caused the abandonment of equipment that was widely observed on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-battle-for-kyiv-d437&quot;&gt;The Battle for Kyiv: D+4–37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+3, it was apparent to Russian commanders that their plan had gone seriously wrong. It was evident that Ukraine’s air defences were still operational, that the Russian Ground Forces had stalled, and that there was fierce resistance. Moreover, it was apparent that the activities of the special services in Kyiv aimed at neutralising Ukraine’s political leadership – critical to Russia’s theory of victory – were failing as the Security Service of Ukraine identified, isolated and destroyed their infiltrated groups. In fact, as Ukraine mobilised, repositioned its forces, and as its air defences recovered from their initial displacement and surprise, the defence was hardening. There was therefore a need to transition from attempting the coup de main to deliberate combat operations to defeat the UAF. This transition in the Russian posture began on D+3 with a progressive improvement in the enemy’s cohesion over the following month. However, it took considerable time for Russian commanders to understand what was happening, to assert control over their units, or to adapt their tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest component of the Russian force to adapt was the VKS. From D+3, Russian aircraft began to change their tactics. Rather than flying single sorties to strike pre-designated targets, large strike packages of interceptors and aircraft armed with anti-radiation missiles would form up in an attempt to provoke Ukrainian air defences into illuminating. These would then be suppressed with anti-radiation missiles and hunted by Russian aircraft or helicopters at low level. The latter suffered heavy attrition to MANPADS employing these tactics and the depth of aviation operations gradually diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian transition to low-level hunting tactics coincided with the steady activation of air-defence complexes to protect Russian armed forces’ manoeuvre formations. At this time, Ukrainian air defences deconflicted from the Ukrainian Air Force’s interdiction missions by time, so that MiG-29s would conduct defensive counter-air sorties in pairs as the air defences displaced. This proved problematic because it was difficult to distribute awareness of these phases to deployed infantry with MANPADS. Both Russian and Ukrainian aircraft were threatened by friendly fire at this time. As a result, the deconfliction of air interdiction from Ukraine’s air defences was changed to a spatial approach, with areas in depth assigned to defensive counter-air patrols and areas to the rear assigned to air-defence forces. For a time, Ukrainian pilots were able to engage their Russian adversaries in air-to-air engagements, although they often found themselves outnumbered 6:2. Nevertheless, Ukrainian aircraft did inflict some losses in these engagements, despite losing several aircraft, reflecting the comparatively low training of most Russian pilots. In the first weeks of the invasion, when Russian forces neglected the need to provide air cover, long Russian convoys were also subjected to air strikes by both Air Force and Army aircraft, including Su-24M/MR bombers, Su-25 attack aircraft, Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters, and Bayraktar TB2 UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+10, defensive counter-air missions became harder to mount. Russian A50-M orbits ensured that the VKS had ample early warning of Ukrainian air movements. As Russian EW complexes began to be deployed systematically, Ukrainian pilots found that they often had their air-to-ground and air-to-air communications jammed, their navigation equipment suppressed, and their radar knocked out. The use of jamming pods on Russian aircraft also increased. Combined with an intensifying threat from air-defence systems, the Ukrainian Air Force progressively lost access to parts of the occupied territories. Close air support and the use of strike UAS also became impossible over much of the battle space owing to dense EW and air-defence coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapid improvement in the performance and organisation of the VKS is noteworthy because these units were flying from inside Russia’s operational depth and did not therefore suffer from the confusion that was engulfing Russia’s Ground Forces in Ukraine, slowing their adaptation to the circumstances on the ground. Another good indication that the intent of Russian commanders shifted fairly rapidly is the decision by the Russian command not to commit its maritime assault forces, which had been intended to conduct landings between Mykolaiv and Odesa. To conduct the amphibious landing, two amphibious detachments of three large amphibious ships were formed. For the landing in the first wave, units of the 810th Marines Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 336th Marines Brigade of the Baltic Fleet were initially planned. With small breaks, the amphibious forces manoeuvred in the Black Sea until the beginning of April 2022. After the initial reconnaissance landing by Russian special forces in the first days of the invasion with flat-bottomed raiding craft destroyed and heavy casualties, the Russian command determined to refrain from launching this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those Russian ground units already in Ukraine, adaptation was slower. It is worth exploring why. The standard Russian approach to the formation of BTGs provided for the allocation of one or two BTGs from the composition of the full-time brigade or regiment. In forming, or more precisely, collecting, even one BTG from the brigade for a short-term military operation, the command tried to appoint the best personnel to its composition and distribute the best weapons and equipment for its mission. By itself, the BTG, in the understanding of the Russian command, was more like a ‘reinforced battalion’. The main difference with such a reinforced battalion compared with a permanent combined arms formation is that approximately half of its personnel, and the unit commanders, largely saw each other up close for the first time in their lives on the amalgamation of the BTG. One can only assume how much the relevant commanders were informed about the level of training, experience and equipment of such a unit. At best, they had to rely on the reports of the commanders of regular units about the readiness of their distributed forces and their capacity to perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to BTGs being units that had not trained together and lacking staff who knew one another, they were also non-uniform in their composition. These deviations did not appear to derive from the tasks they were assigned but instead arose from the equipment available from the units that generated them. Yet, to commanders at higher echelons, the Russian battle management appeared to treat all BTGs as comparable units of action with no tailoring of tasks to their respective capabilities. When military advances are used as a mere demonstration of force this would not have been critical. But once the force tried to transition to fighting, units were now assigned tasks for which they were poorly equipped. As an example, consider the composition of two BTGs, which operated in almost the same area in the east of Ukraine at the end of April 2022. One of them was from the 228th Motor Rifle Regiment of the 90th Armoured Division of the Central Military District (Svatove district): 23 APCs; six tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’; up to 40 vehicles; and about 400 personnel. Another was from the composition of the 57th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District (Rubizhne district): more than 30 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs); 14 tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a 152-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’ battery; up to 60 vehicles; and about 800 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o4dm8Cx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusion as to the location and composition of units combined with significant deviation from their pre-assigned tasks led to paralysis in command decisions and no new statement of intent being provided to tactical commanders to rationalise their own decisions. A combination of a lack of time to exchange encryption keys on radios, the effects of Ukrainian EW, poor training on communications equipment and the reversion to stealing cellular communications from local citizens allowed Ukrainian forces to monitor a significant quantity of Russian tactical communications. For the period of March, most of the radio exchanges of Russian troops at the brigade-BTG level consisted of information about the locations of units and individual elements, and only 10–20% related to combat management. Later, Friendly Force Information Requirements only partially considered the monitoring of the needs of class III and V supply which, in turn, created problems with ready supply and imposed loads on the control networks. This not only saw significant supply problems but also the nature of the traffic enabled Ukrainian forces to accurately target Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of understanding of Russian commanders as to the location or condition of their units and the lack of situational awareness of their tactical commanders near Kyiv and Kherson in March–April 2022 invariably led to the movement of newly arrived units along the same routes, repeated attempts to conduct already-exposed manoeuvres, the use of the same locations for temporary staging, and the overreliance on a small number of main supply routes. Even in the maritime theatre, this sticking to proven routes enabled a strike in early March using BM-21 Grad by the Ukrainian Marines on a Russian patrol boat at sea. Conversely, communication with 1st Tank Brigade was maintained along a small supply road running northwards on the left bank of the Dnipro that the Russians failed to sever, despite having an overwhelming force presence. This speaks to the poor situational awareness and lack of active patrolling by Russian units. The breakdown of communications also prevented units bringing up equipment to resolve a range of unforeseen tactical dilemmas. From an operational point of view, Russian intelligence obviously did not foresee the use of hydrotechnical structures for the improvement of existing natural barriers. An example of this is the slow response by Russian troops to the use of hydraulic structures on the Irpin River, which made it possible to raise the water level by 0.5–0.7 m and turn the small river into a significant obstacle for the Russian troops who were rushing to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This general confusion among Russia’s Ground Forces gradually eased towards the end of March as senior officers came forward to establish situational awareness. In the meantime, however, on the axes approaching Kyiv, Ukrainian forces had effectively screened the flanks of the Russian force, which was in any case concentrated in too narrow an area for the number of troops pushed forwards. This unfavourable battlefield geometry made it impossible for the Russians to build up significant momentum, as they came under sustained and intense artillery fire throughout the month. By the time Colonel General Chaiko, commanding the Eastern Group of Forces, had re-established a clear picture of the battlespace, he faced a choice to break through Ukrainian lines and sever the roads to the west of Kyiv, or else withdraw. Initially the Russian forces attempted the former course of action. Unable to bring significant artillery or ammunition forward, however, they took massive casualties and, pressed from both flanks, were at risk of encirclement. When it became apparent that the Central Group of Forces was going to fail to invest Kyiv from the left bank, the decision was taken to withdraw from the Gomel axis and recover the troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Group of Forces, attacking via Chernihiv towards Kyiv, and via Sumy, faced a different dilemma. Having bypassed large Ukrainian combat units, while attempting to traverse over 200 km of densely wooded terrain, these forces had dissipated much of their combat power and were suffering heavily in ambushes and meeting engagements. Here the tactical initiative of Ukrainian tactical units and special forces inflicted heavy casualties. Given the use of Chernihiv as a strongpoint in all-round defence, the Central Group of Forces had the choice, once control had been re-established over its combat units, to either concentrate to reduce these positions to its rear, or else to screen these positions and continue towards the original objective, which was Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial success of the Southern Group of Forces slowed considerably as the combat power of this grouping dissipated across multiple axes. The problems that arose in some of the tactical decision-making among this group of forces can be observed from the lack of intent in orders regarding reversionary courses of action. For example, the Southern Group of Forces only encountered serious resistance on reaching Mykolaiv. As on other axes, the Russians achieved an advantageous force ratio and surprise. Available Ukrainian artillery in this sector was limited. Russian forces had also achieved air superiority. Nevertheless, adhering to the orders to bypass centres of resistance, the Russian units proceeded to try and encircle Mykolaiv to the north. In doing so, they dissipated their combat power, gave the Ukrainian Southern Command time to mobilise and organise more units, and left themselves with an exposed flank. As a result, this position became increasingly untenable, although it would take weeks of bitter fighting before Russian combat units stopped trying to push further west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southern Group of Forces had much more success in closing off Mariupol. Despite many of the Russian tactical actions in this phase of the war, originating with precise and appropriate instructions from higher command, few of these commands could be properly executed. The advance on Mariupol represents an exception, where the higher operational intention to achieve encirclement was properly carried out. Here there was a skilful implementation of preparatory measures to block the communication routes from Mariupol to Volnovaha at D+8 during the encirclement of Mariupol. This set up conditions for the subsequent siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Mariupol – where the Russians had anticipated fierce resistance and were not expecting a rapid surrender by the local authorities – demonstrates the difference that could have been made elsewhere if Russian forces were properly prepared for heavy fighting. Here the model was similar to that used against Grozny in the Second Chechen War: massive employment of fires combined with assault groups to break up defensive positions. The commitment of the 8th Combined Arms Army using BTGs with poor infantry–armour cooperation in the first phase saw significant attrition among Russian units. Nevertheless, Russian forces quickly adapted, forming storm groups of armour and infantry, and creating storm detachments of Chechen troops who proved relatively effective. There were shortcomings in the Ukrainian defence of Mariupol that have since been rectified. The main issue was the establishment of unit boundaries and the division of responsibility between naval, ground and territorial defence forces of the UAF. Russian assault units accurately identified the unit boundaries and were able to exploit these to fracture the defence into several isolated pockets. Given that Russian tactical commanders understood the intent was to seize the city, they were able to effectively implement tactical actions. The longevity of the defence of Mariupol reflects the extraordinary bravery of its defenders. Ukrainian forces not only exceeded the expectations of the Ukrainian General Staff, but also inflicted heavy losses on the Russian attackers. The battlefield geometry, however, of an encirclement deep behind Russian lines, the extensive air defences erected around the city, and the lack of friendly air defences enabled the use of heavy bombers, massive artillery and other means to steadily reduce the defence. Ukraine’s Southern Command has subsequently worked to improve the coordination between Army, TDF and naval units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing-on-donbas-d3891&quot;&gt;Refocusing on Donbas: D+38–91&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian retreat from Kyiv saw a change in the objectives and strategy of the AFRF. Instead of seeking to seize the capital, Russian forces would endeavour to implement what the UAF had assessed to be their most dangerous course of action from the outset of the conflict: the destruction of the UAF in Donbas; seizure and annexation of Luhansk and Donetsk; and, from this position, force Kyiv to negotiate on unfavourable terms. The focus of Russia’s special services would also shift, from the destabilisation of the Ukrainian government to economic and political warfare against Europe to undermine international support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before describing the nature of the fighting, it is important to take stock of the relative condition of the forces, which were repositioned over the course of April. Russian forces had suffered from massive attrition around Kyiv and had lost a vast quantity of military equipment. Throughout April there was an ongoing debate in the Russian government as to the need for mobilisation. Eventually the decision was made against mobilisation. Alongside attrition, Russian forces were suffering from low morale given their lack of success on most axes. At this point, a peculiar bifurcation occurred in the Russian forces. On the one hand, the higher command was still convinced of the need to fight with the BTG as the preferred unit of action, even if this non-uniform and non-mission-specific grouping differed considerably in capability. Thus, when the offensive against Donbas was undertaken in earnest throughout May 2022, it is estimated that Russian forces were fielding a total of 146 BTGs located around Ukraine, of which 93 were active, 13 were being restored, and 40 were in first- and second-phase reserves. This included the 136 BTGs in the original invasion force and additional units formed from reserves and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) and Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, where the Russians had achieved success, they had formed mission-specific groupings, as in Mariupol. The need for non-uniform formations was also driven by several factors concerning human and material resources. Although the Russians were beginning to recruit new contract soldiers and commit Wagner mercenaries and other units, these groupings were largely organised into company-sized units. Heavy casualties among spetsnaz and air-assault units also led to these troops being fielded in company groups more often than battalions. Moreover, although the mobilisation of conscripts in Luhansk and Donetsk had produced around 35,000 troops, heavy casualties in these formations left them highly irregular. Equipment losses also led to the consolidation of capabilities, so that fewer BTGs fielded their assigned batteries of 152-mm howitzers, with these concentrated into artillery tactical groups instead. Over time, as the Russian military came under strain, its organisational principles were diverted into task-specific organisation, usually of brigade groups with several attached independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materiel and personnel pressures were also shaping the disposition of the UAF between the assault on Kyiv and the offensive on Donbas. Ukrainian casualty figures remain classified and cannot be detailed in this report. Nevertheless, after months fighting outnumbered, the very high number of wounded – representing around 80% of casualties on the Ukrainian side, with around 40% of wounded personnel sustaining permanent injuries – left a number of key units heavily depleted. It was also noted at this time that the UAF did not have an established doctrine nor procedures for rotating units from contact. Units in Donbas, for example, had been under attack for more than a month with no reprieve, and it seemed probable that they would now face the full weight of a Russian offensive. Fatigue and concussion from artillery fire were serious issues best resolved through troop rotations. It became imperative to develop techniques to ensure the rapid circulation of troops. Despite these challenges, morale within Ukrainian units remained high, first, because of the failure of the AFRF to place Kyiv under siege, and second, because while a fight in Donbas would be difficult, it was also something that Ukrainian troops had prepared for over several years, offering confidence in their ability to blunt the Russian offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is briefly worth flagging here a political factor that shaped, and in some ways constrained, Ukrainian military preparations for the defence of Donbas at this time. The discovery of war crimes perpetrated at scale by Russian forces in occupied territories on the axes approaching Kyiv created a political climate in which the surrender of territory, and especially settlements, became politically unacceptable. Given the disparity in forces, a manoeuvre defence would have been most effective from a purely military point of view, enabling the enemy to be shaped and then cut off through counterattack to maximise its losses. However, the human cost of these tactics on the population, whom the UAF were mobilised to defend, would have been unacceptable. Showing that the Army would hold ground for as long as practicable was therefore not only a political imperative, but also important in underpinning the moral component of the fighting force. This is not to argue that political decisions inappropriately had an impact on military decision-making. Instead, it is one of the ongoing strengths of the Ukrainian state that there remains a healthy civil–military discourse and an ability to balance these critical factors. Nevertheless, this led to tactical dispositions that, from a purely military perspective, may have appeared suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest challenge at this stage in the conflict for the UAF was equipment losses and the expenditure of ammunition. Although Western support had been symbolically invaluable in the early stages of the war, the enemy was stopped principally through the employment of Ukrainian arms. Nevertheless, Ukraine had, by this point, exhausted most of its MLRS and heavier-calibre Soviet-era artillery ammunition. By the commencement of the Russian offensive against Donbas, NATO systems were becoming available. However, only small numbers had arrived, while training and support for first- and second-line maintenance was not yet available. For example, many of the M777 howitzers that were delivered became inoperable due to maintenance issues after being misused by crews. Furthermore, there was not yet a structured way for equipment to be provided. Whereas piecemeal deliveries of a wide range of systems was workable for rocket-propelled grenades and other light weapons, it was problematic for heavy weapons such as artillery. With little consolidation of support, Ukraine began to receive a wide variety of equipment types, all of which differed in their maintenance and logistical requirements. The early stages of the offensive on Donbas, therefore, saw the UAF at their most vulnerable from the point of view of equipment. The question was whether materiel support would accelerate sufficiently to meet the imminent threat. While Ukraine managed to maintain artillery parity in the first stage of the war, in the second stage, thanks to the absolute superiority in the volume of ammunition, Russia began to achieve fires dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian offensive on Donbas proceeded in accordance with the sound logic of operational encirclement through attacks to the north and south of the JFO. Although the overall operational concept was sound, it must be noted that no effort was made to disperse Ukrainian forces on to other axes or otherwise present the UAF with competing imperatives. Thus, while the UAF had a shortage of armaments at this time, they also had a very limited and identifiable area where armaments needed to be concentrated. The protracted defence of the Azovstal steel works – long after the rest of Mariupol had fallen – proved important in slowing the release of forces to simultaneously pressure Donbas from the southern axis and thereby further limited the frontages that the UAF had to cover in the first weeks of the offensive. After initial attempts at an armoured breakthrough failed, the Russian military resorted to manoeuvre by fire. The efficiency of this approach was greatly hindered by the unwillingness of their infantry to make deliberate assaults without massive artillery preparation of the targets. It was not uncommon for a company position of the UAF – occupying a frontage of approximately 3 km – to be subjected to 6,000 rounds per day of fire. At this time, the Russians not only had vastly more ammunition than the UAF but also outranged most Ukrainian artillery and the concentration of EW limited the effectiveness of precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the concentration of effort on Donbas, Russia set up EW complexes with up to 10 complexes per 20 km of frontage. Collectively, these complexes effectively disrupted navigation along the front, and conducted direction finding to direct artillery and electronic attack against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs. The use of UAVs during this period deserves special consideration. As the war became dominated by artillery duelling, the importance of rapid target acquisition increased. The narrowing of the contested front and concentration of artillery also offered fewer opportunities for human reconnaissance. Both sides used UAVs extensively throughout the conflict. These ranged from commercial and adapted quadcopters at tactical echelons to fixed-wing reconnaissance UAVs such as the Ukrainian SKIF and Russian Orlan-10. The latter two were especially valuable because they could fly at medium altitude, were too cheap to be economical targets for air defences and provided extensive imagery to enable rapid and responsive fires. Both parties also used large medium-altitude long endurance UAVs such as Ukraine’s TB2s and Russia’s Orion for target acquisition, although these platforms were scarcer, more vulnerable, and therefore only committed under favourable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of UAVs to remaining competitive, their attrition rates were extremely high. Of all UAVs used by the UAF in the first three phases of the war covered by this study, around 90% were destroyed. The average life expectancy of a quadcopter remained around three flights. The average life expectancy of a fixed-wing UAV was around six flights. Skilled crews who properly pre-programmed the flight path of their UAVs to approach targets shielded by terrain and other features could extend the life of their platforms. However, even when UAVs survived, this did not mean that they were successful in carrying out their missions. UAVs could fail to achieve their missions because the requirements to get them in place – flying without transmitting data, with captured images to be downloaded on recovery, for example – prevented timely target acquisition before the enemy displaced. Furthermore, such a method, while improving survivability, also necessitated the right locations to be preselected for image capture. Many missions failed to find targets because there was no target at the specified location. Alternatively, and more common, was mission failure owing to disruption of a UAV under control through electronic warfare, the dazzling of its sensors or the denial of its navigational systems from determining the accurate location of a target. In other instances, the Russians successfully struck the ground control stations of the UAV. In aggregate, only around a third of UAV missions can be said to have been successful. Here, the Orlan-10 should be singled out in terms of its utility because the cheap platform nevertheless had a high performance and proved difficult to counter, although its inertial navigation makes insufficient account of windage. Even the Russian military, however, found that it did not have enough of these platforms to sustain the loss rate during the battle in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defeat of precision was critical to unit survival. Defeating precision could be achieved by preventing a launcher from accurately determining its position, even with very small displacements, by preventing the enemy determining the precise location of the target or through direct interference with the mechanism for precision strike. The latter did not always require expensive methods. When Russian reconnaissance troops began to mark Ukrainian defensive positions with laser designators, for example, it was found that having laser warning indicators over strongpoints could alert personnel being targeted, who could then pop smoke grenades to disrupt the accuracy of the strike. This would also blind the defenders, making them vulnerable to assault. Thermal optics, or the targeting of the designating team from another position to relieve the suppression of the targeted post was critical. The experience of the UAF showed that precision artillery was not only disproportionately effective, but also limited the vulnerability of the force by reducing its logistical footprint. Nevertheless, in the early phases of the fighting in Donbas when the UAF had few precision systems, Russian EW reduced the effectiveness of these systems. This disproportionately affected the UAF because the Russians primarily relied on saturation fire from unguided shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian EW systems were highly effective, there were also noted weaknesses of these complexes. The Russians suffered extensively from these systems having an equally noticeable effect on its own troops. The AFRF have not yet managed to solve this problem, except in the case of some specific platforms such as the Su-34. Furthermore, there were often weaknesses in planning, partly exacerbated by the issue of fratricide. For example, when military communications were suppressed it was often possible to revert to cellular communications channels. Although the Russians have the means to target these communications, the Leer-3 payload carried by an Orlan-10 UAV is hard to synchronise with EW effects that make the use of UAVs exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, although navigational effects disrupted precision, direct jamming against precision systems was rarely effective. It is apparent that the Russians have refined, but done little to develop beyond, Soviet systems and some of their new systems such as the Repellent complex were largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, the Russians had consolidated much of their artillery into artillery tactical groups and began directing fires from higher headquarters owing to a shortage of trained fire controllers. Russian artillery would tend to operate in batteries a third of their range behind the forward line of own troops (FLOT), with a spacing of 100–150 m between their guns. Missions were usually assigned to the battery, whereas the UAF mostly assign fire missions to guns. Russian units with their own UAVs could deliver highly responsive fires, bringing effect to bear within 3–5 minutes of target detection. For targets that ran through a fire-control headquarters, the Russians continued to add new detections to the bottom of the list and prosecute strikes in order, leading to fire missions taking 20–30 minutes at the tactical level, and around 48 hours at the operational level. Russian artillery would conduct counter-battery fire, but never from the targeted battery. Instead, a targeted battery would immediately displace in the case of MLRS when under fire, or the crews would seek cover until fire lifted and then displace. Counter-battery fire would be assigned to a separate battery. The Russians rarely displaced after firing unless they received fire. This appears to have been because the volume of shells they needed to fire their missions could not be displaced or repositioned quickly, even if the guns could. Given their fires dominance, during this phase, their static approach was not overly costly until longer-range precision systems became available to the UAF, at which point the Russian fires system was severely disrupted. Owing to fire missions being coordinated at a high level, the AFRF at this time also exercised limited discipline in assigning weapons to fire missions but could instead draw on any available weapons system to complete a mission. Thus, Tochka-U were deployed for counter-battery effects. Overall, during the offensive against Donbas, Russian artillery were firing around 20,000 rounds per day, with their peak fire rate surpassing 32,000 rounds on some days. Ukrainian fires rarely exceeded 6,000 rounds a day, reflecting a shortage of both barrels and ammunition. For the offensive on Donbas, the Russians deployed over 1,100 tube artillery pieces with around 80–90 guns usually formed into a group to support the actions of brigade-sized groupings of three to four BTGs. The Russian advantage in artillery during May and June 2022 in Donbas was 12:1. Special attention should be paid to the use of Russian MLRS, including BM-21 Grad, 9K57 Uragan and 9K58 Smerch. Practically all these systems were used at their maximum range; 9K57 and 9K58, in particular, were used at 35–70 km. Despite their doctrinal role, MLRS were used not only on area targets, but also on point targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this overwhelming firepower, the Russians made slow progress. The assault tactics employed by Russian operations evolved over time. Initially there were repeated attempts to make progress using armoured thrusts. A shortage of infantry, and, in particular, of motivated and skilled infantry, led to heavy equipment losses. Thereafter, the Russians resorted to the total saturation of defended areas to compel withdrawal. This created a dilemma for the UAF because if ground was ceded, the Russians would advance, but to prevent it being ceded it was necessary to maintain troops under massive bombardment, with inevitably high casualties. The threat became more acute as the Russians developed more effective means of attack. Rather than uniform BTG manoeuvres, they began to operate in waves. LNR and DNR conscripts would be pushed forwards to skirmish and assault a position, forcing UAF positions to reveal themselves. These would be identified by Russian reconnaissance troops and subjected to precision artillery fire. There would then be a massive artillery bombardment followed by a deliberate assault by more capable troops comprising airborne, spetsnaz or Wagner companies. Notably, spetsnaz during this phase were almost exclusively employed as capable light or sometimes mechanised infantry. Once the UAF withdrew, the Russians would occupy the position with LNR and DNR conscripts and withdraw their more capable forces. This cycle would take one or two days, with the Russians aiming to go firm in the evening to have the night to harden their positions against counterattack. Of course, this process could only ever advance a couple of kilometres per day, and often less, depending on the distance between defence lines. It also incurred heavy Russian casualties, although these were disproportionately concentrated among LNR and DNR conscripts. The Russians also changed their use of armour from thrusts by platoon-sized groups of tanks supported by armoured infantry to using tanks for indirect fire or long-range engagements using barrel-launched ATGMs, copying the preferred approach of the UAF. A lack of training left Russian forces less accurate in applying these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VKS operations during this time also shifted. Although heavy bombing was carried out in Mariupol, the penetration of Ukrainian airspace had declined after the withdrawal from Kyiv, other than with long-range precision fires. The VKS however recommenced the delivery of frontline effects as the offensive in Donbas got under way. This usually saw a fourship of Russian aircraft approach the Ukrainian air-defence zone at medium altitude, applying EW effects or launching anti-radiation missiles if Ukrainian radar illuminated. At the same time, a twoship of aircraft would approach the air-defence zone at very low level and usually conduct strikes with unguided munitions, including indirect rocket attacks after lofting. This technique – also applied by the Ukrainian Air Force and Army Aviation – could be effective in saturating an area target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than close air support, the VKS’s main effort was in releasing long-range precision fires from inside Russian airspace. Strategic aviation of the VKS comprising Tu-22M3 (Backfire) and Tu-95MS (Bear) long-range bomber aircraft operated as launch platforms for Kh-22/Kh-32 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-55/Kh-555 (AS-15 Kent) from the first days of the war and proved to be effective. The first strikes with the use of air-launched missiles were noted on D+3 and continued throughout the conflict. For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, approximately 180 Kh-22/32 and Kh-55/555 launches were recorded. Beyond air-launched effects, however, there was a marked difference in the pattern of long-range precision fires from the first phase of the war to the offensive on Donbas. The main portion of strategic, and sometimes operational, fire missions until the beginning of April 2022 was performed by the short-range ballistic missile systems 9M720 and 9M723 Iskander (SS-26 Stone). For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, more than 200 missile strikes by this system were recorded. Missile strikes were conducted deep into the territory of Ukraine, up to the regions near the border with Poland. More than 160 civilian and military objects were hit. While Ukrainian Air Defences were effective at intercepting cruise missiles throughout the war, 9M720 proved exceedingly difficult to intercept, and 9M723 was almost impossible to manipulate via other means. The situation changed from D+14–16, when the number of SS-26 Stone employments significantly reduced, and at the beginning of April 2022, the Russians shifted from salvo to single strikes. The likely reason for this may be a shortage of missiles, the stocks of which were calculated for a short-term strategic operation. Russian industry has the capacity to manufacture six 9M723s per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive on Donbas, although long-range precision fires continued, the Russians increasingly relied on obsolete systems. Target types that were struck with 9M720 earlier in the conflict were instead engaged, from April 2022, with the short-range ballistic missile system 9K79 (SS-21 Scarab A). A similar transition occurred with the employment of naval fires. For example, from D+60–65 there was a transition from target types that were previously engaged with Kalibr 3M-14K (SS-N-27 Sizzler), instead being engaged with 3K60 Bal (SSC-6 Sennight) and 3K55 Bastion (SSC-5 Stooge) coastal missile systems. The consequence of this inappropriate employment of munitions was reduced accuracy and, in many cases, the tragic striking of civilian structures. The main operational impact of these strikes on Ukrainian cities was to force Ukrainian air defences to be spread over a wide geographic area, limiting protection of the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued threat from strikes originating in the Black Sea further stretched Ukrainian air and missile defences. Although the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva on 13 April 2022 caused the Russian Black Sea Fleet, other than fast attack craft, to move its operations further from the Ukrainian coast, the Russian Navy could still functionally perform two of its defined tasks. It could no longer approach the coast and threaten landings. However, Russian ships and submarines continued to deliver long-range missile strikes against southern and western Ukraine, while the transition from a close to a distant blockade did not fundamentally alter the economic isolation of Ukraine’s ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of fires delivered on the front in Donbas led progressively to the total destruction of defensive positions until they were no longer viable. This led, in mid-June, to the decision to withdraw from Severodonetsk. At this time, the Russian system of war was effectively inflicting casualties and taking ground from the UAF, but it also had several key dependencies and therefore vulnerabilities. The most prominent of these was its sustainment. The supply of fuel for the groupings of the AFRF in Ukraine was more a task of its delivery than a matter of availability. To solve this problem, a historically proven approach was mainly used: the exploitation of railways. The volume of transportation was large. For example, in just the period 1–19 April 2022, and only to the railway station of Rovenki (Luhansk region), 228 railway cisterns with fuel and lubricants (more than 13,600 tonnes) were moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the supply of ammunition, the Russian command used the classic system provided for by doctrinal documents. Its essence is in a multi-level delivery and distribution from brigade to battalion to company/battery. However, during the strategic operation against Ukraine, the function of the ‘brigade link’ had to be performed by divisional- and army-level logistics units because of the volume of materiel moved. The Russians were forced to reorganise their logistics at D+7 upon realising that the conflict would protract significantly beyond their initial planning assumption. The ammunition supply system was based on two organisational solutions. The first was that the supply of ammunition relied on a network of deployed so-called ‘field artillery depots’. Each of them turned out to be a complex of civilian industrial buildings adapted for the storage of ammunition. Such warehouses usually stored no more than two–three ammunition basic loads for an attached group of troops. One such warehouse could supply ammunition to units within a radius of 30–50 km. The second solution provided for the maximum accumulation of ammunition directly in units (company/battery-battalion/artillery battalion). This stimulated the dispersion of stocks and allowed for autonomy of actions in case of disruption of planned delivery. However, it also increased the probability of the destruction of stocks and reduced the tactical ability of artillery units to shoot-and-scoot, since they had large ammunitions stocks at their positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the requirements of Russian doctrine, which is essentially a carbon copy of the Soviet ones, the location of the main support elements and reserves of the divisional and army units is situated at a depth of up to 50 km from the line of contact. It is likely that such a requirement is justified for the conditions of dense operational order of battle with reliable cover of such elements by air defence. The practice of war in Ukraine showed something different – a decentralised operational structure and separate directions for advance. But the Russian command, for reasons not fully understood, continued to follow the doctrinal position unchanged, for more than 60 days. As a result, the specified objects regularly became targets for damage by the long-range MLRS BM-30 Smerch and Tochka-U – fired by the UAF. Only at the end of April 2022 was the concentration of a significant part of the personnel, equipment and materiel moved beyond the 50-km (later 100-km) security zone, based on the maximum range of weapons of the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From D+20–30 the Russians began to secure and exploit surviving rail infrastructure in the occupied territories for the transportation of troops and materiel. Understanding the importance of rail transportation, primarily from the point of view of efficiency, the Russian command managed to ensure the unloading of military echelons 30–50 km from the line of contact in most directions. An understandable condition for this was its repair, restoration and protection with the involvement of military units of the Railway Troops of the Russian Armed Forces. For example, since May 2022, as part of the logistical support for the conduct of actions by Russian troops, the MLZH-VF-VT pontoon rail bridge was installed by the 29th Brigade of Railway Troops of the Western Military District near the destroyed rail bridge in Kupyansk (Kharkiv region), across the Oskil River. This was connected to the main railway by the Kupyansk-Vuzlovy–Vovchansk branch. To ensure adequate protection of rail communications, on the southern axes, Russian troops used such exotic means as armoured trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian logistics system was chaotic in the first phase of the war, the structural efficiency of the approach ensured consistent supply throughout the offensive on Donbas. However, the dependence on fixed rail infrastructure, the viable distances from the known railheads to the field depots, and the lack of manoeuvrability of units because of their materiel-heavy concept of operations all exposed the force to systemic vulnerabilities. The mapping of depots and unit support areas, once Ukraine obtained long-range precision fires through military-technical assistance, allowed for the systematic targeting of this logistics infrastructure and through this means the denial of the Russian concept of operation. The introduction of HIMARS and M270 firing GMLRS into the UAF therefore can be seen as the point where the Russian offensive on Donbas ended and the war entered a new phase. The character of the summer fighting involves many elements that remain operationally relevant, and, to that end, it is inappropriate to discuss this phase of the war at this stage. In due course, it will be possible to discuss the Ukrainian preparation for offensive operations. Nevertheless, what has been discussed already provides a rich body of data from which lessons can be identified as to the structural strengths and weaknesses of the AFRF and wider lessons about modern combat for NATO forces. These are considered in the following chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-assessing-russian-military-performance-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;IV. Assessing Russian Military Performance in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 24 February 2022, Russia’s potential adversaries, through professional respect, assumed that Russian forces would employ their capabilities with a basic level of competence. But the size of their forces, sustained investment, their available firepower and the proficiency with which the AFRF had conducted smaller-scale operations in preceding years led to an overestimation of Russia’s actual military capabilities. There was also an overriding focus on the quantity of equipment, rather than the quality of personnel, their leadership, training and motivations. The general error was to take the best observed Russian performance and set this as the expected standard. This had a pernicious effect on policy by increasing fear of Russian forces among Ukraine’s international partners, which Russia exploited to coerce its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 24 February 2022, many observers who have not had direct experience of the conflict have overcorrected for their early analytical errors. There is a perception that the AFRF are systemically incompetent, irredeemably corrupt, that their weapons are ineffective and unreliable, and that the force is incapable of adapting. This narrative is dangerous, both because it is inaccurate, and also because it encourages complacency. Ukraine benefited significantly in its preparations by measuring its readiness against Russia’s potential rather than its actual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational data outlined above shows that the Russian military suffered from major errors of judgement made by the Russian leadership, special services and the presidential administration. The force also suffers from structural weaknesses in its force design and training system that created specific operational and tactical frictions. It was also a force designed for ‘active defence’ strategic military operations, not for a large-scale attack on another sovereign country without full wartime mobilisation. Nevertheless, the AFRF have already demonstrated that they are able to learn and adapt. They remain highly lethal, determined to achieve the mission set by their president, and employing highly capable weapons systems. In future assessments of Russian capabilities, careful attention should be paid to the extent that they have corrected some of the systemic weaknesses in their force, which they are unlikely to be able to resolve during the current period of aggression. If they can make progress in resolving these issues, the gap between Russian potential and its capabilities may narrow considerably. This chapter outlines these key identified weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-has-a-hierarchy-of-jointery&quot;&gt;Russia Has a Hierarchy of Jointery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from the perspective of Russia’s Ground Forces, its military likely appears to be a highly joint organisation. Against Ukraine, the Russian Navy and VKS were both integrated into the campaign plan, adapted as the Russian plan was forced to change, and each contributed to the overall mission. Conversely, it is evident that Russian jointery functions as a hierarchy in which the Navy and VKS are subordinated to the Ground Force’s needs. This was demonstrated in the C2 arrangements during the conflict and the prioritisations of their mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Russians had both airborne command posts in the form of Il-20 Coot aircraft and AWACS orbits provided by A-50M, the coordination of air operations was subordinated to the military district command posts of the Ground Forces rather than the VKS. Rather than running operations from a central combined air-operations centre, coordination of air tasking was managed by ground-based C2 and planned separately by air armies assigned to support each operational group of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of Russia’s air campaign is that the initial targets were prioritised according to the extent that they enabled the Ground Force’s seizure of critical infrastructure. After the Ground Forces began to struggle to make progress, Russian airpower shifted from targeting air-defence sites to win control of the air and instead attempted to provide increasing levels of close air support. The depth of penetration decreased and became tied to the Ground Forces’ axes of advance. Thus, not only C2, but also the logic of prioritisation of air targets, was disproportionately shaped by the tactical challenges faced by the Ground Forces, arguably at the expense of the VKS planning to bring about control of the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Russian Navy, the task of blockade may be considered an application of sea power. Beyond this function, however, the Navy’s core tasks were similarly in support of land operations, either to put troops ashore to seize key lines of communication in advance of Ground Forces movements, or to simply provide strike platforms in support of the wider strike campaign, and, in particular, servicing of targets of tactical importance to the Ground Forces moving along Ukraine’s southern coast. The impact on the professionalism and identity of the service from being subordinated to the Ground Forces in this way is hard to measure but must necessarily contribute to the generally low level of seamanship demonstrated by the Moskva, whose radar was stowed when struck. A more effective employment of air and sea power would likely require a greater level of autonomy in planning for the separate branches with the prioritisation of tasks geared towards joint ends rather than subordinate to the logic of land operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-force-generation-is-not-aligned-with-its-concepts-of-operation&quot;&gt;Russian Force Generation is Not Aligned with its Concepts of Operation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet military was structured to fight in regiments, divisions and combined arms armies that also held independent brigades under command. The Russian armed forces have, for over a decade, pursued the concept of a BTG, constituting an all-arms formation with disproportionate enablement. After 2015, it was noted by the Russian General Staff that the BTG construct would not work without the divisional logistics structure sustaining it and, so, brigades and regiments would thereafter generate BTGs which would be supported by the divisional logistics effort and commanded by the associated combined arms army. The BTG would pool the experienced contract troops from the peacetime unit, thereby theoretically increasing the combat power of the forces generated. It would also allow mixed units of conscripts and contractors in peacetime, which was consistent with a training model that saw the upskilling of soldiers conducted in their units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia has attempted, for some time, to shift from a conscript-based force to a fully volunteer force, it has not been able to recruit enough contract soldiers to abandon conscription. Nor has the Russian military adopted a contract structure that retains experienced and educated personnel in positions of junior leadership. This is equivalent to the non-commissioned officer cadre in Western militaries. This makes the BTG construct highly problematic. The battalion staff is insufficient to manage all the enablers that are assigned. Moreover, because this is a composite formation drawing from multiple units and is only generated for operations, there is a lack of familiarity among the personnel in different arms of the BTG. The commander does not know their people. Thus, a small team of sufficiently trained personnel is unable to provide detailed instructions to each of its subordinate elements, but also does not know its subordinates well enough to be able to predict how they will handle brief and incomplete instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem with the BTG is its ability to absorb losses. An enabled company group – as a unit of action – either succeeds in its task or fails and can thereafter be rotated out if overly attrited. A BTG, however, because of the level of enablement, can become incapable of executing battalion tasks when key enablers are disproportionately attrited, even if many of its components are still useable. As an example, on 22 April 2022, as a result of engagements in the direction of Kurakhove, a BTG of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade under the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District was taken out of battle having lost 240 servicemen killed in action, 11 IFVs, four tanks, three self-propelled guns and three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’. Statistically, the BTG lost only up to 30% of its initial combat power, and many of its supporting elements were intact. However, as a unit, it was no longer capable of executing the tasks that it was being assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial response to this challenge introduced even more confusion into Russian operations. The units less affected by attrition within a BTG would be removed and assigned to other BTGs so that a new amalgamated formation with the requisite combat power was created. The result was to further intermingle personnel from different units, once again changing the command team and ensuring that commanders had no familiarity with their subordinates. It also created logistical and communications problems as units were cut across from one chain of command to another, creating frictions with encryption keys and compatibility problems, and ensuring that the calibres and thus the sustainment demands within a given formation changed periodically. A further complication was that, because the BTG structure put the most experienced troops and commanders in the first echelon, attrition was disproportionately among those with the most experience and therefore best able to manage the uncertainty of composite and amalgamated formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frictions may have been manageable with a higher proportion of junior leaders. Instead, the Russian military found that junior commanders were rapidly promoted to fill the critical staffing requirements at battalion and higher levels, denuding companies of effective leadership and technical skills. As the conflict went on, the disparity between the precision and elegance of issued orders from headquarters and their execution widened considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the weaknesses of the BTG were the most evident, similar issues have bedevilled other Russian branches, most notably the VKS. Ukrainian assessments concluded that given limited flight hours and the practice of training being delivered in units, the VKS entered the conflict with fewer than 100 fully trained and current pilots. Combined with a military culture that assigns the most dangerous missions to the most experienced crews, attrition in the VKS has fallen disproportionately on this cadre, reducing the overall effectiveness of the force and its ability to train new pilots. In negotiations over prisoner exchanges, the AFRF have been eager for the return of experienced pilots. The mobilisation of trainers from their flying schools to frontline formations has also hampered the ability to generate new pilots. The Ukrainian military has noted a rise in both very young and very old pilots in the VKS, with ageing pilots returned to frontline service. This has corresponded with a significant reduction in the scale and complexity of VKS air operations over Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict. It is also a problem that has affected ground crews, for example with the discovery of left-on covers on the sensors of Russian aviation operating over Ukraine, an easily avoided mistake which has a severe impact on effectiveness and should be considered negligence. This suggests challenges in discipline and junior leadership among maintenance crews in the VKS. Another demonstration of this poor discipline in the VKS is the routine stacking of munitions next to aircraft on Russian air bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is harder to assess the limitations of the Russian Navy in terms of its force-generation model as there are fewer data points. Nevertheless, the alertness and damage-control capabilities on the Moskva suggest similar deficiencies in junior crew leadership may affect the Navy. The key point here is that Russia has built a force-employment concept that is beyond the capacity of its force-generation model to resource with the appropriate expertise. Key indicators for improvements in Russian military capability therefore will be whether it adjusts its force-generation model, or reconceptualises how it task organises for operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-has-a-tendency-to-reinforce-failure&quot;&gt;The Russian Military Has a Tendency to Reinforce Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of the war, it was apparent that the course of events described in the orders issued to units diverged significantly from developments on the ground. Nevertheless, units continued to seek to execute their orders long after it had become apparent that assumptions in those orders were wrong. This behaviour has continued throughout the war. The continuous attempts to assault Bakhmut, for example, long after it ceased to be on Russia’s main effort, demonstrate that until an order is countermanded commanders will continue to try to execute their last instruction. In the early phases, during offensive operations, this was best demonstrated around Mykolaiv and Chernihiv. In both cases, Russian units had been ordered to bypass resistance to reach their objectives. The orders made clear that resistance was expected to be light. When this assumption was demonstrated to be false, however, Russian commanders continued to seek to bypass strongpoints, even when it degraded their tactical position, exposed their flanks and diluted their combat power by spreading concentrated forces over a long frontage in contact with Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not be mistaken for a lack of flexibility or adaptability in implementing combat tasks. Russian units often rapidly adapt their methods in response to failure. They also demonstrate creativity within their assigned boundaries. In some contexts, the tendency to lean into a course of action poses dangers to the enemy. Much Western military literature discusses ‘cognitive shaping’ and the use of ‘information manoeuvre’ to divert or alter the enemy’s course of action. These are unlikely to be effective against such a military culture. Similarly, if a force intending to divert an offensive into a killing area is insufficiently strong to blunt the enemy, the response to contact may be – and often is – to lean into the confrontation. If the blocking force is not sufficiently large or lacks firepower, it risks being destroyed, even if it inflicts high casualties, rather than stops the assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of this tendency, it appears clear that anticipating the enemy’s intent and setting dispositions to optimally respond is more important than trying to shape that intent. If an enemy accelerates through a killing area or recommits to an axis even if its intelligence assessment of resistance was unrealistic, anticipating its assigned axis is the best means of placing killing areas in the right location. Conversely, even if a more favourable or apparently advantageous route presents itself, it is unlikely that the unit will deviate from its axis. Cognitive shaping, therefore, must be aimed at operational commanders, with such decisions rarely being made lower than the combined arms army command post. In delivering such a capability, it is essential to understand the theory of victory and higher intent to which the commander is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of Russian orders, which is a significant weakness, is the near absence of reversionary courses of action. If unsuccessful, or if the higher intent is no longer achievable, this leads to requests for clarification being referred upwards. Once decisions are made at higher echelons, the lower echelons can alter their actions quickly. The decision to withdraw from Kyiv, for example, saw a rapid break from contact – with varying levels of order – on both main axes. This was largely executed competently. However, in the interval when higher headquarters seek to formulate a plan, paralysis tends to grip lower echelons if their initial orders do not reflect the position on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has probably had the greatest impact in creating a gap between potential and actual capability as regards Russian fires. All reported contacts are treated as true. All fire missions appear to be given equal priority and are prosecuted in the order in which they are received unless an order to prioritise a specific mission comes from higher authority. It seems that those directing fire missions either do not have access to contextual information or are indifferent to it. In any case, observations of Russian pre-planned fires shows that they will strike targets that have moved and subsequently engage the same target in its new position, suggesting a purely chronological prioritisation of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Russian Navy, a similar dynamic can be observed. The orders to initiate amphibious landings were conditions-based as they were in support of ground forces which never reached the point to justify the action. Thus, these were called off before the forces were committed. However, subsequently, when the sinking of the Moskva enabled the Ukrainian Air Force to re-establish control of the air over Snake Island, it was notable that the Russian Navy continued to try to contest this outpost and the surrounding waters with fast attack boats. Lacking air defence, these were destroyed, mainly with TB2, while Snake Island became denied by Ukrainian long-range fires. Still, the Russian Navy sought to reinforce this failure even though control of the island had no functional impact on its ability to blockade Ukraine’s southern coast. They only stopped reinforcing this failure when higher-level orders accepted abandoning the position. The tendency to reinforce failure was less evident in the VKS, which adapted rapidly to battlefield developments and emerging threats in terms of the employment of its capabilities. The VKS did suffer from the same tendency when it came to targeting, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of fires without prioritisation is a tendency that should be carefully monitored, except in instances where a battery is directly allocated to a unit, has organic capabilities for target acquisition or is operating under higher command. If the Russians can resolve the cultural tendency to treat all instructions as valid until directly countermanded, and all intelligence as accurate unless contradicted, their capability may rapidly improve, coming closer to what their systems suggest they should be able to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-is-culturally-vulnerable-to-deception&quot;&gt;The Russian Military is Culturally Vulnerable to Deception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of too few experienced tactical commanders and a culture that leans into courses of action without distributing sufficient situational awareness for contextual judgement leads to a force that is systemically vulnerable to deception measures. It is vulnerable to deception for three reasons. First, the tendency to treat information received as true unless there is contradictory information leads to systemic confirmation bias. Second, the force does not encourage honest reporting of failures, while there is a shortage of capabilities for battle damage assessment. Third, Russian systems are largely designed around single missions. Even within an EW or air-defence system, each operator will control a different sensor or function. Operators are trained to examine the specific picture for which they are responsible. Neither in their systems’ design, nor in their culture, is there an effective fusion process. In consequence, although the force often has the information to spot inconsistencies in its sensor picture, it is rarely able to compare its datasets to identify these inconsistencies within an operationally relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deception has succeeded against Russian forces at all echelons and across all three service branches. At the tactical level, the UAF have systematically employed false signals traffic and decoys of prestige systems to misdirect Russian fires. This has almost always succeeded, leading to a vast expenditure of munitions against non-existent targets and a corresponding vulnerability for Russian fires in revealing their positions. Tracking how the Russians were conducting battle damage assessment and thereby assuring the Russian military that all strikes were successful repeatedly led to the loss of Russian aircraft and other capabilities because they proceeded on the assumption that the threat had been eliminated. At the operational level, too, Russian forces have been predictable in allocating resources against telegraphed movements and failing to detect or prepare for concealed movements. This has even taken place when some Russian reporting streams have detected concentrations but have been unable to present a sufficiently convincing case to commanders to win resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of the Russian forces to deception is also a risk for its adversaries. Especially prior to a conflict, the primary aim of a force is often deterrence or shaping. In much NATO discussion of these issues subtle changes in force posture, weapons fits on aircraft, patterns of behaviour and so on are used to try to message varying levels of readiness, preparedness and will. Many of these actions are premised on the assumption that they will be observed by the adversary. From a technical point of view, it is certainly true that the Russians can see these kinds of activities. However, when Ukrainian forces struck the cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles on 13 April 2022 there was no indication that its radar was operating. This was supposed to be the central ISTAR node for the air defence of the Black Sea Fleet, yet despite being in an active warzone, the ship’s primary sensors were not on. Nor was this an isolated incident. Russian aviation, shot down over Ukraine, has been found on more than one occasion to have its radar in the stowed position, with safety covers over primary sensors. These incidents speak to complacency, poor ground crew training and a lack of mission focus. When considering the issues of process and lack of fusion described above, however, the visibility of these subtle adjustments for Russian operational commanders is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent. From a deterrence point of view – or for the purposes of shaping decision-making – this is concerning because it suggests that most of the nuance in messaging may be lost. Therefore, while the Russian forces may be vulnerable to deception, the message must be clearly telegraphed. In the context of deterrence, one of the biggest challenges may be preventing the Russians from deceiving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing whether the Russians are closing the gap between their potential and actual capabilities, it is important to pay close attention to their discipline in the employment of sensors, the level of fusion achieved between sensors and whether the situational awareness that is needed to provide officers context for information is properly disseminated. If these issues are addressed, there could be a rapid improvement in the performance of the Russian armed forces. Left unaddressed, the Russians, having the potential capabilities but not the necessary awareness, may fight by lashing out at sounds and in response to blows. One can readily trick such an adversary into striking in the wrong direction. But that does not stop it from being a dangerous adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-forces-are-prone-to-fratricide&quot;&gt;Russian Forces Are Prone to Fratricide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fratricide has been a widespread problem for the Russian forces during their invasion of Ukraine. This has been across all systems. Russian air defences have regularly engaged friendly aircraft. When Russian troops deviate from their assigned axes or the timing of their actions becomes desynchronised, they are often bracketed by their own artillery. Russian units in complex terrain have also become embroiled in exchanges of fire between one another’s positions. This speaks to a lack of C2 and control measures during operations. It likely reflects Russian troops largely conducting scripted exercises rather than free-play force-on-force activity where they are used to dealing with the ambiguities that arise on the battlefield. Some Russian units are much better at this. Among line units, however, map-reading and other basic soldiering skills are not well understood, leading to disorientation and therefore a propensity to misidentify sources of fire. Artillery strikes on friendlies have arisen either because units have been detected retreating or redeploying by UAV and presumed hostile based on their direction of travel, or because pre-planned strikes have caught units that have moved slower or faster than dictated by planning. Here, a lack of IFF (identification, friend or foe) procedures is notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the sub-tactical errors described above, fratricide is a systemic issue between Russian systems. For example, the Khibiny EW pod, mounted to a number of Russian aircraft, automatically detects radars and disrupts them. Unfortunately for the Russians, it tends to also do this to other Russian aircraft. Pairs of Russian strike aircraft mounting this system have therefore had to choose between having a functional radar or EW protection. They have often been ordered to prioritise their radar. This wider issue of confliction between systems, or lack of compatibility between communications equipment, could be managed if units had good situational awareness and a high level of training and reversionary planning in the deconfliction by time or space of their different EW effects. In practice, it leads to a great deal of confusion and mutual disruption. It also offers innumerable – albeit regularly shifting – seams through which effects can breach Russian defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further fratricidal issue is the culture of reporting within the Russian military. Those who fail are usually replaced or threatened with punishment. Alternatively, for senior officers, failure can lead to a different organisation being given leadership for a specified task. Far from incentivising success, this often leads to dishonest reporting in which the blame for failure is transferred onto others. This scapegoating of colleagues – endemic in the Russian special services but also in the military – obscures the actual operational problems that must be solved. These only become apparent when they can no longer be concealed, slowing the learning of lessons, but also leading to predictable and predicted vulnerabilities not being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of fratricide therefore may be studied in three respects as a measure of progress in the development of the Russian Armed Forces. First, there must be an assessment as to the level of effort in future Russian systems to deconflict their effects. Second, there is the question of free-play exercises and testing deconfliction in a dynamic environment to build the necessary skills to avoid fratricide. Third, there is the cultural issue of an honest reporting culture. Without incentives to resolve these issues, it is likely that the Russian military will continue to employ effects that cause its troops harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point on fratricide is the attitude of the Russian military generally, and of its officer corps in particular, to people – its own and civilians. The widespread war crimes by Russian troops throughout the conflict have been widely documented. But it should also be noted that many Russian officers do not invest time in looking after their personnel or caring for their welfare. The culture of hazing in the Russian military arguably creates strong disincentives for junior officers to become involved in the everyday lives of their subordinates. This stems from a general cultural approach that does not place a great deal of value on human life. For senior Russian officers who spent their time as junior officers in the Soviet Union there is still a mindset of seeing people as an inexhaustible resource to be expended. But that is not Russia today. Russia has a finite number of available military personnel. This culture of not valuing individuals is a form of institutional fratricide. Although it leads Russian troops to take a great deal of punishment without surrendering on the battlefield – there is an expectation and acceptance of suffering – it also leads to low morale, poor unit cohesion and troops who lack the team spirit to effectively conduct sub-tactical manoeuvre. Given Russia’s ageing population and its limited base for recruits, progress in its approach to its human capital is another important metric for assessing whether the Russian armed forces can improve their capabilities after this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-lessons-identified-for-the-british-military&quot;&gt;V. Lessons Identified for the British Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military – as outlined in the second chapter of this report – differed considerably in its size, capabilities, structure and culture compared with NATO forces. There are some threats that proved exceedingly difficult for the UAF that would not pose a threat to NATO armies. For example, NATO would not face the same technological disadvantages in the air against Russian aircraft or be unable to contest Russia’s distant blockade. Conversely, there are areas where the UAF are considerably more capable than the forces of many NATO states. Another feature of identifying lessons for future conflict is that some of the weaknesses identified in the previous chapter as regards Russia’s armed forces may be resolved following this conflict. This chapter, therefore, focuses on those aspects that are considered likely constants and applicable to a range of adversaries. This chapter is also specifically aimed at identifying relevant lessons for the British military in relation to how it is currently projected to develop until 2030, although many of the observations have application across NATO members. For other armies, slightly different lessons may apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-is-no-sanctuary&quot;&gt;There Is No Sanctuary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first clear lesson from the war in Ukraine is that the enemy can conduct strikes on targets throughout its adversary’s operational depth with long-range precision fires. Moreover, in target states, the Russians have proven able to retain networks of agents in place to observe key targets and to update their command on the movement of troops and stores. The integration of human intelligence (HUMINT) into Russian long-range precision-fires kill chains is critical. Given that Ukraine has also retained this capability, despite the exigencies of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories, it seems unlikely that states can plan on the assumption that they can conceal key sites, or the movement of materiel, from the enemy. The Russians have missed targets because of self-imposed frictions in their kill chains, usually striking too late rather than not at all. Their misses have not been for want of intelligence. The effect of these munitions on targets when they strike them is sufficient to destroy most military objects other than deep subterranean or heavily hardened structures. Non-hardened structures are also targetable by loitering munitions, whose accuracy and affordability make them a persistent and pervasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UAF, it was found that the ability to conduct dispersed operations was critical to survivability. Without this capability – to disperse and maintain aircraft in the field for a limited period, while periodically returning to main bases when repairs allowed – it is likely that the Ukrainian Air Force would not have survived the opening days of the conflict. Furthermore, dependence on single critical pieces of infrastructure for C2 is not only risky if they are struck, but also risks encouraging escalatory behaviour by the adversary. For the RAF it appears that a critical question for its survivability is the number of deployable maintenance kits available for its aircraft and the capacity to use secondary and tertiary airfields to disrupt enemy planning. This challenge is especially important in future concepts as aircraft become more dependent on software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Ground Forces similarly found that long-range precision strikes were used against their stockpiles, against training establishments and against maintenance facilities when these were identified. Maintenance facilities had to be situated a long way from the front and dispersed, not because distance assured protection, but because increasing the space over which the enemy had to search for them improved survivability. Ukrainian war stocks survived because they could be rapidly displaced and dispersed. Russian materiel has remained highly vulnerable to long-range fires. The reduction in the logistical tail and therefore reduced vulnerability of precision systems is perhaps as important as their effect in terms of their superiority to non-precision fires. The historical approach of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and 3 UK Division of erecting tented cities – command posts with a large physical footprint – is non-viable in wartime on the modern battlefield. These sites will be identified and struck. Moreover, as the Russians have found to their detriment, concentrated command posts inside requisitioned civilian buildings are similarly vulnerable to long-range precision fires unless all staff retain rigid communications discipline. Even here, the HUMINT threat means that locations should be moved frequently and key components of a staff dispersed. The capacity to access staff work remotely means that it is not strictly necessary to concentrate all headquarters components in close physical proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of pervasive strike capabilities are different for the Royal Navy because naval operations are in continual motion and therefore do not suffer from the same vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine has seen a vast expenditure of anti-ship munitions fired from the air, sea and land. These have mainly been fired against ground targets and in this role have had reduced accuracy. Technical examination of these munitions – and how and why they struck the wrong ground targets – demonstrates that they would be highly effective at sea, however. The volume of long-range anti-ship missiles the Russians can bring to bear means the fleet must not set patterns and work strenuously to break the targeting kill chain. Conceptually, the true problem for the Royal Navy lies in multi-domain concepts. In a constrained sea, in close proximity to the shore, or in sea space canalised by mines, the vulnerability to such fires increases exponentially. While sea power can deliver significant if non-decisive effects on an adversary from afar, if it is to affect the fight in other domains it must come closer. Much UK Commando Force thinking about ship-to-shore manoeuvre for raiding currently emphasises the exploitation of clutter in the littoral environment and the noise of civilian shipping. Ukraine demonstrates that once mines are in play during a major conflict, this clutter rapidly evaporates. Arguably a major conceptual gap has emerged in UK military thinking between the Royal Navy, with blue-water capabilities, and the rest of the force, with its emphasis on multi-domain integration. The conflict in Ukraine demonstrates that this is a conceptual gap to which the UK joint force needs an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the Russian missile systems are reliable and accurate. Cruise missiles can be intercepted, but the Russians routinely adapted flight routes for every mission and such missiles were observed to make up to 80 changes of course on their way to a target. It is not economical for any state to maintain coverage across the requisite frontage to be able to defend all targets with a sufficient density of air defences to guarantee defence against these systems. Russian ballistic missiles meanwhile – notably Iskander 9M723 – fly in a quasi-ballistic trajectory, launch six decoys that significantly alter their radar cross section and targetability, and retain a directional link to satellite-based navigation during the terminal phase, in addition to multiple redundant layers of navigation, that mean it is highly uneconomical to deploy interceptors to defeat these threats against all possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of attention given to Russia’s depleted stocks as regards these capabilities, given the rate of expenditure in Ukraine. This is an issue. Moreover, Russia cannot rapidly produce these missiles. It is estimated that it can fabricate around 100 Kalibr missiles per year, for example, and this may come at the expense of other munitions because many Russian munitions have common key modules that act as bottlenecks in the production of multiple systems. For Iskander 9M723, the Russians have been able to maintain a production line of six per month during the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, given that this arsenal has proven effective during the war, it can be assumed that its replenishment will be a priority for the Russian military. With China and Iran both relying heavily on similar complexes, and the proliferation of knowledge on how to achieve precision with these weapons, it must also be assumed that a convergence in systems design between these states will create economies of scale. Ironically the loss of military equipment may also encourage the Russian military to consolidate around fewer platforms, further increasing the capacity to prioritise resources. This lesson from the conflict regarding the threat that British forces must prepare for is pertinent to both the future as regards Russia and adversaries in other theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;warfighting-demands-significant-slack-capacity&quot;&gt;Warfighting Demands Significant Slack Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professionalism of the British military and the competence of units is high. Ukrainian troops have found British training invaluable. British weapons have also proven highly effective on the battlefield. High morale, skilled soldiering and significant corporate experience are of limited value in high-intensity warfare without ammunition, however. It is abundantly clear that the British military is woefully deficient in its stockpiles across domains. At the height of the fighting in Donbas, Russia was using more ammunition in two days than the entire British military has in stock. At Ukrainian rates of consumption, British stockpiles would potentially last a week. Of course, given that the UAF fielded more than 10 times as many operational artillery pieces as the British Army at the beginning of the conflict, it might take more than a week for the British Army to expend all its available ammunition. All this demonstrates, however, is that the British Army lacks the firepower to deliver the kind of blunting effect that the UAF achieved north of Kyiv. The oft-cited refrain of the UK Ministry of Defence that these deficiencies are not a problem because the UK fights alongside NATO allies would be more credible if the situation were much better among any of the UK’s European allies. It is not, except in Finland. Nor – as Ukrainian troops discovered to their surprise – are ammunition, charge bags and other essential consumables consistent between NATO artillery systems; there is an inadequate capacity to draw on one another’s stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deficiencies are not limited to tube artillery. Air defence – whether air- or sea-launched, or ground-based – is similarly entirely inadequate. Ukraine has practical experience using British MANPADS. They are highly effective. Although Ukraine lacks experience with Sky Sabre, Sea Viper, Meteor or Aster missiles, the effectiveness of these systems has been widely demonstrated. Nevertheless, a cursory study of procurement data and, for the land environment, an examination of the units available for air defence, shows that there is insufficient depth of munitions for any of these systems to be credible in high-intensity conflict. The survivability of Ukrainian units has demanded organic MANPADS to be available at all echelons and across all arms. Even with 60 dedicated Air Defence divisions, Ukraine has struggled to provide air defence to its manoeuvre forces, its critical national infrastructure and population centres. It has had to prioritise between them. It is worth briefly noting that there is a point at which munitions become overly complex, expensive and slow to produce so that the value of their increased performance comes with diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s survival initially depended on its own large stockpiles of Soviet-calibre munitions. Now, Ukraine is almost entirely dependent on NATO supplies. It is evident, however, that manufacturing capacity in many NATO states cannot meet the needs of its members in the event of a major conflict. Establishing production lines and assuring access to key materials such as explosive energetics takes time. Beyond merely holding sufficient stockpiles and spares, therefore, it is also abundantly clear that NATO countries – including the UK – must work out a value-for-money proposition that allows defence industry to maintain slack capacity to be ramped up in the event of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the British Army at present appears particularly strong is in its maintaining large training establishments disproportionate to the size of the force. The British Army maintains dedicated training schools for many of its military specialisms, which all require permanent staff and instructors. As demonstrated by the large-scale training to Ukrainian troops – carried out in parallel to the ongoing training of British forces – there is considerable slack capacity in this system. While this is a disproportionate cost on a small army in peacetime, its importance during any major conflict should not be underappreciated. Even assuming that British forces remain highly survivable, the rate of injury combined with the very small overall size of the British armed forces must see troop levels in frontline units decline in any major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK must therefore be able to train a second echelon. Ukraine mobilised its instructors from training establishments early in the conflict and this has contributed to difficulties in training additional forces. Russia has suffered even more from this problem because it delivers a significant proportion of training in-unit, which is not possible for units that are deployed. The British Army, therefore, must not squander its resilience in training capacity for the sake of efficiencies in the short term. Given that the RAF and Royal Navy have pushed their training establishments towards externally contracted solutions, the scalability and adaptability of these structures in wartime should be critically examined. The air war over Ukraine has demonstrated a rapid action–reaction cycle between offence and defence that has required significant adaptation of tactics and methods. For the Royal Navy and the RAF it is vital that simulators and externally contracted training solutions enable rapid adaptation of tactics and parameters in conflict, lest trainees become forced to learn obsolete tactics as a result of the training tools available rather than operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where slack capacity is invaluable is logistics and maintenance. As explained earlier, the UAF suffered from a high rate of turnover of key specialists during peacetime. This, however, proved invaluable in war. The British military currently lacks logistical capacity for its existing forces, let alone in a situation where more forces would need to be mobilised, or where the UK was seeking to sustain a multinational formation over which it had command. The critical point is less whether logistics units can be retained in the force, but rather whether better recruitment of logistics personnel in which they receive training that certifies them for civilian work can create a depth of reserves with associated liability to underpin the sustainment of both the existing force and additional mobilised units in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appropriately establish which platforms, whether because of their ubiquitous utility, or the inherent vulnerability of their tasks, demand mass. Some, such as pontoon bridging, mortars and UAS must be available at scale. A large number of troops are required to know how to use these tools. While there are minimum characteristics of such devices for them to perform their assigned task, the rate of consumption of these capabilities demands that they are ruthlessly simplified and rationalised so that they can be produced at scale and cheaply. Identifying where such consumables demand complexity and striving for standardisation of complex components, even if other elements of a system may have variations, is vital for achieving sufficient economies of scale. Again, there is a challenge for industry because this demands a great deal of work up front on design, but a very narrow margin of return on each manufactured object. Developing an appropriate value-for-money framework to have industrial capacity in such areas is similarly critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uas-and-cuas-must-be-available-across-all-branches-and-echelons&quot;&gt;UAS and CUAS Must Be Available Across All Branches and Echelons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson from the war is that UAS and CUAS must be available at all branches of the force. It is also evident that the UK and other NATO members have made mistakes in how they categorise UAS, generate the capability in the force and have governance for their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because NATO forces were early adopters of UAS, they have inherited the legacy of earlier generations of system. Early UAS were expensive, complex and often difficult to fly. Thus, specific units were established to be trained to use UAS and considerable investment was put into making the platforms better. Furthermore, because NATO forces have used UAS in an environment where even small numbers of casualties were politically significant, the emphasis has been skewed towards force protection. Since UAS were flying objects, they should be managed as such. In the UK this places permission for launching UAS under the responsibility of the Military Aviation Authority. On NATO exercises careful attention is paid to airspace deconfliction, so that helicopters and UAS, for example, do not find themselves in the same airspace and at risk of collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the evolution of the system of governance for UAS has proceeded logically and the structures around their use made sense when they were formulated, they have produced forces poorly suited for the operating environment, as observed in Ukraine and elsewhere. For pilots and other elements of the force, the expectation that UAS can be excluded from airspace is not viable. There will be many enemy UAS in the airspace. Training to manage this flight risk, therefore, is critical; training in an airspace without this hazard simply transfers risk from training to operations. In any case, given the need for troops to manage their electromagnetic signature and the impact of jamming, tactical echelons cannot guarantee getting information about their flight plans back to higher headquarters. Nevertheless, they will need eyes in the sky to retain situational awareness and to remain competitive. Requiring higher-echelon approval will make the employment of UAS uncompetitively slow. Requiring units to follow the procedures for aircraft in launching UAS also means that it is inordinately expensive to train UAS operators and this too becomes a constraint on their employment that means tactical units will not have enough pilots to keep up the required number of orbits to be competitive. For the UK, the implication is that UAS need to be classified as munitions rather than aircraft. At present, there are fewer administrative restrictions for the Royal Artillery to fire live 155-mm howitzer munitions over civilian roads than for them to fly a UAS over the same airspace to monitor what they are hitting. This must be changed, and it requires changes to policy, rather than simply expecting units to make the administrative burden of employing UAS manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS should be split into three broad categories for land forces. The first are rotary-type UAS able to manoeuvre close to the ground and in complex terrain, fielded across all manoeuvre formations for the purposes of route proving, reconnaissance, situational awareness, target acquisition, fire correction, and a wide range of other tasks. The second are fixed-wing UAS able to fly at medium altitude into operational depth and perform a single task, whether that be target acquisition or direct effects. Where multiple effects are required, this can be achieved by flying complexes of multiple UAS of this type. These should be used by units able to affect what they find, either reconnaissance units or artillery. Both the first and second category of UAS must be cheap and available in quantity. The third category comprises platforms carrying higher-echelon sensors. In Ukraine, this includes the TB-2, which was most useful as a maritime patrol platform. Platforms such as Watchkeeper and Protector fall into this category, best employed behind the FLOT and tasked with standoff sensing. It must be understood that employing these scarce assets depends on shaping, or else they will be rapidly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS were also found to be highly useful for air and naval forces in Ukraine. The ability to put sensors aloft for a protracted period without the need for a wrap to recover pilots or the burden of life support on the platform greatly extended the range at which maritime patrolling could be conducted and the risks that could be taken to gain situational awareness. The lack of loitering munitions able to target air-defence radars has been noted as a critical deficiency in the UAF that would have enabled much more aggressive air operations. Flying at around 50–100 ft and using terrain, Ukrainian pilots have been able to get within around 15–30 km of targets. Although Western aircraft are much more capable, Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) complexes remain highly lethal and would likely drive aircraft low. The Ukrainian Air Force found that the suppressive effect of HARMs (high-speed anti-radiation missiles) launched against Russian radar was short. Loitering munitions, by contrast, can remain in place and thereby create multiple dilemmas for SAM operators that could significantly increase the window within which aircraft could penetrate the Russian missile-engagement zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering UAS has proven no less important across all domains. For land forces, tactical sub-units must first have a means of detecting the presence of hostile UAS. Frontages must be covered by the means of defeating enemy UAS. Defeating UAS does not mean kinetically destroying them. It simply means denying the UAS the ability to achieve its mission. This could be done through the dazzling of sensors, or denial of navigation or control. The most efficient protection against UAS is EW and ensuring that electronic attack and electronic protection is available at all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the British Army has under-resourced this capability. Having two EW signal regiments and assigning their capability to operational tasks leaves most of the force unprotected. It is also important to note that electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) fratricide and C2 are both major challenges of widespread EW employment. The UAF have suffered from battalion staffs who are not sufficiently familiar with EW capabilities to synchronise and manage these tools. The Russian military has suffered even more from this problem. The availability of these troops on exercise and an understanding across units as to how to work with their EW support is vital, especially to avoid EW personnel knocking down friendly UAS, or UAS being launched when the EMS has not been shaped to enable their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, nevertheless, a need for kinetic defeat of some kinds of UAS, especially those penetrating operational depth to conduct target acquisition or loitering munitions. It is highly inefficient to have dedicated CUAS batteries in addition to air-defence batteries. Nevertheless, the munitions that air and missile defence batteries employ do not make CUAS missions economical. The answer must be the provision of intermediate munitions that can draw on the common air picture and guidance available to air-defence units but without the cost associated with munitions that must catch and defeat more complex targets. Point defence for critical sites is also an enduring requirement given the ability for long-range UAS to fly below the radar horizon on complex pre-programmed routes and thereby reach static targets in operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the RAF, the issue of CUAS is foremost one of integration. Given that loitering munitions targeting airfields, critical national infrastructure and other targets are exceedingly small and low flying, elevated sensors such as the AESA radar of the F-35 are ideal for detecting these targets. At the same time, the allocation of F-35s against such targets would be an entirely inappropriate use of the platform. The RAF therefore should either ensure that it has an economical means of supplying wide-area surveillance for tracking these threats or that it can offboard track data from combat air patrols to ground CUAS systems. Given that CUAS systems are often short ranged, these would not usually be priority recipients of such data, but ensuring access to that data will be important if the RAF wishes to avoid having assets drawn to suboptimal taskings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy also faces a CUAS challenge. UAS can be used on maritime patrolling to locate and monitor task forces in a more efficient manner than aircraft, while they are also less economical to engage. Conceptually this is not a novel threat. Of much greater concern is that as the Royal Navy seeks to project power into littoral environments, targets such as ship-to-shore connectors, fast attack boats and other vessels lacking air defence become highly vulnerable to armed UAVs. If the threat from anti-ship cruise missiles drives the main task force out to sea, the ability to operate in the littoral demands that fast attack craft have a means of detecting and countering UAS. The UAF have had considerable success against Russian fast attack craft with TB2. As countries such as Iran increase their investment in strike-capable UAVs, the ability for fast craft to operate within this threat is important beyond contests with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighting-for-the-right-to-precision&quot;&gt;Fighting for the Right to Precision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in the discussion of UAS above, the experience in Ukraine clarifies some of the critical effects of a contested EMS. Military discourse has – for several years – focused on the problem of EMS denial. Its denial was a major challenge for the UAF in 2014 and 2015. Measures were taken to make the force more resilient. The 2022 invasion therefore provides a better canvas to assess the impact of EW on militaries with appropriately resilient systems, and tactics, techniques and procedures. The effect is not EMS denial. Limitations of power, the tactical necessity to manage signatures and the consequences of EMS fratricide all mean that even forces with large EW capabilities cannot achieve blanket denial across large geographic areas for a sustained period. Denial can be achieved for a short period, or across a limited geographic area. Targeted denial can be delivered for a sustained period over a wide area. However, any kind of targeted denial of bands of the EMS can be evaded through altering frequencies or bearers. The result is that EMS interference and disruption is continual, but denial is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that contesting the EMS is less of a priority. Left uncontested, EW slows kill chains, increases confusion and, perhaps most importantly, degrades precision. The inability to determine accurate locations, let alone transmit timely data on target locations, or for munitions to achieve precise impacts against targets, all risk a force losing competitiveness against an opponent. Precision munitions not only inflict disproportionately more damage to the enemy but significantly reduce friendly vulnerabilities in the rear by shrinking the logistics footprint. Precision depends on a functioning kill chain, however. To assure that kill chain and to ensure that the munitions function properly, it is essential to actively contest the EMS. The layering of EW and kinetic attacks is vital to ensure that limited stocks of high-end weapons deliver the effects required. For example, an attempt to deliver precision effects against a target can be disrupted through interference with navigation frequencies so that precise target acquisition is denied. Here, the use of an EW baseline to identify the location of the source of this interference can enable non-precision fires to force the EW platform to displace, thereby opening a window in which the coordinates for an accurate precision strike can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Ukraine distributed EW capabilities across its groups of forces to provide organic support on key axes. It was rapidly discovered that there was insufficient training in units to properly employ these troops. For that reason, the UAF have formed a Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Command, enabling end-to-end management of capability development, electronic-payload preparation and delivery, as well as force protection and direction finding. Although a more centralised approach to the allocation of EW assets has been adopted, it remains necessary to have these capabilities available on all active fronts. The three basic tasks of EW troops are reconnaissance (direction finding), protection and electronic attack. It is necessary for EW troops to understand the fires plan and scheme of manoeuvre, and to have access to the synchronisation matrix of other arms in a force so that they can distribute capabilities to optimally support the other branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of contesting the EMS is pattern recognition in enemy cyber and electromagnetic activities, and the provision of advice on where there are seams in the enemy system that can be exploited. For example, wide-area jamming of navigational systems likely means that the enemy is not postured to conduct accurate fire missions. The lifting of this may indicate that UAS are about to be launched or that a fire mission is about to commence from a sector. However, this also means that friendly UAS committed to that sector can – for a time – accurately determine the location of the targets such as batteries that are fixed by virtue of their preparing to fire. Similarly, if enemy EW protection is strong, targeting the sources of emission will cause EW platforms to displace, revealing gaps in protection that can be exploited to deliver effects. All these effects, however, are limited in duration and require the necessary capabilities to all be available so that the window of opportunity can be exploited once it is identified. Understanding that EW may drive, as well as be a tool applied by, planning is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the British military EW is primarily available from the air and at sea, with limited numbers of specialists available for ground forces. Although Russian capabilities are quite effective in dividing air and ground components, with their air defences also drawing air forces into mission sets that will struggle to complement ground force activity, it is reasonable to assume that the British military could plan on using air assets for electronic attack. Naval EW support is harder to envisage because of the distance at which navies must operate from the land to remain survivable. Air-based electronic attack does not offer electronic protection, however. It is evident that there is a need for EW defence to be widely available for all manoeuvre elements. This includes deception. The British Army has had success in exercises through the emplacement of false command posts and other EW decoys. Russian and Ukrainian forces have also successfully employed these techniques. While units might be able to organically use such measures to improve their survivability, deception in the EMS also offers a valuable means of drawing out and then striking enemy prestige systems, especially those capable of delivering precision fires. Lining up the assets to take advantage of such a lure necessitates drawing on kinetic capabilities and their synchronisation of availability with EW capabilities. There is thus a need for planners – often at quite a junior level – to understand this game of cat and mouse and to be able to assign personnel to enable it. Attriting enemy precision capabilities or EW assets is critical in fighting for the right to precision. Whichever side can secure better access to the EMS is likely to retain significant tactical advantages that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity contesting the EMS requires regular emissions. Operations also create significant EMS signatures even among disciplined forces. A force that sees the EMS as something to be feared, with its sole aim being the limitation of its signature, is likely to introduce so much friction into its operations that it cedes initiative and advantage to the enemy through self-imposed constraints. Avoiding this means that a force exposes itself to greater risk of targeting. Mitigating that risk requires an understanding of the force’s own signature across the force – not just among the specialist EW community – and comfort on planning actions that prevent the enemy’s detections creating timely and reliable information for targeting. Understanding the EMS is also important because in an active contest, EW troops cannot guarantee sustained protection. The enemy may successfully bring about windows of opportunity where it has an advantage in the EMS and can therefore bring precision effects to bear. Understanding the indicators for these conditions among manoeuvre force commanders is important if they are to take the appropriate countermeasures to ensure the survivability of their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the importance of EW to air and maritime operations is significant, the war in Ukraine offers limited lessons for the RAF and Royal Navy in this context because Ukraine’s air and naval capabilities are too technologically inferior to Russia’s to provide a comparable problem set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disperse-dig-deep-or-move-fast&quot;&gt;Disperse, Dig Deep or Move Fast&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dispersion has been at the forefront of British Army discussion since 2015. In general, the importance of dispersion was vindicated by the data from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian infantry companies tend to disperse across a 3-km frontage. Greater concentration often decreases the survivability of units because it begins to make the use of precision munitions and the allocation of ISTAR assets economical in terms of the effect delivered per munition. One important consequence of dispersion is that it increases the tactical commander’s span of control. When combined with the multiple enablers necessary for a formation to be competitive, it is evident that a battalion commander in this conflict is often dealing with a comparable frontage to that traditionally occupied by a brigade, with similar effects in terms of their ability to maintain a physical presence among their troops. Since battalion staffs are not staffed like brigades – and would not be survivable if they were – there is considerable strain placed on company and battalion commanders. The British Army, which tends to put senior personnel within their rank into command positions, is in a reasonable position to handle this challenge. Nevertheless, developing C2 tools to allow beyond-line-of-sight C2 in sub-units is critical. Another challenge for dispersed forces, especially if they must echelon through one another, is identifying friend from foe. Ukrainian troops have tended to sacrifice camouflage for clear identification (using coloured bands) for their manoeuvre forces, relying on speed rather than concealment for survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although dispersion has proven critical to survivability against indirect fire, it also risks individual positions becoming isolated against enemy forces if they choose to concentrate. In concentrating, the enemy likely accepts higher rates of attrition, but that does not necessarily prevent ground from being taken. On both the attack and defence, the UAF have found that localised actions using reserves are critical to the reinforcement of sectors under pressure and thus to ground holding or building momentum. This ability for dispersed elements to echelon through one another to rapidly flank and defeat enemy concentrations has also been important in offensive operations. To do this, however, requires that the force concentrates, as survivability is afforded principally by mobility. If the period of concentration is sufficiently short and the target sufficiently mobile, it is difficult for the enemy to bring effective fires to bear on the right location. If these actions coincide with EW and other effects that extend the enemy’s kill chain, the window of opportunity for concentration at the appropriate point can be extended. Troops must remain mobile if under observation or they will come under highly effective fire. Even Ukrainian Special Operations Forces found that if they went static having penetrated the enemy, they risked being detected by UAS traversing the battlespace to the front and engaged with indirect fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of speed as the best means of protection is also evident in the employment of air-assault operations. Russia successfully penetrated deep inside Ukraine’s air defences precisely because it was able to open a window of opportunity in which the speed of insertion was critical. Ultimately Russia inserted too few personnel too deep for them to be reinforced. Ukraine has also employed aviation assault to cut ground lines of communication ahead of an advance. This too had to be done rapidly, exploiting gaps in enemy air defences. The prospect of pattern setting through second waves or resupply to these troops, however, is bleak, risking ambush for aviation en route or being caught on the ground by artillery. The feasible depth for such operations therefore is very limited. If under observation from UAS, troops ultimately have two options: having defeated the UAS they must either displace or move into hardened cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for hardened cover has been demonstrated throughout this conflict. Shell scrapes and other hasty procedures may improve the survivability of a unit against the opening salvo, but this salvo also risks fixing the unit in cover that is insufficiently protected. Once fixed, the enemy can transition to airburst or thermobaric munitions and thereby kill the target in place. In essence, troops should avoid making administrative stops in the indirect fire zone. If these are essential, shell scrapes may be justified. Mobility is the preferred means of improving survivability in this context. However, if troops are to remain in a position for any length of time, positions must be hardened and have overhead protection. Urban settlements, which often have cellars and other subterranean infrastructure, are optimal defensive points because these positions can be reinforced but begin as a sound basis for shelters. In the open, defensive positions should be dug underground. Both thermal sheeting and overhead cover are very important. Trenches in open ground are too easily targeted so they should be dug along treelines and other areas where there is overhead cover, thereby obscuring where in a trench there are entrances to hardened positions. Hardening positions – including entrances to trench structures – also requires the establishment of UAS detection and laser detection with countermeasures, such as smoke grenades. For any force required to hold vital ground, which is therefore restricted in its ability to displace and manoeuvre, excavation equipment should be available to rapidly emplace hardened defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is far from over. Although the Russian military is now on the defensive and withdrawing in multiple directions, there is not yet an indication that its hostile intent against Ukraine nor its efforts to undermine the West economically and politically have subsided. Although the massive sacrifices of the UAF have inflicted serious and widespread damage to the Russian capacity for offensive operations, Ukraine’s international partners need to fully appreciate the scale of the conflict, the adversary’s capabilities and the cause of their deficiencies to assess whether the Russians are effectively adapting when they try to recover from their recent setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has aimed to properly frame events in Ukraine by outlining Ukrainian decision-making, capabilities and intent, to clarify the scale of operations, and to distinguish between the consequences of Russia’s deficient planning and mistaken decisions compared with the structural and systemic weaknesses of its forces. The shortcomings of this report are that it does not deal in detail with Ukrainian losses nor does it assess the relative effectiveness of Ukraine’s tactics and performance. It also does not cover the second part of the conflict. For reasons of operational security, these issues will need to be discussed at a suitable point in the future. However, the authors have ensured that what is set out in this report’s conclusions is not contradicted by non-public data. It is hoped that this report has therefore provided a sound basis from which to identify critical lessons from the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer a summary of the many detailed and specific observations made in this report, it is worth instead summarising three critical points that policymakers should draw from the conflict if they are to ensure that their national security is built on sound foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated that consumption rates in high-intensity warfighting remain extraordinarily high and that resilience demands a capacity to build new units, produce spare parts and ammunition, and have sufficient stockpiles to remain competitive in the opening phases of fighting. At present, it is evident that NATO members other than the US are not in a strong position on these fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UAF were competitive against their adversaries not because of superior equipment in the early phases of the war but because they were adaptable – especially at the tactical level – and rapidly innovated new capabilities and concepts of employment to address specific areas of vulnerability where the Russians had achieved overmatch. For NATO countries, the critical question therefore is not whether a specific weapons system gives advantage, desirable though this is, but whether a country’s policies, permissions and industrial processes enable the rapid development, experimentation, refinement, acquisition at scale and employment of new systems and tactics. Do personnel at all levels have the permissions to contribute their expertise? Do tactical formations have the capability to procure and test equipment properly? Or is defence procurement a glacial process that is detached from the development of tactics, techniques and procedures? A state in the latter position is unlikely to adapt at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there has been abundant debate over whether the war proves the utility or obsolescence of various military systems: loitering munitions versus artillery, or ATGWs versus tanks. These debates are largely nugatory. Legacy systems, from T-64 tanks to BM-21 Grad MLRS have proven instrumental in Ukraine’s survival. That does not mean, however, that historical concepts of employment for these systems remain advisable. The key priority is to understand how new capabilities not only offer opportunity in and of themselves, but also enable and magnify the effects deliverable by legacy systems. Perhaps most important is to appreciate how the correct employment of exquisite capabilities can magnify the impact of cheap and crude equipment. It is evident that to exploit these opportunities, changes to orders of battle, C2 and novel employment may be necessary. The grouping of armour as a reserve, to be committed under propitious circumstances, for example, may make more sense than its distribution into the leading edge of offensive manoeuvre forces. It is also entirely plausible that the synergies between old and new capabilities shift the balance of requirements for the next generation of armoured platforms. But the enduring utility of these tools is not diminished by these changes. In modernising, therefore, forces need to examine how old and new form novel combinations of fighting systems, rather than treating modernisation as a process of deciding what should be procured and what should be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, for all the new capabilities on the battlefield, the war in Ukraine has been marked by the usual miscalculations, uncertainties and human failings. For Ukraine, victory is essential but can only be achieved with the ongoing support of its international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processes that it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is doctrinally and conceptually committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in multidomain integration (MDI)/Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO)-type capabilities will need to be incremental, compared with the huge Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) programme underway in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potentially useful model for the UK is the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) programme, which has achieved an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting a limited number of core platforms essential to one mission set. To achieve similar results, the MoD will need to carefully prioritise early MDI investment tranches towards seamlessly connecting the assets that will gain the most combat effectiveness from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting priority mission sets and using them as an analytical lens offers one way to identify the platforms and force elements where targeted investment in advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities would add the most tangible value in an operational context. The vignettes examined in this paper suggest that, in general, focusing on connecting key sensor assets such as F-35, E-7A and special operations forces teams, with long-range precision fires and integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capabilities such as guided multiple launch rocket systems and Type 45, appears likely to significantly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios such as suppression of enemy air defence systems/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) and IAMD, where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that a necessary aspect of prioritisation is choosing which assets across the joint force do not currently need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing data sharing and automated command-and-control solution. Over-ambition coupled with a lack of focus in such a complex and interdependent effort involving all the armed services and Strategic Command is a recipe for programme failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MINISTRY OF Defence (MoD) has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processesthat it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control (C2) processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I of this paper demonstrates the scope of the US Department of Defense (DoD)’s ambitions for creating a fully fledged JADO capacity across the entire joint force, via its new Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) architecture. It briefly explains how the US Army’s Project Convergence, the US Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) and the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and Project Overmatch programmes fit into the wider JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapters II to IV use vignettes to examine which elements of the UK’s future joint force might benefit most from JADC2-style connectivity across three specific mission sets. The conclusion explores the implied priorities and considerations for the MoD in pursuing its doctrinal aim of MDI through a capacity to conduct JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note at the start that the scale and scope of the Chinese military threat in the Indo-Pacific, which is driving JADO ambitions in the US DoD, is of a different nature and magnitude to that faced by European NATO members. This has several important implications for what JADO will mean for the UK and its European NATO partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unless European NATO members wish to simply purchase JADC2-compliant off-the-shelf platforms, network architectures and weapons systems from the US, they will have to incorporate JADC2 compliance and compatibility into their own existing and future platforms and C2 systems. If they do not, over time they will lose operational interoperability with the US as the latter moves to ever more tightly integrated and automated data sharing, targeting and C2 arrangements to facilitate JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, both off-the-shelf procurement of JADC2-compliant equipment and modernisation of hardware, software and communications suites on existing platforms will necessarily take place at a much slower pace in Europe than in the US due to limited funding and other competing priorities. For the UK, regenerating the platforms required to deliver a warfighting division, purchasing sufficient munitions and funding adequate training and exercise activity is already overstressing the budget available – especially in light of the refusal of the government to commit to any increases in Defence spending beyond maintaining 2% of GDP in the Budget Autumn Statement. As such, a comprehensive modernisation programme to make the whole UK Joint Force JADC2 compliant or otherwise capable of JADO-type activities is highly unlikely to be affordable for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Defence in the UK (and in other European NATO member states) has limited programmatic capacity to staff and manage large capital programmes simultaneously. In the UK in autumn 2022 a major increase in the Defence budget was promised by then Prime Minister Liz Truss as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. However, this increase was not confirmed in the Budget statement on 17 November. The Chancellor at the time acknowledged the need for increased defence spending, but deferred a decision until the Integrated Review had been amended in light of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation will, therefore, be critical to enable the UK to make efficient use of initial MDI investment tranches and to avoid decision paralysis in the face of the scale of the challenge. Chapters II, III and IV of this paper provide mission-centric vignettes to explore where the greatest potential combat effectiveness gains might be achieved by early investments to unlock JADO-style capabilities between specific UK platforms. The vignettes comprise: a campaign to suppress enemy air defence systems (SEAD) in Eastern Europe; the provision of IAMD to a forward-deployed UK force in the Middle East; and a contested freedom of navigation operation (FONOP). These were chosen as tasks that UK forces may be called upon to conduct, and also because they span the spectrum of conflict from high-intensity warfighting against a peer nation to potentially contested shows of presence during competition. The vignette approach was chosen to demonstrate that tying MDI/JADO questions to mission-focused output metrics can help policymakers move beyond necessary but broad and convoluted conceptual and doctrine discussions and towards identifying practical investment priorities. In addition to suggesting where significant value might be gained, even concise mission-focused vignettes can also shed light on where investment in cross-domain real-time data sharing is not likely to lead to transformative increases in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-joint-all-domain-operations&quot;&gt;What are Joint All-Domain Operations?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADO is a conceptual framework which has been created by the US DoD to describe its goal of integrated military operations across the domains of land, air, sea, space and the electromagnetic spectrum. The working US DoD definition of JADO is ‘actions by the joint force in multiple domains integrated in planning and synchronised in execution, at speed and scale needed to gain advantage and accomplish the mission’. The aim is to deliver integrated effects against an opponent across the phases of inter-state cooperation, competition and armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, JADO is not a programme as such, but rather a guiding vision of the sort of operations the US armed forces are to be capable of undertaking in a future conflict. The intent is that by operating in this way, US forces will be able to create multiple simultaneous dilemmas for an enemy which cannot all be solved, and which compel hostile troops and commanders to make difficult or impossible trade-offs. A critical component of this vision is the simplification and acceleration of current decision-making processes, moving from planning cycles measured in days to hours or even minutes. In some respects, this represents a simple desire to speed up the Observe Orient Decide Act loops which govern military decision-making at all levels. This has led some to suggest that there is little to differentiate JADO from earlier operational concepts.10 As a top-down set of guiding principles, JADO is also very similar to the vision laid out by the UK’s own MDI concept note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the US has a practical strategy which the DoD is pursuing to enable – called JADC2. The working definition of JADC2 in the DoD is ‘the warfighting capability to sense, make sense, and act at all levels and phases of war, across all functional areas, domains, and with partners, to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance’. In more simple terms, JADC2 is a strategy which aims to connect all the sensors across the US Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps into a single and highly automated network. Its primary function is to provide a new kind of joint decision-making and disseminating tool for commanders to enable them to plan, orchestrate and execute JADO. This vision of JADC2 is, to put it mildly, an extremely complex and ambitious undertaking. However, a unified decision-making tool is not the limit of the ambitions for JADC2 across the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, JADC2 is also a way to develop a highly automated ‘any-sensor, any-shooter’ network that will process and disseminate data between all the platforms within a joint force, and automatically allocate fire missions and other non-kinetic tasks to the optimal unit or platform at any given time. In this vision, the key output of JADC2 would be a version of a combat cloud or an Internet of Things, which has been described as an application enabled by modern digital communications networks to interface with connected sensors and shooters in a similar fashion to the Uber ride-hailing app. In this vision, a ‘shooter’ does not know or need to know where the target track that they have been automatically allocated was gathered from, and nor would the original source of that target data need to know which ‘shooters’ were available to prosecute the target when they sent the request for fires. Instead, the system would optimise the matching of detected target tracks and weapons solutions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would represent a major shift from network-centric warfare to data-centric warfare. It requires a C2 system that can be platform-agnostic and capable of taking data from any sensor and supplying firing and targeting solutions to any available effector systems. It is critical to understand what this entails; most networked systems are designed to receive data from a specific sensor. For example, an air defence system is designed to receive target acquisition and tracking data from its own bespoke radars, whose data is formatted for that system’s fire control and battle management systems. The concept of JADC2 holds that the overarching battle management system and C2 network supporting multidomain operations should be able to rapidly receive, interpret, weight and assign actions in response to any data it receives and distribute it in a format that is usable by any other asset or weapons system connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-where-is-jado-now&quot;&gt;I. Where is JADO Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of JADO is being explored through a series of experiments led by the US services that are designed to examine how it can be realised under the aegis of JADC2. JADC2 is both an approach and a procurement effort; it requires the US services to establish common data standards so that information can be shared seamlessly between them, as well as the procurement of new communications architectures that allow that information to be shared. However, it also requires a change in C2 culture with greater thought given to the synchronised, optimal allocation of resources, force positioning and decision-making. There are already several technical efforts underway within each service, which sit underneath the overall JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Air Force is essentially the lead service on JADC2, with its primary efforts in this regard being channelled into its ABMS programme. ABMS is being developed in line with the Joint Warfighting Concept that will shape the doctrines created by the US services to define their role in JADO. JADC2 is the system that will enable US commanders to connect any sensor system to any effector. It is notionally a joint effort, although US Air Force officials have stressed that the technologies developed by the Army and Navy are designed to dovetail into the ABMS. In addition to integrating C2 efforts from across the US armed forces, JADC2 is also expected to integrate the US nuclear arsenal into the same network of sensors and effectors, although details on that effort are classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABMS itself was originally intended to replace the E-3 AWACS before it was expanded to become a programme that will procure equipment and software, as well as implement new C2 and data policies. The US Air Force’s experiments within ABMS have demonstrated the ability to transmit data from Army and Navy radars to F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning fighter aircraft; it has been used in defence of US space assets and to engage cruise missiles. The US Air Force has also demonstrated the use of a KC-46 Pegasus tanker aircraft as a communications node that was used to relay information from fourth- to fifth-generation aircraft. The KC-46 application of the ABMS programme has become the first material step, taking it from a purely experimental standing to an in-service capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army has launched Project Convergence, which is seeking to test the ability of national-level intelligence assets to coordinate and direct long-range fires with the assistance of AI. Project Convergence was established by the US Army Futures Command to test a single use case; a sensor-to-shooter link to enhance and test the ability of in-service systems to pass data between themselves. Its first iteration in 2020 proved that sensor-to-shooter time could be reduced from an average of 14 minutes to a few seconds. However, it also revealed that many of the systems in service with the US armed forces could not pass data to each other in compatible forms, leading to the realisation that the network that facilitates the flow of information is the centre of gravity as far as JADO is concerned. Project Convergence has since expanded to seven use cases and the establishment of the Joint Systems Integration Lab, which is charged with practising the movement of data between systems. Its work has been deemed vital to realising JADC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army’s technical contribution in the land domain is the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), which has experimented with 4G and 5G and hybrid cloud architectures to support mounted and dismounted operations, including the movement of large data sets with low latency. The US Army has also moved its integrated air and missile defence (IADS) Battle Command System (IBCS) into low-rate initial production. The system enables assets from multiple domains to be integrated into a single air defence network. When provided with a suitable relay and datalink translation node (in this case an ‘EMC2’ network bridge on a U-2), IBCS has been used to coordinate an engagement between F-35 and the Army Field Artillery Tactical Data System. In the land domain at least, experimentation with JADO has made clear that passing data between systems in a usable form is the primary challenge to be overcome and emphasises that this is the centre of gravity around which the success of the project will turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy is focused on Project Overmatch, a secretive effort about which little is known except for the intention to introduce an AI-enabled network architecture and facilitate distributed operations through manned–unmanned teaming. Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made under the NIFC-CA programme, which was developed as an advanced version of what was initially termed ‘cooperative engagement capability’ (CEC) whereby aircraft and surface ships could share target track information and guide each other’s weapons in flight. In its fully operational state the NIFC-CA architecture currently connects surface combatant ships equipped with Aegis Baseline 9 or a later version of the powerful Aegis air and missile defence system to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fast jets, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye AWACS aircraft of the carrier air group (CAG). Its primary function is to create a fused recognised air picture which is fed by all the radars on ships and in the air back to the operations centre on the aircraft carrier itself. This allows a huge increase in the effective resolution and coverage of the whole fleet’s radar coverage. It is especially effective at increasing detection ranges against small or stealthy targets such as advanced anti-ship missiles and fifth-generation fighter aircraft due to the ability to exploit the dispersed positions of the various contributing radar sensors for multi-static triangulation. As a secondary function, NIFC-CA was designed to enable assets in the task group to designate targets for and guide each other’s missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which the US Navy developed NIFC-CA is potentially highly instructive for the UK and other Allied nations looking to invest in similar capabilities in their own forces. Rather than making NIFC-CA into a major acquisition programme of record, the US Navy inserted common network connectivity and data standards into the requirements within the major acquisition/modernisation programmes for specific platforms that were judged most critical for a specific mission – in this case counter-air and missile defence. The mission hinged most critically on the forward sensors on the E-2C/D Hawkeye AWACS, the later cancelled Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and the SM-3 and SM-6 ‘shooters’ used by the Aegis combat system onboard US guided missile destroyers and cruisers. Therefore, these systems were prioritised in terms of investment in unlocking shared situational awareness and third-party targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since NIFC-CA was not a major acquisition platform for a poorly defined future connectivity goal, but rather a budgetarily small programme with the power to insert requirements into pre-existing equipment acquisition or modernisation programmes, it did not fall foul of any of a series of major budget cuts over the decade of primary development. Even when JLENS was cancelled, this did not endanger NIFC-CA as a whole. Furthermore, once the cooperative engagement capabilities and combined situational awareness enabled by NIFC-CA in its early form had been demonstrated, it was easier to both justify the funding for and articulate the requirements needed to integrate other platforms, such as F-35C. Consequently, NIFC-CA is currently delivering real-time shared situational awareness and cooperative engagement capabilities between US Navy vessels, aircraft and weapons far in excess of what has yet been achieved by more ambitious but less well-defined US Air Force programmes, such as ABMS. The more ambitious Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made by the US Navy with an incremental and mission-specific approach to unlocking increased combat effectiveness through cross-domain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with this sort of operational capability, tangible UK progress in making JADO-style capabilities a practical reality remains largely experimental. The MoD has specified a guiding ambition to develop the capability to conduct MDI in doctrine and strategy publications such as JCN 1/20, and the Integrated Operating Concept. However, most practical investment is currently being undertaken by experimental establishments within each service. One example is the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), which has taken a somewhat different approach from the US to the problem of joint force connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking to build connectivity through feeds and common applications to link platforms or services, the RCO has focused initially on creating a common data environment called Nexus. The idea behind Nexus is to provide a virtual environment which acts as a Defence-owned portal where other platforms, networks, sensors and applications can both request and feed in data, according to published integration standards. Nexus concentrates on metadata so that applications and platforms alike can see what and who is doing what and where (at varying classifications) across the network, without having to off-board data wholesale as a standard procedure. This keeps baseline bandwidth demands low, and ensures that when a connected user specifically requests detailed data, there is sufficient capacity to pass it through the network along paths which have already been defined using the basic metadata. The RCO conducted flight trials with a hand-carried Nexus portal and a virtual communications hub application called Raven in 2021 on a Voyager tanker, and demonstrated the ability to pull data from satellite communications and a range of other sources into a common operating picture in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the creation of such a virtual data indexing and exchange medium is a significant step, it remains to be seen if it can be scaled up to meet the requirements of the whole force. It also does not by itself solve the problem of how to generate sufficiently low-latency real-time connectivity between joint force assets to enable third-party weapons cueing or guidance. Therefore, Nexus does not fill the same niche for the UK as NIFC-CA does for the US Navy or ABMS does for the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-vignette-1-sead-in-eastern-europe&quot;&gt;II. Vignette 1: SEAD in Eastern Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, the once-theoretical spectre of a confrontation with Russian conventional forces in Eastern Europe has gone from the highest-risk/lowest-likelihood scenario at the top of NATO threat estimates to an unavoidable priority for future force planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of the Russian aerospace forces’ fixed-wing and rotary assets during the initial two months of the war was notably poor – Russia failed to destroy the Ukrainian air force, or exert significant influence on the battles on the ground. This was, in large part, due to its inability to conduct effective suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD). Ukraine’s continued ability to operate its various mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems forced Russian aircraft to operate at very low altitude to take advantage of radar-horizon limitations and terrain for cover, but this left them vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) fire. The majority of combat air losses on both sides during the first phase of the war have been caused by SAMs and MANPADS – with the latter posing a threat precisely because the presence of the former forces both sides to operate at very low level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should prompt renewed prioritisation of SEAD/DEAD capability for NATO air forces, since at present only the US Air Force can field credible answers to the sorts of mobile SAM tactics used by both sides in Ukraine. Therefore, the first vignette in this paper examines where targeted investment in JADO-style capabilities within the UK’s joint force might add greatest benefit during a SEAD/DEAD operation against Russian forces in a geographically constrained flashpoint confrontation in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and its allies would face three primary operational challenges during any SEAD/DEAD operation. The first would be detecting, identifying, mapping and then targeting the key long-range sensors, SAM systems and command nodes which provide the overall coordination for an IADS and allow it to threaten assets at long ranges. The second would be detecting, suppressing and then destroying the more numerous medium- and short-range mobile SAM batteries and systems which move with enemy ground forces. 45 The third challenge would be achieving sufficient effect against these two categories of targets (and their crews) to enable air superiority to be achieved, without taking unacceptable attrition in airframes or running out of critical munitions in the process. Any enemy air superiority assets would also need to be tracked and engaged if they attempted to engage UK or allied SEAD/DEAD assets, although NATO proficiency in the offensive/defensive counter-air mission set is already sufficient to provide a level of overmatch against any likely aerial adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time pressure is also likely to be a major factor, since the UK and most other Western nations depend heavily on the firepower and ISR delivered by air forces to allow their relatively small ground and maritime forces to achieve success against enemies able to field greater mass and firepower. Therefore, there would be heavy time pressure to achieve SEAD/DEAD results so that close air support and airborne ISR aircraft could be used freely within the area of operations. To work out where the greatest benefits might be gained from investment to allow joint, cooperative real-time engagements in such an operation, it is first necessary to identify the critical sensor and shooter platforms across the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the potentially critical assets within the UK’s joint force are relatively easy to identify for any SEAD/DEAD campaign. For the first challenge of detecting, identifying and mapping the key long-range sensors and C2 nodes, standoff signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT) and radar-surveillance platforms – most obviously the RC-135W Airseeker and the new E-7A Wedgetail – would be critical in the run-up to any operation. However, once combat starts these aircraft would need to operate from beyond the reach of the long-range S-400 or S-300V4 SAM systems within a Russian IADS. This is because of their large signature, need to operate at high altitudes where long-range SAMs are most effective, and limited self-protection or evasion capabilities. Furthermore, many SIGINT and ELINT intercepts require significant processing and analysis before they can be fully exploited to help map an IADS and so incorporating an asset such as RC-135W into a JADC2-style real-time data sharing and targeting architecture might add only relatively marginal value compared to current processes. E-7A Wedgetail, by contrast, will be taking over from the E-3D Sentry as a key airborne battlespace management and C2 node within whatever new architectures are designed for combat air and joint forces use. As such, despite its likely position several hundred kilometres from the front lines during combat operations, it will remain a key communications relay and C2 node during active SEAD/DEAD operations, especially as a connective node between the air component and other elements of the force. Therefore, the E-7A is an example of where investing in radical improvements in the ability to exchange data in real time with forward sensors and long-range fires assets across all domains is likely to result in significant efficiency gains for the whole force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once combat operations begin, the most critical sensor nodes will be those that can detect, identify and track high-value enemy sensors, SAMs and C2 nodes from inside the threat range they pose. Obvious candidates within the UK’s current order of battle include the F-35B Lightning II and infiltrated special operations forces (SOF) teams. Both have the potential capability to get relatively close to threat systems covertly and can carry sophisticated sensors. The F-35’s sensor suite is particularly well suited to both hunting key nodes within an IADS and enabling more routine SEAD/DEAD efforts against mobile SAM systems in an ongoing campaign. This is because its sensors and software allow even a single aircraft to rapidly triangulate the position of a hostile SAM radar in flight more effectively than a whole flight of previous-generation ‘Wild Weasel’ F-16CJs with dedicated SEAD sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the F-35 and SOF teams have limited capabilities for direct kinetic attacks due to their relatively small numbers within the overall UK force structure, the need to husband limited munitions carriage capacity for key targets, and the need to avoid detection while deep in hostile territory. In other words, there is a significant mismatch between the ISTAR capabilities and the level of lethality which these assets can project into a hostile IADS when working alone. Therefore, in a SEAD/DEAD context, both F-35B and infiltrated SOF teams are likely to represent key UK sources of real-time situational awareness about key IADS targets, and also force elements whose lethality and survivability would be greatly increased by the ability to call in long-range firepower from other assets in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess which potential ‘shooters’ would bring the most benefit from JADC2-style connectivity with these forward sensors in a SEAD/DEAD operation, the first question is which platforms are likely to be able to deploy standoff weapons from sufficient range? Shooters must be able to threaten targets without unacceptable risk to sustainably leverage the situational awareness generated by the F-35Bs, SOF teams or other forward sensors for increased lethality. Within the UK joint force there are limited potential options, which makes prioritisation for investments in JADO-style cooperative engagement capabilities easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear candidate would be the guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) which currently provide the British Army’s long-range artillery firepower. GMLRS can fire rockets out to 70 km with submunition warheads that make each one lethal against lightly armoured vehicles across a spread pattern on impact. If the British Army’s GMLRS were equipped with such munitions, they would potentially be ideal for use against SAM batteries in the field. Furthermore, the UK has signalled its intention to procure the precision strike missile (PrSM) for its GMLRS launchers, which would provide a long-range precision strike capability of 499 km. PrSM has also been tested with a multi-mode seeker that would enable the missile to track and engage radars, which is expected to be included in the Spiral 1 upgrade of the missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other options could include Royal Navy surface or submerged vessels firing Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAMs), or RAF Typhoons with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. However, due to their high cost and consequently limited inventory capacity, large cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow and TLAMs are likely to be reserved for high-value targets during a SEAD/DEAD mission such as long-range target acquisition radars, command centres and command vehicles. Therefore, they might benefit from real-time target data from penetrating ISTAR assets during the initial phases of any campaign, but would be less critical during the later DEAD phases, where the primary targets are likely to be mobile medium- and short-range SAM batteries. Against these targets, less costly and shorter-ranged munitions would be needed for viable mass of fires to be achieved. Therefore, likely candidates would be RAF Typhoons with SPEAR 3 (if it were purchased for the Typhoon Force), conventional Army AS90 or other 155-mm artillery batteries within range of SAM systems near the enemy front lines, and possibly AH-64E Apache gunships equipped with Hellfire or JAGM missiles. The point is that potential priorities for investment if SEAD/DEAD is chosen as a policy-relevant mission can be identified relatively easily by assessing where lethality would be most significantly increased through tactical real-time sensor-shooter integration across domains, compared to more traditional joint operations integrated at the operational or campaign level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from increased lethality, another aspect to potentially consider is which platforms would benefit most in terms of survivability from JADC2-style connectivity during a SEAD/DEAD operation. This is more difficult to define than lethality enhancement, since the survivability of any given platform is based more on contextual factors, including the risk appetite of both the attacking and defending force and the tactics each employ. However, a basic starting point would be to note that in a SEAD/DEAD operation the assets that might see increased survivability from JADC2-style connectivity are those which will be expected to operate within the missile engagement zone (MEZ) of enemy SAM systems (and possibly aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the competition phase, before kinetic warfare begins, ISTAR assets conducting mapping of the IADS and airspace monitoring may well be operating within the MEZ of long-range enemy SAMs. The same may be true of tanker aircraft conducting aerial refuelling for both ISTAR and combat air patrol orbits close to adversary territory. If they perceive a direct conflict as inevitable or desirable, the adversary might attempt to open hostilities by conducting long-range SAM launches at these high-value enablers while they are within range. Given the lack of agility and limited self-defence options available to airliner-derived platforms, the ability to receive the earliest possible warning of hostile missile launches from any available sensor is critical to increasing their odds of survival. The Voyager MRTT in particular will be a key part of any air operation due to the critical nature of aerial refuelling capabilities for all fast jet and most ISTAR operations. Once shooting starts, tanker orbits will be pushed significantly further back from potential threats, which will keep them safer but means that each fuel offload grants less time on-mission for combat air assets. The centrality of the Voyager MRTT to almost all significant RAF air operations, and its consequent ubiquitous presence in the battlespace, is why it has already been chosen for airborne trials of the new Nexus common data platform and Raven communications node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the survivability of key assets such as the Voyager MRTT, the most valuable airborne connection in a SEAD context is likely to be the F-35, since its electro-optical/infra-red surveillance suite can detect, classify and track missile and rocket launchers from hundreds of kilometres away in any direction around the aircraft. Ground-based long-range missile defence radars such as the MPQ-65 and AN/TPY-2 used by allied Patriot and THAAD batteries could also provide advance warning to airborne assets of long-range SAM launches due to their high flight apexes and consequent similarity to ballistic missiles. As will be seen in Vignette 2, these missile defence assets are also likely to benefit in situational awareness terms from being linked via such enablers to forward air assets for their own mission sets. Orbital missile launch detection and tracking capabilities would also be a potentially useful source of launch warning information if they were able to process the signatures of long-range SAMs and relay warnings in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette is not intended to imply that SEAD/DEAD is necessarily one of the critical missions against which initial UK investments in enabling practical JADO-style capability should be judged. Rather, it is intended to illustrate that considering how the existing and projected force structure would need to be employed against a notional mission set can guide analysis towards the assets that would likely give the greatest return on investment in improved connectivity across domains. In the case of the SEAD/DEAD mission, even a superficial examination of the force structure suggests that necessarily limited early investment could deliver significant increases in combat effectiveness without needing to achieve whole force transformation along the lines of American JADO efforts. The UK has a small number of assets that could be tasked with covertly penetrating defended areas, and which can carry potent sensors, but have limited organic firepower. It also has a limited range of assets that can deploy long-range firepower capabilities but which are reliant on off-board targeting information to hit elusive targets from a safe distance in a high-intensity scenario. Therefore, connecting these two sets of capabilities would be a natural place to invest in delivering an initial real-time cross-domain connectivity programme for the UK if SEAD/DEAD is assessed as an important mission set. The survivability of critical enabler nodes, such as tankers, which lack organic self-defence and evasion capabilities, could also potentially be significantly enhanced by being connected to force elements able to provide early warning of enemy long-range missile launches. They would likely also be present in theatre anyway due to their key roles. Therefore, they might also make logical sense as a priority for early upgrades to enhance their real-time connectivity with other force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, a brief examination of the critical assets for a notional SEAD/DEAD campaign suggests that if this mission were chosen as a key planning task, the MoD could usefully prioritise initial MDI/JADO-style cross-domain connectivity investment towards penetrating assets, long-range precision fires capabilities and large enabler aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-vignette-2-integrated-air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;III. Vignette 2: Integrated Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette examines a notional scenario where the UK is required to provide an element of an IAMD capability for a European force that has been forward deployed to the Middle East in an uncertain political climate with an evolving insurgency led by a regional actor. Across current and future deployments of this type, the threat to British and allied troops deployed on the ground is likely to be increasingly significant and sophisticated. In any political environment where tolerance of casualty risk is limited, having a credible IAMD solution for forward deployed forces is likely to be increasingly essential for operational viability. However, providing IAMD to forward deployed forces is a complex challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat environment has developed considerably over the past decade due to the democratisation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and the proliferation of larger remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) that can be used as munitions in their own right and also to rapidly cue in long-range fires with precision. Whereas past forces would have to contend only with an opponent’s air force and incoming rocket artillery, a European force deployed anywhere in the world today will likely face threats from armed sUAS and RPAS, as were encountered by Russian forces deployed to Khmeimim Airbase in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex missile threats have also proliferated. Houthi attacks against critical national infrastructure in Saudi Arabia have often come from different directions simultaneously, and been conducted across a wide geographical area, forcing the available Saudi air defences to be dispersed, thus diminishing their efficacy. Iran itself has demonstrated the ability to conduct attacks against American bases; the 2020 ballistic missile strikes against the Al Asad air base in western Iraq are the most prominent demonstrations of this capability. Sixteen ballistic missiles were fired at the base in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, 11 of them – each carrying a 1,000-lb warhead – hit the base, causing extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the future threat environment for UK forces deployed to the region is likely to be characterised by a mix of massed sUAS and loitering munitions, as well as higher-end cruise and ballistic missiles, used together in such a way as to increase the complexity of the IAMD challenge. Given this, more traditional siloed deployments of air and missile defence systems, such as Phalanx-B to guard Camp Victory in Iraq from rockets, artillery and mortar rounds, or Patriot PAC-3 batteries to reduce the threat to Eastern European allies from short-range ballistic missiles in 2022, are likely to be insufficient. No one system can efficiently or effectively cover the threat spectrum adequately. It follows that enhancing the ability of UK systems to connect to a common recognised air picture, and the ability to link together and cross-cue different sensors and effectors for layered effects, is likely to offer the best means to increase combat effectiveness for IAMD coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge in any IAMD scenario remains the detection and tracking of incoming threats, and so protecting a UK deployment in the Middle East against the sorts of potential threats outlined would require the provision of persistent omni-directional air situational awareness across all the likely incoming threat altitudes, ranges and speed bands. This is an extremely difficult requirement to meet within the UK’s current order of battle, but in principle it requires the ability to combine the outputs from as many of the available ground-, maritime- and air-based radars and other sensors as possible into a common situational awareness picture. Obvious candidates within the existing force structure include the Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam radar that forms a core part of the British Army’s Sky Sabre medium-range air defence system, the Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar mounted on the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail AWACS aircraft, the Sampson radar on any Type 45 destroyers operating in littoral waters nearby, and the smaller radars carried by counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) solutions such as Drone Dome or ORCUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the IAMD threat encompasses such a broad range of target sizes, speeds and ranges means that operational effectiveness is likely to be disproportionately improved if systems optimised to cover different threat bands and altitudes can be linked together to create a combined situational awareness picture in real time. For threats coming in at close to ground level, sUAS and loitering munitions are likely to be a particularly challenging problem set, since these systems often have a low radar cross section and very small electro-optical/infra-red signature, and can travel extremely slowly. These properties, together with clutter from uneven ground, vegetation and buildings, make them particularly difficult to track and engage with traditional air defence radar systems. The UK has a limited ability to counter these threats in the form of its Drone Dome system procured from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in 2018, which is designed to target sUAS using soft-kill effects. Additionally, the RAF has developed the ORCUS C-UAS system with Leonardo, which also employs soft-kill effects to defeat sUAS, although only four are expected to be delivered. Complex threats such as cruise missiles and RPAS can be countered by the Army’s Sky Sabre, which provides a detection range of 120 km and an engagement range of 25 km. It is claimed to be capable of hitting a target the size of a tennis ball travelling at the speed of sound. Importantly, Sky Sabre is already capable of sharing data with Royal Navy and RAF assets in theatre via the Link 16 tactical datalink. Building on these foundations, an obvious priority candidate for investment in automated, real-time cross-domain connectivity in an IAMD context would be the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail. It not only carries a high-resolution MESA radar that can contribute a look-down view of low-flying targets at far greater ranges than land-based radars but is also the standard Link 16 network gateway that would already be expected to interface between airborne and ground-based IAMD assets to build a common recognised air picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ‘shooters’, the list of UK systems that can be considered for integration is currently quite short but in need of expansion to properly cover the wide range of potential threats. They include: Drone Dome and ORCUS for C-UAS effects; Starstreak and its vehicle-mounted high-velocity missile variant for short-range air defence; Sky Sabre for medium-range air defence; and the Royal Navy’s ship-borne CAMM short-range and Aster 15 and 30 medium-/long-range missiles as part of the Type 45 Destroyer’s Sea Viper air defence system. The ability to integrate high-end land-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 or THAAD fielded by allies and partner nations would significantly increase potential effectiveness from both a ‘shooter’ and a ‘sensor’ point of view. In addition, any IAMD C2 network must incorporate high-fidelity data about friendly and civilian air operations in the airspace in question. Without an accurate, common and comprehensive recognised air picture it is very challenging to manage IAMD engagements safely and effectively. This requirement for deconfliction is another reason why E-7A, as the single best ‘source of truth’ within the air component about the aerial battlespace, would be a high-gain priority for any efforts to enhance IAMD effectiveness through JADC2-style connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK already has a somewhat developed capability that can be used to integrate sensors and effectors from multiple domains into a single IAMD. The SkyKeeper system from Lockheed Martin UK has been developed and refined to meet the Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) capability requirement. A contract for its upgrade and service life extension was awarded in January 2022, which will improve the capabilities of the truck-mounted system and extend its service life to 2029. SkyKeeper can integrate C-UAS, counter-rocket and mortar (C-RAM) and conventional air defence assets into a single recognised air picture for the operators of each system. In the future, the system is claimed to have significant growth potential for use as a battlespace C2 network, which would allow incoming threats to be identified and then allocated to the most suitable of a potentially wide variety of shooters such as C-RAM, Sky Sabre or C-UAS effectors. The current SkyKeeper version unveiled in 2019 can receive data feeds from most sensors and transmit target tracking data using common data links such as Link 16 from air assets and Link 11 from naval assets. Lockheed Martin UK also claims that it can integrate the wide-area sense and detect sights of Ajax into the system, and can also integrate data from the F-35 Lightning II into the network if required. This would be a significant expansion of the current LEAPP requirement set, but illustrates that there are already networking solutions in place with UK forces that could potentially be used as building blocks for increasing the real-time integration of sensors and potentially shooters from across the joint force in an IAMD context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vital importance of a high-fidelity common recognised air picture, and the multifaceted nature of the potential threats ranging from sUAS to salvoes of ballistic and cruise missiles that might face UK forces deployed in the Middle East make the priorities clear for early investments in JADC2-style cross-domain connectivity if IAMD is identified as a priority mission set for the future joint force. Significant increases in effectiveness and operational flexibility could be expected if existing network and C2 capabilities such as LEAPP that currently focus on connecting systems in a single domain could be expanded or linked to allow routine real-time data exchange with airborne sensor nodes such as the E-7A Wedgetail, F-35 and Crowsnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, enabling full-spectrum IAMD coverage in a theatre as complex as the Middle East with capabilities currently in the UK inventory is unlikely to be possible. Seamless data sharing with allied ground-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 and THAAD, as well as E-3A/F/G AWACS, would be necessary for deconfliction purposes but would also be a high priority due to the potential improvements to mutual sensor and shooter coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-vignette-3-contested-freedom-of-navigation-operations&quot;&gt;IV. Vignette 3: Contested Freedom of Navigation Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy conducted a potentially opposed FONOP in June 2021 when HMS Defender sailed close to the Russian-occupied territory of Crimea in the Black Sea. During this operation, Defender was harassed by Russian attack aircraft and gunboats and locked up by shore-based radar systems. The Royal Navy has also conducted FONOPs in the South China Sea close to artificial reefs built by the People’s Liberation Army Navy to create illegal bastions of territory claims and area-denial system coverage. The US Navy frequently conducts FONOPs, and they are seen by many NATO nations as a crucial politico-military tool to assert rights of access to the global commons against aggressive attempts to change borders or interdict sea lines of communication (SLOCs) by force. With Russia committed to long-term confrontation with the West following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and China continuing its policies of attempting to change the status quo in both the South and East China seas, FONOPs are likely to remain an important tool for Western policymakers in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the continuing development and proliferation of highly capable anti-ship missiles, submarines and more novel potential threats, such as swarms of sUAS and loitering munitions, will all ensure that even major surface action groups will face considerable danger during contested FONOPs at times of heightened tension. The US Navy’s NIFC-CA architecture was developed precisely to enhance the survivability and lethality of naval task forces against high-end threats in a warfighting context by greatly improving the situational awareness and weapon effectiveness of the destroyers and aircraft against incoming threats. At a less ambitious scale, it is worth examining where similar automated C2 and data-sharing functions between platforms would add most value for the UK in the context of FONOPs to defend access to contested SLOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to the preparatory stages of a SEAD/DEAD campaign, the first challenge in reducing the risk to a planned FONOP would be to try to detect, identify and then track the locations of the primary anti-ship threats in the contested maritime area. These will generally comprise coastal defence cruise missiles and the ground-based and possibly airborne radars that provide them with target information, as well as, potentially, missile-carrying small-boat swarms, sUAS and in the case of larger powers possibly aircraft and submarines. The nature of the threat in each geographic context will determine the scope and feasibility of mitigation and (if necessary) defence or deterrence measures to ensure a FONOP can be conducted successfully. However, in all cases a thorough understanding of enemy force dispositions and capabilities will be essential. Without such an understanding it is impossible to adequately protect a vessel conducting FONOPs during periods of high tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge will be to ensure that the ship or task group is provided with as many credible defence and/or retaliatory options as possible to deter hostile action by denial and/or punishment respectively. The third will be ensuring adequate connectivity between the ship conducting the FONOP, any supporting assets, and higher command levels who can provide rapid guidance on changing political circumstances, rules of engagement or orders throughout the period of vulnerability. This may be very difficult given that an adversary is likely to make liberal use of electronic warfare to interfere with the sensors and communications of the ship and any supporting elements, as such actions signal displeasure and create windows of kinetic vulnerability without the escalation implications of kinetic force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence collection assets being used to ascertain the localised threat nature and location of key adversary capabilities are unlikely to be a major priority for integration if they will be conducting their missions well in advance of the FONOP in question. By its nature, the side conducting a FONOP generally has a significant degree of control over the timing of the passage through the contested waterway. Therefore, increasing the ability to pull information off ISR assets in real time through greatly increased connectivity is unlikely to provide more than a marginal increase in the efficiency of such preparatory activity compared to current practices. On the other hand, on the day of the FONOP itself, as the ship(s) in question sail towards the contested area, the ability to provide real-time connectivity between supporting ISR assets and the surface action group could add significant value. ISR assets such as P-8 Poseidon or RC-135W Rivet Joint may be able to detect any changes in the movement patterns and electronic emissions of adversary ground-based and maritime threat systems which could signal intent to conduct an attack. The faster this information can be relayed to the task group, the more effective any defensive and/or retaliatory measures can be made, and the greater the deterrent effect on an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the FONOP transit itself, the ship’s onboard radar systems would provide the primary source of defensive situational awareness, alongside the sensors of any embarked aviation – such as the MX15 sensor ball and SeaSpray AESA radar mounted on the Royal Navy’s Wildcat HMA.2 helicopters. The outputs from these sensors are theoretically already supposed to be well integrated via the Merlin Mk2 Crowsnest system which (if present) would also provide another source of wide area radar surveillance to spot incoming threats. These systems should, on their own, provide excellent radar coverage of both the aerial and surface threat picture during the hours of the transit itself. However, the interception of incoming missile threats would still rely on the radar picture from the ship’s own sensors, which restricts the range at which such engagements can be conducted against sea-skimming threats. Sufficiently high-resolution/low-latency data sharing between airborne sensors (including F-35B, if in theatre) and the Type 45 to enable third-party missile guidance for Aster 30 could enable the ship to engage incoming threats beyond the radar horizon of its own sensor coverage. Against supersonic or hypersonic threats this would significantly enhance the odds of a successful defensive engagement and might also allow the launcher to be targeted rapidly with naval gunfire or TLAMs to prevent further hostile launches. This is precisely what NIFC-CA allows for the US Navy. However, the Royal Navy lacks a long-range missile capability comparable to the US SM-3 and SM-6 series, and aside from the F-35B’s radar, the available airborne radars, which include Crowsnest and SeaSpray, may lack the technical capacity to provide missile guidance even if furnished with a sufficiently advanced ability to share data with both ship and missile in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, NIFC-CA or JADC2-style connectivity with airborne assets with high-end sensors offers the opportunity to enhance the guidance quality and effective range against sea-skimming or surface threats for the missiles carried by Royal Navy ships during a contested FONOP. This would not only offer the potential for lower risk against a given threat but also lower the political escalation risk during an actual engagement – since the number of munitions fired can prove the symbolic difference between a skirmish and a major confrontation at the geopolitical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of both the precision and need for any retaliatory strikes against shore-based or maritime attackers. From an escalation-control point of view, the ability to intercept incoming threats is preferable to needing to go after the enemy launch site/vehicle, if possible, but where the latter is desirable or necessary, it is better to use fewer missiles to accomplish the task. Therefore, there are potential efficiencies to be gained from investment in JADC2-style connectivity for the likely force package the UK might deploy for a contested FONOP. However, they are marginal compared to the potentially dramatic combat effectiveness gains identified if initial investment were focused on priority areas in the context of an IAMD or SEAD/DEAD mission set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is intended to illustrate that a mission-facing approach could help UK policymakers identify the most relevant and potentially easiest capabilities across the force to concentrate on integrating in the early tranches of necessarily sequential MDI/JADO-type transformation efforts. Currently, there is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK’s Joint Concept Note 1/20 makes clear that the MoD is committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm. However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions within stretched budgets and limited programme management capacity. Even ambitious transformation projects have to start somewhere, and well-targeted initial investments in integrating a limited number of key capabilities across the domains could deliver significant enhancements to whole-force combat effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy’s approach, with its NIFC-CA programme model, offers a potentially useful model for the UK to pursue JADC2-type connectivity across the force in more manageable and easily defined blocks. Rather than attempting root-and-branch change across the whole force simultaneously, the US Navy created an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting the core platforms essential to a given mission, and then building on the progress made once initial investment had yielded real-world results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the lessons are clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MoD, and Strategic Command as the integrating authority, need to prioritise early investment in real-time data sharing and combined C2 capabilities between the platforms and systems likely to deliver the greatest improvement in combat effectiveness for the force in specific key mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mission-specific analysis can be used to identify which force elements would make most sense to concentrate early investment tranches on, by providing a framework through which to examine if and where advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities between specific platforms would add the most tangible value in an operational context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, even a superficial analysis of kinetic mission sets such as the ones provided in this paper suggests that enhanced data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities linking key sensor assets, such as F-35, E-7A and SOF teams, with long-range precision fires and IAMD capabilities like GMLRS and Type 45, could greatly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that analysis of some mission sets may suggest that for many force elements the potential combat effectiveness gains from currently deliverable JADC2-style integration would offer significantly less in terms of return on investment in the near term than other options for that funding. This should not be seen as a bad thing since careful prioritisation is undoubtedly necessary across defence, given limited budgets, personnel headroom and programme management capacity. Therefore, choosing which assets across the joint force do not yet need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing network and automated C2 solution is perhaps just as important as identifying what assets ought to be connected with all possible speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of defence may eventually include something akin to the vision laid out in Joint Concept Note 1/20 and other top-level strategy documents; a completely connected joint force, fully integrated in real-time not only across all domains but also across government departments. However, there is a huge gulf between this ambition and the current state of the joint force. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in MDI/JADO-type capabilities will need to be incremental and focus on seamlessly connecting and integrating the assets that will see the greatest combat effectiveness increase from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the existing commentary focuses on how or when a Chinese attack on Taiwan could occur, but there is little discussion of the nonmilitary consequences of such a scenario for China and the world. This brief explores the implications of a Chinese attack on Taiwan based on reasonable, albeit speculative, assumptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When considered more holistically, the implications of an attack on Taiwan would be grim for Beijing, even if Chinese forces “successfully” capture the island. China would probably be diplomatically and economically isolated from key advanced economies, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping would have to tread a narrow path to avoid dire consequences for China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a whole. This analysis helps clarify what could be at stake for the world and reaffirms the importance of deterring Beijing from contemplating such an attack on Taiwan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation has increased over the past several years that Beijing is accelerating plans for an invasion of Taiwan. While there is little doubt that Beijing seeks to fully annex Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) one day, questions remain about the timing and methods that China might use to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons Beijing might undertake a military campaign against Taiwan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-standing territorial and national identity aspirations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi’s own personal ambitions and sense of legacy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addressing a perceived threat to its own security stemming from deepening U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to perceived provocations from Taiwan, specifically a formal declaration of de jure and permanent independence from the PRC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of commentary and analysis has explored how the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might undertake a military campaign to annex Taiwan, a critical — yet underemphasized — question remains regarding the types and magnitudes of costs Beijing would pay for such actions. Nearly all discussions of China’s potential invasion of Taiwan ignore the economic and diplomatic costs of such a move, make unrealistic assumptions about what China could achieve (including technological and economic gains), or otherwise minimize the challenges that China would face if an invasion of Taiwan were successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below analysis is an initial exploration into some of these potential nonmilitary consequences for China. It does not seek to prove or disprove Beijing’s true intentions and timelines toward Taiwan, nor does it claim to know how Chinese leader Xi Jinping is assessing the risks and rewards of an invasion. Rather, it highlights costs that Beijing would likely face if it successfully invaded Taiwan, based on plausible assumptions of how China, Taiwan, the United States, the international community, and global investors would react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this brief looks at three distinct phases of a possible Chinese attack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period leading up to an attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period between the initial phase of an attack and the end of major conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period following a successful PLA invasion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the analysis focused on how a successful invasion by the PLA would impact China’s economic, diplomatic, and political circumstances, this brief intentionally remains nonspecific about the type of attack or invasion it might launch. At a minimum, this analysis assumes that it would include the direct use of lethal force by the PLA’s air, land, and sea capabilities to defeat and subdue Taiwan’s military and to depose the civilian political leadership on the island. It also assumes that the U.S. military would intervene, but its actions would be limited and ultimately unsuccessful in halting the Chinese invasion. And it further assumes that no nuclear weapons would be used. Such assumptions are not predictions of actual outcomes, but rather necessary simplifications adopted so this brief can focus on the issue of costs associated with a relatively smooth path to military victory for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conflict in and around Taiwan would entail major economic, financial, diplomatic, and reputational costs for Beijing, both directly and indirectly. Even if China “won” in the military domain and thus accrued additional regional military benefits, its economic and diplomatic position would likely be substantially worse off. Simply put, China would have gained Taiwan but sacrificed its larger ambition of becoming a global and comprehensive superpower. This is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even absent U.S. intervention, any conflict initiated by the PRC would have immediate and dramatically negative effects on China’s ability to import and export goods, on its domestic financial markets, on business sentiment, and on the exchange rate of its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s costs would significantly increase if the U.S. military intervenes meaningfully, even if delayed by several days or even weeks. The blunt geographic truth for China is that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would occur directly off the shore of its most economically important and populated provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even supposing Chinese troops could overcome Taiwan’s defenses, they would then occupy an island inhabited by a hostile population with a shattered local economy, including its semiconductor sector, while China itself would face severe economic and diplomatic repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is necessarily speculative and requires many assumptions. Perhaps the most important ones are that Taiwan offers at least some resistance and that U.S. leadership can effectively organize some semblance of an anti-China coalition among advanced economies. In addition, forecasting the effects of major discontinuities requires considerations for societies’ potential reactions under stress rather than under normal conditions. History suggests that major crises can trigger or inspire rapid shifts in consensuses based on reevaluations of national, political, or cultural priorities that can supersede economic logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has compelling strategic reasons for deterring China from attacking Taiwan. This exercise is not intended to suggest that losing Taiwan to the PRC would be a positive outcome for Washington. Rather, the key point is that even in this dire scenario, China would still likely be the country that most suffers diplomatically and economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the effects of such a conflict with any precision is extremely difficult, in part because there is no analogous historical case upon which to draw. The world’s two largest economies might be at war with each other. Global supply chains are far more integrated now than before World War II — or even World War I, which ended the first era of globalization. The disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war are not a good proxy because Russia’s economy is far smaller than China’s, the conflict and Western response have not stopped key Russian exports, and Western powers are not directly engaged in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this brief concludes that the implications of a PRC attack on Taiwan would be cataclysmic for China, the United States, and the world. Simply put, any attempt to achieve “reunification” through force is likely to fracture global geopolitics and economies far beyond today’s “partial decoupling” trends and preclude any long-term “national rejuvenation” for China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-one-pending-chinese-attack-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;Phase One: Pending Chinese Attack on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing’s preparation for an attack on Taiwan would likely alert foreign governments and investors to the impending conflict, but the signals would not be entirely clear.&lt;/strong&gt; These actions would include measures to mobilize its forces, insulate its economy and financial system, ready its population, and prepare the diplomatic space for a conflict that Chinese leaders might assume will entail enormous costs for the Chinese Communist Party. While Beijing would strive to obscure its intentions in some scenarios, the required military, economic, and political preparations would be at least partially detectable to the international community. Such observable signals might include stockpiling of munitions, a freeze on military demobilizations, and an intensification of bellicose propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States would warn of China’s military intentions, hoping to rally allies and deter Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of such warnings would depend on the strength of U.S. leadership, the state of Washington’s diplomatic relations with third countries, and the credibility of U.S. intelligence. Beijing would likely proceed toward an attack in a manner that clouds or frustrates U.S. efforts to assign blame to China, such as by claiming that Taiwan provoked Beijing by crossing red lines or even that Taiwan’s military attacked Chinese territory or a Chinese asset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some U.S. allies and partners would join Washington in warning of Beijing’s intentions.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. allies — most likely including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom — would coordinate planning for steps that could deter China. However, even among allies, the bar for assuming an attack on Taiwan is imminent would be high. The intensity of allied responses would thus largely depend on the credibility of U.S. intelligence, the strength of U.S. government statements and actions, and Taiwan’s own demonstrations that it took the threat seriously. This would include military preparations and the threat — or perhaps use of — economic sanctions on China to deter military action. On the other hand, the United States and its allies would be wary of acting too drastically, which might escalate the crisis, including by triggering responses from Beijing, precluding off-ramps for China, or damaging the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other governments would be slow to respond.&lt;/strong&gt; Some might believe Beijing’s actions are mere saber rattling, as some Western governments did ahead of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine despite clear warnings from Washington. Some leaders would hesitate because they want to avoid taking disruptive emergency measures not yet seen as justified by their uncertain or oblivious polities. Other leaders would try to avoid committing themselves to either side in a conflict. Behind the scenes, Beijing would likely be using all its diplomatic channels to pressure third countries to remain on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International firms and investors would need to make important early decisions in an environment of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial markets would be the first to respond, with strong downward pressure on Chinese assets and the renminbi’s exchange rate. Many foreign investors would assume the crisis will harm business sentiment in China and, even if resolved, at least incrementally slow the economy. Direct investors would be slower to respond than portfolio investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Beijing’s true intentions, including the scope and scale of a possible attack, would not yet be entirely clear, many firms operating in China, Taiwan, or the broader region would adopt a “wait and see” approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Global headquarters would be looking to in-country staff for information and updates — though even staff in China and Taiwan would be struggling to interpret events. Because the costs of shifting supply chains or divesting from China could be substantial, many companies would delay making drastic decisions in the hope that a crisis never materializes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Beijing would likely impose emergency economic measures such as even stronger capital controls, selling Chinese assets abroad, stockpiling emergency supplies, suspending critical exports, rationing key imported goods, or restricting foreign travel. Early resistance by Taiwan’s military would compel China to take economically disruptive measures to protect its military assets in its eastern provinces and population centers from air or missile attacks from Taiwan or U.S. forces. Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-one-pending-chinese-attack-on-taiwan-1&quot;&gt;Phase One: Pending Chinese Attack on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing’s preparation for an attack on Taiwan would likely alert foreign governments and investors to the impending conflict, but the signals would not be entirely clear.&lt;/strong&gt; These actions would include measures to mobilize its forces, insulate its economy and financial system, ready its population, and prepare the diplomatic space for a conflict that Chinese leaders might assume will entail enormous costs for the Chinese Communist Party. While Beijing would strive to obscure its intentions in some scenarios, the required military, economic, and political preparations would be at least partially detectable to the international community. Such observable signals might include stockpiling of munitions, a freeze on military demobilizations, and an intensification of bellicose propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States would warn of China’s military intentions, hoping to rally allies and deter Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of such warnings would depend on the strength of U.S. leadership, the state of Washington’s diplomatic relations with third countries, and the credibility of U.S. intelligence. Beijing would likely proceed toward an attack in a manner that clouds or frustrates U.S. efforts to assign blame to China, such as by claiming that Taiwan provoked Beijing by crossing red lines or even that Taiwan’s military attacked Chinese territory or a Chinese asset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some U.S. allies and partners would join Washington in warning of Beijing’s intentions.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. allies — most likely including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom — would coordinate planning for steps that could deter China. However, even among allies, the bar for assuming an attack on Taiwan is imminent would be high. The intensity of allied responses would thus largely depend on the credibility of U.S. intelligence, the strength of U.S. government statements and actions, and Taiwan’s own demonstrations that it took the threat seriously. This would include military preparations and the threat — or perhaps use of — economic sanctions on China to deter military action. On the other hand, the United States and its allies would be wary of acting too drastically, which might escalate the crisis, including by triggering responses from Beijing, precluding off-ramps for China, or damaging the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other governments would be slow to respond.&lt;/strong&gt; Some might believe Beijing’s actions are mere saber rattling, as some Western governments did ahead of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine despite clear warnings from Washington. Some leaders would hesitate because they want to avoid taking disruptive emergency measures not yet seen as justified by their uncertain or oblivious polities. Other leaders would try to avoid committing themselves to either side in a conflict. Behind the scenes, Beijing would likely be using all its diplomatic channels to pressure third countries to remain on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International firms and investors would need to make important early decisions in an environment of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial markets would be the first to respond, with strong downward pressure on Chinese assets and the renminbi’s exchange rate. Many foreign investors would assume the crisis will harm business sentiment in China and, even if resolved, at least incrementally slow the economy. Direct investors would be slower to respond than portfolio investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Beijing’s true intentions, including the scope and scale of a possible attack, would not yet be entirely clear, many firms operating in China, Taiwan, or the broader region would adopt a “wait and see” approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Global headquarters would be looking to in-country staff for information and updates — though even staff in China and Taiwan would be struggling to interpret events. Because the costs of shifting supply chains or divesting from China could be substantial, many companies would delay making drastic decisions in the hope that a crisis never materializes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict-1&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Beijing would likely impose emergency economic measures such as even stronger capital controls, selling Chinese assets abroad, stockpiling emergency supplies, suspending critical exports, rationing key imported goods, or restricting foreign travel. Early resistance by Taiwan’s military would compel China to take economically disruptive measures to protect its military assets in its eastern provinces and population centers from air or missile attacks from Taiwan or U.S. forces. Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two most important determinants of the war’s intensity and duration — and thus economic impact — would be the degree to which Taiwan resists and whether the United States is engaged militarily. Neither condition is certain, but both are probable.&lt;/strong&gt; To assume Taiwan would not resist, one must have a bleak view of Taiwan’s civil society. To assume the United States would not engage militarily, one needs to at least assume that Beijing’s military operations would be extremely effective and quick while also not targeting U.S. forces in the region. Beijing would have an official pretense for any military action, but unless Taiwan took reckless actions, such as declaring independence, it is unlikely that leaders in Washington and other Western capitals would find them convincing. In the early days of the conflict, global firms and investors would assume that U.S. military intervention and general escalation pose high risks, absent extremely unlikely statements by Washington that explicitly disavow Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimated that a year-long war between the United States and China would reduce China’s GDP by 25–35 percent and U.S. GDP by 5–10 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; However, the study did not examine the implications for global supply chains or estimate effects from sanctions, infrastructure damage, or cyberattacks. Given China’s subsequent economic growth, the economic damage ratios now are probably somewhat more in China’s favor, but the overall costs (considering all factors) could be considerably higher. A war would have an immediate impact on the three Chinese provinces nearest to Taiwan — Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang — which together account for 22 percent of China’s GDP and 17 percent of its population. Damage would not be limited to coastal provinces, however, because interior provinces are part of an intricate network of domestic supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most maritime trade and air freight within range of the war zone would be disrupted.&lt;/strong&gt; International shipping and logistics firms would try to reroute traffic around the conflict zone and would avoid entering ports in or near Taiwan. Shipping insurance premiums would surge. Chinese ports accounted for roughly 40 percent of shipping volume among the world’s 100 largest ports in 2020; six of China’s largest ports are near Taiwan and would likely be directly impacted by a Chinese attack. Nearly half of the global container fleet and five-sixths of the largest ships transit through the Taiwan Strait, most of which would be rerouted. A complete disruption of China’s trade would reduce global trade in added value by $2.6 trillion, or 3 percent of world GDP — and this figure, based on peacetime valuations of global supply chains, only captures the first-order effect on trade. In the short term, however, existing inventories of goods or supplies would mitigate the effect on global firms and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even in the early stages of a conflict, multinational corporations (MNCs) would face significant pressure to begin unwinding operations in China.&lt;/strong&gt; Managers’ foremost consideration in the hours and days after a Chinese attack would be employee safety, and many foreign MNCs would seek to exfiltrate foreign passport holders. Companies operating near the eastern coastline would likely halt operations even if they encounter no supply chain disruptions. MNCs exporting from or sourcing parts from China might try to shift production or inputs to other locations, although this would be expensive, and there would be competition from other firms doing the same thing with limited alternative capacity. MNCs operating in China for access to its domestic market would be the least likely to try to pull out because direct investments, such as factories and retail locations, are difficult to liquidate in a crisis. Such firms might conclude that even in dire scenarios, the Chinese market would still be enormous — at least after the conflict. However, they would fear the appropriation of their assets by Chinese authorities and the reputational costs in other markets if they remain in a China hostile to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would face significant capital-flight pressures and a massive selloff of Chinese assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese citizens, companies, and investors — as well as foreign firms — would seek to jump the queue and avoid having their international capital ensnared by Western sanctions. While China already maintains stringent capital controls, the central bank would likely issue additional unofficial “window guidance” to China’s major state banks, directing them to halt outgoing transfers. Unofficial and illicit channels exist for motivated parties, but they are relatively narrow owing to regulators’ efforts to diminish their effectiveness. In addition to selling off onshore Chinese stocks, many investors would also dump their holdings of Chinese stocks listed on overseas exchanges. The exchange rate of the onshore and offshore renminbi would plunge, necessitating heavy interventions by the central bank to arrest the slide. As during other periods of heightened risk, global investors would flee to assets perceived as safe, especially U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would impose at least some economic sanctions on China in any scenario. But if U.S. forces were engaged, the sanctions would be severe, and Washington would probably coordinate with — or even compel — major allies to join such sanctions. U.S. politicians and the public would likely not tolerate continued direct trade or investment with China if U.S. forces suffer even a low number of casualties fighting Chinese forces, although indirect economic linkages would remain. Financial sanctions on major Chinese banks would have a devastating economic impact, including for U.S. firms and consumers. The expected costs of such actions suggest they would only be used in full once a conflict breaks out and the United States becomes militarily involved. If U.S. personnel start dying and the public sees bloody images of China’s attack on Taiwan, Western sentiment would likely turn swiftly and decidedly against China. A Western sanctions coalition could coalesce quickly, as happened after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in part because of lessons learned and coordination mechanisms established in response to the sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major U.S. allies, even if not engaged militarily, would likely support Washington’s efforts to punish China economically.&lt;/strong&gt; While China’s market and supply chains are critical for many international firms, overall, the United States is even more important as a consumer market, investment destination, and financial market. The European Union’s — even just Germany’s — economic and financial ties to the United States are far deeper than those with China. Perhaps more importantly, Europe’s political, cultural, and security ties with the United States would present European leaders with a binary choice they might otherwise hope to avoid. Washington would exert significant pressure on its allies to join its sanctions efforts; if the United States were engaged militarily, those requests might become ultimatums, which Western leaders would need to weigh against the expectation that China’s economic growth and liberalization has peaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;EU Economic Ties to the United States Are Deeper Than to China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s economy would be shattered and cut off from most trade, losing the ability to export the majority of the world’s semiconductors and microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Much of its infrastructure would be damaged during combat or from sabotage by local actors, and Taiwan’s ports would be well within the combat zone. This would halt Taiwan’s microchip exports, of which roughly 60 percent go to China as inputs into electronics that are then exported to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global supply chains for consumer electronics would be particularly damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s exports of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, have accounted for nearly 40 percent of the global total since 2014. Because of shipping disruptions and possible suspensions of trade with advanced economies, China’s domestically produced microchips would also probably not be exported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-three-the-world-after&quot;&gt;Phase Three: The World After&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if the PLA were successful in seizing and holding Taiwan, Beijing would still face enormous economic, diplomatic, and political challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; The only plausible pathway to mitigating these challenges would be for China’s military operations in Taiwan to be quick (to shorten the window Washington has to respond) and clean (to minimize fighting and damage, including civilian casualties in Taiwan), as well as avoid triggering an international backlash, particularly from advanced economies. More realistically, an attack on Taiwan — even a successful one — would result in some level of U.S. military involvement, a direct response from Taiwan’s military and people, and international outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/83OVRSJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would occupy a new but significantly damaged and isolated “special administrative region,” which would face a severe economic contraction and be expensive to subdue, police, and rebuild.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese military and security forces would contend with a restive population, even assuming local resistance is not prolonged. Reconstruction costs would be high and absorb much of Taiwan’s remaining fiscal capacity. The public on the mainland might object to spending Chinese resources to occupy and rebuild Taiwan, given that the island is nominally more developed than most of the mainland and its people are considered hostile. Chinese leaders probably would have planned for the post-war environment based on optimistic assumptions, in part because experts and planners would have been reluctant to suggest that Taiwan’s population is sincerely opposed to “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), would be severely damaged and unable to resume production of cutting-edge microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming TSMC is not affected during combat or destroyed by saboteurs, its seizure by Chinese forces would only give China a snapshot of its technology in an otherwise fast-moving global industry. Beijing would also need to coopt or compel TSMC’s employees to continue working for the firm. Furthermore, TSMC relies on foreign inputs, including for chip designs and chip-manufacturing equipment. The governments of key advanced economies would likely impose export controls on those inputs, even if this means losing access to leading-edge fabrication capabilities. Foreign firms reliant on TSMC for production would no longer consider its Taiwan facilities reliable even after reconstruction. However, TSMC’s overseas assets might continue operating, assisted by TSMC staff who escape Taiwan and perhaps after being acquired by other firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economic and diplomatic relations with advanced economies would significantly deteriorate.&lt;/strong&gt; Western sanctions and export controls on China would probably persist for months or perhaps years after a conflict, even if U.S. military forces are defeated. In Washington, Tokyo, and some European capitals, there would be little to no political appetite to resume normal economic relations with a belligerent China. Both sides would suffer, but China would suffer more. In 2021, the Group of Seven (G7) economies — a reasonable proxy for the U.S. alliance network — had a collective GDP 65 percent larger than China’s, even at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates favorable to China, and directly absorbed 41 percent of China’s exports. China has little prospect of eliminating its key external economic dependences — technology, commodities, and the U.S. dollar — in the medium term. After a conflict, China would largely maintain access to commodities from emerging markets and developing countries. However, China would struggle to overcome technology export controls and sanctions based on the global dollar network, upon which its remaining trading partners would also remain reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s periphery would become increasingly hostile.&lt;/strong&gt; Any Chinese attack on Taiwan would provoke significant anxiety among China’s neighbors. If the United States were perceived to have intervened aggressively, even if ultimately unsuccessfully, U.S. credibility as a security partner would largely remain intact, if somewhat bruised. On the other hand, if U.S. intervention were seen as halfhearted, countries might put less stock in Washington as a security guarantor, and some might develop their own capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter China. Either way, China’s aggression would likely galvanize a surge in military spending and pronounced bandwagoning against Beijing by Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India, but also Vietnam and the Philippines. Most other emerging markets or developing countries, however, would probably try to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annexing Taiwan would likely give Xi Jinping an initial bump in public approval, but the mounting costs of “state-building” would erode overall domestic confidence in the CCP.&lt;/strong&gt; Propaganda organs would seek to contain criticisms of the invasion, but the proximity of the conflict would make it difficult to obscure the likely military casualties. Such efforts would be further undermined by the vast network of overseas Chinese nationals with unfettered access to information on the invasion’s course and consequences. Beijing would probably feel forced to use terror and repression to subdue pockets of resistance (real or imagined) in Taiwan, and reports of such atrocities would inevitably filter through to the mainland population. An invasion of Taiwan and the associated occupation phase would also distract Beijing from addressing China’s pressing domestic agenda and economic headwinds. To take control of the narrative and tamp down on any domestic unrest (again, real or imagined), the CCP would feel compelled to flex all its coercive muscles, and thus China would enter a new and more protracted phase of its police state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economy would be on a wartime footing, and its hope of achieving high-income status would be severely diminished.&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing would struggle with China’s overburdened fiscal system and state-sector debts amid capital outflows — and could face a systemic financial crisis. MNCs would expect Western sanctions and export controls to persist, while also forecasting far less potential from the Chinese market, and thus would generally maintain lower exposure to China. Foreign MNCs operating in China would fear asset nationalization, and even MNCs who want to remain or reinvest in China would face a Chinese government that scrutinizes companies representing “hostile” Western countries. China’s outbound investments and lending would be constrained. Amid draconian capital controls and a loss of foreign investor confidence in China’s trajectory and reforms, the renminbi would not substantially internationalize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this initial exercise is to sketch out some of the likely responses to a Chinese attack on Taiwan and the associated political, economic, diplomatic, and strategic consequences Beijing would face. The conclusion reached is stark: China would court disaster if it launched an invasion across the Taiwan Strait. Even under optimistic assumptions about the combat performance of the PLA and the relatively muted or constrained military responses by Taiwan and the United States, there is a precariously narrow path Xi Jinping would need to follow to emerge from the gambit unscathed. Once more realistic assumptions begin to be layered in, the picture becomes dire for the CCP and China as a whole. Equally as significant, any Chinese attack on Taiwan would also have an extraordinary impact on the global economy, especially for U.S. partners and allies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strategic challenge for the United States remains to ensure Beijing never actively contemplates an attack on Taiwan. While it is likely Beijing broadly understands the costs associated with such an action, the increasing isolation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the concomitant rise in groupthink in Beijing’s policymaking circles means that one cannot assume Chinese leaders will continue to conduct a sound cost-benefit analysis. It thus remains critical to find direct and clear ways to communicate to Xi Jinping the costs he would face for undertaking any attack on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing lessons from the Cold War, the author distills six principles to guide crisis management among U.S. policymakers navigating an increasingly crisis-prone U.S.-China relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With U.S.-China relations already headed toward a more belligerent rivalry, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 was bound to cause heartburn in Beijing. China responded with an elaborate show of force around the island: shooting missiles over Taiwan and into Japanese exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters, firing rocket artillery into the Taiwan Strait, declaring a ring of maritime exclusion zones around Taiwan, and surging over 200 military aircraft and 50 ships into Taiwanese airspace and waters. Many now refer to the event as the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet compared to previous confrontations around Taiwan, the United States this time failed to play much of its appointed part. The Biden administration mostly stayed aloof, condemning China’s actions but not dispatching U.S. forces to confront China directly. If there was a crisis, it was largely one-sided, with China posturing and slinging missiles and the United States watching from the sidelines. The resulting U.S. coolness left China thrashing in a performative display that produced condemnations from Japan, Australia, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This U.S. strategy might have been quietly brilliant, inviting China to stamp and roar and drive many countries further into a balancing coalition. The administration may have decided that a belligerent response would have been inappropriate given that it had been the action of a U.S. official that had sparked the crisis. But it remains to be seen if restraint was the right choice. The crisis arguably furnished China with an ability to set a new threshold for military intimidation in the strait and beyond. Some observers worried that U.S. moderation would encourage China to escalate its coercion in the future, a concern fueled in part by commentary in China that seemed to brag about the absence of a more forceful U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing seems clear: an era of persistent confrontations in U.S.-China relations has arrived. The escalating rivalry is, unavoidably, a long-term campaign for predominance in which each side makes investments, builds forces, and develops technologies to gain competitive advantage — as symbolized by the set of potent sanctions Washington recently imposed on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. But it will also take a more perilous form as a series of discrete collisions that demand careful statecraft. Not all these events will be on the scale of the Taiwan Strait Crisis. Some could involve sudden disclosures of Chinese troops at foreign bases, large-scale cyber intrusions of U.S. systems, or proxy conflicts that emerge out of disputes over third parties. But some of the confrontations could be even violent and dangerous, such as outright Chinese military action against islands in the Taiwan Strait, an all-out blockade of Taiwan itself, or even seeming preparations for an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dealing with the Taiwan issue and larger U.S.-China relations, the United States should keep firmly in mind that these are primarily political issues, which demand diplomatic solutions. Attending to the statecraft of the larger relationship is the essential route to avoiding and mitigating crises. But in intense rivalries, crises are likely to emerge despite such efforts. In such an era of persistent clashes, the United States will need criteria to guide its responses — a handbook for managing a series of skirmishes within the larger rivalry. This essay offers an initial down payment on such thinking by drawing lessons from the most recent U.S. experience with managing crises within a larger rivalry: the Cold War. It uses those lessons to suggest six principles for managing confrontations with China. The resulting approach is to get the fundamentals of a systemic competition right and then strike a difficult but necessary balance: respond rapidly and decisively in support of a few vital commitments while resisting the urge to endow lesser clashes with undue significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagnosing-a-rivalry-lessons-and-insights-from-the-cold-war&quot;&gt;DIAGNOSING A RIVALRY: LESSONS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE COLD WAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some critical ways, the emerging rivalry is unlike the Cold War. China is more of an aggrieved rising power determined to recapture its place in world politics than the Soviet Union was at the beginning of the Cold War. China’s economic and technological power is vastly greater, and it may turn out to be more pugnacious in crises — more self-righteous, more overconfident (partly out of a faith in its ability to control crises and limited wars in a mechanistic way), more anxious to use crises to teach punitive lessons, and less willing to negotiate or even communicate during a skirmish if it believes doing so would signal weakness. But there are enough areas of similarity between these two crisis-prone rivalries that the Cold War experience can offer relevant lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-one-major-rivalries-are-systemic-contests&quot;&gt;LESSON ONE: MAJOR RIVALRIES ARE SYSTEMIC CONTESTS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Cold War suggests that principles for managing confrontations should be grounded in a conception of the rivalry’s essential character. If it is a primarily military or imperial contest for strategic points, then the resolution of individual standoffs at such sites may be decisive. The Cold War, however, was not such a contest — it was a competition between systems and their domestic and international bases of power. The dominant center of gravity was domestic economic, social, technological, and cultural dynamism. Societal dynamism is the foundational measure of systemic competitiveness, and the Soviet system failed that test in the Cold War — it could not generate sufficient growth, innovation, or legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War systemic competition played out in international terms as well, in the struggle for leadership of international markets, institutions, and processes — the ability to set the rules of the international system and become the hub of predominant networks of finance, trade, people, and ideas. In such a systemic contest, power emerges from the production of legitimacy, economic power, and cultural influence that radiates outward and reshapes world politics. Any systemic contest is a struggle to be the dominant gravitational force in world politics. Here, too, the United States prevailed: the primary international institutions became increasingly oriented toward the United States and other leading democracies, which came to embody far greater magnetic power due to their economic dynamism, cultural attraction, military power, and broadly accepted legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the same themes can be detected in the current rivalry between the United States and China. It is certainly a contest of domestic systems: China’s economic dynamism, and the innovation and technological sophistication it has spawned, underlies its ability to challenge the United States. In global terms, China is seeking to gain influence in the United Nations and other international forums, weaken U.S.-led institutions, and build a set of Sino-centric ones, from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China is seeking dominance, and the ability to use others’ dependencies for leverage, in several high-technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory of the nature of rivalries carries important lessons for the management of confrontations. Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash. In a contest powerfully influenced by attractive power and perceived legitimacy, over-aggressive and belligerent states will tend to undermine their long-term strategic position. They will also do so for classic reasons of strategic overreach: great powers that pour resources into distant clashes of secondary importance end up exhausting themselves and becoming strategically insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Cold War also suggests that gravitational effects and network power depend partly on perception and on others’ confidence in an actor’s power. Cultivating a reputation for strength and reliability is a systemic requirement every bit as important as avoiding overreach. Establishing guardrails on a rival’s progress, through a carefully selected set of inflexible commitments — in the case of the Cold War, the core U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia — can safeguard a baseline level of credibility. And it can provide running room to be more flexible on secondary issues without sparking a collapse of a great power’s global position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;overreacting-to-individual-encounters-will-usually-be-a-mistake-a-rivalry-focused-on-long-term-systemic-attraction-will-not-be-determined-by-any-one-clash&quot;&gt;Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such flexibility is available because of a related lesson from the Cold War: while a reputation for credible commitments is important, reputation is a contingent factor — not every standoff carries the same reputational weight, and the lessons that friends and rivals take from individual crises will depend on many factors. Iain Henry has documented, for example, in the context of earlier Taiwan Strait crises, that U.S. allies sometimes prefer that the United States not fulfill other commitments if they do not directly enhance the ally’s security. Some U.S. allies and key regional states welcomed pre-Korean War U.S. statements that it would not defend Taiwan, fearing that to do so would drag them into conflict. More recent cases — such as Russia’s reaction to the U.S. failure to enforce a red line on chemical weapons use in Syria — reinforce the point that the credibility lessons others draw from U.S. actions are specific to each case. There is no imperative to show strength in every test of wills. An important lesson of the Cold War, then, is that even a bitter systemic rivalry is not a zero-sum affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-two-the-ambitions-of-a-great-power-are-a-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;LESSON TWO: THE AMBITIONS OF A GREAT POWER ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also suggests that any strategy for managing recurring confrontations should rely upon an accurate diagnosis of the rival’s intentions. A China on a global mission of military adventurism would demand a very different series of responses in discrete crises from a China in a defensive crouch, reacting to perceived attacks from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategy in the Cold War reflected in part an extended, imperfect effort to calculate the real intentions of Soviet leadership. Debates around such issues began with George Kennan’s “Long Telegram” and “X” article, which detected an urge to power in the Russian culture and Soviet system but also real risk aversion, and continued through the argument over the sincerity of reformers of the Gorbachev era. But in retrospect, perhaps the most important lesson was how inchoate Soviet ambitions were — grand and global in rhetorical content but mixed, often half-hearted, and contradictory in application. Far from being set in stone, Soviet intentions were a work in progress, an evolving set of ideas, commitments, and opportunistic grabs unfolding under nebulous long-term doctrines. A key lesson of the Cold War, then, is the potential gap between the ideological, rhetorical, and even strategic proclamations of a great power and its practical ability, or even at times desire, to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related lesson is that the Soviet intentions and actions, which unfolded during the Cold War, were reactive as much as self-generated. Soviet leaders occasionally glimpsed windows of opportunity based on perceived U.S. or Western weakness. More often, however, their ambitions were driven by concerns about what the United States was doing or might do, or about the dangerous potential of emerging trends. One does not have to fully embrace a comprehensive revisionist account of the Cold War to accept that in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Afghanistan in 1979, the Able Archer nuclear crisis of 1983 and many other cases, Moscow was acting out of reactive alarm rather than calculated revisionist ambitions. Even the Cuban Missile Crisis stemmed primarily from Khrushchev’s worries about a U.S. invasion of Cuba and an unfavorable nuclear balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of emergent rather than fixed national intentions has much in common with the portrait of Germany authored in 1907 by the British civil servant Eyre Crowe. It was obvious, Crowe wrote, that “Germany distinctly aims at playing on the world’s political stage a much larger and more dominant part than she finds allotted to herself under the present distribution of materiel power.” But the issue was whether this reflected a formally outlined agenda or a series of improvisations. It was entirely plausible, he argued, that “the great German design is in reality no more than the expression of a vague, confused, and unpractical statesmanship, not fully realizing its own drift” and that “Germany does not really know what she is driving at.” Crowe concluded that it did not matter much which interpretation was correct: a belligerent Germany fueled by an “erratic, domineering, and often frankly aggressive spirit” was moving in a direction perilous to British interests whether it had a strict plan or not. It had to be opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, the Soviet Union’s ambitions in the Cold War reflected at least as much of an ongoing extemporization under imprecise long-term desires as any consistent long-term plan. This does not mean that the Soviet Union was not aggressive or goal-oriented: Vladislav Zubok has pushed back against excessively revisionist accounts of Soviet intentions, noting that ideology did fuel Soviet foreign policy and that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stalin’s policy was not one of confusion and defense, but one of cautious expansionism. Various factors intervened to prevent implementation of his policies, but historians should not overlook specific designs and intentions that produced those policies in the first place. Stalin was clever and scheming, and he regarded the Western powers as dangerous rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting Soviet objectives were in many ways inexact and conceptual, more of a work in progress than a preset plan. Any given Soviet lunge — backing Kim Il-sung’s invasion of South Korea, putting missiles into Cuba, or invading Hungary or Czechoslovakia — was more likely to be a momentary, unplanned scheme or reaction than a cog in an orchestrated machine of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this emergent, improvisational character of goals and the lack of detailed information about others’ thinking, the Cold War and earlier great power rivalries show the great difficulty of gauging a rival’s true intentions. States uncertain of others’ goals then often engage in worst-case analysis and overreact to specific moves. In the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union frequently misread the true reasons behind specific actions and reacted based on often exaggerated beliefs about each other’s purposes. A classic example was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan: the Carter administration saw it as the first step toward military control of the Persian Gulf, when in fact Soviet leaders were desperately trying to prevent the country from slipping out of the Soviet orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to believe that this basic model applies to China today; it is a state with elaborate goals, but ones without precise form and subject to misunderstanding. China’s international objectives are more of an improvisational work in progress in service of some clear but very broad long-term goals, rather than the working out of a rigid, pre-planned campaign. To be clear, this is not to suggest that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lacks ambition: China aspires to modify and even partially dismantle the U.S.-led post-war order and achieve some version of global leadership and deference to its wishes, at least in its own region. Some degree of global control is inextricably linked to the CCP’s core ambition of national rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s goals are therefore formidable and potentially dangerous to U.S. interests. The argument here is only that the detailed requirements for a world that would meet these goals are being worked out over time, and the strategies China uses to obtain them are also emerging through trial and error. Much like Germany in 1907 or the Soviet Union in 1946, China has a broad sense of a desired future — but the shape of its precise components, and what it is prepared to do to achieve them, remain very much a work in progress. And they will emerge through a long-term interaction with its primary perceived antagonist, the United States — not because the United States is responsible for all Chinese belligerence, but because Beijing will respond in part to perceived threats and to actions which appear intended to deny it the achievement of what it regards as legitimate interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is apparent from the phrases that Chinese officials and scholars have used to depict their goals, which are powerful but also vague and abstract. Statements such as “win-win cooperation” and “a community of common destiny” seem more like assertions of hope and general intent than a commitment to a specific agenda. Hal Brands and Michael Beckley argue that “China doesn’t want to be a superpower — one pole of many in the international system. It wants to be the superpower — the geopolitical sun around which the system revolves,” but even that potent objective could take many forms. They admit that its goals exist more in a “rough consensus” than any “detailed, step-by-step plans” and that it does not require “outright physical dominance” in the manner of some previous imperial powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful recent case for an expansive view of China’s ambitions is Rush Doshi’s book The Long Game, which makes the argument that Chinese official sources suggest an almost unlimited thirst for regional hegemony and global predominance. Yet even in his extensive account, most of the phrases attributed to official documents are rather vague: “make new and greater contributions to humanity,” “actively accomplishing something,” “a new type of international relations,” a “community of common destiny,” and other fuzzy exhortations. More pointed and specific demands, such as the suggestion that U.S. alliances must be ruined, tend to come from individual scholars or breast-pounding statements from specific Chinese commentators. In fact, many Chinese sources explicitly reject such terms as “hegemony,” associating it with Western imperial ambitions and claiming China seeks something very different. Some explicitly accept the idea of sharing world power, as Doshi puts it at one point, as “co-equals” with the United States. As Paul Heer put it in a respectful but critical review of Doshi’s book: “What Doshi appears to be overlooking or dismissing here is the possibility that China seeks to escape subordination to the United States, but without presuming that it can, in turn, subordinate the United States: that it expects a central role in global leadership without presuming exclusive global hegemony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other sources recognize the loose concepts and definitions inherent in Chinese strategic statements. One recent RAND study concluded that “no official Chinese document that outlines a strategy for managing competition with the United States is known to exist… At most, officials have described Chinese concepts, guiding principles, and proposals for foreign policy, all of which provide important clues as to Chinese intent.” Nadège Rolland argues that Beijing seems intent on some form of recognized primacy but explains that the precise elements of such a vision remain unformed and subject to debate. The vagueness, silence, and variety of opinions in Chinese thinking on strategic objectives suggest to Aaron Friedberg that “analysis of China’s long-term strategy cannot help but rest heavily on inference and speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedberg is deeply concerned about expansive Chinese ambitions, but he too relies on generic terms to capture China’s intent — seeking “predominance,” “preponderance,” or “hegemony” — while admitting that its “precise definition, and the extent to which” these concepts “can be achieved at acceptable cost at any given moment, remain[s] open to discussion and debate.” At one point he suggests that a more emergent approach to objectives may reflect an essential characteristic of Chinese strategy. Whereas Western strategy tends to be goal-directed, Chinese thinking tends to be “more organic and improvisational and less mechanical and deterministic.” Friedberg also points out that different Chinese officials “may be divided, or even undecided,” about the shape of their objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese writings also admit constraints on the tools the country might use to gain its desired future. They emphasize avoidance of war with the United States as well as other limits, such as an emphasis on nonmilitary forms of power, and recognize “the importance of having a balanced and nuanced strategy that avoids disastrous missteps.” Chinese strategy recognizes that a stable international environment and a friendly regional environment are essential to national rejuvenation, and Chinese official and unofficial sources stress the need for international legitimacy as a supporting pillar for both domestic legitimacy and the kind of leading global role Beijing seeks — based on the open acceptance of Chinese authority as a force for good, not the grudging tolerance of a resented coercion. Some Chinese sources have described an “ideal security environment” in ways that do not appear to demand hegemony at all. Chinese sources dispute the question of whether the United States would accept subordination to a clearly superior China, and therefore whether China should seek such a future. China sees little need to impose its political system on other countries or to develop a global network of military bases. Most fundamentally, the CCP’s predominant goal is to maintain its own power, and risky international steps that could pose serious threats to its rule will usually trade off against this most essential of objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important place to judge the scope of Chinese ambitions as they play out in practice, as opposed to theory, is in its push-and-pull with specific targets of influence. South Korea provides an interesting recent example. When Seoul announced in 2016 an intention to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in cooperation with the United States, China reacted angrily, calling the capability a threat to its nuclear deterrent. When South Korea went ahead with an initial THAAD deployment in 2017, China imposed economic sanctions, which cost South Korea and estimated $8 billion or more. The Moon Jae-in administration in South Korea sought to proceed with a partial deployment while mollifying Beijing, offering a promise of “three nos”: Seoul promised not to deploy more than one THAAD system, not to actively join a U.S. missile defense network, and not to seek a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This result demonstrated some Chinese influence but not an ability to dictate outcomes: China backed off its sanctions even though the initial THAAD system remained in place. Since that time, China’s belligerence has had a significant price. Public opinion in South Korea turned starkly against China. The new president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has declared that the “three nos” do not represent permanent South Korean policy and describes the U.S. alliance as “fundamental” to South Korean security. Chinese diplomacy on this issue has been improvising in service of a general goal — and the outcome does not reflect a linear march toward the future of Chinese regional suzerainty described in the most aggressive statements of its scholars and officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More evidence for the emergent, unplanned nature of Chinese ambitions comes from studies of its primary tool for achieving hegemony — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As analysts such as Raffaello Pantucci, Alexandros Petersen, Will Doig, and Jonathan Hillman have chronicled, to observe the working out of the BRI on the ground is to see a massive exercise in decentralized initiative and frequent ad-libbing. The overall enterprise does support a broad Chinese hope to play a leading role in world politics, and surely elements of it are planned from Beijing. But the empirical record of its unfolding suggests an accumulating set of emerging programs and ideas rather than a rigid and deterministic program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions thus appear to reflect a typical degree of elaborate geopolitical self-image characteristic of rising great powers, infused with China’s particular blend of resentment over past mistreatment and sense of cultural superiority. The United States should not underestimate the intensity, reach, or emotional resonance of those ambitions. On the other hand, the precise scope of a world China could live with remains undefined. “The question of whether they will have to settle for something less than clear-cut preponderance is probably unresolved at this point in the minds of China’s leaders,” Aaron Friedberg concluded. Individual confrontations, much as in the Cold War, can represent many things: a carefully planned step toward regional hegemony, a defensive reaction to a perceived threat, a trial or experiment, or the initiative of one part of the CCP bureaucracy. And along the way, U.S. actions and responses to Chinese behavior will shape Beijing’s perceptions of the degree to which the United States is fundamentally opposed to its core interests, and the sort of world it believes is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-three-there-is-wisdom-to-moderation-in-crises&quot;&gt;LESSON THREE: THERE IS WISDOM TO MODERATION IN CRISES.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War offers a final lesson in the handling of individual U.S.-China clashes. Despite the common idea that containment demanded an immediate answer to every Soviet and Chinese initiative, in fact, Washington succeeded in the Cold War in part precisely because it picked its spots. President Harry Truman rejected demands to escalate the Korean War and accepted an unsatisfying draw. Dwight Eisenhower refused French pleas to join the war in Indochina during the 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu, rebuffed calls to intervene during Moscow’s invasion of Hungary in 1956, and sought to preserve U.S. geopolitical legitimacy by opposing British and French interventions in Suez that same year. The United States did not commit force to respond to Soviet interventions in Czechoslovakia in 1968 or Afghanistan in 1979. It accepted a communist takeover of Cuba and allowed an anti-American theocracy to take root in Iran. In some of these cases, of course, Washington turned to covert regime change operations to pursue its goals, but it avoided the use of force in the initial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dismal parade of nonresponses would seem to be an obvious recipe for failure — allowing a rival to succeed, or accepting U.S. losses, in one crisis and war after another. Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided first and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies. The United States did erect a strong floor under the day-to-day competition by committing resolutely to a handfulof treaty commitments and vital interests, notably the defense of Europe, South Korea, and Japan, which placed strict limits on how far Soviet or Chinese success in other crises would cascade. But it prevailed (and survived) as much due to restraint as to belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathering these collisions required something else as well: a mutual willingness to combine steadfastness with reassurance and compromise during even the worst crises. Both sides showed a recurring ability to respect the most essential interests of the other and to accept that avoiding escalation demanded conciliation. This was the pattern in U.S. restraint in Korea and Vietnam, in the series of crises over Berlin, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in many other cases. Managing confrontations was as much about empathy and compromise as it was about power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;yet-the-united-states-prevailed-because-the-rivalry-ultimately-represented-a-clash-of-systems-one-decided-f-irst-and-foremost-by-the-organic-power-of-the-relative-societies&quot;&gt;Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided f irst and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, U.S. appreciation for this fact was wildly inconsistent. All too often, U.S. officials misread individual confrontations as the result of Soviet aggressiveness and belligerence rather than fear and desperation. Some of the most dangerous moments in the Cold War flared up when one or both sides exaggerated the stakes of local disputes. This basic misperception cropped up again and again, from the Berlin crises to Afghanistan to perhaps the most famous and perilous example, the 1983 war scare produced by Soviet fears of an imminent U.S. nuclear strike. It was also a product of a related fact about Cold War clashes: despite immense intelligence apparatuses and decades-long personal ties, each side often had only the most rudimentary information about the other’s true thinking. Partly as a result, crisis signaling never worked as well in practice as in game theory. In the chaos of major clashes, signals were misinterpreted or ignored as often as accurately read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But U.S. moderation through many Cold War crises also suggests a more reassuring lesson: Soviet imperial objectives were to some degree self-correcting in the responses they provoked from others. Before 1950, for example, the United States was not fully committed to the defense of either South Korea or Taiwan. It was willing, for a time, to assume that Taiwan would be reabsorbed into the new mainland regime. But the Soviet-sponsored invasion of South Korea changed all that, sparking renewed U.S. and allied defense investments and commitments. The Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 turned out to be strategically disastrous, alienating much of the nonaligned movement and speeding the collapse of domestic support for the Soviet system. The more belligerently aggressive Moscow became, the more it drove countries to seek implicit or explicit security help from the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is seeing much the same dynamic play out with China today. The more it seeks to intimidate its neighbors and capture influence within the societies of other countries, the more it steals intellectual property and imposes elaborate technology transfer demands on foreign firms, the more Beijing alienates those it is trying to win over. With Europe imposing much stricter controls on technology cooperation, Japan considering a doubling of its defense budget, and countries throughout Asia accelerating networks of security cooperation, China’s most aggressive ambitions may turn out to be, like the Soviet Union’s, a self-correcting threat. This has implications for its goals: China may seek regional hegemony, but if it encounters more visceral opposition with every new step, it will have to recalibrate its objectives over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sources of insight lead back to the central goal of this essay — to nominate principles for managing an era of persistent altercations within a combative rivalry with China. The Cold War lessons summarized above can help inform these principles. Those lessons highlight the possibility of a rival whose ambitions are substantial but not clearly defined. They warn of the risks of misinterpreting China’s true motives in any crisis and suggest that a long-term systemic rivalry will not be determined by almost any one clash — but they also emphasize the need to draw some clear limits to an aggressive state’s opportunism. They make clear the need to balance strength in any one standoff with the need to remain patient, signal a willingness to compromise — if such a step remains possible in the context of U.S. China Policy — and avoid escalation. And the Cold War experience hints that China’s belligerence will be partly self-correcting and that successive crises can be one tool for shifting the global alignment of power against Beijing. Seven principles for managing confrontations embody these lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-one-establish-the-boundaries-of-us-tolerance&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE ONE: ESTABLISH THE BOUNDARIES OF U.S. TOLERANCE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle requires identifying the potential confrontations that would justify strong and determined responses, with either military force or a comprehensive nonmilitary campaign of cost imposition. These are the confrontations in which the United States would draw red lines to circumscribe the outer bounds of China’s territorial encroachment, identifying those commitments and interests that will generate a rapid and substantial U.S. military response. Some U.S. experience with China indicates that China does respect firm boundaries when others draw them, suggesting that the strictest red lines would largely be respected (except for Taiwan, discussed below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 suggests a rough categorization of potential crises along two indices: (1) the degree of U.S. national interests involved, and (2) the precedential importance of an issue in regulating Chinese ambitions. Confrontations that reflect high measures on both indices (the top-right box) would call forth a powerful and direct response. An example would be a massed Chinese maritime coercion campaign to impose Japanese withdrawal from the Senkakus: such a gambit would demand rapid and substantial U.S. military deployments, reaffirmations that any action against Japan would trigger the U.S.-Japan security treaty, and other steps. Once it has identified the issues in this quadrant, the United States would then make unequivocal deterrent threats around them to avoid clashes in the first place. It has begun to do this with actions such as the statement that the Senkakus fall under the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the 2019 clarification that “any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea would trigger mutual defense obligations under Article IV of our Mutual Defense Treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the figure also highlights confrontations in which the United States would have more room for maneuver. The bottom-left corner includes issues that call for ongoing competition rather than risk-taking confrontations; when they flare into momentary public crises — such as the revelation of a specific Chinese human rights abuse or agreement to build a new military base — the United States could react calmly and indirectly. The most challenging quadrant to handle would be the bottom right: forms of Chinese coercion or outright aggression that threaten non-treaty allies, but which could, if successful, turbocharge Chinese ambitions. Here, the United States could potentially rally world opinion, support the beleaguered state in significant ways, or impose punishments on China, but not deploy forces or risk a direct confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/byDcnVA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Categorizing Potential Confrontations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matrix does not distinguish crises based on who initiates confrontation, a crucial factor. The restrained U.S. approach in the recent Taiwan Strait Crisis was probably dictated in part by the role of U.S. actions in creating it. Whether a given crisis arises from U.S. or allied actions, or fully unprovoked Chinese belligerence, will have to be considered when categorizing a given confrontation and the appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue is notably absent from the figure — Taiwan. Much of the debate about U.S. policy really amounts to which cell it belongs in. Many would place it on the right-hand side, as a precedent-setting issue for Chinese ambitions — though some would disagree, suggesting that it is such a unique issue that it holds limited meaning for restraining wider Chinese ambitions. Most of the debate, though, will be about the lower-right versus upper-right cells. Is this an issue that, when crises erupt, the United States should signal a strong and immediate response, including military deployments and threats of escalation? This question is addressed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-two-emphasize-understanding-and-strategic-empathy&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE TWO: EMPHASIZE UNDERSTANDING AND STRATEGIC EMPATHY.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major theme of Cold War crises was how often each side misread the intentions of its rival — and how dangerous such misperceptions could be. In the current rivalry, these risks may be compounded by China’s doctrinal emphasis on moving rapidly, decisively, and violently at the beginning of a crisis or war to seize the strategic advantage. China’s own myopic conviction that its ambitions reflect a rightful demand for fair treatment may make it blind to the ways in which it generates crises, something the United States needs to understand and navigate around. In recent crises, U.S. signals of toughness, based on limited information about Chinese intentions, have arguably created unnecessary risk. And the history of Chinese crisis behavior suggests that, like most great powers, it is most likely to take risk and escalate events when it perceives itself in a domain of losses, under severe pressure, and losing strategic position and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will therefore be essential for senior U.S. officials to put in place wide-ranging sources of information, from inside as well as outside government, and formal analytical products that constantly invite them to put themselves into the mindset of leaders in Beijing. This is easier said than done, and the hints of a new orthodoxy on China are already evident that will make it even tougher. It will demand committed effort from presidents and senior advisers to be sure they are drawing from the widest possible basis of information and interpretations — offices, products, and processes that go well beyond reporting on China to representing its mindset, as well as relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials that provide some basis for correcting misimpressions during future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-three-keep-from-generating-crises-ourselves-especially-with-unnecessary-political-provocations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE THREE: KEEP FROM GENERATING CRISES OURSELVES, ESPECIALLY WITH UNNECESSARY POLITICAL PROVOCATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be times when the United States believes it needs to take strong action on some issue in the relationship, actions China will view unfavorably. But Washington should avoid provoking unnecessary confrontations to the greatest degree possible. Partly this is simple resource management: Expending time, diplomatic capital, and military readiness on needless clashes is not good strategy. This imperative is partly about managing Chinese perceptions, avoiding, to the degree still possible (which may be limited), the idea that the United States is determined to challenge China in every opportunity. But it is also partly about sending a signal to third parties that both sides in this rivalry are not equally responsible for its most dangerous moments — that the United States, to the degree possible, seeks stability and China is the author of instability. All of those principles help to set the context for the successful resolution of individual confrontations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the challenge for the United States is to avoid the central source of instability when dealing with rising, dissatisfied powers — signaling that the only way for them to achieve their rightful place in world politics is through warfare. Accommodating some Chinese aims and ambitions is not only appropriate, it is essential if we are to avoid a bitterly zero-sum contest with an aggrieved and increasingly paranoid great power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-four-develop-options-for-shoring-up-credibility-away-from-the-local-confrontation&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FOUR: DEVELOP OPTIONS FOR SHORING UP CREDIBILITY AWAY FROM THE LOCAL CONFRONTATION.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant clash will raise the age-old issue of credibility and reputation, sparked by fears about the lessons that third parties will draw from U.S. conduct in such standoffs as well as concerns about domestic political costs of inaction. As noted, this concern for reputation can sometimes push great powers to take risks beyond those the interests at stake would seem to support. To avoid being trapped into excessive reactions out of a concern for credibility, the United States should identify indirect ways to shore it up — actions away from the local confrontation that signal U.S. strength and commitment without undertaking costly adventures. Partly this can involve preset options to quietly reset expectations in the wake of crises, including enhanced U.S. military posture, public statements of commitment to friends and allies, arms aid and transfers to partners, and expanded security cooperation activities. It can energize dialogues with U.S. friends and allies on shared steps to bolster collective credibility when a local military response is not judged to be sensible. None of this would involve starting new proxy conflicts or putting U.S. credibility on the line in new places or conflicts. The options would focus on reinforcing existing alliances and commitments to make clear that restraint in one confrontation will not produce a domino effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-five-multilateralize-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FIVE: MULTILATERALIZE CONFRONTATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the great advantage of enjoying the active or tacit support of most key industrial powers, and most countries in Asia, in the effort to constrain the most aggressive forms of Chinese power. Both before and during crises, the United States should continue to seek to recruit collective support for norms and principles; then, when China prompts a clash with belligerent actions, it will face significant global criticism and confront a strong coalition of states insisting that it respect certain norms of conduct. One example is the growing European presence in Asia, in particular, conducting various forms of freedom of navigation demonstrations and security engagements with Asian nations. There is an ample institutional framework for such an effort, starting with the United Nations and running through bilateral and multilateral alliances, minilateral groupings such as the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) initiative, informal groups such as the Quad, and regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The United States will have uneven success in recruiting support in these venues depending on the nature of the crisis, but a major focus now can be to build a strong normative foundation for later support in crises. It would accelerate efforts to ensure that, especially in crises involving true U.S. red lines, China would confront a substantial coalition opposing its belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-six-use-confrontations-as-levers-to-seek-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SIX: USE CONFRONTATIONS AS LEVERS TO SEEK COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should seek with every event not merely to fulfill its immediate interests but to rally world opinion against Chinese coercive provocations and put into place a gradually increasing deterrent posture in the region. After each crisis, for example, the United States can approach key regional actors, such as the Philippines, and propose slightly improved U.S. force presence and deepened bilateral training and exercise activities. It can try to ensure that each confrontation has some of the echo effect of major Soviet adventures in the Cold War, from Korea to Czechoslovakia to Afghanistan, in stiffening the commitment of other states to respond to the next provocation. To do this, however, the United States will need far better tools of informational statecraft to help shape opinions, especially in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reap such competitive benefits, the United States should develop concepts and capabilities to ensure that, once a confrontation is underway, the passage of time benefits the United States rather than China. Whether it is a maritime standoff over a set of disputed islands, a partial or complete quarantine of Taiwan, or another clash with the potential to last days, weeks, or even months, the side that accumulates more strength over time will have the advantage. If China believes it can outlast the United States, it will have every incentive to disregard short-term challenges and hold out to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-seven-use-each-confrontation-as-an-opportunity-to-build-communication-channels-rules-of-engagement-and-norms-of-conduct&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SEVEN: USE EACH CONFRONTATION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, AND NORMS OF CONDUCT.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also highlights the role of mutual understandings in helping to manage the pressure-packed days or weeks of individual crises. A great risk with China today is that the formal crisis management mechanisms that do exist are embryonic, frequently ignored or bypassed, and not developed through mutual practice. Personal relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials are either nonexistent or, with a few exceptions, poorly developed. In some past crises, the absence of rapid U.S. responses to Chinese signals was potentially dangerous. In the wake of every crisis, the United States could approach China with an offer to jointly learn lessons and find ways of avoiding inadvertent escalation in future clashes, including through codified rules of engagement, mechanisms of communication, and informal standards of conduct. This is especially true at senior levels: Chinese habits of centralized decisionmaking and constraints on regular contacts at many levels may leave little room for strengthening rules of engagement from the bottom up. Senior U.S. officials and U.S. presidents should therefore use the aftermath of any crisis as an opportunity to argue for processes and contacts that improve mutual understanding, and mechanisms for easy conversation, at their level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-does-this-leave-taiwan&quot;&gt;WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE TAIWAN?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those principles may work reasonably well for most U.S.-China confrontations, but they may be of less use on the dispute most likely to spark crises: the status of Taiwan. The issue resides in a vague middle ground between the two right-hand cells in Figure 1 — possibly, but not necessarily, justifying inclusion with the clashes that would prompt an immediate and uncompromising U.S. response to Chinese coercive modes. That obscure status is becoming ever more complex and strewn with dilemmas. On the one hand, the case for the U.S. policy of ambiguity remains strong: to promise unqualified defense of the island would provoke China and possibly tempt Taiwan to take actions which would irretrievably inflame the issue. Signaling restraint to extend China’s timeline for achieving its interests, in part by “keeping the possibility of peaceful unification alive” to the degree possible, has been an essential component of maintaining peace. This has meant avoiding symbolic actions that will infuriate Beijing and doing everything possible to reintroduce a degree of patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustaining that approach is critical and should be a U.S. policy priority. Yet it cannot be denied that all trends are now running in the direction of more formal U.S. commitments to defend Taiwan. Having watched the horrors of the Ukraine war unfold, the United States may now be far less likely to exercise similar restraint over Taiwan. President Biden has said multiple times that the United States would defend Taiwan, only to have his words walked back. The most recent of these statements implied the United States would fight even if Taiwan declared independence, a clear shift from existing policy. Meanwhile, Congress seems on the verge of passing a Taiwan Policy Act that would represent nothing short of a revolution in U.S. security relations with Taipei. There may now be no going back to the precise forms of mutual restraint around the Taiwan issue that helped produce relative stability for the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of dealing with confrontations over Taiwan is further complicated by the fact that they may not represent an outright invasion. More likely is an interim series of crises below that threshold, intended to signal China’s determination and warn the United States, Taiwan, and others off any course that hints at de facto independence. Such moves could include repeated exercises, penetration of Taiwanese airspace, cyberattacks on Taiwan’s civilian and military infrastructure, large-scale political warfare, direct attacks on islands in the strait, attacks on undersea cables carrying internet connectivity to the island, temporary or quasi-permanent blockades of parts of the surrounding waterways, or an energy embargo. Even if Beijing does move toward a full invasion, it would have to undertake many forms of preparation — from months or years of surging defense production to national mobilization to more immediate movement of forces — that would create a crisis of impending war long before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be no simple playbook for U.S. responses to such a diverse array of actions, but the principles for managing persistent confrontations suggested above can still provide some guidance. First, the essential foundation for any U.S. approach to future crises should begin with an effort to reaffirm elements of stability to reset the context for future confrontations. If China comes to believe that the United States is inching toward open support for Taiwanese independence, it will have less incentive to restrain the escalatory dynamics of any crisis. It may be too late to resuscitate the comprehensive policy of ambiguity, but Washington can still offer a modified reassurance to Beijing. It can pledge that the One China Policy remains in place, indicate that the United States has no intention to formally recognize an independent Taiwan, and insist that both sides restrain actions that could lead to war. Washington could even publicly signal that a Taiwanese declaration of independence would void any U.S. promises. (In fact the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy came fairly close to saying all of this.) In return it should request more consistent pledges from Beijing that it remains committed to the peaceful resolution of the issue, as it has long claimed. A mutually agreed series of such statements could move the public position of both sides back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, however, and in tension with that effort, the United States now seems compelled to clarify its red lines for future Taiwan crises in ways more explicit than the policy of ambiguity had allowed. It could declare that an unprovoked Chinese attack on Taiwan proper would produce U.S. military involvement of some kind, leaving substantial leeway in terms of what military response it would undertake. It could continue to insist on freedom of navigation in international waters — including international maritime freedom to engage with Taiwan (thus placing a comprehensive Chinese blockade across the U.S. threshold of tolerance). This would amount to placing only the most severe confrontations in the upper-right quadrant of Figure 1, actions that would trigger a U.S. military response in a crisis (such as large-scale military movements). Lesser contingencies — including Chinese cyberattacks, missile flights, violations of Taiwan’s airspace, and even direct attacks on small islands in the strait — would fall into the lower-right quadrant and leave the United States with greater freedom of action in responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under such an approach, the United States would not reflexively seek to confront any Chinese coercive act around Taiwan. It would not adopt a policy of disrupting any Chinese exercises, flights, or sailings that cross certain territorial lines, unless they dealt with red-line issues. As in the recent strait crisis, it would take a largely hands-off approach unless there were clear actions or indications that China was preparing to violate one of the red-line issues. The approach aims to recreate, in miniature, the essential U.S. approach during the Cold War, combining firm commitment to a small number of essential red lines with flexibility on most other clashes. The result would split the difference on ambiguity, but in ways that do not reflect a major departure from U.S. policy, which has always insisted on a peaceful resolution of the issue and strongly hinted that the United States would respond militarily to an outright invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, before or during a major crisis, the United States could follow other elements of the principles for managing confrontations suggested above. It could recruit statements from other countries insisting that China not use military force as well as expand multilateral exercises, sailings, and security cooperation efforts to make clear that an unprovoked use of force would put Beijing afoul of most of the world economy. For lesser contingencies where it chooses restraint, such as the recent crisis, the United States could undertake parallel actions to demonstrate strength, reassure regional actors, and reaffirm its credibility. It could finally get serious about its information instrument of statecraft and use Chinese belligerence to drive regional and global opinion during future skirmishes. At the same time, it would do everything possible to enhance channels of communication and personal relationships and approach Beijing after each clash to reaffirm key rules of the road. Fourth and finally, this approach has implications for U.S. operational military posture in the region. A relatively calm and contained approach to many confrontations will have much greater credibility if the United States and Taiwan have a stronger persistent, preset ability to impose costs on aggression, rather than having to spend weeks or months flowing forces to the area. This demands, first and foremost, that Taiwan take stronger steps for its own defense. More spending, a true commitment to a more asymmetric emphasis, and a transformation of Taiwan’s reserve forces are minimum necessary steps. For the United States, this approach would call for more submarines; unmanned undersea systems; advanced sensing and targeting systems, including long-range drones; loitering munitions; some number of long-range precision fire systems (including bombers); and demonstrated offensive cyber capabilities. The United States would also need to design the highest-impact forces to be able to rapidly deploy to the region — even onto Taiwan — once it received unambiguous warning that China was assembling forces for a full, unprovoked invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-temperate-strategy-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;TOWARD A TEMPERATE STRATEGY FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conceptualizing the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, most U.S. officials and analysts have become accustomed to thinking of the competition as a persistent contest to shape measures of advantage on some grand long-term scorecard. But an equally important set of choices will be episodic — the ways the United States approaches specific crises and confrontations to gain strategic advantage while avoiding conflict. It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Cold War offers a blueprint for such a strategy, it suggests that a great power must first get its fundamental socioeconomic engine right and work to set the alignment of world politics to its advantage. To limit the cascading effect of any one loss or compromise, it must lay out a handful of vital commitments on which its commitments are resolute and credible. The U.S. experience with China in recent decades suggests that such explicit line-drawing on the most important issues can have a meaningful effect on Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done these things, great powers can then be restrained in most individual crises beyond those issues or allies because they are not going to decide the outcome. Repeatedly in the Cold War, the United States responded to clashes with at least a degree of restraint — in Korea, Dien Bien Phu, Hungary, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. There is every reason to believe the same basic rule will hold in the rivalry with China: the United States cannot be so spring-loaded to respond that it turns every clash into an existential contest of wills. This suggests, on Taiwan and other issues, a challenging but manageable balancing act that combines strengthening the most essential commitments with a determination not to overreact to other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk, at this point, is that the room in the U.S. national security context for compromise, understanding, and sensible accommodation appears to be narrowing rapidly. Especially with the recent announcement of understandable constraints on dealing with China’s semiconductor industry, the United States is giving every indication of viewing the rivalry in increasingly zero-sum terms. This will convince Chinese officials and commentators that their most pessimistic instincts have been correct: the United States has no intention of offering shared leadership of world politics. The policy case for each of these specific actions, such as information technology constraints or arms sales to Taiwan, may be compelling. But the sum of these actions is creating an environment in which Beijing has much less incentive to hold back when a crisis arrives because it thinks its rival is operating according to a zero-sum mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Chen Weiss recently made an impassioned plea for strategic goals and direction in a U.S. China Policy rapidly being swallowed up by worst-case assumptions and zero-sum thinking. “U.S. politicians and policymakers are becoming so focused on countering China that they risk losing sight of the affirmative interests and values that should underpin U.S. strategy,” she argues. U.S. policy “has struggled to define success” in the overall competition and has become dangerously reactive and, at times, exaggerated. As a result, “Both countries are intent on doing whatever is necessary to demonstrate that any move by the other will not go unmet.” The same dynamic could easily come to characterize the U.S. approach to specific crises. In its approach to the periodic clashes that will increasingly come to characterize this relationship, no less than in the overarching rivalry, the United States needs a positive strategy for success.&lt;/p&gt;
