The number of violent incidents related to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict increased 4.5 times in the last week of September from the weekly average between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024. In addition, the attacks are targeting a much larger geographic area. Israeli and Hezbollah attacks struck an average of 27–28 km from the Blue Line in the last week of September, up from an average of about 3–4 km between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024. The number of strikes and the geography of the conflict are likely to grow and include a larger swath of Lebanon and Israel as well as potentially Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah continue to escalate in what Israel has called Operation Northern Arrows. In mid-September 2024, Israeli intelligence sabotaged thousands of Hezbollah beepers and walkie-talkies, detonating them in an operation that killed dozens of group members and wounded thousands more. On September 27, 2024, Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on the group’s Beirut headquarters — the culmination of a campaign against Hezbollah’s leaders that led to the killing of numerous senior group leaders in September 2024. Two days before the Nasrallah assassination, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, chief of the general staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told Israeli troops from the Seventh Brigade deployed along the northern border, “We are preparing the process of a manoeuvre, which means your military boots . . . will enter enemy territory.” The IDF also called up two reserve brigades for what it referred to as “operational missions in the northern arena.” Israeli commandoes have conducted cross-border operations to gather intelligence and otherwise prepare for a ground invasion, and Israel has done limited operations so far in southern Lebanon. Iran responded by launching waves of ballistic missiles and other stand-off weapons at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the prospect of further escalation, this brief asks four questions: What are Israel’s and Hezbollah’s objectives? How has violence evolved over the past several months? What are plausible scenarios for further escalation? What options do the United States and other countries have to mitigate or prevent escalation? To answer these questions, this analysis draws on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative information. It compiles data on Israeli and Hezbollah strikes along the Israel-Lebanon-Syria border and geolocates Hezbollah attacks against Israel in the demilitarized zone between the Blue Line and Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data show the increased scope and scale of Israeli and Hezbollah operations in recent months. Although most strikes by both sides have been within a relatively narrow area along the Israel-Lebanon border, the nature of the limited war between Hezbollah, Iran, and Israel is rapidly changing. Israel has escalated the number of strikes and the depth of its targeting. Hezbollah too has increased strikes, though in a far more limited way than Israel. And Iran has become directly involved in the conflict by firing ballistic missiles at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing risk, an all-out war is not inevitable. Israeli attacks might successfully coerce Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire and move forces away from the border, or they might significantly weaken Hezbollah’s capabilities to strike Israel. But if negotiations fail to establish a buffer zone along the Israel-Lebanon border, there is a heightened possibility of all-out war. Escalation could lead to significant casualties for both Hezbollah and the Israeli military, put Israeli civilians throughout the country at risk, lead to hundreds and perhaps thousands of Lebanese civilian casualties, and spread to Iran, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the implications of escalation, the rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first examines likely Israeli and Hezbollah objectives. The second assesses the evolution of violence. The third explores plausible scenarios of further escalation, and the fourth explores U.S. policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Strategic Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) helped establish Lebanese Hezbollah and provided money, equipment, training, and strategic guidance to the fledgling Shia organization. In addition, Iran sent as many as 1,500 IRGC advisers to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon to build and run training camps that prepared Hezbollah fighters for war with Israel. Hezbollah played a major role in Israel’s 1985 decision to withdraw to a buffer zone on the Lebanese border and its 2000 decision to withdraw from Lebanon completely. Hezbollah, since its establishment, has defined itself in opposition to Israel. Its main objectives have been to drive Israel out of Lebanon and, ultimately, to destroy the state of Israel. In the 1980s and 1990s, Israel and Hezbollah regularly attacked each other despite the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) along the Israel-Lebanon border, which is typically known as the Blue Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah continued occasional attacks on Israel and conducted a series of attacks against Israeli interests and citizens across the globe. This limited conflict flared into an all-out war in 2006 after a Hezbollah cross-border kidnapping operation. The war left over 100 Israelis and around 500 Hezbollah fighters dead and devastated Lebanon. The 2006 war ended with United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. Among other measures, UNSCR 1701 created a demilitarized zone between the Blue Line and Litani River along the borders of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria (Figure 1). Weapons and fighters that did not belong to the Lebanese government or the United Nations (i.e., those of Hezbollah) could not pass south of the Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pZR3hLc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: UNSCR 1701 Zone in Southern Lebanon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2006, an uneasy status quo prevailed. Israel occasionally attacked Hezbollah fighters, and Iranian arms shipments headed to Hezbollah and other groups in Syria. There were intermittent rockets and drones and other standoff attacks across the border. For the most part, however, the border was the calmest it had been in decades. Another area of dispute was the village of Ghajar, just west of Shebaa Farms and bisected by the Israel-Lebanon border. Its residents have both Lebanese and Israeli citizenship. For years, a fence divided Ghajar, but in 2006 Israeli forces reoccupied the entire village and today retain control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, however, several factors have changed the dynamics between Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran. First, the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel dramatically increased Israeli insecurity and took a psychological toll on Israelis. Israel’s risk tolerance significantly changed. If Hamas could kill over 1,100 Israelis in a surprise cross-border operation, what could a much better organized, armed, and trained Hezbollah do? Hezbollah’s close relationship with Iran and ties to Hamas reinforced this fear. Second, the repercussions of the October 7 attack and clashes between Hezbollah and Israel displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border after October 2023, including over 62,000 civilians from northern Israel and more than 92,000 from southern Lebanon. The continuing displacement has put pressure on Israeli leaders to contain the Hezbollah threat to northern Israel so that residents can return. Third, Hezbollah has dramatically improved its military and stockpiled more than 150,000 standoff weapons in Lebanon and Syria. With Iranian partner and proxy forces active in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries across the region, the threat from the north could get worse over time, not better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these changes, Israeli leaders likely have several main objectives. The first is to curb the Hezbollah threat to Israel by seriously degrading Hezbollah’s military capacity and deterring further actions against Israel. As Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant remarked, a key Israeli goal is “destroying Hezbollah’s capabilities that have been built up over 20 years,” including “disarming entire units of the Radwan force and leaving Nasrallah alone at the top of Hezbollah.” As the Nasrallah killing, beeper operation, large-scale air attacks, and ground operations showed, Israel is increasingly shifting from a traditional deterrent approach of threatening punishment to one of weakening Hezbollah’s capabilities to the point that the group cannot effectively respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has repeatedly fired anti-tank guided munitions (ATGMs), rockets, drones, missiles, and other standoff weapons at Israeli military and civilian targets from south of the Litani River and other locations in Lebanon. Figure 2 displays possible launch areas for Hezbollah ATGM attacks based on geolocated footage of ATGM impacts shown in Hezbollah propaganda videos. These attacks are a clear violation of UNSCR 1701. Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces have also been deployed along the border. Thanks to Iranian assistance, Hezbollah possesses as many as 200,000 standoff weapons, including short- and long-range unguided rockets, short- and intermediate-range unguided ballistic missiles, and short- and medium-range guided ballistic missiles such as the Fateh-110/M-600 and Qadr-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a54ELh1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Assessed Areas of Hezbollah ATGM Team Operations (October 7, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second Israeli objective is to resettle Israel’s internally displaced population back to their homes and villages in northern Israel. Doing this requires establishing and sustaining a security environment that currently does not exist. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated it would be impossible to return Israeli civilians to their homes without a “fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” an attitude that appears to be driving Israel’s recent escalation. Defense Minister Gallant added, “We will continue with additional blows that are already prepared until we achieve our goal — the return of the residents of the north to their homes, to achieve the goal we are willing to take any action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalating-violence&quot;&gt;Escalating Violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escalation of violence in late September far surpasses any other phase of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. After conducting an average of about 160 attacks each week for the 11 months following October 7, Israel struck Lebanon more than 300 times in the week of September 15 and more than 700 times in the week of September 22 (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yKnCJZ6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Violent Incidents Related to the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even before Israel commenced Operation Northern Arrows in September, there were indications the conflict was entering a new phase. The number of violent incidents related to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict fluctuated between 150 and 250 incidents each week between October 7, 2023, and August 18, 2024. But late August saw the number of incidents rise past 280 per week, with Israeli attacks driving most of the increase. Another sign was an increase in Israeli warplanes conducting threatening overflights over Lebanon (Figure 4). Before summer 2024, these incidents were extremely rare, but Israel sent warplanes over Lebanese cities with increasing frequency throughout the summer, frequently breaking the sound barrier in what now seems to be an implicit threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5fGtoXh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Recorded Israeli Overflights of Lebanon (December 31, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, most of the violence took place in the vicinity of the Blue Line (Figure 5). Hezbollah and Israel have traded artillery, ATGM, and air and drone strikes across the border almost daily since October. Before the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, the fighting displaced roughly 60,000 Israelis and 110,000 Lebanese. The fighting has resulted in a major increase in displacement and death since the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, with Lebanese authorities reporting that more than 90,000 people were displaced and 600 were killed between September 24 and September 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hAyt9V8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Violent Incidents Related to the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violence has not remained limited to southern Lebanon or northern Israel; it has expanded deeper into both countries. Israel has conducted long-range strikes into Lebanon since early 2024, and both the frequency and depth of these strikes have increased over time (Figure 6). Between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024, the average Israeli strike occurred about 4 km into Lebanon. In the first three weeks of September, the average depth of an Israeli strike was approximately 6 km. During the week of September 22, the average depth of an Israeli strike was 27 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest-profile deep strikes have been the assassinations of Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, but the IDF has also repeatedly attacked Hezbollah’s logistics and air defense infrastructures. The IDF does not appear to be limiting its deep strikes to symbolically or politically important targets but seems to have been engaged in a campaign to degrade Hezbollah’s ability to supply and protect its forces throughout Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L5SGGWW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Violent Incidents in Lebanon by Distance from the Blue Line (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite promises by Hezbollah and Iranian leaders to escalate in response to Israeli deep strikes, Hezbollah’s success has been mixed. As shown in Figure 7, Hezbollah attacks have reached deep into Israel on far fewer occasions than Israel has struck deep into Lebanon. This may be, in part, due to the efficacy of Israeli air defenses like Iron Dome and David’s Sling, but Hezbollah restraint and Israeli deterrence have played a role. For more than a decade, Hezbollah has possessed standoff weapons capable of striking all of Israel, but it has not appeared to use them in response to any of Israel’s deep strikes, generally retaliating with an increase in short-range rocket or ATGM fire into northern Israel. Hezbollah has also kept its rocket attacks small relative to its total launch capacity, which is frequently estimated to be more than 1,500 rockets per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/plqnX8A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Violent Incidents in Israel by Distance from the Blue Line (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has, however, managed to escalate the depth of its attacks, if not their number. As shown in Figure 8, the average depth of Israeli and Hezbollah attacks has moved roughly in parallel since October 7. Between October 7, 2023, and August 18, 2024, the average Hezbollah strike occurred about 3 km into Israel. Between August 18 and the beginning of September, the average depth of a Hezbollah strike was approximately 4 km. During the week of September 22, the average depth of a Hezbollah strike was 28 km. Hezbollah has conducted far fewer attacks than Israel since the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, probably due to the pressure created by Israel’s recent killings of Hezbollah leadership, penetration of the group’s communications, and bombing of rocket and missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lkmGq7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: Average Distance from the Blue Line of Violent Incidents in Israel and Lebanon (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has recently escalated its long-range attacks with a September 25 missile attack that apparently targeted the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s main external intelligence agency, near Tel Aviv. Although Israeli air defense systems intercepted the attack, Hezbollah signaled that it is willing target Israel’s largest city. But the attack has not yet developed into a campaign of long-range strikes against Israel, possibly because of the amount of pressure from Israel’s recent killings of Hezbollah leadership, penetration of the group’s communications systems, and bombing of rocket and missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict underwent a further escalation on October 1, when Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. The attack marked only the second direct attack on Israel launched from Iranian territory. Israel’s response remains uncertain; it responded to Iran’s previous missile attack with an implicit threat to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure. The region is currently teetering on the brink of all-out war. More direct attacks between Israel and Iran will probably push it over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios-for-escalation&quot;&gt;Scenarios for Escalation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the escalating violence, this section examines three scenarios for further escalation: an Israeli ground invasion, a coercive Israeli air war, and a major Hezbollah escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-invasion&quot;&gt;Ground Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel might conduct a major and sustained ground incursion into southern Lebanon to drive Hezbollah forces away from the Israel-Lebanon border, ideally up to or past the Litani River. In essence, the goal would be to recreate something like the buffer zone Israel held from 1985 to 2000, when the cumulative weight of Hezbollah attacks led Israel to withdraw. The operation might require large numbers of Israeli ground forces (in 2006 Israel sent around 30,000 troops into Lebanon — a number that was probably insufficient), both to suppress retaliatory Hezbollah missile and rocket fire against Israel and to support ground operations. Because Israeli forces have been fighting in Gaza or have been called up in other theaters for almost a year, reservists need little retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If successful, such an operation would greatly reduce the risk of an October 7–like ground incursion from Lebanon. Hezbollah fighters would need to traverse the buffer zone before crossing the Israeli border, making their detection and disruption far more likely. In addition, depending on the length of the buffer zone, Israel would reduce the risk of Hezbollah strikes from short-range systems such as mortars and especially ATGMs, making it hard for the group to fire into Israel proper. This, in turn, would make it safer for Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. Hezbollah would probably lose hundreds of fighters in the operation, perhaps even thousands — another blow to the group, which has suffered for months from Israeli strikes and covert operations against its personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short- and long-term costs of such an operation would be significant. Almost a year of fighting in Gaza has strained the Israeli military, which relies heavily on reserves. Another major operation would place a high burden on Israeli society. Because of the skill of Hezbollah fighters and the years they have had to build tunnels and establish defensive positions, operations may need to move slowly or risk surprise attacks that could lead to significant Israeli casualties or the risk of Hezbollah taking military captives. Even with a cautious approach, Hezbollah likely would impose significant casualties on Israeli forces, as it did in 2006. In addition, a ground invasion could trigger a far more massive Hezbollah rocket and missile attack deeper into Israel, with large numbers of systems launched to overwhelm Israel’s air defenses. These systems could target the whole country and, because Hezbollah has some precision systems, pose a risk to important military and civilian sites. In the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah sustained rocket and missile attacks on Israel for all 34 days of the conflict. Israel’s recent operations against the group, however, may have degraded its ability (and thus its willingness) to engage in a massive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage to Lebanon would be far more severe, with Israeli forces targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters throughout the country. If the Gaza campaign is any guide, Israel would be willing to inflict significant damage to civilian infrastructure and kill many civilians in pursuit of military objectives. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese might be displaced as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vexing issue for Israel is the long-term status of the territory. Before 2000, Hezbollah regularly attacked Israeli forces and their Lebanese allies in the buffer zone, imposing low-level but steady casualties on Israel. Israeli forces were caught in the “Botz HaLevanoni” (the Lebanese muck) for 18 years. Given Israel’s 2000 abandonment of its Lebanese allies, it will struggle to find local allies to maintain the security zone, increasing both the risk of casualties to Israel and the number of troops needed to maintain the buffer zone. Iran would also help Hezbollah rearm and otherwise support the group as it recovers from Israeli attacks. With Israel occupying Lebanese territory, backing for Hezbollah is likely to increase, as Hezbollah can more credibly claim its operations are defensive and seek to restore the country’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these risks, Israel might use a ground invasion supported by an aggressive air campaign to significantly degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities, destroy infrastructure (including tunnels) in the south, withdraw troops to Israel, and threaten to escalate if Hezbollah continues attacking. Economist and military strategist Thomas Schelling writes, “It is the threat of damage, or of more damage to come, that can make someone yield or comply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coercive-air-war&quot;&gt;Coercive Air War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a major ground invasion, Israel might conduct a sustained large-scale air campaign against Hezbollah and perhaps Iran and Iranian-backed groups. In such a scenario, piloted aircraft and drones would attack Hezbollah and other rocket and missile sites, ammunition stockpiles, command-and-control centers, and leadership targets, as well as interdict Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah. In contrast to current operations, far more attacks would occur outside the border zone, especially in Shiite-populated parts of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley, both of which are long-standing Hezbollah strongholds. Such an operation would put far fewer Israeli personnel at risk and otherwise avoid many of the costs to Israel of a ground operation. The operation would have to be sustained for many days. For example, Operation Allied Force, the U.S. air operation that forced Serbia to make concessions on Kosovo, lasted 78 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If successful, such an operation would continue to inflict a high pace of leadership turnover against Hezbollah. As a result, Hezbollah would continue to be off-balance and face difficulty drawing on the full strength of the organization. Attacks on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure would reduce the number of rockets and missiles Israel might face and make it harder for the group to deploy longer-range (and thus larger) systems without risk of detection and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although such an operation would be less destructive to Hezbollah than an Israeli ground operation, the constant killings and destruction might make the group more willing to accept a ceasefire independent of the outcome of the Gaza war. Hezbollah leaders might also fear that ordinary Lebanese would turn against them, blaming the group for Israel’s campaign of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah, of course, might not cave in the face of Israeli pressure. In the past, the group has proved willing to suffer considerable costs, including the loss of its most senior leaders, without abandoning its fight against Israel. Hezbollah may fear the public embarrassment of surrender, especially if Hamas and other Palestinian groups keep fighting. They may also believe they are in a use-or-lose situation with regard to some weapons systems. Moreover, by not using ground troops, Israel would be less effective at rooting out Hezbollah fighters near the border, who might hide underground or among civilians. In addition, the group’s short-range systems are less vulnerable to airpower. Hezbollah will also believe, probably rightly, that Iran will eventually replace many of the weapons systems Hezbollah would lose to air strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, Lebanese civilians would suffer considerably from this operation. The Israeli military claims that many Hezbollah facilities are located near civilian sites and that the group has deliberately put weapons in civilian areas. Several conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah have ended, in part, because of high-profile Israeli attacks that mistakenly killed civilians. However, Israel’s approach to Gaza suggests international condemnations due to civilian deaths matter less in its leaders’ calculations than other factors. This campaign may also take weeks or even months to resolve, far longer than a ground operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hezbollah-counter-escalation&quot;&gt;Hezbollah Counter-Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah and Iran may decide to dramatically escalate operations against Israel. Israel’s recent attacks may lead group leaders to feel that their credibility is at stake if they do not respond. Hezbollah might also feel that Israel’s operations will be unrelenting, even if it does not retaliate, and thus the group may lose capabilities if it does not use them. A Hezbollah and broader Iranian decision to move to all-out war could involve a massive and sustained rocket, missile, and drone assault on Israel as well as limited ground operations on Israeli territory, though such ground operations are unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ground operation would be difficult under the present circumstances. Israel’s leadership attacks and the explosion of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies have made command and control more difficult and thus make it harder for Hezbollah to coordinate a successful ground operation. In addition, Israeli forces on the border are reinforced and prepared for an attack. There would be little chance of surprise, and given the recent successes of Israeli intelligence, Israel may know about the attack well in advance and prepare a devastating response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More dangerous for Israel is Hezbollah’s rocket, missile, and drone arsenal. Although Israeli air strikes have degraded some of this arsenal, Hezbollah still has much of it left, including large numbers of unguided missiles as well as smaller numbers of guided missiles that have the range to strike all of Israel. Hezbollah’s command-and-control systems also may be in chaos due to the various Israeli attacks. If Hezbollah could simultaneously launch large numbers of rockets and missiles, Israeli air defenses would down many, but Hezbollah could probably overwhelm Israeli defenses with massive simultaneous strikes and drone swarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s goals would be as much political as military. If Hezbollah could conduct credible operations against Israel, it would offset some of the damage done to its reputation by Israel’s various intelligence successes. In addition, by inflicting steady punishment on Israelis throughout the country, Hezbollah would try to repeat its 2006 war success, when it created a sense among Israelis that they were involved in an unwinnable war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks for Hezbollah would be considerable. In addition to losing many of its fighters in ground attacks, the group might have an uncoordinated response and inflict only limited damage upon Israel, a further humiliation. Lebanon would suffer considerably from the Israeli response, and many Lebanese would blame Hezbollah, as well as Israel, for the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah may count on help from Iran, though Iran’s anemic response to Israeli attacks so far, its weak conventional military, and its distance from the theater make it a limited partner. Nevertheless, Iran would likely replenish Hezbollah’s matériel losses and provide financial support to help the group recover, as it did in 2006. Iran has also increasingly signaled its willingness to directly attack Israel in response to the Israeli threat to Hezbollah, and the Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack will risk further escalation between the two regional powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options-for-mitigating-a-war&quot;&gt;Options for Mitigating a War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has engaged in near-constant diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah since the crisis began. Although U.S. efforts have clearly failed, the United States did help convince Israel not to launch a preemptive strike on Hezbollah in the days after the October attack. Moreover, the United States has probably helped deter Iran from increasing its direct role and may be a factor in Hezbollah’s decision, so far, not to escalate to all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amos Hochstein is the face of U.S. diplomacy in the Lebanon crisis, often working with French, and at times German, officials. He has put forward a plan to relocate Hezbollah forces north of the Blue Line and end Israeli overflights of Lebanon, which violate UNSCR 1701. Hochstein has advocated for additional observers (potentially from Germany) to the 13,000 UNIFIL troops deployed in southern Lebanon to better monitor potential Hezbollah activity there. Hezbollah, however, claims it will not end its attacks as long as Hamas is fighting, a stance it reiterated after the Nasrallah killing. Israeli officials claim diplomacy alone will not bring a ceasefire, and they call for Hezbollah to abide by UNSCR 1701, which prohibits the group from placing fighters near the Israeli border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States has pushed for a diplomatic settlement, however, it has supported Israel militarily with equipment, ammunition, air defense, and intelligence, and it could continue to do so as a way to increase pressure on Hezbollah. Given the risk of all-out war, however, U.S. officials should redouble efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, even if they cannot achieve one in Gaza. Hezbollah, given its recent losses, may be open to a ceasefire if it can occur in a face-saving way, which in practice may mean after Hezbollah successfully conducts a significant attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, experts like Middle East analyst Robert Satloff contend the United States might push for an informal deal where both sides suspend or significantly curb cross-border fire and civilians return to their homes. Under this proposal, Hezbollah would remove its major military systems from the area near the Israeli border. An Israeli concession would allow Hezbollah’s forces to return to the border but not in uniform or as part of large formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these diplomatic initiatives, a lasting ceasefire will be difficult to achieve. The October 7 Hamas attack was a landmark moment for Israel’s government and population, exacerbating the country’s insecurity. The best that negotiators may be able to achieve is managing the escalation of violence and preventing an all-out war that devastates much of Lebanon and expands into Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea remains one of the most opaque nuclear states in the world, offering little information about its nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) and weapons programme. Yet, the structure and scope of its programme have significant implications for global stability. There is a need for a robust analytical methodology that can derive insights from limited data to assess North Korea’s NFC and nuclear strategy. Such analysis is crucial for the international community, particularly should diplomatic avenues reopen, providing a rare opportunity to curtail or reverse North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on work conducted by the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC) to model North Korea’s NFC. It integrates VERTIC’s estimates of North Korea’s production of weapons-usable fissile material – specifically weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) – into a comprehensive framework that assesses Pyongyang’s nuclear strategy. By examining the trade-offs in arsenal structure amid fissile-material constraints, the paper offers a nuanced exploration of North Korea’s approach to deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s nuclear arsenal serves two purposes: to deter distant nuclear powers such as the US; and to counter nearby non-nuclear adversaries such as South Korea, United States Forces Korea and Japan. Should deterrence fail, North Korea aims to contain and win any conflict on the Korean Peninsula, ensuring the regime’s survival. To meet these objectives, North Korea appears to be developing both a strategic and more versatile arsenal – featuring smaller-yield weapons and varied delivery platforms – for regional and battlefield use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper delves into the various strategies North Korea might employ to optimise its arsenal, given its fissile-material constraints. Based on the analysis of force-structure requirements to achieve credible deterrence, it is assessed that North Korea might aim to develop 25–35 strategic thermonuclear warheads and 80–200 short- and medium-range single-stage warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its fissile-material inventory at the end of 2023, as analysed by VERTIC, North Korea might have already developed approximately 21–23 composite (plutonium and HEU) thermonuclear warheads. With its remaining HEU inventory, the state could additionally have manufactured 51–165 single-stage nuclear warheads, supporting its regional deterrence goals (via tactical and battlefield deployment). Although North Korea is still likely constrained by its plutonium supply, evidence suggests that its nuclear material production goals may have been met or are nearing sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, North Korea may choose to work within its existing fissile-material resources, deeming its arsenal adequate. Alternatively, it might ramp up production to exceed current needs, maintain a surplus stockpile or continue enhancing its arsenal’s capabilities to align with the availability of its fissile material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the future trajectory of North Korea’s nuclear strategy remains uncertain, this paper provides an analytical framework that enriches understanding of North Korea’s nuclear force structure given its fissile-material production. By offering these insights, the paper seeks to advance a more informed international dialogue, recognising the critical need for preparedness in the face of limited information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea provides very little information to the international community about its nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) and nuclear weapons programme. However, the structure and extent of its programme impacts geopolitical stability. An analytical methodology that can work with only limited data to assess both North Korea’s NFC and its nuclear arsenal strategy is therefore crucial. Such a methodology would help to prepare the international community should negotiations restart with North Korea and an opportunity present itself to restrain or roll back its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC), the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) and RUSI, with funding from Global Affairs Canada, embarked on a multi-year project to assess the entirety of North Korea’s WMD programme. For the nuclear programme, the whole NFC was modelled – from uranium mining to weapons-grade material production – using software provided by the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (a process hereafter referred to as the “VERTIC model”), with the help of open source information, including extensive satellite imagery analysis. The result of this work was a range of estimates of North Korea’s inventory of fissile material, given different plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this analysis, conducted by the Open Nuclear Network (ONN), a programme of PAX sapiens, is to take the fissile-material inventory as it stood at the end of 2023 and assess North Korea’s nuclear force structure. It specifically aims to address two research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What key fissile-material demands are derived from various strategies that North Korea might adopt to structure its nuclear arsenal?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might North Korea’s nuclear arsenal structure have been affected by fissile-material constraints?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has four chapters. Chapter I explores North Korea’s nuclear strategy, Chapter II examines its potential nuclear arsenal size and Chapter III addresses the potential designs of its nuclear weapons. Chapter IV then explores the fissile-material demands and constraints that might affect each of those areas. The paper concludes with overall observations and future recommended work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete answers to the above research questions can only be provided by a handful of North Korean leaders and nuclear decision-makers. Nonetheless, ONN provides here an analytical framework with which to evaluate North Korea’s nuclear weapons strategy, including examining trade-offs that the country must consider when deciding how to structure its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the first research question, ONN analysed the composition of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. This encompassed a comprehensive literature review of North Korea’s nuclear strategy, arsenal size and weapons designs. This aided in evaluating North Korea’s declared nuclear strategy and identifying the types of weapons developed, quantities of weapons required for different deterrence strategies and the corresponding amount of fissile material. Further evaluation was made of the nuclear weapon varieties and potential designs. This primarily entailed measurements based on accessible open source images of North Korean nuclear armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the second research question, ONN took the cumulative fissile-material inventory estimates – as they stood at the end of 2023 – from the VERTIC model, assessed trade-offs North Korea might make under fissile-material constraints and analysed other areas that may potentially constrain the programme (such as tritium production and high-explosives testing capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this picture of North Korea’s fissile-material demands and constraints, several conclusions were drawn about what North Korea’s current nuclear weapons arsenal may look like and how the state might be hoping to develop its nuclear weapons programme in the future. While the fissile-material models ran to the end of 2023, the analysis was completed by March 2024. The methodology presented here can be adapted if assumptions change or new information is revealed. This allows changes in the arsenal and fissile-material demands/constraints to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear bounding constraints or design imperatives deriving from the development of delivery systems that are relevant to fissile-material requirements. However, this study does not consider in detail the implications for weapons design of the development of specific North Korean delivery systems. This research also focused primarily on analysing the present situation; historical situations are considered only to provide clarity on the present. These two aspects, in addition to other recommended follow-on work, are discussed further in Conclusions at the end of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-nuclear-strategy&quot;&gt;I. Nuclear Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a state publication from 2013, North Korea classifies weapon size according to yield (with “super-large” above 1 megatonne, all the way down to “super-miniaturised” at less than 1 kilotonne). North Korea reportedly further classifies its nuclear arsenal by use: tactical (to destroy personnel and equipment on the frontline or operational tactical depth zone via tactical ballistic missiles or artillery shells); battlefield (to strike regional targets via medium-range missiles); and strategic (to strike large cities, industrial centres and other strategic targets via intercontinental or submarine-launched ballistic missiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to state media, North Korea has begun to gradually shift its nuclear strategy from solely intending nuclear weapons for strategic deterrence to including potential regional and battlefield use. Additionally, North Korea is looking to diversify its nuclear forces to operate in a variety of environments and with a variety of delivery means and ranges, including greater emphasis on the nuclearisation of North Korea’s navy. This means developing nuclear weapons with a range of yields that can be delivered by a wide range of platforms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, North Korea released its codified nuclear doctrine, the Law of the Supreme People’s Assembly of the DPRK on the State Policy on the Nuclear Forces. The new law is a departure from its 2013 Law on Consolidating Position of Nuclear Weapons State, primarily in that it provides more details on North Korea’s nuclear command and control. It also specifies the following conditions for nuclear weapons use, which were absent from the 2013 law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In case an attack by nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case a nuclear or non-nuclear attack by hostile forces on the state leadership and the command organization of the state’s nuclear forces was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case a fatal military attack against important strategic objects of the state was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case the need for operation for preventing the expansion and protraction of a war and taking the initiative in the war in contingency is inevitably raised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other case an inevitable situation in which it is compelled to correspond with catastrophic crisis to the existence of the state and safety of the people by only nuclear weapons is created.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un also stated that North Korea’s “status as a nuclear weapons state has now become irreversible” and there would be no more denuclearisation talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further attempting to solidify its position as a nuclear state, in September 2023 North Korea amended its constitution to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea relies on the all-people, nationwide defence system. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as a committed nuclear state, shall accelerate the development of nuclear weapons to ensure its rights to existence and development, deter war and safeguard peace and stability of the region and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this amendment, North Korea is now the only nuclear-armed state to have any reference to nuclear weapons in its constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 2023, changes in the political landscape may have implications for North Korea’s nuclear strategy. One such change is the reclassification of South Korea as the “principal enemy”, departing from a previous relationship aimed at unification. This shift followed North Korea’s complete suspension in November 2023 of the Comprehensive Military Agreement, accompanied by the remilitarisation of former buffer zones. Subsequently, North Korea’s rhetoric towards South Korea has become more confrontational, evidenced by tests and inspections of close-combat weaponry, and strategic maps of Seoul. These developments may lead to greater emphasis on the development of tactical and battlefield nuclear warheads. Reported and observed technical advancements also indicate a continued expansion of medium- and long-range missiles and the development of space capabilities. Notable examples include the testing of a new solid-fuelled intermediate-range ballistic missile equipped with a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle payload, another ICBM test and North Korea’s first successful spy satellite launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements and actions, taken together, suggest that North Korea is looking to deter both a large, distant nuclear adversary (that is, the US) and a range of regional conventionally superior, non-nuclear adversaries (that is, South Korea, United States Forces Korea (USFK) and Japan) by making its arsenal useable (with smaller yields, a greater variety of platforms and an acknowledgement of battlefield use). This approach is consistent with its stated goals of being able to deter, contain and win a conflict on the Korean Peninsula in order to preserve the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-nuclear-arsenal-size&quot;&gt;II. Nuclear Arsenal Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores North Korea’s potential nuclear arsenal size. First, a literature review is presented of external open source estimates of North Korea’s fissile material and nuclear weapons amounts. Following this, a potential numerical force structure is developed through analyses of likely defence needs and analogous nuclear weapon programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External evaluations from the time of North Korea’s last reprocessing campaign in 2022 to the analysis cut-off period of March 2024 provide a range of assessments about the amounts and types of nuclear material and weapons that North Korea possesses (Table 1). These align closely with the outputs from the VERTIC model and ONN’s subsequent analysis (discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Gav575H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: External Open Source Estimates of North Korea’s Fissile-Material and Nuclear Weapons Amounts from 2022 to March 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors. Note: Additional open source estimates have been released since the end date of this analysis (March 2024) and are included in a separate literature review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-numerical-force-structure&quot;&gt;Potential Numerical Force Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on North Korea’s own definitions, the country seems to divide its arsenal into strategic (long-range), battlefield (medium-range) and tactical (short-range) nuclear weapons. ONN has used these categories in its own analysis of the potential number of weapons that North Korea may be seeking to fulfil its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Weaponry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic weaponry of North Korea’s arsenal is seemingly aimed at deterring the US from invading or attacking the country – such an invasion would present an existential risk to the regime. Given this overarching goal, it is plausible to assume that North Korea views the US as minimally deterred if North Korea can, with a strategic nuclear weapon, hold at least one target on the continental US at risk. To do this, North Korea might seek a quantitative capacity that would be significantly likely to breach US missile defences working at optimal performance levels. This assumes a conservative level of North Korean risk tolerance. If North Korea is prepared to take on more risk, the country might require a smaller strategic arsenal to accomplish its desired level of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US ICBM defence architecture contains 44 ground-based interceptors (GBIs), based in Alaska and California. At least two GBIs would be fired per incoming re-entry vehicle (RV), meaning these 44 GBIs might intercept 22 RVs, assuming the capacity for simultaneous launch. An additional 20 GBIs will reportedly be added by 2026, meaning eventually 32 RVs might be intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be reasonably confident that at least one nuclear weapon would breach US missile defences and strike a target on the mainland, North Korea would need to launch at least 23 weapons loaded on separate ICBM RVs (33 by 2026). For the purposes of this analysis, 25–35 weapons is the range considered, given that at least two weapons will likely be undergoing maintenance or be in transport at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “worst-case” estimate – from North Korea’s perspective – assumes perfect operation of US missile defence and that North Korea does not take evasive measures (for example, dummy RVs). As mentioned above, modified assumptions may mean that North Korea might be satisfied with a smaller strategic arsenal. On the other hand, varying the assumptions might end up with North Korea requiring a larger strategic arsenal; for example, to account for the potential for missile or warhead failures, or the loss of nuclear weapons due to an attack before they can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical and Battlefield Weaponry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical and battlefield weaponry of the North Korean arsenal is aimed at deterring large-scale attacks or invasion from South Korea, USFK and Japan by establishing the threat that North Korea has the capability and willingness to use nuclear weapons in the region (either on the frontlines or at regional targets on the Korean Peninsula, Japan or surrounding areas). The number of weapons North Korea might be building for this portion of its nuclear arsenal is more difficult to assess. What constitutes “enough” weapons for warfighting or regional use varies state to state and person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible insight into North Korea’s tactical strategy was provided in the March 2023 reveal of the Hwasan-31, a new type of nuclear warhead that was depicted as part of eight different delivery systems. While this may or may not be an accurate representation of North Korea’s current capabilities or actual intent, it does suggest one way North Korea may decide to shape its arsenal: with nuclear weapons on a variety of delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to assess how many weapons per delivery system North Korea might be aiming to deploy. These could be all the same design but mated to specific, different delivery systems. Or they could be different designs made specifically for deployment on one type of delivery system. The implications for fissile-material amounts are negligible. There is no universally accepted way to assess this, as every state has vastly different strategies when deciding how many warheads should be deployed on each delivery system. Additionally, there are even fewer states that actively deploy tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the probable compositions of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals are helpful guides as each of these states is trying to hold many targets at risk in their neighbour’s territory. Hans M Kristensen and Matt Korda assessed that for these states there are 10–25 warheads mated to each delivery vehicle type. This range can be used to consider the North Korean arsenal. Parts of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals are for similar uses – on short- or medium-range ballistic missiles – and are relatively small nuclear programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If 10–25 warheads are similarly mated to each of North Korea’s eight notional delivery systems, North Korea could aim to have 80–200 tactical weapons deployed. This would presumably be “enough” tactical and battlefield nuclear weapons for warfighting, as it would allow the state to hold at least 80 targets at risk, both on the Korean Peninsula and further afield in the Northeast Asia region. As discussed earlier, there are many potential targets in the region for North Korea’s tactical and battlefield nuclear weapons, and this number provides flexibility and extensive coverage for the country’s targeting plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the strategic arsenal, varying any of these underlying assumptions might mean a larger tactical and battlefield arsenal (for instance, to account for greater caution on the potential for missile or warhead failures, the loss of nuclear weapons due to an attack before they can be used, a larger set of identified targets, or more warheads per system) or a smaller one (such as to account for a higher level of North Korean risk tolerance, or fewer delivery systems or warheads per system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-nuclear-weapons-designs&quot;&gt;III. Nuclear Weapons Designs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter analyses potential nuclear weapon designs North Korea may have incorporated into its arsenal. First, a literature review is presented, followed by a summary of imagery analysis conducted on North Korea’s displayed nuclear devices. This is followed by a discussion on design element trade-offs, and concludes with a list of designs North Korea may have developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;literature-review-1&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External experts and analysts have suggested that North Korea may have tested or may be developing the following possible nuclear weapons designs. Not all listed designs are considered plausible (either by the original authors or ONN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single-stage device:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 15-kt device, with a diameter of 40–60 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An HEU device with a total warhead weight of 500 kg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unboosted 250-kt HEU device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tactical warhead (Hwasan-31) with a levitated pit capable of being used in different delivery vehicles, and with a diameter of 40–45 cm and yield of 10 kt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 15-kt composite core made of a 2-kg plutonium sphere with 10–15 kg of HEU shells.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thermonuclear “layer cake” device with a 3.5-kg plutonium core, 80 kg of uranium (HEU, low-enriched uranium and natural uranium), and lithium-6 deuteride and lithium-6 deuterium-tritium shells.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two-stage device:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A thermonuclear device with a 4-kg plutonium primary and a 37–40-kg HEU secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other analysts have been less specific in suggesting possible designs, although several have assumed when conducting their calculations that an average of 4 kg of plutonium or 12–20 kg of HEU is used per weapon, depending on whether the weapon uses only plutonium or only HEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;imagery-analysis&quot;&gt;Imagery Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the size of each device shown by North Korea can be used to obtain bounding constraints on the possible designs of North Korea’s devices. The amount of fissile material and designs do not correlate exactly to size. Nonetheless, it is an important aspect to assess, as North Korea releases relatively little data and only a handful of images of these devices exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN independently conducted an analysis of open source images of nuclear devices, released by North Korea, to generate the size estimates. The results are published separately and are summarised below. These estimates of maximum device diameter are a guide to the potential sizes of North Korean nuclear devices and show the country’s desire to move towards more complex and compact designs. While the devices shown may be fake, their very release at the least indicates some sort of drive or desire for these types of weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Composite Pit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its third test, some assessed that North Korea used an HEU or composite pit. If it did, this would mirror the Soviet Union’s third test, which used a composite plutonium-HEU pit. As a late mover, North Korea has a relative technological advantage, lending weight to the argument that the country has diversified its fissile-material use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gas Boosting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gas boosting would increase yield and allow for more advanced miniaturisation, it is unlikely that North Korea has incorporated this design into its arsenal, although it is technically possible. To do so, North Korea’s programme, as with earlier programmes of other states, would have to overcome several issues, such as gaseous tritium/deuterium storage and handling, tritium production and integration of such materials into the weapons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gaseous Tritium/Deuterium
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaseous tritium/deuterium, which can be used for boosting the primary, creates challenges in handling and storing within a warhead system. There is potential leakage under very high pressure, which increases as tritium decays. This is exacerbated by the radioactive decay specifically to helium, which accelerates cracking in imperfections in the metal lattice of the containment vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in storage, gaseous tritium “leaks” from containers, and will cause pressure increases in its containers due to radioactive decay. Tritium stored in a solid matrix, such as in uranium or palladium metal, is easier to handle and ship; however, the process to recover the tritium can be difficult depending on the metal used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tritium has a half-life of 12.26 years, 5.7% decays per year, requiring any nuclear-armed state incorporating gas boosting to manufacture tritium close to the date of a test or use in any weapon, to prevent as much decay as possible and lower the risk of storage incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tritium Production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from the VERTIC model, North Korea’s NFC can produce 3–17 g of tritium per year depending on how much of its plutonium and HEU production North Korea is willing to sacrifice; there are trade-offs between tritium production on the one hand, and plutonium and HEU production on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapons Integration
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, gas boosting has required significant testing to ensure its reliability. As North Korea has only conducted six tests, it is unlikely to have mastered this technology, which eluded other nuclear-armed states until they were well into their testing programmes. Confidence in a boosted system requires significant testing, especially as it is a potential single point of failure for the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as mentioned above, tritium’s short half-life requires that it is regularly changed out of the weapon, thus increasing maintenance time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given such difficulties, the lack of technical necessity or security imperative and the lack of announcements from North Korea’s government, ONN assesses that North Korea is unlikely to be employing gas boosting in its nuclear weapons. North Korea might instead be opting for the more abundant lithium-deuteride fusion fuel, which would remove some logistical burden in handling tritium directly, eliminate the half-life issues and allow for production in situ when the secondary is initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these considerations, North Korea has likely decided to use more proven designs that can still produce considerable yield without sacrificing reliability and safety. This area should be monitored for further developments as this is likely a technology North Korea is eager to master, allowing for greater yield at lower warhead weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thermonuclear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN assesses that North Korea already has a fielded thermonuclear weapon, likely demonstrated in its most recent test. This is consistent with, for example, China’s programme, which designed and tested a two-stage thermonuclear device within five nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lithium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-6 can be used to breed tritium (which is used in fusion reactions), either directly in a thermonuclear weapon or in a nuclear reactor via neutron activation. Open source information indicates only a few kilograms are used per weapon. According to the available literature, it appears that North Korea has access to millions of tonnes of natural lithium (both through domestic reserves and dual-use imports), and the capability to enrich to higher concentrations of lithium-6 at its Hungnam Chemical Complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these external assessments, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that North Korea has enough lithium, and in particular lithium-6, for use in any thermonuclear arsenal it has built or plans to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beryllium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beryllium can be used in nuclear weapons as a neutron reflector to increase the fissioning efficiency of the nuclear material, thus requiring less fissile material to produce a critical mass. North Korea has known reserves of beryllium and, although little is known about the exact amount, based on geological data from the 1950s, they are assumed to amount to at least thousands, if not millions, of tonnes. Additionally, there is data suggesting that North Korea sent beryl for processing to the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It is unknown if there are any current processing capabilities in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are uncertainties, this analysis assumes – based on the limited evidence available – that beryllium is not a constraint on North Korea’s weaponisation strategy. This is especially the case as other materials can be substituted for beryllium in nuclear weapons applications. Should additional information come to light, this assumption should be revisited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Explosives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High explosives are used to achieve criticality in nuclear devices, while also having numerous non-nuclear military applications. There is an abundance of raw materials and production techniques known to exist in North Korea for high-explosives manufacturing, and a lack of any indication that the country is having issues with supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea conducted high-explosives tests at the Yongbyon Nuclear Complex in the 1980s and 1990s. Since the 1990s, media and research articles have repeatedly associated Yongdoktong (approximately 40 km northwest of Yongbyon) with the country’s nuclear weapons programme, specifically in connection to high-explosive tests and storage, and the storage of nuclear weapons. According to ONN’s analysis of available satellite images, the Yongdoktong site has a number of locations with features similar to other high-explosives testing sites (such as enclosed structures to avoid blast effects and a monitoring area). The site has underground facilities with multiple entrances, and activities related to excavation and construction have been seen. North Korea has demonstrated its ability to manufacture high explosives for its six nuclear tests and numerous non-nuclear tests. Thus, it is assessed that high explosives are not a constraint on nuclear weapons manufacturing in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modelling and Simulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify nuclear weapons design information and gain insight from nuclear weapons tests, some modelling and simulation capabilities are necessary. Of course, testing is a form of design verification, but the more modelling capability a state possesses, the better it can interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has clearly developed expertise with weaponisation-relevant codes (receiving valuable early assistance on nuclear weapons designs from A Q Khan), as demonstrated by its training of others on these codes. In 2011, it was reported that North Korea had provided Iran with a US-origin computer program. This program simulated neutron flows and would help with nuclear weapons development. North Korea also trained Iranian specialists to establish and maintain proficiency with the software. Furthermore, North Korea was linked to participation in the provision of “mathematical formulas and codes for theoretical design work” in Iran. It is unknown how much of this expertise was indigenously developed or learned from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis assumes that North Korea has sufficient competencies to model and simulate nuclear devices. Further in-depth analysis of this aspect of North Korea’s weaponisation programme is needed for additional clarity and insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Weaponisation-Relevant Equipment and Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, it can be difficult to assess the availability of weaponisation-relevant technologies (such as specialised machining equipment, high-speed cameras or other monitoring equipment used for nuclear weapons testing) because of the lack of open source information, including international trade and domestic commercial data. Due to the focus of this paper, an in-depth analysis of these issues was not conducted, but could be explored in further analysis. Difficulties in procuring such equipment and technology could constitute a significant complication for North Korea’s nuclear strategy. However, as North Korea has demonstrated its ability to conduct nuclear tests despite these limitations, it can be assumed for this study that other weaponisation-relevant technologies are not a major constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potentially-incorporated-designs&quot;&gt;Potentially Incorporated Designs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the discussion presented in this chapter, ONN has assessed that the six nuclear devices tested and incorporated into North Korea’s arsenal are likely one of the following designs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implosion-based single-stage device with a levitated pit made of plutonium, HEU or a composite of plutonium and HEU.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two-stage thermonuclear device that incorporates a version of its single-stage device as the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has likely explored several designs that could be considered more reliable (that is, those that will produce the designed yield when detonated) and, conversely, more technically sophisticated (that is, miniaturised weapons). The state has displayed what was indicated to be a thermonuclear weapon and a tactical weapon, designed to be deployed on a number of delivery vehicle types. Therefore, to understand the full range of North Korean force structure strategies and provide a fully exhaustive assessment, it is assumed that the country has built both single-stage implosion devices and a two-stage thermonuclear device. These devices would satisfy the two purposes of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and allow the state to diversify its nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely design selection for the strategic weaponry is a two-stage thermonuclear device, given that North Korea defines its strategic weapons as ones that will strike large cities, industrial centres and other strategic targets. It is certainly possible that North Korea has single-stage implosion devices in its strategic arsenal. However, based on the country’s own definition, this analysis assesses that “strategic” means two-stage thermonuclear. Should this assumption be modified, the analysis could be adapted to account for another composition of the strategic arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely warhead design for the tactical/battlefield part of North Korea’s arsenal is a single-stage implosion device, as it would be used in proximity to North Korea’s own forces and homeland. Tactical/battlefield nuclear weapons could be two-stage thermonuclear weapons, and thermonuclear weapons could be designed with lower yields to prevent harm to friendly troops. However, based solely on North Korea’s own definition, ONN assesses that tactical/battlefield is a lower-yield, single-stage device. The most likely candidate for this is the Hwasan-31, as it is the only reported tactical weapon North Korea has shown. If any of these assumptions were modified, the analysis could be adapted to account for another composition of the tactical/battlefield arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-fissile-material-demands-and-constraints&quot;&gt;IV. Fissile-Material Demands and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the intersection between fissile-material demands and constraints, and how this interplay could affect North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fissile-material-demands-from-potential-force-structure-and-designs&quot;&gt;Fissile-Material Demands from Potential Force Structure and Designs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all the considerations presented, North Korea has many choices for how to structure its arsenal to optimise its fissile-material use while also accomplishing its geopolitical and security objectives. For this analysis, ONN has identified plausible arsenal configurations and derived the associated fissile-material demands of these arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Arsenal Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following assessments about the fissile materials potentially used in North Korea’s strategic arsenal are made based on nuclear physics principles and assumptions made in open sources. The figures shown in Table 2 represent the final amounts of fissile materials in each two-stage thermonuclear device (losses due to the weaponisation process are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All plutonium: 4 kg of weapons-grade plutonium per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All HEU: 12–15 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixed-material: 2–4 kg of weapons-grade plutonium and 10 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical/Battlefield Arsenal Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following assessments about the fissile materials potentially used in North Korea’s tactical and battlefield nuclear warheads are made based on nuclear physics principles and assumptions made in open sources. The figures shown in Table 3 represent the final amounts of fissile materials in each single-stage nuclear device (losses due to the weaponisation process are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-plutonium pit: 4–6 kg of weapons-grade plutonium per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-HEU pit: 10–12 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Composite pit: 2 kg of weapons-grade plutonium and 8–10 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Fissile-Material Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should North Korea be fielding an all-plutonium arsenal, based on the options presented, it would need 420–1,340 kg of plutonium. For an all-HEU arsenal, it would require 1,100–2,925 kg of HEU. For an arsenal made of composite pits, it would require 210–540 kg of plutonium and 890–2,350 kg of HEU. There are of course ranges in between, should there be different mixes of weapon types (such as ½ plutonium, ½ HEU; ⅓ plutonium, ⅓ HEU, ⅓ composite); the estimates here represent the extremes of fissile-material demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures in Table 4 represent the nuclear material actually used in the device (losses from machining and fabrication are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fissile-material-production&quot;&gt;Fissile-Material Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is a naturally occurring element. In its natural form, it mostly consists of the isotope U-238 with very small (less than 1%) amounts of the isotope U-235. To manufacture most fuel for nuclear reactors, uranium needs to be enriched to approximately 3–5% U-235 to create the proper fission dynamics. For nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be highly enriched, at over 20% U-235, although the ideal enrichment level is over 85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various isotopes of plutonium are produced via fissioning of uranium in a nuclear reactor, typically consisting of approximately 24% Pu-240. For use in nuclear weapons, the amount of Pu-240 needed for practical purposes is less than 7% of the total amount of plutonium, which corresponds to 93% Pu-239. This can be accomplished by configuring the nuclear reactor fuel in specific ways to produce this “weapons-grade plutonium” and thus optimise the amount of Pu-239. However, the plutonium products must be separated from the rest of the spent reactor fuel via reprocessing, and then further refined into a form usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VERTIC ran three different fissile-material production scenarios (as of 2023) in its NFC model for ONN to produce cumulative totals of fissile material produced in North Korea. All scenarios assume no plutonium production prior to 1991 and no HEU production prior to 2003, and only significantly vary in the HEU production estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first scenario is based on analyses from Siegfried S Hecker at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a second large clandestine centrifuge facility that may be Kangson or some facility not yet identified in open sources … Hecker, under this scenario, assumes a pilot plant with two cascades (660 centrifuges) and a SWU/centrifuge of 4. The UEW [uranium enrichment workshop at Yongbyon] then has 8000 SWU/year from 2010-2015 and 16,000 SWU/year from 2016 onwards. A clandestine facility is constructed in 2013-2014 and expanded in 2017-2018 for a total 35,000 SWU/year. Hecker’s analysis is based on North Korea’s annual production capability of rotors, with two flow-forming machines between them capable of producing 1500 P2 rotors/year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is based on analyses from David Albright at the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the UEW [Uranium Enrichment Workshop] at Yongbyon is the largest centrifuge facility and only a pilot plant exists alongside this, responsible for all pre-2010 evidence of enrichment. In this scenario, Albright takes Hecker’s estimate of 2000 P2-type centrifuges observed in the UEW and assumes a four-stage enrichment process as observed in Libya … and operational challenges with the centrifuges that reduces a 5 SWU/centrifuge effectively by a third for a total SWU/year for the plant of 6500 from 2010 to 2015 and 10,000-13,000 from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third scenario is also based on analyses from David Albright at ISIS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, there is a second large clandestine centrifuge facility that may be Kangson or some facility not yet identified in open sources. Albright in this scenario assumes the clandestine facility becomes operational from 2005-2010 with a comparable size to the UEW for total SWU/year of 26,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outputs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 5, all three scenarios generally agree that North Korea has produced 64–65 kg of plutonium enriched to weapons grade (98% Pu-239). The three scenarios, however, indicate vastly different HEU (88–89% U-235) accumulations, ranging from 868 kg to 2,111 kg. This large difference in uranium largely stems from the external community’s uncertainty about North Korea’s uranium enrichment programme, as detailed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-fissile-material-losses&quot;&gt;Potential Fissile-Material Losses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN assumes that losses due to production and experimentation, and keeping some material in storage for excess, should account for around 10% of total fissile-material availability. Estimations of fissile-material losses are difficult to assess due to secrecy surrounding the manufacturing process. An initial estimate of 10% was chosen, as material losses from the NFC are already accounted for within the VERTIC model. This is therefore a reasonable starting point for the losses due to weaponisation. See Table 7 for the adjusted fissile-material availability numbers as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the information that is both known and assumed about North Korea’s nuclear tests, the likely fissile material available at the time of the test, and its nuclear strategy, the assessment in Table 6 was made about the devices tested by the country thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7FeiVe4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 6: North Korean Nuclear Tests and Assumed Devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjusted Fissile-Material Availability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the assessments of the fissile material consumed via losses (see above) and testing (presented in the “ONN Device Assessment” column in Table 6), the total fissile-material inventory available for North Korea’s nuclear weapons arsenal was adjusted to the amounts shown in Table 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plutonium-versus-uranium-weapons&quot;&gt;Plutonium Versus Uranium Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weaponry using plutonium is aligned with North Korea’s overarching nuclear strategy aimed at deterring the US. This approach allows lighter-weight strategic weapons to fit on ICBMs. As its nuclear doctrine evolves, North Korea is incorporating more tactical and battlefield weapons into its nuclear approach, facilitated by its accumulated stockpile of HEU. The accessibility of HEU provides the state with increased flexibility in crafting a variety of tactical/battlefield nuclear weapons, stemming from the ability to design devices with various arrangements of fissile materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is also possible that HEU is used in North Korea’s strategic nuclear weapons in combination with plutonium in the primary, as this configuration would allow the state’s limited stockpile of plutonium to be stretched much further. Additionally, HEU was likely first produced in 2003, before North Korea’s first test in 2006, which means it is highly likely that HEU is in at least some of the test devices (to confirm reliability), including the strategic weapon tested in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparison-with-demands&quot;&gt;Comparison with Demands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis of North Korea’s demands, it was concluded that the state may be aiming to develop at least 25–35 strategic thermonuclear warheads and 80–200 tactical and battlefield fission devices to meet its geopolitical and security objectives. Given the fissile-materials constraints presented here, it is likely that North Korea has not yet accomplished this goal – although it could be very close – as it has not yet produced sufficient quantities of nuclear material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should North Korea intend to produce 25 composite thermonuclear weapons, it would, at a minimum, need 2 kg of plutonium and 10 kg of HEU per weapon, leading to a demand of 50 kg of plutonium and 250 kg of HEU. Given the material constraints presented in Table 7, North Korea would have been able to produce 21–23 devices of this type, using at least 42–46 kg of plutonium and 210–30 kg of HEU. This leaves a deficit of 2–4 strategic thermonuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tactical and battlefield mission of its nuclear arsenal was added after its strategic mission, it is assumed that North Korea would work to accomplish its strategic nuclear requirements before its tactical ones. The use of nuclear materials for strategic weapons described above would leave minimal plutonium (0 or 0.5 kg) but large quantities of HEU (513–1,652 kg) remaining for the tactical and battlefield mission, which could be accomplished with only HEU. As assumed before, North Korea would need at least 10 kg of HEU per tactical and battlefield weapon for a single-stage, all-HEU device. This indicates that North Korea could have 51–165 weapons after production losses and testing, which could already or nearly fulfil its tactical and battlefield deterrence objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should any of the underlying assumptions in this analysis be modified, this final weapons deficit could end up being larger or even result in a surplus. Additionally, any further data that would require adjustments to the VERTIC model or underlying assumptions made there would require adjustments to the figures derived in this analysis. As North Korea reveals so little information, any further information that confirms or changes these inputs and assumptions will greatly increase the precision and accuracy of these analytical outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is likely diversifying its nuclear force to operate in a variety of environments and with a variety of delivery means. Relatedly, the country looks to be continuing to move towards a nuclear strategy with two purposes: to deter both a large nuclear adversary (that is, the US); and a range of regional conventionally superior, non-nuclear adversaries (that is, South Korea, USFK and Japan) by making its arsenal useable. Based on this potential dual focus of North Korea’s arsenal, the state is likely developing at least three different categories of weaponry: strategic; battlefield; and tactical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for how North Korea can structure its arsenal to optimise its fissile-material use and demands while also accomplishing its deterrence objectives. To meet its objective in deterring the US, one possibility is that North Korea could strive for at least 25 strategic thermonuclear warheads, with the eventual goal of 35 based on the 2026 target delivery date for the expansion of US missile defences. Based on calculations of North Korea’s potential available fissile materials as of 2023, the state could have sufficient material to enable it to have already developed 21–23 thermonuclear warheads. After developing its strategic thermonuclear devices, North Korea would have enough HEU remaining to manufacture 51–165 single-stage nuclear warheads, thereby also potentially addressing its regional objectives (which could be 80–200 warheads, although if underlying assumptions change, this goal could change as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is clear that North Korea is still operating under some fissile-material constraints, especially regarding plutonium, both the strategic and tactical/battlefield objectives have either been met or are approaching nuclear material sufficiency. The state could therefore decide to work within the current fissile-material inventory and determine that its weapons demands have been sufficiently met at this point, without any further expansion of nuclear material production. Alternatively, North Korea could continue producing fissile material at a quick pace to either: catch up to full current demands if they have not yet been met; exceed its defence demands and maintain an excess stockpile of fissile material without expanding the weapons arsenal; or restructure its nuclear strategy to continue to add defence capabilities to fit its fissile-material supply. However, as North Korea moves from an early-stage programme a more established one, like other nuclear states it will likely continue to make nuclear material in excess of defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a handful of arsenal options that North Korea may be considering. Without more information, it is not possible to know precisely what North Korea is trying to achieve with its nuclear weapons programme. This analysis provides an analytical framework and points of discussion to stimulate a transparent and detailed conversation about the types of choices and trade-offs that North Korea is making on nuclear force structure and fissile-material production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-recommended-research&quot;&gt;Future Recommended Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several follow-on analyses that would be beneficial to better understand some underexplored areas that ONN identified while developing this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of North Korea’s nuclear strategy further into the future (that is, 15–20 years) is already underway to consider how the state might expand and structure its NFC to meet its long-term fissile-material demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some history of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme was considered to provide clarity on present realities, a more in-depth analysis of the entire history of the programme using the analytical methodology presented here (combining demand- and supply-side analyses) would provide additional clarity on present and future North Korean nuclear arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional area for exploration is the interaction between nuclear-warhead development and delivery-system development. While some consideration of delivery vehicles were factored into this paper’s analysis as context, a more detailed look would aid in discovering further details about North Korea’s current and planned nuclear weapons programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the nuclear and missile programmes, it would be advantageous to analyse potential external programme assistance, as any assistance could affect the assumptions of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, additional investigation into the other potential weaponisation constraints is needed. While there is some published research on North Korea’s lithium and tritium production capabilities, further research is needed into its: beryllium supply and refinement capabilities; high-explosives manufacturing and testing facilities; weapons-relevant modelling and simulation codes; and additional weaponisation-relevant technologies. Further investigating North Korea’s capabilities in all NFC-relevant material, equipment and technologies, especially those related to uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, would provide a fully comprehensive picture of the state of North Korea’s civilian and military nuclear programmes, and would be a much-needed information source for external analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research in these areas could help to clarify some of the uncertainties on the issues presented in this paper and could help raise the global community’s awareness and understanding of additional aspects of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves a good competition. There is a reason the Olympic Games have been around for millennia. It is human nature to compete, compare performances, and strive for improvement. The commercial remote sensing arena is not immune. When the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) released a public product comparing the performance of commercial satellite imaging systems in 2021 — what came to be known as the “Commercial Imaging Olympics” — the outcomes were surprising. U.S. systems won “gold” in only three of the nine categories of performance, with Chinese systems also earning three gold medals. The results informed discussion and elicited actions within both the U.S. space industry and the U.S. government to make changes in support of a stronger industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, four leading institutions — the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Taylor Geospatial Institute, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation — collaborated to independently produce a “Top 3” ranking of the world’s best commercial space-based remote sensing systems in 2024. The results should spur discussions on the state of U.S. leadership and global competition among commercial space providers and serve as an indicator of the relative strength of a nation’s remote sensing offerings within the global space economy. While the project team developed a new and distinct research methodology and ranking system rooted in well-understood technical performance parameters, the format of the results honors both the spirit of the Olympic Games and the original product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 assessment centers largely on advances in U.S. and Chinese remote sensing systems. Of 11 performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five areas and U.S. systems in four areas, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal. Nearly half of the podium spots went to satellite systems launched between 2021 and 2024, showing a large amount of dynamism within the last four years and the speed at which more advanced capabilities are being introduced in the global commercial marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of 11 performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five areas and U.S. systems in four areas, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report discusses actions the U.S. government should take as “a regulator, investor, and customer” to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive. With a nascent commercial market, the government is the primary customer and market driver. It will need to take a more strategic and active role in advancing commercial capabilities that must endure and be competitive against Chinese commercial offerings, among others. This means building multiyear budget profiles for commercial remote sensing to create a stable demand signal, harmonizing government investment and private capital, aligning executive and legislative branch support, improving access to financial tools common in other economic sectors, and continuing to reform U.S. export policies and regulations. The report further highlights that U.S. national interests are also advanced through greater collaboration with allies and partners in commercial remote sensing, and explores the benefits of foreign companies establishing a greater presence in the United States and sharing their technological advancements and business innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long been the global leader in space, the 2024 medal winners spotlight the continued advancement of China’s remote sensing capabilities and the expansion of its commercial space sector. Commercial remote sensing is one dimension of a broader space competition as Beijing continues to execute its vision of leading the world in space, among other key technology sectors. The stakes are high. Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long been the global leader in space, that lead is being challenged as nations vie for the same economic, security, and industrial benefits from space capabilities that the United States has long enjoyed. The proliferation of space technologies, decreasing launch costs, diffusion of capital, and stimulating government policies are affording more nations the opportunity to compete in space, with some countries — in recent years — taking surprising new leadership roles in space-based remote sensing. Further, the expanding privatization of the space-based remote sensing sector is creating increasing supply and competition in the international marketplace. Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic and security advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) sought to understand trends in the global remote sensing marketplace. In 2021, it produced a ranking of commercial remote sensing systems across various categories of performance: a “satellite Olympics” that coincided with the 2021 Summer Olympics. The NGA product was informative and well received by the government, industry, and academia. It challenged assumptions by policymakers, many of whom “assumed that U.S. companies would be industry leaders across the board.” Yet, U.S. systems won “gold” in only three of the nine categories. The 2021 product spurred important conversations about the importance of U.S. leadership in commercial remote sensing and, according to some U.S. companies, prompted new investments to accelerate developments in certain areas of remote sensing where the United States appeared to lag the rest of the world in technology. The product also reinforced changes to U.S. government regulatory policy and prompted an emphasis on a “competitive and burgeoning U.S. commercial space sector” that was described in the United States Space Priorities Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic and security advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in just three years. To understand the latest trends, a collaborative team from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Taylor Geospatial Institute, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation conducted an independent assessment of the world’s best commercial remote sensing systems — shining a spotlight on those companies and nations that are leading the world in capturing knowledge of Earth and the activities upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To produce a ranking of the world’s best commercial space-based remote sensing systems, the authors developed a methodology to quantitatively assess satellite performance using commonly understood and widely used technical performance parameters for remote sensing. The assessment covered eleven categories of performance across electro-optical (EO), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared (IR) modalities. Nine categories are similar to those used by NGA in 2021, and two categories have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance parameters relevant to each category include technical factors such as spatial resolution, spectral resolution, number of imaging bands, and the number of operational satellites (or persistence of imaging), among others. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses many of these parameters in evaluating commercial remote sensing license applications and in its benchmarking of foreign remote sensing systems. In each category, the top performers were scored, ranked, and awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals. A company’s national flag corresponds to the state or organization under which its satellite system is registered, as captured by the United Nations, and from where the majority of its satellite constellation and operations are regulated. While the authors recognize that several foreign companies have established U.S. subsidiaries to pursue greater business opportunities within the United States, they were still attributed to a national team based upon satellite registration and licensing. Foreign companies that have established U.S. subsidiaries are recognized for sharing their technical and business innovations with the United States, promoting greater alliance and partnership opportunities, and increasing the overall competitiveness of the market. The one exception made this year is for Satellogic, which is dual-flagged as both a U.S. and Uruguayan competitor due to unique circumstances of redomiciling in the United States, maintaining Uruguayan registration with the United Nations, and subjecting its entire satellite constellation to NOAA licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify for this assessment, only those space-based remote sensing systems that were privately owned and currently operating (i.e., not owned and operated by a government entity) and offering a product or service available to the commercial market as of July 1, 2024, were included in the dataset. The authors relied on information that was publicly available and — recognizing that the accuracy and opacity of information can vary — sought to corroborate data across multiple sources, confirm technical specifications, and capture true performance data to the maximum extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report makes comparisons to the 2021 NGA rankings, as provided in NGA’s publicly released and discussed rankings chart. While the methodologies may differ, the project team makes such comparisons buoyed by the fact that there are a limited number of key technical parameters needed to evaluate performance in categories such as EO imaging resolution and SAR revisit, and those technical parameters are often made publicly available in product specification sheets, press releases, and other information disclosed by companies. When necessary, companies were contacted directly to verify and fill in gaps in satellite system information, which in some cases was essential in determining podium rankings. The research team did not contact Chinese system owners, which could introduce both favorable and unfavorable effects for Chinese systems in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While striving to compare objective technical parameters with a repeatable methodology, the authors acknowledge that it is impossible to do so perfectly. Choices were made for how to score performance in each category and for selecting the definitions of the categories themselves. Challenges to this methodology and rankings are to be expected and encouraged, and the authors are receptive to engaging with companies and other experts to inform future iterations of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors recognize that many U.S. and foreign commercial remote sensing systems are dual use, with companies selling data and services both in the commercial marketplace and to governments. Those companies may offer even higher-end capabilities to government customers that they do not make commercially available, but such capabilities were outside the scope of this assessment. Further, while including government systems might provide different outcomes at a different classification level (this project was completed based solely on non-classified, publicly accessible information), the purpose of this effort was to examine the state of competition among commercial providers alone as an indicator of the relative market strength of a nation’s remote sensing offerings within the global space economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s assessment centers largely on advances in U.S. and Chinese remote sensing systems. Of the eleven performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five and U.S. systems in four, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal. Nearly half of the podium spots went to satellite systems launched between 2021 and 2024, showing a large amount of movement within the last four years and more advanced capabilities being introduced in the global commercial marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electro-optical-eo-systems&quot;&gt;Electro-Optical (EO) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notable in the EO categories is China’s rise to gold in EO imaging capability, with its SuperView Neo-1 system, launched in 2022, offering a commercial product that combines high-resolution imagery with the largest constellation collection capacity. Because there is now a clustering of commercial systems able to capture native 30-centimeter (cm) imagery, additional performance factors such as collection capacity (at this resolution) provide further differentiation in the global market. While the U.S. WorldView-3 system (launched in 2014) still remains on the podium, Maxar’s WorldView Legion constellation is likely to compete for the top spot in future assessments once its products become commercially available. The first two satellites in the Legion constellation were launched in May 2024, and two more launched in August 2024. Expected to launch in 2025 are the first commercial EO imaging systems going to very low Earth orbit — from Albedo Space and EOI Space — a move which will significantly improve their imaging resolution and enable them to be highly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Jilin-1 EO systems hold the top spot in EO revisit, owing to its large constellation of over 100 operational satellites in orbit. In the EO video category, the latest generation U.S. SkySat system earns gold when accounting for its enhanced product offerings tied to frame rate, dwell time, and spatial resolution. While not on the podium due to its products not being available on the commercial market, Japan’s CE-SAT-1E system, operated by Canon Electronics and launched in 2024, receives an honorable mention for its high frame rate performance and innovative design. A noteworthy trend is a growing group of EO constellations offering sub 1-meter imagery at higher revisit rates. One such example is the U.S. BlackSky Global constellation that, while not on this year’s podium, will be one to watch as it and other constellations optimize different performance parameters to increase the value of remote sensing to end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-systems&quot;&gt;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAR performance was the most challenging to assess, given the complexity of the data collected in radar pulses and the relative opacity of Chinese technical data. The authors used a benchmark that the NOAA Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) has adopted in its regulatory process, an equation to calculate information density contained in a SAR dataset called the Radar Generalized Image Quality Equation, and drew heavily on NOAA published data to rank the top foreign remote sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAR X-band imaging performance saw a complete shake-up on the podium this year, with the three medalists being all new systems — U.S. Umbra SAR (gold), U.S. Capella Space Acadia (silver), and Finnish ICEYE Generation 3 (bronze) — launched in the 2022–2023 timeframe. Similarly, the same three companies were top performers in SAR revisit, with ICEYE outpacing the competition due to its larger constellation size. This is a stark contrast to just seven years ago when, as described in an Aerospace Corporation report, it was observed that “U.S.-based companies are not participants in the competition for commercial radar imagery due to domestic regulatory limitations that so far have been an insurmountable barrier to entry.” With NOAA’s regulatory reforms in 2020 and the removal of further restrictions on X-band SAR data sales in 2023, U.S. companies quickly become top performers in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese firms have made less progress in X-band SAR, they lead the pack in C-band SAR. C-band SAR provides lower-resolution radar imagery over larger areas and is particularly useful for environmental analysis, including global mapping, landform changes, and ocean monitoring. The aging Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite earned a bronze medal and its follow-on system, the CHORUS-C satellite from MDA Space, is expected to compete favorably in future rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that all commercial SAR companies will approach a resolution limit based on spectrum constraints set by the International Telecommunication Union. With resolution and dwell time approaching technical limits, where commercial SAR companies go next in offering differentiated performance and products over their competitors will soon make these comparisons more complicated and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spectral-systems&quot;&gt;Spectral Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multispectral and hyperspectral podiums tell two different stories. In multispectral, China’s SuperView Neo-3 received the gold medal, but the competition in this category was tight. All three podium winners appear to offer similar capabilities, with China’s Siwei and the second-place finisher, U.S./Uruguay Satellogic, both launching their top performers in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral capability was a category that, in NGA’s 2021 assessment, showed no competitive U.S. system. In 2024, a U.S. system is now atop the podium with GHOSt satellites developed and operated by the U.S. company Orbital Sidekick. And an Indian system, Pixxel, is in receipt of the silver medal. Performance parameters for hyperspectral systems can often be in tension, making direct comparisons challenging. Some systems are designed for higher spatial resolution to aid in discovering smaller targets while others are optimized for finer spectral resolution (i.e., spectral density) to characterize specific materials and hydrocarbons and find them over larger areas. In future iterations of this analysis, it will likely be appropriate to separate hyperspectral systems into two unique categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrared-ir-systems&quot;&gt;Infrared (IR) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the IR remote sensing categories, short-wave infrared (SWIR) appears largely unchanged from NGA’s 2021 rankings. WorldView-3 remains the leader, driven by its resolution performance, as many U.S. companies have shied away from SWIR offerings due to long-standing regulatory restrictions. While not reflected on the podium, several countries have or are developing commercial SWIR systems that could alter these results within the year. In contrast, fewer companies are pursuing mid-wave infrared (MWIR) remote sensing systems. The South Korean KOMPSAT-3A — a system launched in 2015 — was then and still sits now atop the podium. Chinese systems launched in 2018 and 2019 took silver and bronze, respectively, with lower resolution offerings than KOMPSAT-3A. Despite a smaller competitive pool at present, there are MWIR efforts by British, German, and U.S. companies worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the category of long-wave infrared (LWIR), Chinese commercial systems are dominant. Much of the utility of LWIR remote sensing is in applications such as climate change, agriculture, and wildfire monitoring. Changes to U.S. regulatory restrictions on infrared imaging will enable U.S. companies to test this commercial market, with two U.S. companies planning to launch systems in 2025 capable of imaging in the LWIR spectral range: Albedo Space and Muon Space. Both could be future medal contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ciIVYZ3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Trends in the Medal Rankings.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither the United States nor China has a clear across-the-board lead in commercial remote sensing. In comparison to NGA’s 2021 rankings, U.S. companies have made the greatest positive movement in X-band SAR, hyperspectral capability, and EO video. Government contracts, strategic investments (from both private and U.S. government-related entities), and U.S. policy and regulatory relief appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of these improved commercial capabilities over the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Chinese companies moved up the podium in EO imaging and multispectral capabilities, and they hold dominant positions in LWIR and C-band SAR. The authors cannot definitively explain China’s dominance and the absence of U.S. or other Western commercial entrants. However, space-based remote sensing using C-band SAR and LWIR instruments for environmental and scientific applications has long been a core competency of Western civil space agencies, such as NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite weather satellites and the European Commission-European Space Agency Copernicus initiative, with fewer commercial market opportunities. Important to watch will be progress by U.S. companies like Albedo Space and Muon Space, and their ability to disrupt the IR results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are commercial remote sensing systems currently flying as demonstration systems or launched since July 1, 2024, that are on the cusp of operational capability and were not eligible for inclusion in these results. Established U.S. companies like Maxar and Planet launched WorldView Legion EO imagers and a Tanager hyperspectral system, respectively, and new-to-market companies will soon begin to offer commercial IR data and products. It is more difficult to predict new capabilities coming from Chinese aerospace companies, though they are expected to continue improving their commercial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding China, are Chinese companies focusing efforts on assessed niches where little competition exists, or is their progress reflective of a broader strategy by Beijing to advance on myriad space-based remote sensing fronts? The authors believe it is both when looking holistically at the presence of Chinese companies across these categories, the numerous systems that did not medal but are in orbit or in development, and trends in other areas of commercial space. While U.S. analysts tend to focus on the People’s Liberation Army’s developments in space, China’s commercial space sector is also rapidly expanding — enabled by leadership priority, national policy, government funding and incentives, and private capital. China is likely intent on dominating this medal count in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-discussion&quot;&gt;Policy Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The fundamental goal of this policy is to advance and protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by maintaining the nation’s leadership in remote sensing space activities, and by sustaining and enhancing the U.S. remote sensing industry.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-commercial-remote-sensing-policy-april-25-2003&quot;&gt;— U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy, April 25, 2003&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assessment considered worldwide commercial space-based remote sensing systems and produced a ranking of the world’s best. As the overall medal count shows, the dominant front-runners are Chinese and U.S. companies. While the United States has long been the global leader in space, Beijing has declared its intent for China to lead the world in space. Commercial remote sensing is but one dimension of a broader space competition, from Earth to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions for policymakers include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What issues will shape the long-term viability of these commercial remote sensing companies?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What role should the U.S. government play in creating opportunities for U.S. companies that strengthen their overall viability and global competitiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is at stake for U.S. national interests if the United States loses ground in this important area of technology and commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy, unchanged since 2003, articulates the objective of “advanc[ing] and protect[ing] U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by maintaining the nation’s leadership in remote sensing space activities, and by sustaining and enhancing the U.S. remote sensing industry.” Furthermore, the first policy goal listed in the more recent 2020 National Space Policy is that the United States shall “promote and incentivize private industry to . . . strengthen and preserve the position of the United States as the global partner of choice for international space commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might take away from these 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings that, in general, the U.S. remote sensing industry is performing well and that its position has improved from three years ago. Companies from the United States or its allies medal in nearly all categories, new systems are soon coming online (e.g., Maxar’s WorldView Legion) that will be top contenders in the international marketplace, and U.S. companies are high performers in key categories that the U.S. government relies upon (e.g., EO and SAR). However, given the current global rankings, it is clear that the United States has not fully achieved its stated policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is also fragility and acute competition across the ecosystem with global security and economic consequences. The 2024 rankings provide a snapshot in time with mixed trends. Four Chinese systems and four U.S. systems each make their podium debut this year, having been launched in 2021 or later. While U.S.-flagged companies gained in the rankings in several categories when compared to 2021 (e.g., EO video and hyperspectral capability), they lost ground in others (e.g., EO imaging). The 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings published here highlight the challenges ahead for the U.S. government to leverage all tools at its disposal to achieve U.S. national policy goals in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-as-a-regulator-investor-and-customer&quot;&gt;Government as a ‘Regulator, Investor, and Customer’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three government stimulants occurred in the past four years that appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of U.S. commercial capabilities and, very likely, this year’s podium results: government policy and regulation, strategic investments, and government contracts. This mirrors observations made by the Defense Science Board in a May 2024 report on commercial space access and integrity, where they see the role of government as “a regulator, investor, and customer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First in 2020 and later in 2023, NOAA implemented licensing reforms that removed several restrictions on the ability of commercial remote sensing companies to sell their more advanced and competitive products. For example, it removed all “temporary conditions” on X-band SAR, the practical effect being that U.S. companies could, according to the president of one U.S. SAR company, “offer customers the highest resolution images that our satellites are capable of capturing.” U.S. company Albedo Space, in 2021, was granted a first-of-its-kind NOAA license to sell 10 cm resolution EO imagery, a leap forward from today’s 30 cm offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A philosophical shift is occurring, with U.S. government regulators accounting for the need to keep U.S. industry in the lead amid a tightening global competition. These global rankings show the speed at which the overall sector is moving and how both U.S. and foreign companies are seeking to push the performance envelope. Roughly half of this year’s top performers were systems launched in the last four years alone. While trends in U.S. policy and regulations are positive, they must continue to lead and pace, not lag. NOAA regulators should now work to remove the remaining technical restrictions on U.S. remote sensing systems and, like other nations, regulate more directly to whom they can sell their data. This would open a new era of technical innovation and dominant performance for the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the sector saw an influx of private capital in recent years that fueled many of the systems atop this year’s podium. According to market analysis firm BryceTech, 2021 was a high watermark for private capital entering the commercial space sector, including through the use of special-purpose acquisition company vehicles, which raised capital for a few U.S. companies featured in this report. The investment firm In-Q-Tel, whose aim is to transition intelligence and defense-relevant technologies from the private to the public sector, also made strategic investments in commercial remote sensing companies during this time. In 2022, In-Q-Tel invested in U.S. company Orbital Sidekick to advance its hyperspectral capabilities, with previous strategic investments including U.S. firm Capella Space (2017), Finnish firm ICEYE (2021), and British firm SatVu (2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three government stimulants occurred in the past four years that appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of U.S. commercial capabilities and, very likely, this year’s podium results: government policy and regulation, strategic investments, and government contracts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the investment landscape is becoming more challenging. Commercial space investments in North America are decreasing overall, with investors not seeing a return on their capital and the markets growing slower than they anticipated. Without a continued influx of capital — satellite development and operations are capital intensive — U.S. companies will be hard-pressed to invest in further technological advancements, which could limit their future competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the U.S. government awarded a large contract for commercial EO imagery. In 2022, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) awarded “its largest-ever commercial imagery contract. . . . Valued at billions of dollars over the next decade” to three U.S. companies with commercial EO systems. The NRO has also outlined plans to purchase other sensing modalities, like SAR, hyperspectral imagery, and radiofrequency mapping, but has not yet followed through with an expanded demand signal and program of record like it has for EO. Meanwhile, the U.S. Space Force is beginning to acquire commercial remote sensing data and analytics to provide “tactical support of unified combatant commands as directed by the recent Tac ISR/SRT [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance/surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking] initiative,” but also lacks clarity on scale, funding, and timelines. Additionally, NGA plans to procure commercial analytic services through a program named Luno, creating a further market demand signal for geospatial data and value-added products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;projecting-ahead&quot;&gt;Projecting Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projecting ahead, one might read market forecasts with headlines that the space economy is “booming” and think there is no need for concern; the market is strong. After all, a 2024 World Economic Forum report projects the global space economy will grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, with space-based Earth observation revenue more than tripling from $2 billion in 2023 to $9 billion annually by 2035, driven by increasing demand for value-added services like analytic insights and tailored products. One firm noted that, “The demand for EO imagery remains the highest in the defence and intelligence (D&amp;amp;I) vertical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this forecasted demand signal from the U.S. government has not translated into sustained investment. U.S. companies are capturing small, initial government contracts but are finding it hard to secure substantial follow-on contracts. Without an ability to forecast long-term revenue, these companies will be challenged to attract capital to continue advancing their technology and product offerings. Even further, without a near-term demand signal, there is uncertainty about whether current companies will survive to realize the forecasted market opportunities in the decade ahead. It has already affected commercial SAR. Two U.S. SAR companies earned medals this year — Umbra and Capella Space — with ICEYE (headquartered in Finland with a U.S. subsidiary) also earning a podium spot. However, other U.S. companies have scrapped plans to deploy SAR satellites in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is still a powerful market actor with an ability to shape the commercial marketplace and assure the long-term sustainability of private industry, consistent with its policy goals. The Defense Science Board observed that “the government can be indispensable as an anchor tenant and source of a stable demand signal” for “nascent markets emerging from traditionally government missions . . . for which there may be limited early pure commercial demand.” To keep U.S. companies atop the podium and globally competitive, the government will need to wield its power as a customer, investor, and regulator more strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning government investment and private capital is a good place to start. Today’s systems benefited from an influx of capital, including unprecedented private capital that entered the commercial space sector in 2021. Further investment now will determine the most advanced systems on the podium three years from now. The government is the primary customer and market driver with a nascent commercial market. It will need to take a more active role in investing in commercial capabilities that must endure and be competitive against Chinese commercial offerings, among others. This means building multiyear budget profiles for commercial remote sensing to create a stable procurement demand signal and aligning executive and legislative branch support. Such a demand signal should be used strategically to drive early capital investments that accelerate technological advancements and innovative solutions ahead of planned government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To keep U.S. companies atop the podium and globally competitive, the government will need to wield its power as a customer, investor, and regulator more strategically.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government can also better integrate commercial capabilities into its architectures to increase the diversity of sources, add capacity, and improve mission resiliency. However, so long as commercial data and products are treated separately and perceived as costly to access, whereas government data is “free,” users will not embrace it. The user experience should be seamless from tasking to delivery, whether they are accessing commercial or government-collected remote sensing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer partnership with investors can also seed advancements, whether to improve capabilities in existing areas of U.S. strength or nurture U.S. companies into new areas altogether. For example, new hyperspectral medal winner GHOSt, developed by U.S. company Orbital Sidekick, was bolstered by a strategic investment from the global security venture firm In-Q-Tel in early 2022 and a U.S. Department of Defense Strategic Funding Increase award in 2020, which private investment funds matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for those U.S. companies atop the podium, revisions to U.S. export policies and processes — beyond NOAA’s regulatory reforms — will continue to be necessary for selling their superior capabilities in the rapidly growing international marketplace. There is international demand, particularly from allied and partner governments that see procurement of commercial systems as a way to accelerate their own sovereign space capabilities. However, ITAR continues to hamper U.S. companies as they pursue these international business opportunities. The ongoing U.S. government review of space export controls holds promise. But, as this year’s podium shows, it is important to recognize the global diffusion of remote sensing technology and speed of progress; U.S. export restrictions have not slowed advancements by Chinese firms, who, in some areas, lead U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of international demand, Poland recently acquired two French Pléiades Neo satellite systems (the 2024 silver medalist for EO imaging). Not only could such contracts expand revenue for U.S. companies, putting less pressure on the U.S. government as an anchor tenant, but they build opportunities for greater interoperability with allies and partners, and prevent China from further expanding its market reach. The U.S. government holds significant sway as an advocate of U.S. industry. It should aggressively promote its commercial remote sensing sector abroad, as it does for other areas of U.S. industry. Further, to expand international business opportunities, especially vis-à-vis China, greater use of investment and financing levers such as the Export-Import Bank of the United States should be encouraged within the commercial space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States regards its allies and partners as an “asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match.” Although Americans want to see U.S. flags atop the rankings, and beat their friends in competition, U.S. national interests are also advanced and U.S. leadership demonstrated through greater collaboration with allies and partners. Notably, there is a lack of Five Eyes partners and NATO countries on the podium, despite Europe’s long-standing space aptitude. Japan is injecting capital into its space industry to advance capabilities for its security and economic benefit. Many of these allies and partners possess cutting-edge technologies and are making investments in space-based remote sensing. Friendly countries looking to expand their commercial remote sensing capabilities should be encouraged, with this report being a helpful guide to put more friendly flags on the podium that complement U.S. systems and compete vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the government must be mindful that it can have a deleterious effect on the market as a competitor to industry. Mantras like “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build only what we must” from the U.S. Space Force are encouraging, but the contribution of commercial capabilities and services must be integrated throughout requirements, acquisition, and operational processes to avoid the government pursuing systems that compete directly with what the commercial sector can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-stakes&quot;&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“China’s commercial space sector is growing quickly and is on pace to become a major global competitor by 2030.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-annual-threat-assessment-of-the-us-intelligence-community-2024&quot;&gt;— Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, 2024&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assessment shows the dynamism occurring in the sector and how rapidly the technology is advancing. Without deliberate actions by the U.S. government, as discussed above, it is not guaranteed that U.S. flags will remain atop the podium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is intent on being the world’s leading space power by 2049. Beijing is rapidly expanding its government and commercial space sectors, accelerated by political direction from President Xi Jinping himself, government-wide prioritization, large state and private investments, regulatory leeway, and technology theft. Beijing sees its commercial companies as a way to bring technology innovation into the government and, consistent with its civil-military fusion strategy, to improve its military capabilities. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is creating new markets for Chinese goods and services, and its commercial space companies “will continue attempts to undercut the price of Western firms in more competitive markets,” according to the U.S. intelligence community. Rising nations may look to acquire Chinese remote sensing systems, or data and services from those systems, for their own security, economic, and environmental needs and leverage already established BRI relationships and infrastructure. Should China take the mantle of global leadership in space, whether in remote sensing or communications, it is expected to spread its own techno-authoritarian norms and standards, grow its influence in international governance and standards bodies, and extend its surveillance model into orbit. Simply put, U.S. leadership here matters. The competition in commercial remote sensing is emblematic of the broader strategic interests at stake for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Simply put, U.S. leadership here matters. The competition in commercial remote sensing is emblematic of the broader strategic interests at stake for the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;way-ahead&quot;&gt;Way Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent of the 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings is to spur a discussion on U.S. leadership, take stock of the state of global competition, and consider ways in which the government tool kit can be used to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive. According to a recent article in the MIT Technology Review, a “country’s economic security — its ability to generate both national security and economic prosperity — is grounded in it having significant technological capabilities that outpace those of its adversaries and complement those of its allies.” The authors want the results of the 2024 global rankings to generate deeper conversations across the public and private sectors on the importance of U.S. leadership in this area of economic, technological, and national security significance and the longer-term consequences should this leadership erode. These global rankings should also motivate closer discussions between the government and investment community on how government resources and private capital can work together to keep U.S. companies outpacing and out-innovating the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2024 assessment is an initial effort to characterize the state of global commercial remote sensing capabilities. While this product focused strictly on the technical performance of remote sensing collection systems, the project team intends to expand the research effort to spotlight recent market advancements and technological trends that will impact the value of commercial remote sensing information delivered to customers. New collection modalities should be explored, including radio frequency, non-Earth imaging, and variations in hyperspectral remote sensing, as well as capabilities such as virtual constellations that aggregate multiple modalities of remote sensing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The intent of the 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings is to spur a discussion on U.S. leadership, take stock of the state of global competition, and consider ways in which the government tool kit can be used to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this study’s repeatable, objective research methodology could be expanded to assess companies’ efforts to move up the value chain, such as the timeliness of information delivery, the range of data sources used in multisource analysis, and the relative value of highly automated analytic products and services — focusing on outputs rather than inputs. As several market forecasts predict, demand in the Earth observation market will grow in value-added services, such as “data processing, data fusion and tailored products,” to meet user demand for analytic insights. Feedback and reader interest will help determine the future direction of this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the United States finds itself in this dynamic and highly competitive global landscape, tremendous commercial remote sensing capabilities have been created that are now ready to shine. Ideally, these companies will continue to spend capital to improve their capabilities. Doing so will enable a new community of private multisource analytics companies who will create even greater economic success and information value in the form of fused products and services that reveal the many changes and behaviors on Earth and the gamut of human activities taking place upon it. The “gold rush” is on, and the future competitiveness of U.S. commercial remote sensing is no longer guaranteed. What happens next will be decided by U.S. government actions through regulation, investment, consumption, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;4認罪被告求情 辯方：蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠、曾比喻社會問題如危樓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j8YRxN3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年「屠龍」小隊等被指計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警察，遭律政司起訴反恐怖主義條例，他們亦被控「串謀謀殺」警察。陪審團裁定6名被告無罪，1名被告交替罪成。早前有4名被告已認罪，包括兩名「污點證人」蘇緯軒及彭軍壕，4人今（27日）在高等法院求情。辯方指，案發時18歲的蘇緯軒在言談中表達對社會的熱誠，他曾比喻香港社會的問題有如危樓，「唔可以俾危樓起落去」。辯方認為，蘇是天真及正直的年輕人，「以為自己做嘅嘢係啱」。另外，辯方指彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁，比一般在囚人士孤單及辛苦。就製作引爆器及接收槍械零件的另兩名被告，法官張慧玲指量刑時不能抹煞背景與2019年反修例事件有關，「知道對抗警方同政府，好難話唔知呢件事，只係貪得意」。案件暫定11月14日判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4名認罪被告為：蘇緯軒、彭軍壕、蔡凱明及陳玉龍。蘇承認「串謀謀殺」、「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」及「使用槍械及彈藥意圖抗拒或阻止合法逮捕」罪。彭承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪。蔡承認「協助和教唆製造爆炸品」罪。陳承認「串謀無牌管有槍械及彈藥」及「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠是正直的年輕人&quot;&gt;辯方：蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠、是正直的年輕人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蘇緯軒，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於2001年在美國出生，現年23歲。他於2019年12月20日被捕，當時任職兼職救生員，被捕前沒有案底。代表蘇的大律師江小菁求情指，對蘇有深刻印象，因蘇被捕後兩人曾於警署聊天。辯方留意到，年僅18歲的蘇在言談中表達對社會的熱誠，他曾比喻指香港社會的問題有如危樓，「唔可以俾危樓起落去」。辯方認為，蘇在她心目中是天真及正直的年輕人，「以為自己做嘅嘢係啱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘇案發時年輕易受影響事後知道行為魯莽&quot;&gt;辯方：蘇案發時年輕易受影響、事後知道行為魯莽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，本案不幸中的大幸是蘇的人生觀因而改變，他的求學態度變得積極，亦修補了與父親的關係。辯方補充，蘇曾經與父親關係緊張，認為父親不理解他，起初拒絕父親探訪，後來破冰。辯方指她見證蘇的成長，蘇後來發現之往接收的訊息並非絕對正確，亦知道自己行為魯莽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，沒有打算淡化案情的嚴重性，但蘇於案發時較其他被告年輕，思想較為天真，且容易受人影響。辯方最後指，「（蘇）佢嘅人生路仲係好長，而家23歲，佢明白離開監獄要面對社會，希望努力讀書彌補之前嘅錯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁較孤單及辛苦&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁、較孤單及辛苦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭軍壕，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於1986年在香港出生，現年38歲，被捕前沒有案底，完成中三學歷。他於2020年1月被捕，當時無業。辯方指，彭的父親及胞妹今天到法庭支持他，惟母親在他還柙期間去世。辯方又指，明白判刑需要反映案情嚴重性，亦知道刑期不短，但希望法庭接納彭有悔意，亦很快表示願意做控方證人。在彭決定擔任控方證人後，他被單獨囚禁，比一般在囚人士孤單及辛苦。彭在鐵窗下生活了4年8個月，成為終身不能磨滅的烙印，其重犯機會微乎其微，「有生之年唔會再犯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指蔡凱明知道製作引爆器是為反抗政府&quot;&gt;官指蔡凱明知道製作引爆器是為反抗政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蔡凱明，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於1999年於內地出生，2003年來港定居，現年25歲。蔡修畢機械工程高級文憑，案發時任職倉務員。蔡於被捕時被發現電話內藏有兒童色情物品，並於2024年被判囚6個月。辯方表示，蔡還柙至今已4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，考慮判刑時不能抹煞本案背景與2019年反修例事件有關，「知道對抗警方同政府，好難話唔知呢件事，只係貪得意」，雖然他們並不知道本案的串謀，但被告的行為確實與串謀相關。辯方同意。張官又指蔡製作引爆器的行為或牽涉暴動，從他與同案被告吳智鴻及賴振邦的對話可見，蔡知道製作引爆器是為了反抗政府並達到「五大訴求」。辯方同意被告知悉其行為與社會事件有關，但他對背後目的及串謀的規模並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方無證據顯示陳玉龍藏槍打算作非法用途&quot;&gt;辯方：無證據顯示陳玉龍藏槍打算作非法用途&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳玉龍，辯方讀出其經歷口供。陳於1992年在港出生，現年32歲，中五學歷。他於2020年被捕，案發時任職技術人員。辯方求情指，陳的親友為他撰寫求情信，形容他積極面對困難，沒有放棄自己，希望出獄後照顧家人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述案情指，陳在本案中不斷協助其他被告接收槍械零件的包裹。陳於被捕後表示，每次能獲取蘇給予的200元報酬，他以為包裹內的是玩具。辯方確認，陳事後同意知道包裹內的是槍械零件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳管有一支裝有14粒子彈的真槍，並管有近百發彈藥。張官表示很難接受屬於收藏性質，辯方則同意沒有證據證明他打算作非法用途，惟背景確實牽涉2019年社會事件，很難撇除他完全沒有非法意圖。辯方強調，沒有證據證明陳有參與其他活動；張官表示串謀牽涉很多人及角色，沒有證據顯示本案被告知道串謀，但他們的行為始終對串謀有幫助。張官另指，被告沒有可能不知道槍械與社會事件有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，上月被裁定罪成，今於區域法院判刑。早上已有不少市民到場輪候，有前立場員工形容兩人「decent」、「有禮貌」，「畀好大嘅自由度所有記者」，又憶述早前見面時鐘沛權精神狀態不俗，惟林紹桐「好明顯咁瘦咗好多」，望兩人保重，「就算佢哋入返去，我哋都會再見。」記協前主席岑倚蘭亦望到場支持兩人：「讓佢哋唔好覺得孤單，留喺香港啲行家繼續出現，撐佢哋囉」，又指結果雖很多時令人失望，但「心存盼望囉，風雨總會有消除嘅一日」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今近12時半到達法院。而裁決日因病獲准缺席的林紹桐，則穿白色長袖裇衫、深綠色褲、戴白口罩，於約1時許到達，身形明顯較之前消瘦。辯方早前求情時透露，林患嚴重疾病需接受化療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民一早到場輪候公眾旁聽席&quot;&gt;市民一早到場輪候公眾旁聽席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件於下午2時半開庭，《獨媒》早上約7時到場，法院地下已有約9名市民排隊。排首名的市民「姨婆」居於葵涌，由2019年開始旁聽法庭案件，今早約6時到場，她指「牆入面嗰啲，每一個對我哋都係好重要，甚至係一個人我哋都要去聽，去話俾佢聽『有我哋響度』」。她希望向兩人說「希望佢哋身體健康」、「祝佢哋平安」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約9時，旁聽隊已達40多人，當中有一部分為中年人士，記者問他們旁聽什麼案件，均不獲回應。現場多次發生爭執，有人打算插隊被其他人士揭發，亦有多個位置的人離隊良久，引起市民不滿，稱「冇排隊黨就冇問題啦」。在場保安則解釋措施「人性化」，指由於排隊時間長，允許輪候人士外出散步、用膳等，亦強調保持公平公正的原則，呼籲「唔好幫人排隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前立場員工指林紹同身體好明顯瘦咗好多&quot;&gt;前立場員工指林紹同身體「好明顯瘦咗好多」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾在《立場》工作一年多的前員工葉小姐，坦言感覺「唔好受」，指公司因而結業，經歷這番事件後她亦轉行。以前的她負責法庭新聞，較少到公司工作，但每次開會都會見到兩人，形容他們「decent」、「有禮貌」，亦不會限制記者所編寫的內容及工作，「會畀好大嘅自由度所有記者」，也會給予改善意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她又指，兩星期前曾與兩人見面，「阿權就應該睇落精神狀態都ok嘅，但係Patrick（林紹桐）就真係好明顯咁瘦咗好多，同埋成個人都好攰囉，好似得返一嚿骨咁樣囉，撐住件衫咁樣。」被問到有什麼想對兩人說，她希望兩人身體健康和保重，「就算佢哋入返去，我哋都會再見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;記協前主席岑倚蘭到場支持心存盼望風雨總有消除一日&quot;&gt;記協前主席岑倚蘭到場支持：心存盼望，風雨總有消除一日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協前主席岑倚蘭亦有到場排隊，她表示與鍾沛權相識近30年，在《蘋果日報》任採訪主任已認識其太太陳沛敏，亦見證二人結婚，今早向兩人傳短訊稱「風雨同路，繼續撐你哋，願你哋平安」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑認為，審訊由二十多日延至五十多日，二人被捕至今亦近3年，對二人而言「係好磨人嘅一個過程」。她上星期曾與鍾沛權進餐會面，替他打氣，並擔憂林紹桐的身體狀況：「希望佢唔好再判返入去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑又說，對於裁決結果感到「好憤怒」，亦不認同裁決理由：「做新聞工作咋嘛，做到點解要坐監？」她又指，雖然結果「好多時好似好令我哋失望，但係心存盼望囉，風雨總會有消除嘅一日」，她作為新聞工作者亦望繼續支持和同行，指新聞界發生很多事：「讓佢哋唔好覺得孤單，留喺香港啲行家繼續出現，撐佢哋囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獨立記者稱新聞界早於二人被捕時已受影響&quot;&gt;獨立記者稱新聞界早於二人被捕時已受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獨立記者鄭思思坦言，對裁決感到失望，亦認為判詞對新聞界進行訪問和時事評論，定下了很多新紅線。被問及會否影響往後的新聞工作，她指「個影響before嗰判決已經有喇」，即使未有判決前，經已無人敢訪問海外流亡人士，「我覺得個影響係早於2021年佢哋被捕，已經會步步為營、自我審查、小心，但個判詞就更加冇改變嗰局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民望向兩人說加油&quot;&gt;市民望向兩人說「加油」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;居於粉嶺的市民王先生早上約9時半到場，他由提堂開始已旁聽此案三次，指「今日係大概都估到嗰結果，但係都覺得要支持一下」。他形容，《立場新聞》對他而言是一個「獨立的聲音」，用另一個角度去闡述事情，「係我其中一個要睇嘅媒體，但就冇咗喇。」王說，「欣賞佢哋敢講」，能反映他的心聲，並想向鍾沛權和林紹桐說「加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，上月被裁定罪成，今（26日）於區域法院判刑。國安法指定法官郭偉健判處鍾沛權監禁21個月，至於林紹桐以14個月為量刑起點，但考慮其健康狀況，以及入獄可能對他生命有危害，判處他可即時獲得釋放的刑期。《立場》母公司則判罰款5,000元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權和林紹桐已分別還柙11.5個月及10個月9日，意味鍾沛權須即時入獄，如無行為良好三分一扣減，須多服刑9.5個月；林紹桐可獲即時釋放。鍾沛權聞判表現平靜，林紹桐則一度仰天，其妻子激動落淚。散庭時，多人向鍾沛權揮手，鍾沛權逐一揮手回應，又頻頻微笑合十、做OK手勢和豎起拇指。至於《立場》母公司的充公令，將於2025年3月17日處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裁決日因病缺席-林紹桐明顯消瘦&quot;&gt;裁決日因病缺席 林紹桐明顯消瘦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今近12時半到達法院。而裁決日因病獲准缺席的林紹桐，則穿白色長袖裇衫、深綠色褲、戴白口罩，於約1時許到達，身形明顯較之前消瘦。辯方早前求情時透露，林患嚴重疾病需接受化療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，多名前《立場》員工到庭旁聽，另前記協主席岑倚蘭、社民連曾健成、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松等人，及美國、比利時、歐盟、加拿大、意大利、愛爾蘭及英國等多國領事均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭前，多名前《立場》員工在庭外交談，鍾沛權入庭前，各人輪流送上祝福，搭肩說「保重」，鍾亦笑着合十道謝。鍾沛權和林紹桐進入被告欄後，不時交談，狀甚輕鬆、面露笑意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延遲逾兩小時開庭&quot;&gt;延遲逾兩小時開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾兩小時始開庭。下午4時16分，法庭書記一度步出，並播放法庭錄音，惟4時24分錄音播畢，書記亦離庭。等候期間，鍾沛權、林紹桐及多名旁聽人士均現疲態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林紹桐病況嚴重-憂再入獄或延誤治療致生命危險&quot;&gt;辯方指林紹桐病況嚴重 憂再入獄或延誤治療致生命危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件4時41分開庭，資深大律師余若薇進行補充陳詞，就林紹桐的情況呈交3份醫療報告，由瑪麗醫院內科學系主任講座教授、腎病外科主管陳德茂教授，及黎嘉能醫生所撰寫。陳自2020年4月起已是林的主診醫生，指林患「抗嗜中性白血球細胞質抗體」，其身體會產生抗體攻擊自己的血管，雖然2022年經診斷後穩定下來，但今年7月病情惡化，患嚴重狼瘡性腎炎，腎功能少於3成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余引述醫生指，林要經常定期覆診，獲及時適切的治療和藥物才能穩定控制病情，相隔兩周覆診一次；而林一直接受瑪麗醫生治療，若判監無法送往瑪麗治療。余又指，林現時腎炎為第四期，容易進入第五期，屆時如感染、脫水亦可能要洗腎，憂慮如他再入獄，或因延誤治療導致生命危險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望判刑不超出已還柙日數&quot;&gt;辯方望判刑不超出已還柙日數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇又呈上多個案例，重申鍾沛權和林紹桐分別已還柙349日及313日，若計算行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，即使控罪最高刑期為2年，二人無論如何已服畢大部分刑期。余又指，二人被捕至今3年，當中國安法案件應盡快處理，林紹桐亦因等候裁決失去出國留學機會；而今年3月《監獄規則》修訂，令被告或未能獲三分一扣減，二人已獲保釋近2年，若要再服刑「對佢哋來講係好大嘅負擔同焦慮」，望法庭判處二人可獲即時釋放的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指煽動文章非立場意見佔比很小-法官應整體考慮&quot;&gt;辯方指煽動文章非《立場》意見、佔比很小 法官應整體考慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，有別於以往羊村繪本或譚得志案的街頭宣傳，本案被裁煽動文章為兩人履行新聞工作期間所刊登。就判詞指《立場》政治立場為本土主義，余亦強調被裁煽動的11篇文章，無一是《立場》的意見、宣傳其政治立場，全部均是受訪者或博客的意見；而且《立場》亦有刊登很多其他文章，涉案文章所佔百分比「好細好細好細」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余認為，正如判詞指鄒家成專訪雖有批評中央政府，但亦有批評泛民主派，整體考慮下不屬煽動，法官量刑時亦應作「整體考慮」。法官郭偉健認為兩者有分別，指如有人說「我唔鍾意你」，「有理冇理都講」；但如果無客觀事實作中傷、抹黑就不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指被告非明知故犯已下架多篇文章&quot;&gt;辯方指被告非明知故犯、已下架多篇文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，法官裁定文章屬煽動，在於沒有提出客觀基礎，惟法例無就新聞工作的限制定下指引，辯方審訊時曾呈上多篇其他媒體如《大公》、《文匯》等文章，亦沒有提客觀理據、甚至屬謾罵；又指博客文章不同學術論文，一般受訪者或作者可能心中有客觀基礎，「但佢未必知道要提出」，被告並非明知故犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就判詞指，無證據《立場》其他99.99%文章並非煽動文章，余若薇指涉案17篇文章是控方深思熟慮下挑選，而《立場》運作7年，一直以來無收到文章具煽動性的投訴，只是因政治環境、民情和法律轉變，以往可接受的報導現時變得犯法。余強調，「以往真係冇傳媒因為呢一類報導被判刑」，而被告並非刻意犯法，如鍾沛權看到有關北愛抗爭的文章已立即下架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提屠龍小隊訪問-指難考慮其餘9999文章非煽動作減刑因素&quot;&gt;法官提屠龍小隊訪問 指難考慮其餘99.99%文章非煽動作減刑因素&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「其實我唔係好想提其他嗰啲文章」，因不屬檢控基礎；但補充他曾考慮應否將另一篇屠龍小隊的專訪文章納入考慮，指「好明顯對辯方係不利」。郭官又反問：「發布嗰篇文章係幾時？係中大同理大暴動期間，啱啱有人比人掟死、啱啱有人被活燒，《立場》喺度寫咩呀？和平示威」，因此就其餘99.99%文章不具煽動意圖，「對唔住我真係好難比一個positive嘅減刑因素，因為我見到呢個唔係一定啱嘅事實」，而他在判詞亦已寫明，無證據顯示其餘99.99%文章不具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇指，《立場》報導屠龍小隊並非為「歌頌」，而是「報導」，其他媒體亦有報導該小隊，甚至附上捐款號碼。郭官指，他只是解釋「有啲可能對辯方不利嘅文章喺我面前，我已經擺低哂」，余指法官應這樣做，並再強調當有事發生，傳媒有責任報導，而非傳媒導致事件發生，而且「冇一個政府指示話屠龍唔准報導，何桂藍唔准訪問」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鍾沛權自動放棄犯罪可獲減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指鍾沛權自動放棄犯罪可獲減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，認為《國安法》第33條適用於鍾沛權，指鍾辭職和將逾萬篇文章下架，屬自動放棄犯罪，可獲減刑，而他無將何桂藍專訪等4篇涉案文章下架，最多只是判斷上錯誤。至於林紹桐，余指他涉案只有兩個月及一篇文章，該篇中大衝突兩年專訪性質亦僅訪問當時在場的人；而警方指報導失實後，他們已作覆核，並將警方投訴如實刊出，如判監的刑罰是不相稱。加上其健康狀況，如有事發生未能送往瑪麗醫院，可能有病情惡化或性命危險，望法官可判處二人即時獲釋的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官聽罷陳詞後，休庭約50分鐘後宣讀判詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁11篇文章具煽動意圖立場理念為本土主義&quot;&gt;官裁11篇文章具煽動意圖、《立場》理念為本土主義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案為1997年後首宗傳媒被控煽動的審訊。法官郭偉健上月裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具煽動意圖，認為其中何桂藍專訪、中大衝突兩周年專訪，以及區家麟、羅冠聰、陳沛敏的博客文章，在無客觀基礎下，指律政司檢控初選案為荒謬濫權、攻擊《國安法》和警方執法、煽動「攬炒」、以假消息散播憎恨及反政府情緒等。至於餘下鄒家成、梁晃維、羅冠聰、許智峯及梁頌恆5人的專訪，及鄒幸彤得獎報導，官則裁定不具煽動意圖，認為只涉受訪者表述政治觀點、屬新聞報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又根據《立場》創刊辭、社論等，認為其政治理念是本土主義，媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具。法官認為兩名被告審批涉案文章，是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，意圖煽動憎恨政府等，指「無論如何，至少罔顧煽動後果」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情指新聞工作者有責任報導-有別其他煽動案&quot;&gt;辯方求情指新聞工作者有責任報導 有別其他煽動案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;兩人均呈上陳情信，提及新聞理念，其中鍾沛權指如實記錄和報道是新聞工作者「不可逃避的責任」，林紹桐則指新聞工作者效忠對象「只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾」，同事最後在巨大壓力下仍堅守崗位，「無愧於時代」，且「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師余若薇指，二人均是新聞工作者，有責任報導社會狀況和不同意見，與其他煽動案涉宣洩政治言論不同。她又指，二人曾分別還柙349日和313日，如考慮三分一行為良好扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，望法庭判處刑期不會超出已還柙日數。余又提到，二人在本案後已失去工作，林紹桐患嚴重疾病需接受化療，如入獄難以接受治療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告依次為Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited、《立場》前總編輯鍾沛權（53歲）及前署任總編輯林紹桐（35歲），他們被控一項串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物罪，指他們於2020年7月7日至2021年12月29日在香港，一同串謀和與其他人串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物，即具以下意圖的刊物：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》煽動案今日判刑，前總編輯鍾沛權判囚21個月，前署任總編輯林紹桐則基於健康狀況，獲判可即時獲得釋放的刑期。散庭後已經入夜，林紹桐約7時半離開區域法院。他未有發言，在正門站立讓傳媒拍攝後離開，期間雙手合十及報以微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林紹桐搭升降機到法院地下時，有約3名便衣警及2名警民關係科警員詢問他會如何離開，期間有女警觸碰其手臂。林表示「唔好掂我」，望警員與他保持距離。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在林步出門口前向傳媒稱：「（林）唔會接受訪問，會企定定影相，之後喺後門搭車走，希望大家安全唔好追。」林現身時，有人高呼「Patrick，加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》兩位前總編輯鍾沛權、林紹桐，昨日（9月26日）因「串謀發布煽動刊物」分別被判監21個月及11個月。記協發聲明，認為已對新聞業造成不可逆轉的傷害。政府發言人則指，判刑理由指《立場新聞》與鍾林「站在抗爭者的一邊與政府抗衡」、「干犯的罪行相當嚴重」，判刑彰顯公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協的聲明指，《立場新聞》及鍾林被定罪「已對香港新聞業界造成不可逆轉的傷害」，明言反對以煽動罪、《港區國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使權利，進行新聞工作的人士及機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協又指，本港現時可以合法報導和刊登的議題和評論比以往大減已是不爭事實，而案件亦未有為新聞業劃下清晰界線，加上煽動罪最高刑期已提升至七年，認為只會令新聞工作者陷於憂心動輒得咎，難以無後顧地履行職責。審訊期間，控方就編輯、記者及文字的意圖向被告逐字逐句盤問，記協認為亦加劇新聞業界的自我審查風氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明稱「維護國家安全無可厚非」，惟「讓新聞工作者敢言直諫、社會能暢所欲言，是維持香港繁榮穩定所必須，亦是維持其國際良好形象的重要一環。」對於政府堅稱新聞自由如何完備，記協認為「公道自在人心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府則以《區域法院就「串謀發布煽動刊物」案的判刑彰顯公義》為題，在昨晚發出新聞稿。政府發言人指早前的裁決理由已指出涉案文章並非以事實為基礎的新聞報導，「將煽動仇恨的言行歪曲成『新聞工作』是絕對的顛倒是非。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府發言人又指，裁決理由提到「三名被告不是進行真正的傳媒工作，而是參與當時所謂的抗爭」，從《立場新聞》的社論和其出版的刊物《立誌》可見「他們站在抗爭者的一邊與政府抗衡」，「干犯的罪行相當嚴重」。《立場新聞》有約160萬跟隨者，「涉案的煽動文章對中央和特區政府及其居民造成的傷害必然是相當嚴重，雖然難以量化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於有指本港新聞及言論自由受影響，政府發言人指裁決理由已指出《立場新聞》罔顧客觀事實，違背國際人權公約需按「負責任新聞作業」原則真誠地行事，而《基本法》和《香港人權法案》保障港人權利。港人和新聞工作者可「一如既往可以自由作出基於事實的評論或批評，及依法享有和行使新聞和言論自由，無須擔心會誤墮法網。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Nvoohlf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，鍾沛權今被判監禁21個月，林紹桐則可獲即時釋放。法官判刑時，拒納二人因履行新聞工作者報導責任及誤墮法網為減刑因素，指煽動罪自1938年已是成文法罪行，法例早已就傳媒可發布或不可發布的內容提供指引，而傳媒若以事實為基礎，「即使他的批評是猛烈和尖銳，他也不會干犯煽動罪」，而「只有那些意圖『打擦邊球』的人才會擔心誤墮法網」。法官認為，二人並非「單純的新聞工作者」，如專訪何桂藍顯然為她助選，中大衝突兩年專訪則重燃已冷卻的暴力抗爭，雖有將警方投訴列出，但「顯然是視警方的投訴為無物，增加他們對警方的藐視」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官批評，被告並非進行真正的傳媒工作，而是「參與當時所謂的抗爭」，「站在示威者的一邊與政府抗衡」；即使辯方指涉案文章無一篇是《立場》的意見，但他認為文章「完全可以幫助《立場》促進本土主義在香港萌芽和壯大」，「無論如何，雖然《立場》不是作者，它依然是發布者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;拒納履行新聞職責誤墮法網-指煽動罪已立多年早有指引&quot;&gt;拒納履行新聞職責、誤墮法網 指煽動罪已立多年早有指引&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官判刑時表明，3名被告不是因為履行新聞工作者的報導責任被定罪，強調煽動罪為特定意圖罪行，控方須證明發布者具煽動意圖或罔顧煽動後果，而法庭已從《立場》社論和刊物等，裁定其政治理念是本土主義，媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具；鍾沛權和林紹桐是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，因此不接納被告因履行新聞工作者報導責任為減刑因素。就辯方指，法庭無就新聞工作者限制訂指引，二人並非明知故犯、是誤墮法網，法官不同意，指煽動罪自1938年已是成文法罪行，大公報案表明煽動罪元素不包括煽動暴力，對傳媒工作者有指導作用；而《刑事罪行條例》第9條亦訂明煽動意圖以及合法辯解，法例早已就傳媒可發布或不可發布的內容提供指引，而且重點顯然在發布者意圖。此外，言論和新聞自由受《基本法》、《香港人權法》和《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》保障，即使回歸後本港無傳媒被控煽動案例，新聞工作者仍可參考大量海外案例，包括歐洲人權法院對編輯責任製作指引，在互聯網「唾手可得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於辯方指，法例從未指出評論文章必須「提出客觀基礎」才可避免指為煽動，法官指「這是不需要法例或政府指出的」，指任何一名新聞工作的人都知道，「新聞工作的首要責任是講真話，不是講假話、不是講半真半假的話」，當評論或意見得到真確事實、或發布者盡力查證為真確事實所支持，自然有「客觀基礎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指若以事實為基礎-即使批評猛烈尖銳亦不犯罪&quot;&gt;官指若以事實為基礎 即使批評猛烈尖銳亦不犯罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，法庭裁定被告是否發布煽動刊物時，會先考慮刊物是否具煽動意圖，如有，再考慮被告是否具煽動意圖，但他認為新聞工作者考慮的次序可對調——若他意圖發布批評政府或政權的文章，可先考慮發文意圖是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，若他抹黑中傷中央和特區，意圖嚴重破壞政府合法性等，「他自然要承擔罪責」；但若其批評不是為抹黑中傷、散播仇恨恐懼，是「以事實為基礎」，透過適當驗證確保事實真確性，並在呈現、描述和敘述評論或意見時「保持真誠公正的態度」，且根據傳媒倫理守則進行，「在這種情況下，即使他的批評是猛烈和尖銳，他也不會干犯煽動罪。」法官又指，即使後者不幸被控，控方舉證必然遇上困難，被告「亦絕對可指出他的強烈批評是如何有理有據」，及不具煽動意圖。法官指，「只有那些意圖『打擦邊球』的人才會擔心誤墮法網，因為他不是從他的意圖出發，而是從言論或文章的內容是否可以『偷雞』出發。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指作其他報導-不表示不會無煽動意圖&quot;&gt;官指作其他報導 不表示不會無煽動意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官並指，《立場》案發時無疑作出很多新聞報道，涵蓋官方和非官方人物的新聞、法庭新聞等，但這「並不表示3名被告不會在發布其他文章時沒有煽動的意圖」。官指《立場》作為網媒，自然須以新聞媒體的形象出現，但現今媒體吸引讀者的賣點「更多是它如何作出評論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指被告絕非單純新聞工作者-發布何桂藍專訪顯然為其助選&quot;&gt;官指被告絕非單純新聞工作者 發布何桂藍專訪顯然為其助選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，案發期間鍾沛權和林紹桐「絕對不是單純的新聞工作者」，以鍾沛權負責審批的何桂藍專訪為例，指《立場》專訪何並發布，「顯然是為參加民主派35+初選的何桂藍助選」，透過訪問讓她有機會說出早在2014年已參與撰寫本土主義的專題文章、對六四的覺醒，及曾到烏克蘭學習民主運動；亦將何過往號召他人支持郭榮鏗等在立法會拉布阻止國歌法立法的錄像嵌入文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，作者特別讓何桂藍說出選民選她而不是其他參選人的理由、及她即使攬炒自己也絕不與政權妥協，再以煽情手法問讀者會否選何。而專訪在7月7日發布後，《立場》在7月11日初選投票日首日再在網絡發布，但其他人的專訪無相同待遇，「毫無疑問，《立場》替何桂藍助選」，唯一合理和不可抗拒推論是《立場》和鍾沛權認同何的煽動言論及意圖發布。法官又指，何桂藍有接受其他訪問並發布，但該些媒體無在文章內或行為上說明他們認同何的煽動言論，亦無替何助選勝出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cLqlG4z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指中大衝突專訪列警投訴仍發布-顯然視投訴為無物增加對警藐視&quot;&gt;官指中大衝突專訪列警投訴仍發布 顯然視投訴為無物、增加對警藐視&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐負責審批的中大衝突兩周年專訪，法官裁定無客觀基礎下指中大學術自由受威脅、攻擊警方執法並美化暴動者行為，更嵌入片段比較校園暴動時及兩年後景象，出現「光時」等口號。法官認為，「這顯然是《立場》的編採決定」，藉文章意圖重新展示抗爭口號，重燃已冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公眾對政府及警方憎恨，可見《立場》和林紹桐「不是純粹履行傳媒的報道責任，而是意圖發布煽動文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，其他媒體亦曾發布參與「所謂『保衛中大』」示威者的專訪，雖受訪者聲稱「保衛中大」，但文章無提出警方或政權當時損害中大的學術自由，只是記錄示威者說法、事件對他們及家庭關係的影響等，《明報》相關文章一欄亦加入〈警員：從來無意攻入中大 保衛戰是偽問題〉的文章，「平衡了文章的內容」，但《立場》和林紹桐卻無相類似做法。法官又指，《立場》和林紹桐確實將警方投訴在文章開端和結尾以編按形式列出，但繼續發布該文章，「顯然是視警方的投訴為無物，增加他們對警方的藐視。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指涉案文章非編者話-官可助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大&quot;&gt;辯方指涉案文章非編者話 官：可助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，《立場》的社論及博客文章，散播出來的資訊是「中央政府是極權政府、特區政府是中央的傀儡，及警隊和法官是政權的打手」，必然意圖挑起港人對中央和特區政府的仇恨藐視，及不接受中央和特區政府的合法性和認受性。就辯方指煽動文章無一篇是《立場》的編者話或意見，法官認為：「這些文章完全可以幫助《立場》促進本土主義在香港萌芽和壯大。無論如何，雖然《立場》不是作者，它依然是發布者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官被告非進行傳媒工作而是參與抗爭與政府抗衡&quot;&gt;官：被告非進行傳媒工作、而是參與抗爭與政府抗衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健指，3名被告並非進行真正的傳媒工作，而是「參與當時所謂的抗爭」，從《立場》的社論和《立誌》可見，被告「站在示威者的一邊與政府抗衡」。他指被告的罪行嚴重，犯案持續1年5個月，「大部分處於香港社會過半民眾最不信任中央、特區政府、警隊及司法機關的時間」，而「立場」有近160萬名追蹤者，因此文章「對中央及政府和居民造成的傷害必然相當嚴重」，基於罪行嚴重性，監禁是唯一恰當選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納鍾下架文章屬放棄犯罪-判監21個月&quot;&gt;官拒納鍾下架文章屬放棄犯罪 判監21個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;刑期方面，就鍾沛權的量刑，郭官不接納《國安法》第33條的減刑理由適用，指鍾並非自動放棄犯罪，他移走部分文章，其「目的只是降低被執法機關對他及《立場》進行執法的風險」。郭官以23個月監禁為量刑起點，由於相隔一段時間才作裁決，對他構成壓力，故減刑兩個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，本案因譚得志的上訴案而押後，至現時判刑時，《監獄條例》已修訂，但郭官認為這不代表鍾未能獲行為良好的三分一扣減，只要他能夠令懲教署署長相信不會再犯危害國家安全的罪行，他就可獲刑期扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官考慮林紹桐患腎病易受致命感染-判即時釋放&quot;&gt;官考慮林紹桐患腎病易受致命感染 判即時釋放&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐，郭官指他在鍾辭職後才擔任《立場》署理總編輯，僅參與兩個月，牽涉一篇文章，因此以14個月監禁為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於減刑方面，由於辯方指林患上「抗嗜中性白血球細胞質抗體血管炎」，其抗體會攻擊自己的細胞，而腎功能低於正常三成，屬於第四期腎病，容易受到危及生命的感染，而林一直在瑪麗醫院接受治療，若返回獄中服刑的話，懲教署未必批准林到瑪麗就醫，但其主診醫生的照顧十分重要。因此，郭官決定減刑3個月，而林早前只還柙了10個月，即需要再入獄21天。惟郭官考慮到林需接受醫學監察，再入獄會對其生命構成威脅，因此判他可即時釋放的刑期，並下令林即時獲釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，鍾沛權今被判監禁21個月，林紹桐則可獲即時釋放。國安法指定法官郭偉健判刑時，提及由區家麟撰寫、無被納入檢控基礎的博客文章〈終審法院喜迎江湖新秩序〉，文中評論終院推翻黎智英獲高院批准保釋的判決，批評「法官們跪得很快很徹底」、「完全站在權貴立場」等。郭官斥：「即使是終審法院的判決，區家麟完全不尊重，語調輕挑、充滿藐視」，又指他沒有提出任何實質理據，也沒可能有任何客觀理由相信終院法官會不遵守誓言執行職務。郭官指區的文章明顯地具有引起市民憎恨司法機關的意圖，並強調：「毫無疑問，終審法院法官在司法界的地位是不可能受到任何政權的操弄。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官反駁區家麟稱法官受政權操弄不可能是正確&quot;&gt;官反駁區家麟稱法官受政權操弄「不可能是正確」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健判刑時拒納履行新聞工作者報道職責為減刑因素，指《立場》非進行真正傳媒工作、而是參與抗爭，涉案文章幫助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大（見另稿）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官另在判詞兩度提及區家麟的博客文章，指《立場》刊登區家麟等人的博客文章，肆意攻擊和抹黑《國安法》，藐視司法，「尤其是將指定法官描述為被政權操弄，而這些法官亦願意接受操弄或自行配合」，惟「這一點不可能是正確」。法官指，區家麟和鍾沛權「根本沒有證據顯示政權操控法官，更沒有證據證明指定法官屈服於政權之下而不是根據其法官誓言執行職務」。而他們不可能不知法官李運騰是首批被委任為指定法官的原訟庭法官，據他們說法，李「必然是政權的打手」，但「假若這是事實，他們又如何解釋李法官批准黎智英保釋外出」，法官批評區從無在此方面解釋，鍾沛權亦「視而不見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官嚴詞斥區家麟完全不尊重法院判決-語調輕挑充滿藐視&quot;&gt;官嚴詞斥區家麟完全不尊重法院判決 「語調輕挑、充滿藐視」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於辯方多次指被裁定煽動的文章只有11篇，佔《立場》整體文章數量約0.001%，無證據餘下99.99%的文章涉煽動，郭官表示不想論述其餘文章，以免被指擴大檢控基礎，但為回應辯方陳詞，以區家麟另一篇博客文章〈終審法院喜迎江湖新秩序〉為例，它刊於2021年2月11日，當日正正是終院推翻法官李運騰批准黎智英保釋外出的判決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官引述區在文章中批評司法機關和法官的句子，包括「讀終審法院有關黎智英保釋上訴的判案書，才不過幾段，只見法官們跪得很快很徹底，權力永遠是對的，人權法治聊作點綴」、「法官所理解的社會背景，完全站在權貴立場，並非站在人權公義的視角」、「判詞也略提到香港人享有公民自由、無罪假定等原則，但只是口甜舌滑一番」、「終審法院反駁，律政司一些技術性理據⋯顯得終審法院還有點自主、有點權威，但這些技術性細節上的反駁，只屬趴在地上嗱番拃沙之舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hLGt8ss.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 區家麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官語氣稍強地指：「即使是終審法院的判決，區家麟完全不尊重，語調輕挑，充滿藐視，但他沒有提出任何實質理據，他更加沒有亦沒可能有任何客觀的理由相信終審法院法官會不遵守法官誓言執行職務。」郭官強調，「毫無疑問，終審法院法官在司法界的地位是不可能受到任何政權的操弄。」區的文章明顯地具有引起市民憎恨司法機關的意圖，而區亦視而不見。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黃振強自行求情指「出庭指證難免受憎恨或潛在報復」冀獲減刑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AKtahPt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年「屠龍」小隊等被指計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警察，遭律政司起訴反恐怖主義條例，他們亦被控「串謀謀殺」警察。陪審團裁定6名被告無罪，1名被告交替罪成。認罪被告、「屠龍」隊長黃振強在審訊中以「污點證人」身份作供。他今（26日）在高等法院自行求情。法官張慧玲指黃雖有作供，但「你畀完口供嗰啲、關你事嘅個個都罪名不成立，『屠龍』全部罪名不成立」，並問黃有否就減刑作補充。黃表示：「希望法官閣下可以考慮人身威脅呢個因素，呢宗案件牽涉好多殺傷力武器，我出庭指證相關人士，以及一啲仍然在逃嘅人士，難免會受到佢哋憎恨或者潛在嘅報復。」黃最後哽咽稱：「我對於2019年反修例運動期間所犯下嘅罪行，同對社會造成嘅破壞深感歉疚同抱歉。我會藉住監獄嘅時間積極進修⋯⋯將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件暫定11月14日判刑。明天將由蘇緯軒、彭軍壕、蔡凱明及陳玉龍求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃振強大律師有事-未能繼續代表&quot;&gt;黃振強大律師有事 未能繼續代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還柙中的黃振強身穿灰黑色西裝、手持文件步入犯人欄，他一度望向旁聽席微笑。法官張慧玲向黃確認，原本代表他的陳大律師是否有事而未能繼續代表他；黃同意。控方讀出黃的經歷口供，他於1998年9月出生，案發時任職搭棚工，月入3萬。他於案發時並沒有刑事紀錄，自2019年12月8日起被捕還柙至今。黃同意張官更正，他於案發時已辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指黃作供後屠龍全部罪名不成立&quot;&gt;官指黃作供後、「屠龍」全部罪名不成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官指，黃並非最早認罪，因此不會有三分一減刑。原本代表黃的大律師，早前已向法庭呈交求情陳詞，提及希望法庭考慮黃有出庭作供，而給予額外減刑。張官指黃雖然作供，但「你畀完口供嗰啲、關你事嘅個個都罪名不成立，『屠龍』全部罪名不成立」，「你畀咗兩個星期嘅口供，陪審團唔信，或者有疑問。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃稱出庭指證難免會受對方潛在報復-冀法庭予減刑&quot;&gt;黃稱出庭指證難免會受對方潛在報復 冀法庭予減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述求情陳詞指，黃選擇認罪後，同案被告吳智鴻才改為認罪；黃同意這點。黃另補充：「希望法官閣下可以考慮人身威脅呢個因素，因為呢宗案件牽涉好多殺傷力武器，我出庭指證相關人士，以及一啲仍然在逃嘅人士，難免會受到佢哋憎恨或者潛在嘅報復。」黃再補充，希望法庭可以考慮他被捕時提供的手機證據，對案件有幫助，「協助控方理解成件事嘅案情同埋真相，件案好大程度依賴我手機嘅證據去組織返案情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃哽咽表示將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人&quot;&gt;黃哽咽表示「將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最後哽咽向張官表示：「我對於2019年反修例運動期間所犯下嘅罪行，同對社會造成嘅破壞深感歉疚同抱歉。我明白要面對好長嘅刑期，我會藉住監獄嘅時間積極進修，反思自己嘅錯誤，報答家人師長朋友嘅照顧，將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人，多謝法官閣下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張官一度問控方，就「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，黃承認的案情牽涉400多萬款項，但審訊期間卻顯示所涉金額並非如此多，而法庭量刑時該如何考慮。控方認為，法庭可考慮400多萬作為判刑基礎，並非只依賴審訊期間的證供，而且罪行的基礎是計算「進進出出」的累積金額。張官另問到，控方能否提供涉及眾籌的案例，控方指有一宗英國案例相關。案件暫定11月14日判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強早前承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪；而「串謀謀殺」及「管有爆炸品」罪則獲存檔法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告不認罪，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪亦不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv’s signature of the statute on 21 August came several weeks after Russia’s 8 July attack on a paediatric hospital, which killed over 35 people (including four children) and injured another 190, in Russia’s latest egregious crime committed during its war of aggression in Ukraine. In the face of such a tragedy, OSINT analysts in Ukraine and further afield were quick to identify the make and composition of the Kh-101 missile that hit the hospital, denying Russia the opportunity to mask the attack and affirming the increasing relevance of OSINT in holding the Kremlin accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSINT’s relevance to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is no coincidence, but rather the result of OSINT’s gradual development and acceptance in recent years, in parts thanks to advancements in data tools including geolocation and chronolocation software. Realising its full potential requires a coordinated and prepared approach from government, the private sector and civil society – no small undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;squaring-the-evidentiary-triangle&quot;&gt;Squaring the Evidentiary Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, from Luhansk to Lviv and around the world, the online community is filming, posting and resharing evidence of Russian war crimes on social media, online fora and journalistic sites in the hope that someday, victims might hold the guilty to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OSINT techniques in documenting modern crises has demonstrated a need to expand the production of criminal evidence beyond the traditional triangle of law enforcement, forensic experts and witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the aftermath of the Second World War, OSINT has gradually played a more pivotal role in holding perpetrators of international transgressions to account. For example, starting in 1945, photography and film offered critical evidence during the Nuremberg Trials. From 1993–94, documentation from news channels, online fora and satellite imagery led to the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Beginning in the 2000s, cell phone photos and videos, geo-referencing tools, drones and social media captured information crucial for the hybrid internationalised tribunals for the conflicts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia in 2001 and Lebanon in 2009. Finally, in March 2011, images of clashes in Darʿā, a rural province of southern Syria, changed everything, giving birth to the first “war feeds”, or “digital war in plain sight”. During the Syrian conflict, OSINT was regularly pivotal in correcting war narratives, especially surrounding the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In We Are Bellingcat, Elliot Higgins highlights how, even as hopes for international support in Syria dwindled, OSINT analysts continued documenting and disseminating evidence of human rights violations on social media. Collaborations like the Google/Bellingcat-supported Syrian Archive validated the dangers faced by Syrians in gathering evidence and solidified OSINT’s role in facilitating evidence collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spinning-the-web-of-accountability&quot;&gt;Spinning the “Web of Accountability”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court, ultimately pursuing greater degrees of accountability for criminals and malign actors than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its partners have jointly pursued a “web of accountability” – a term coined in March 2023 at the United for Justice conference in Lviv – for war crime investigations in Ukraine. However, the pseudo-network of strands comprising this web are messy and convoluted, spanning an amalgamation of actors in nearly as many jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;What was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the OSINT network dedicated to uncovering war crimes in Ukraine comprises – at a minimum – six legal firms, nine academic hubs, 19 OSINT investigative teams (including names like Berkeley’s Human Rights Investigations Lab, Osint For Ukraine, Global Rights Compliance and the Ukrainian Molfar), 17 special IT projects (which range from apps like e-Enemy to blockchain solutions like project Dokas), a sub-network of 23 judicial bodies in Ukraine and further afield, and 39 civil society organisations (including the 5AM Coalition) that collect and document potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. These actors are intricately linked with judicial authorities across the West and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Investigation Team and the CICED Database at Eurojust epitomise this collaborative spirit, pooling resources and evidence with enhanced support. Additionally, the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group – a collaborative venture between the EU, UK and US – provides tailored guidance to war crime prosecutors. Another effort, the Dialogue Group on Accountability for Ukraine – an initiative led by Ukraine, the ICC and the EU – aggregates workstreams from Ukraine’s General Prosecution Office, international accountability actors, domestic and foreign accountability providers, and civil society organisations. USAID’s Human Rights in Action Programme is funding study visits and advanced training (inclusive of OSINT modules) in international criminal law and justice for Ukrainian lawyers. Europol has also established an OSINT taskforce to facilitate international investigations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The Council of Europe has launched the CyberUA project, which aims to enhance Ukraine’s capabilities in handling electronic evidence related to war crimes and gross human rights violations. In short, there are several notable cases of successful international cooperation in leveraging open source information for documenting war crimes in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these achievements, however, interorganisational coordination is arduous. Actors may not know of each other’s existence and do not necessarily have the means, forums or trust to collaborate. “The current landscape lacks a unified model for archiving war crimes evidence, with various platforms operating in isolation and without full integration”, stressed Roksolana Burianenko, former programme manager for Mnemonic’s Ukrainian Archive. “The key issue is the absence of a coordinated approach and a governance system to harmonise efforts across different archives and actors. Such coordination is essential not only for accountability, but also for creating a digital memorial that captures the Ukrainian people’s suffering. In our digital age, establishing these archives and memorials should, and could, happen much faster than in the past”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is paradoxical: actors across nearly every sector of society are tackling overlapping aspects of war crimes investigations, but those same actors are so siloed that communication is inconsistent and cooperation is sporadic, even in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-osint&quot;&gt;Leveraging OSINT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strengths that OSINT lends to war crime investigations, the sheer amount of information (and disinformation) in the open sources, the costs of upskilling to use this information, and judicial wariness of open source information pose several challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-overload&quot;&gt;Information Overload&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense and ever-growing volume of digital evidence – from sources including social media, blogs, online forums, CCTV footage, livestreams and satellite – deepens the web of accountability’s inefficiency. The Ukrainian Archive contains a staggering 6,930,635 videos from 9,567 sources, and even this represents only a fraction of the pieces of open source evidence amassed by the 5AM Coalition. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office keeps a diligent count of registered crimes of aggression and war crimes since February 2022. At the time of writing, this number exceeds 143,899 – a testament to the enormity of the task at hand. For comparison, the office records only 19,274 crimes against national security in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Overall, we have 5 million digital records in our system”, says a chief investigator for Mnemonic. “We are preserving the potential human rights violations and possible war crimes from all parties, but only a small percentage is being really analysed. While preservation of data was our initial priority, the community now aims to undertake analysis, mapping and tagging on a larger scale to harness the full potential of the preserved data. With all the data we have collected it would take decades, probably, if not longer, to investigate every single one of these files!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the volatile nature of conflict zones and the complexity of war crimes make it difficult to verify the authenticity of digital evidence. Russia has enthusiastically compounded these issues by flooding online spaces with disinformation and propaganda, propagating conflicting narratives and leveraging deepfake technology in ways that highlight the need for continuous adaptation and innovation in the use of OSINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prohibitive-capacity-building-costs&quot;&gt;Prohibitive Capacity-Building Costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the overwhelming availability of OSINT evidence is one problem, the costs of storing and processing this evidence represent another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a pressing need for a technological platform”, argues Lindsay Freeman, co-author of the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations, “that enables civil society groups and documentarians on the ground to securely store digital evidence. This idea, like a ‘digital evidence locker’, has been widely discussed, but even the biggest NGOs face significant challenges in scaling and securing such operations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this evidence is stored, investigators and legal professionals often require training to ensure they can efficiently handle and process OSINT-generated evidence. Thus, another obstruction facing the coordinated use of OSINT by actors investigating war crimes is a difficult trade-off: should they invest time, resources and funding into trainings and platform subscriptions, or leave investigators aimlessly sifting through datasets that grow with each social media post and website refresh, further burying key evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, actors with more resources can advance their application of OSINT in their investigations, while others are left further behind in capacity and capabilities. This disparity exacerbates the web of accountability’s patchwork use of OSINT. “Technical trainings on software techniques and OSINT methods should not be confined to exclusive clubs; there is a need of some form of modernisation and update of these investigative and legal communities to achieve a more effective usage of the concept of Universal Jurisdiction”, says Burianenko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;courtroom-challenges&quot;&gt;Courtroom Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a judicial perspective, accountability structures need time to adapt to the introduction of OSINT as an evidence collection tool as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, courts often have varying admissibility criteria for open source evidence, which needs to be handled accordingly. “I’m certainly not against open-source investigations”, Freeman clarifies, “but I insist on their execution within the bounds of legal standards. It’s heartening to see many in the OSINT field have significantly honed their methodologies … [but some] tend to leap to conclusions prematurely. In criminal proceedings, where establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is the cornerstone, selecting a single hypothesis from a spectrum without adequately exploring alternative scenarios can be a major oversight”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeman also indicates that the aforementioned information deluge compounds the legal difficulties of using OSINT. “Much of what’s captured during a conflict is [more relevant] for historians and won’t directly feed into crime documentation … Flooding [judges] with an excessive amount of information is not just tactically unsound; it risks prolonging the trial unnecessarily and could potentially infringe upon procedural efficiency”. For actors to use OSINT to evidence war crimes in a way that could be effective in judicial proceedings, they therefore need to be incisively selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The essence is ‘data minimisation’, to gather only what’s pertinent to the case at hand”, continues Freeman. “This requires setting precise research questions and establishing a clear investigative direction – to discern what must be proven and what evidence is genuinely relevant, whether it incriminates or exonerates”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-labour-of-love&quot;&gt;A Labour of Love&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable. Thankfully, several mechanisms are already in place that could facilitate both a more efficient, well-connected web of accountability and the closer integration of OSINT into that web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU, which supports Ukrainian rule of law institutions and agencies with EUAM Ukraine, is investing over €10 million to support the ICC, as well as over €6 million on IT and equipment for the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Training Centre, civil society organisations and new, dedicated accountability structures. EUAM has also helped coordinate workshops designed to assist Ukrainian legal offices and courts with admitting OSINT war crime evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other allies of Ukraine are pursuing similar support and coordination structures. For example, the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) aims to be “the first step in this process to preserve evidence and prepare cases for future trials” with the help of a joint investigation team led by Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Romania, and with additional participation from the ICC and financial support from the US. The EU also supports the Register of Damage, which records “claims and evidence on damage, loss or injury caused by the Russian Federation’s internationally illegal acts in or against Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As initiatives like the ICPA seek greater coordination for evidence collection and processing, other partners are specifically facilitating opportunities to boost OSINT capabilities. In December 2023, the UK committed £3.7 million to the “documentation, investigation, and prosecution of war crimes committed in Ukraine”, which will fund training for Ukrainian authorities to develop “skills in verifying and utilising open-source intelligence, including materials uploaded by mobile phones to social media, and train prosecutors in preparing strong and well-evidenced legal cases”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts, among others, to develop a comprehensive, technology-centric and OSINT-enabled approach are encouraging, but there is always more work to be done. As stated by the ICPA, “we are dealing with an international crime that has rarely been prosecuted and for which there is no standard practice”. Holding war crimes perpetrators accountable will require an equally unprecedented commitment to innovative collaboration in evidencing and prosecuting atrocious crimes in Ukraine, but the benefits of doing so – chief among them, a secure and sovereign Ukraine – are worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sophisticated remote pager and walkie-talkie attacks on Hezbollah on 17–18 September were followed by an intensive Israeli air campaign against the militant group, which is ongoing. These events were hailed by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as a new phase in the country’s conflict with Hezbollah and a shift of gravity in Israel’s conflict from south to north. These actions, driven by intelligence breakthroughs and rapid decision-making, mark a critical moment in the ongoing conflict in the region and could have far-reaching implications for regional stability and Israel’s political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-use-it-or-lose-it-moment&quot;&gt;Israel’s “Use it or Lose it” Moment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensational events of last week were, arguably, a suboptimal military outcome for Israel. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for either attack, though the capability and intelligence from allies point to its involvement. The pager and then the walkie-talkie attacks were originally designed to be the opening salvo in a coordinated and total attack against Hezbollah. This would undoubtedly have been devastating, rendering communications obsolete for Hezbollah while being prepared to simultaneously hit hard with drone and missile strikes, maybe even alongside a ground incursion. Despite this careful planning, US sources have reported that Israel’s leaders were forced to either act instantly or risk losing this asset. This was a “use it or lose it” moment, and has ultimately led Israel to ramp up its pressure on the north to follow what Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah fairly identified as a “declaration of war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activation of the pager attack was forced upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel followed up with the movement of the 98th Division, a paratrooper division, from Gaza to the northern border on 18 September. In addition to this, Gallant visited aircraft bases on the northern border in the immediate aftermath of the pager attack. Israel then activated another of its assets in the walkie-talkie attack, another “use it or lose it moment” as reeling Hezbollah security officials (as well as embedded Iranian officers) began to look for other infiltrations. Israel has since begun a brutal missile campaign against Hezbollah with strikes in Southern Lebanon as well as in Beirut, where Israel reported the successful assassination of Ibrahim Aqil, a senior Hezbollah commander. According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health, these attacks killed almost 500 and wounded many more on 23 September alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s “shock and awe” strategy in Lebanon is clear, proving capability and intent to strike and eliminate targets at will until Hezbollah agrees to Israel’s demand to withdrawing its troops and missile silos to beyond the Litani River. After activating their pager asset, Israeli commanders were forced to activate their walkie-talkie asset before it was detected. The forced use of these two key assets led Netanyahu to believe that this was his best chance to push for a victory against Hezbollah with further missile strikes and assassinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel’s “shock and awe” strategy in Lebanon is clear, proving capability and intent to strike and eliminate targets at will until Hezbollah agrees to its demands&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that throughout this last week Netanyahu has been led by events, and not the other way around. Despite this, he will be delighted that he is one step closer to reclaiming the “Mr Defence” reputation that has seen him serve a record eight terms as prime minister. After the shock of 7 October and the hostages that Israel has not been able to bring home, this is a moment of victory for the Israel Defense Forces, Israeli intelligence services and Netanyahu himself in re-asserting the competence and superiority of Israeli capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel will ultimately hope that ramping up pressure on Hezbollah through its continuing assassination and missile campaign will force its troops back behind the Litani River (some 18 miles from the current border, as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1701). This would allow Israel to return 200,000 displaced refugees to cities and villages in the north and score a major political and legitimacy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-crushing-blow-for-hezbollah&quot;&gt;A Crushing Blow for Hezbollah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Hezbollah, the pager and walkie-talkie attacks represented the most significant failure for the organisation since the 2006 war. In three days, Israel’s intelligence services blatantly proved their ability to infiltrate and destroy Hezbollah’s command-and-control structures. This began with the remote detonation of several thousand pagers on Tuesday and was followed up by the remote detonation of thousands of walkie-talkies used by the terrorist group on Wednesday. For Hezbollah this is a serious blow that carries a number of serious implications for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the successful outcome of the Israeli operation exposed fundamental weaknesses in the group’s command-and-control mechanisms. Hezbollah already operates in an extremely difficult command-and-control environment due to extensive human intelligence and Pegasus spyware, where Israeli intelligence can compromise mobile phones simply by sending them a signal. This environment has forced Hezbollah to operate on a network of cells which rely on almost constant top-down delegation. The inevitable restructuring as well as the human capacity that Hezbollah has lost will hamper the group’s ability to effectively resist Israel’s attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there has been an impact on Hezbollah’s legitimacy. Israel’s attacks are a humiliation for the group, representing as they do a colossal security failure. Hezbollah’s inability to prevent the attacks and protect Lebanon (as it claims to do) makes its position extremely difficult. The severity of this legitimacy hit is demonstrated by Nasrallah being forced to admit that Hezbollah has suffered a major and unprecedented blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Hezbollah’s position is made more difficult by its lack of credible options to respond. Hezbollah cannot afford a full-scale conflict with Israel and will be wary of giving Netanyahu the slightest justification for further attacks or a ground incursion. At the same time, however, Nasrallah has furious internal stakeholders demanding revenge. The only real pressure valve available to him in this extremely difficult position is being able to claim attacks by the Axis of Resistance as consequences for Israel’s actions. This axis is comprised of an aligned group in the region, led by Iran and including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and various militia groups, who claim to resist Israel and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-questions-for-the-axis-of-resistance&quot;&gt;Wider Questions for the Axis of Resistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a major test for the Axis of Resistance. Iran has watched seemingly powerlessly as Hezbollah, its ally, has been pummelled again and again by Israel. The refugees streaming out of Southern Lebanon towards Beirut are another example of the pressure Israel is applying on Hezbollah. Iran is also yet to respond to Israel’s assassination of Ismayel Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Iranian leaders and key Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps figures will be increasingly frustrated that they have been unable to re-establish credible deterrence against Israel. This is a particularly sore point as it is fairly clear by now that their April missile and drone strikes against Israel were ineffective in achieving this. We can expect to see an evolving Iranian strategy that aims to place maximum diplomatic pressure on Israel through moves such as encouraging proxies to strike at Israel, as well as threatening regional stability and shipping lanes. We may also see Iran to make diplomatic overtures to the West to exert more diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hezbollah cannot afford a full-scale conflict with Israel and will be wary of giving Netanyahu the slightest justification for further attacks or a ground incursion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to be aware of is that there are multiple smaller militia groups and individual cells within Hezbollah that have the potential for escalation. Many of these smaller or splinter groups may feel that they must respond to Israel with an independent attack that pre-empts or goes beyond Hezbollah’s so far very measured response. This danger is illustrated by previous attacks on UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon, such as the attack that resulted in the death of Private Sean Rooney in December 2022. If one of these smaller groups was to hit an Israeli population centre, either on purpose or by mistake, the tension could easily spill over into a larger-scale conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-usisrael-relationship&quot;&gt;The US–Israel Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting dynamic to note is that the pager attacks and subsequent missile campaign represent another case of Israel making aggressive decisions without first consulting the US. Prior examples of this include the decision to invade Rafah, rejecting any possibility of a future Palestinian state as part of negotiations, and missile campaigns on non-combat areas in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the US is Israel’s main ally and security guarantor, this trend embodies the increasing risk appetite of the current Israeli government. This is likely due to an assessment of the strategic environment, particularly Iran’s reluctance to enter a full-scale conflict, but also represents a political calculation by Netanyahu. Once again, the only way for Netanyahu to safeguard his short-term survival is by taking decisions that ensure Israel remains in a state of conflict. Followers of Israeli politics will not need reminding that Netanyahu faces three criminal cases that will progress as soon as he loses the premiership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escalation perhaps also reflects a weakness in the US’s security arrangements, as it has been unable to effectively dissuade and disincentivise its own allies from escalation. The US has made it very clear that its priority, especially approaching the presidential election, is for regional de-escalation. This is illustrated by the exhaustive diplomatic efforts made since 7 October to reach a settlement between Iran, Hezbollah and Israel in order to keep the border cool. When the new US administration takes office later this year, its first priority in terms of Middle East policy must be addressing the balance of power between Washington and the Israeli prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a shock because, in a world where the use of aggressive war has been a contravention of international law since 1945. It was not a surprise because Western intelligence agencies had detected indications of a possible attack from late 2021, and they had made their conclusions public.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;They did so in part to deter Russia and in part to build “Western resolve.” The intelligence was also passed on to Ukraine, even if many in Kyiv struggled to accept that Russia would actually invade. The real surprise for several commentators and for U.S. intelligence itself was not the invasion but its immediate aftermath. The Russian forces failed to achieve a quick success, and Ukraine, in turn, mounted an effective response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine was not the first time that both participants in a war and their observers on the sidelines have made the wrong calls. It will probably not be the last, although the purpose of this report is to mitigate that danger in one particular case: a possible clash between the United States and the People’s Republic of China in the Pacific. No one example will exactly match any other. However, the quality and quantity of information — much of it not the product of leaks from official agencies but from open sources like Bellingcat — make the overestimation of Russia’s capacities and the underestimation of Ukraine’s particularly egregious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz considered that “a great part of the information obtained in war is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part somewhat doubtful.” In Clausewitz’s day, most tactical intelligence was collected by cavalry patrols, and much of it was dependent on rumors, often inflated, or on reports from illiterate peasants of doubtful loyalty. Because of the inherent unreliability of the intelligence on which planning and operations were based in the Napoleonic era, he observed, “what a dangerous edifice war is, how easily it may fall to pieces and bury us in its ruins.” The advent of wireless, the consequent collection of signals intelligence, the development of aerial reconnaissance, and now the use of drones and satellites for persistent surveillance have all transformed the quantity and quality of information available to commanders. Artificial intelligence and its capacity to handle and interpret big data promise to deliver an era of intelligence-led operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent experience, however, should warn against hubris. Information superiority has not in itself delivered victory in recent wars, despite its capacity to enable stunning individual successes. In the 1990s, the assumption that dominant battlespace knowledge could allow the United States to dictate the tempo and outcomes of armed conflict was a key feature of the “revolution in military affairs,” but it did not prove of much use in preventing the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States or in directing the wars that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan to satisfactory conclusions. It, therefore, behooves states and their organizations to consider why their expectations were not correct and how they might do better next time. For there will be a next time: that is another reason why wars, even if they are shocks, should never be surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place to begin any such exercise in lesson-learning from the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, is with those assumptions that are so inherent they are the most likely to be left unquestioned by otherwise well-informed analysts, whether they are from Beltway think tanks or government intelligence agencies. This prologue to the report that follows sets out eight such assumptions, several of which have a resonance that goes beyond the specifics of the Ukraine case. They illustrate how easy it is to take shortcuts in some thinking, not least because ideas are taken from others who are presumed to be experts without critical reflection, or — in the case of the United States’ allies — because they accept them from the United States without giving them context. In some cases, these ideas may indeed be appropriate in Washington, but they may not travel so well to the capitals of the United States’ partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first of these assumptions is the short-war illusion.&lt;/strong&gt; The expectation of an easy Russian victory in February 2022 began here, with the argument that the war would be short. What is a short war? Historians conventionally describe World War I as a long war because it did not end by Christmas 1914. That was the hope of those who were mobilized and taken from their families and peacetime jobs in late July 1914, but it was not the conclusion of many prewar staff planners who had thought more deeply about the issues. When they looked at the dependencies created by alliance structures and the effects of industrialization on war’s conduct, they were not convinced that the war could end so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular expectations, and their rapid disappointment, have led many to see World War I as a “long” war, a point that is sustained when one bears in mind that, after the German armistice of November 11, 1918, bitter fighting continued from the Baltic to the Balkans and across the southern arc of the British and French empires until the last peace treaty was signed in 1923. But on one reading, particularly if one takes 1918 as its traditional end point, World War I was not so long, especially in relation to its scale. At just over four years, it was shorter than World War II (1937–45), and much shorter than the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), or the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). It was also shorter than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality in any war — especially after it has started — is that few of its participants can anticipate the war ending tomorrow, but they will still hope that something will happen to end it in the next six months or so, precipitated perhaps by a surprise attack at the front or by a sudden domestic collapse in the enemy’s rear. After three or four months of conflict, when the possibility of a quick victory, or its corollary, the danger of quick defeat, has passed, such speculations look to an event out of the ordinary, one that is not on the immediate horizon but could have an instantaneous effect — such as the addition of a major new ally or the collapse of a coalition. World War I and World War II were transformed in 1917 and 1941, respectively, by the former. Both world wars ended with the victors acting with growing coherence while the soon-to-be defeated powers lost whatever unity they possessed and sought separate ways out of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalents by the autumn of 2022 were the hopes that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was fatally ill or that Russia would, once again, as in 1905 and 1917, respond to war with revolution. When these hopes are regularly postponed, they are abandoned as fantasies, and so the short war expectation becomes a long war in reality. It does so through accumulation: the end never ceases to be somewhere around the next corner. The main point, however, is that neither “short” nor “long” is an adjective endowed with any precision, despite the determination of analysts to use both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How short or long did analysts think the Russian invasion would be? Three days? Three months? Three years? Any of these would have revealed how devoid of context they were. By February 2022, the war was already into its ninth year and, by most standards, had become a long war even before the Russian invasion. In 2013–14, Ukraine effectively acquiesced in the loss of Crimea and parts of the Donbas. That acquiescence magnified the capabilities of the Russian forces because they were not tested. It locked in the minds of Western observers the apparent threat of “hybrid” war, even if hybrid war was largely fabricated by NATO. It ignored what became, in the jargon, a “frozen conflict” — a misnomer — even a euphemism — given that fighting continued and people were killed. It also led to an underestimation of what Ukraine achieved between 2014 and 2022 as it sought to put its armed forces on a better footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aided by training teams from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Ukraine prepared over eight years for a possible renewal of more active hostilities. From 2014 onward, it enhanced its capacity for national mobilization and popular resistance, prepared plans for territorial defense, and built up both the training and the tactical and operational competence of its battalions and brigades. A striking omission was the failure of those powers charged with advising Ukraine to consolidate the knowledge of its fighting capacity gleaned from their training missions or to integrate the views of those who executed these tasks into any strategic assessments. The reports submitted by the advisers were, at least in the United Kingdom’s case, treated as matters of defense engagement and not as an index of the levels of preparedness for the next round of fighting. Effectively, they went into a separate, self-contained file and were not shared at a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second assumption that reveals remarkably little about war in reality is that, in order to mount a successful offensive, the attacker requires a 3:1 superiority.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its endless repetition, that statement is profoundly misleading. Only very rarely has that margin of superiority been available to any military commander. Unusually, however, the preinvasion analysis of Russia and Ukraine’s relative strengths insisted that this was, in fact, the sort of advantage which Russia was alleged to enjoy. As of November 2020, Russia was reported to have 900,000 active-duty troops to Ukraine’s 209,000, 2 million reservists to 900,000, and similar ratios in terms of tanks and guns. Its superiority in combat aircraft was even greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality in most armed forces is that strengths on paper do not convert into actual numbers available for combat. The result, and this was true in February 2022, is that forces are frequently much more evenly balanced and that, if they are not, the inferior force avoids battle and opts for other methods like guerrilla warfare or terrorism. Russia did not manage to create a local superiority of 3:1 and had not even sought to do so. On December 30, 2021, the Financial Times put the total Russian force on the Ukrainian border at 175,000. This was definitely not a 3:1 advantage. Nonetheless, it was enough for some analysts to conclude that “Russia’s military superiority would enable it to overrun Ukraine’s army in weeks by launching assaults on multiple fronts.” That interpretation of Russian intent was right, but it ignored the fact that Russia lacked the manpower to put it into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the assumption about the inherent superiority of Russia was not one just about quantity but also about quality. It reflected a greater faith in the professional soldier than in the conscript or national serviceperson.&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian forces were portrayed in glowing terms twice over, as professional soldiers and as professionals with extensive combat experience, most recently in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculation rested on three core assumptions. The first was NATO’s own rejection of the principles of mass and national service in favor of long-service professionals better adapted for expeditionary warfare than home defense. Even France and Germany, the long-standing exemplars in Europe of the conscript army, went down that route in 1997 and 2011, respectively. The United Kingdom and the United States, territorially more secure because of the sea and with their defenses also underpinned by nuclear deterrence, had done so even earlier, in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Both Russia and Ukraine are continental states with long land frontiers, and neither could afford to make such a choice. Moreover, their immediate western neighbors, the most resilient Eastern European and Scandinavian states — Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland — either never abandoned conscription after 1991 or have returned to it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine’s own combat experience since 2014 was discounted as somehow insignificant because it had been gained in a “frozen” conflict, not in an active, high-tempo war. The one-sidedness of the estimates of relative quality was striking, not so much for their underestimation of the Ukrainian army as for their almost complete lack of attention to it. As a result — and the third attribute of this third assumption — very little attention was given to what Ukraine’s own professional forces had learned from the continuity and depth of their combat experience over a period of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, the prewar assessments were conditioned by the Military Balance, the annual publication of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which counts the equipment and manpower strengths of each state.&lt;/strong&gt; A standard reference in the think tank community (for good reason), the Military Balance has encouraged generations of analysts to begin any judgments of capability with crude numbers — a process rarely put to the test in the Cold War because it never became hot. That approach in itself is not unreasonable precisely because it is capable of some form of exactness. But that very feature gives it a dominance that overshadows efforts to assess its less quantifiable aspects — will, morale, and intent. These, too, are part of fighting power and its measurement. For those who forgot that, Ukraine’s response since February 24, 2022, has reminded them that all three matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two direct consequences emerged from the prewar estimates as a result. First, insufficient account was taken of the fact that Ukraine’s soldiers were defending their homeland and that its people were fighting an existential war for national survival. Debates about the motivators for high morale, which focus, for example, on small-group cohesion, pale into insignificance in comparison with the unifying effects of legitimate and passionate national defense. The surprise — not that it should have been — was the fact that the sum of the state’s military capabilities did not represent the full sum of Ukraine’s defensive strength. If it were true that the number of professional soldiers married to sophisticated technology invariably trumped motivation and self-belief, the United States might have done better in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and related consequence was the mistake of treating prewar measurements as predictors of wartime applications. States may want to match each other before a war, not least to deter their adversaries from attacking, but during a war, they endeavor to exploit differences to establish a relative advantage. They seek ways to exploit enemy vulnerabilities, not just to match strength with strength. Arms races, peacetime military competition, and the Military Balance focus attention on the latter, but, in doing so, fail to reflect war’s realities. After the 9/11 attacks, the United States called its enemies’ refusal to pitch like against like “asymmetric” warfare, as though they were somehow behaving unfairly by not meeting it on a level playing field in the sort of battle for which the United States had prepared and so reckoned it would win. But by so derogating asymmetric warfare, the United States failed to take sufficient account not just of the resilience and adaptability of Iraqi militias or the Taliban but, ultimately, also of Ukrainian strength in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part and parcel of this approach is a continuing fifth assumption that there is a clear division between the “conventional” operations of “major war” and the insurgent and guerrilla warfare historically associated with “small wars.”&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, an analyst from the Institute for the Study of War commented in January 2022, had created “a large-scale maneuver army to conduct operations against Ukraine.” That military capability had been modernized since 2008 and especially since 2014. However, that analyst and another from the Center for Naval Analyses recognized that if the Russian invasion in February 2022 became a protracted conflict, it would also turn into an insurgency. The war in Ukraine would, therefore, become a quagmire for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some commentators, this was the gleam on the horizon. Although Kyiv would fall and Russia would win quickly in the opening conventional phase of the war, a national insurgency would follow. The relative insouciance with which some senior politicians accepted this scenario demonstrated a striking ignorance of what an insurgency would do — and had done very recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would have divided the Ukrainian people; it would have broken the state; it would have fostered criminality and corruption, both in part legitimized by their necessary role in funding resistance; and it would have made the transfer to peace and the recovery of national unity even more protracted and complex than the war’s current shape — that of an interstate conflict — suggests is likely. This sequencing, conventional success for one side followed by that side’s exhaustion and possible defeat in a much messier, protracted war, appealed because it was familiar: it did, of course, mirror the experience of the United States in its post-9/11 wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the United States, aided by the Northern Alliance, took Kabul in short order, but the war in Afghanistan did not end there. Insurgency followed, and two decades later, in 2021, the United States acknowledged defeat. But the lessons of Afghanistan had not sunk in with everyone, however recent and traumatic they were for many U.S. soldiers. One retired U.S. Army major wrote that if Russia took Kyiv in short order, “At that point you’ve lost the war. Yes, you may start the greatest insurgency in history. But you’ve [presumably meaning the Russians] won the war.” That is an extraordinary statement. This is not just a point about the inherent strength of an insurgency; it is also a point about the presumed sequence of events in Ukraine. It would begin with a high-tempo operation, as in Afghanistan in 2001–2 and in Iraq in 2003, and then would be followed by an insurgency. There was no allowance for the possibility that Ukraine would plan on incorporating some aspects of insurgent warfare from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement of the retired major was not only revealing for what it assumed about sequencing; it also assumed that the conventional operations of major war and the guerrilla operations of an insurgency were opposites and thus to be seen as alternatives. It ignored the fact that in both the world wars of the twentieth century, as well as in the Napoleonic Wars of the nineteenth century, guerrilla operations and partisan warfare had coexisted with “major war.” The standard narratives of all three of Europe’s major wars since the French Revolution, by focusing on conventional operations, omitted or marginalized the contributions and roles of insurgencies on multiple fronts. Nor was this neglect necessarily caused by the perception that insurgencies were somehow lesser forms of war, as the term “low-intensity operations” suggested. Frequently, they were not. Popular resistance to enemy occupation elicited brutal responses and indiscriminate violence. There was plenty of firepower-intensive, face-to-face combat in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2014. The division between the two forms of war is an illusion: over the course of a conflict, especially if it is protracted, war changes its shape and can do so many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2014 and 2022, Ukraine had prepared the capabilities for a war of national resistance, and it mobilized them on February 24, 2022. The territorial defense units formed in small groups and the non-attributable sabotage teams operating on Russian lines of communication had the potential to enable an insurgency at the same time that Ukraine also fought major conventional operations. It is worth remembering that in 1941–44, Ukraine was a theater of war characterized both by major conventional operations — using armor, artillery, and airpower — and by partisan warfare, sustained and directed from Moscow. The Soviets claimed that 200,000 partisans were organized into 2,145 groups, and at their peak they tied down 424,000 Germans. These figures may be exaggerated, but the SS and the Wehrmacht were provoked into counterinsurgency operations of extraordinary ferocity. The early Cold War texts on the subject stressed how the Soviet Union placed partisan warfare at the center of its thinking about war. Today, Russia, unlike the United States, makes no distinction between major wars and counterinsurgency. War, whether it is waged in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Syria, or Ukraine, is about the use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth was the way in which the issues of terrain and weather and their effects on the conduct of operations were examined.&lt;/strong&gt; The Military Balance mentality, which looks at capabilities, can tend to neglect geography — broad, deep rivers; boggy ground and swamps; forests; and mountains. These are the principal concerns of field commanders and key elements in the conduct of land operations. In analyzing Ukraine’s case, commentators saw its size and strategic depth as a source of weakness for Kyiv. In the words of two analysts, “Ukraine is vast, which makes it impractical for the country’s inferior force to mount an effective defence against an invasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia in 1812 and the Soviet Union in 1941, strategic depth proved to be not a liability but a major defensive asset. In focusing on the problems for Ukraine of its force-to-space ratio, analysts failed to consider the much greater challenges that Russia would face on the same grounds. An army of 175,000 men was simply insufficient for a front of roughly 1,000 kilometers and a depth that was far greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two world wars, the Pripet (or Pripyat or Pinsk) marshes were studiously avoided by the armies of both sides as unsuitable for the conduct of major war. Straddling the border of Belarus and Ukraine, they create a natural obstacle north of Kyiv, which in itself makes the city’s encirclement a daunting task. Some argued that, by attacking in the winter, Russia would be able to maneuver because the ground would be frozen. By late February 2022, however, it was not. Much of the landscape around Kyiv — thick forests in standing water — was unsuitable for mechanized warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propositions around terrain took another twist. Pundits said that, if Ukraine had to wage guerrilla warfare, it would do so in the cities, and, if it did that, Russia would find its forces sucked into dense urban spaces. They counseled Ukraine against exercising this option: it would endanger the civilian population and cause major damage to the nation’s infrastructure. But if Russian columns could not maneuver across open ground because it was too waterlogged and so were instead forced onto the roads, the towns and cities where these lines of communication converged could be fortified as hubs of resistance. Mariupol was the obvious example in 2022: the Stalingrad of the Russo-Ukrainian war. The fighting here, however, was less urban insurgency and more conventional defense — a fight which, once again, made the distinction between the two much more fluid than the prevailing wisdom suggested was likely. In both world wars, attacking armies avoided cities with good reason: generals lose tactical control of their troops and operational designs are hijacked by house-to-house fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seventh, there is a further point about the importance of territory, which the preinvasion analysis, and much that has been written since, has failed to address.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has encouraged Ukraine and its de facto NATO allies to identify this war, as it encouraged Europe to see both world wars, as a war for the defense of democracy and freedom. The “Western allies” clothe war in the vocabulary of the United States’ “manifest destiny.” Ukraine has colluded in that, not least to ensure its leverage with NATO members, and specifically with Congress in Washington and with the American people as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is an underlying truth in this characterization of the war, but the United States’ physical distance from Europe also minimizes the fact that for Russia, as Putin has himself described it, the war in Ukraine is designed to recover a lost empire, while for Ukraine it is a war to reestablish its 1991 frontiers. In other words, the control of territory is as much at the heart of this conflict as is the difference between an autocracy and a liberal and democratic government. In that context, possession is nine-tenths of the law. Ukraine has to fight to regain the land it has lost in order to be in a strong negotiating position when the war ends. Russia only has to hold what it has to have won something. That is why maneuvering, especially withdrawal, is so risky, and why counterattacking to regain what has been lost is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrality of territory — with small gains counting as significant victories for Ukraine — feeds a narrative that plays badly in the United States. It smacks of attrition. The need for Ukraine to hold what it has elevates trench warfare. U.S. observers doubted that Ukraine could sustain the operational level of warfare. They saw its army as locked in by tactics and battles characterized by exhaustion and heavy casualties. Hence, the surprise created in September 2022 by the thrust on Kherson and then the switch to the counteroffensive at Kharkiv. Ukraine was not meant to be able to maneuver. The doubters argued that the success was due to Russia’s relative lack of numbers in the Kharkiv sector. A very similar set of arguments was run in August–September 2024 when the Ukrainian forces advanced into Russian territory to create the “Kursk pocket.” The Ukrainian military had used the best of its brigades against the weakest of Russia’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That emphasis on territorial control and trench warfare became a recurring part of the narrative as summer turned to autumn in 2022. It evoked frequent, but largely unhelpful, comparisons with World War I, not just from the international press but also from many of those fighting at the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World War I analogy played badly in the United States for three reasons. First, the United States, even more than the United Kingdom, sees World War I as a wasteful war, a conflict into which it was lured by a combination of British propaganda and Wilsonian rhetoric. It ended with a peace settlement that unraveled by the 1930s. By contrast, World War II is the “good” war, even if that narrative rests on retrospective myth-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, attrition became a taboo word after the war in Vietnam, with maneuver being elevated, especially in the U.S. Army’s Field Manual 100-5: Operations (1982), as the virtuous form of war, both more decisive in its effects and less costly in lives. That debate, which presented attrition and maneuver as opposites, rested on a false premise. At the tactical level, fire and movement are not competing alternatives but complementary and mutually dependent forms of fighting. Troops use fire to create the opportunity to move and to improve their position for firing. Moreover, the supposed antithesis between fire and movement, or between attrition and maneuver, is totally redundant in the air, where platforms do both. So, too, do most of today’s land platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the fighting of 2022–23 was characterized as attritional: Mariupol became Ukraine’s Stalingrad and Bakhmut its Verdun. Attritional battles make sense where terrain matters and where — as a result — the enemy is prepared to commit its forces to patterns of fighting that exhaust them. Bakhmut became symbolic for Ukraine because of the losses it suffered in its defense, just as Verdun did for France in 1916: “Ils ne passeront pas” [They shall not pass], in the words of the French posters that year. But Bakhmut also had significance for Russia’s capacity to maneuver: it sits athwart the junction of several roads running westward. The defense of Stalingrad similarly fulfilled two strategic functions in 1942–43. It was a rallying call for Soviet morale, which, in annihilating Friedrich Paulus’s 6th Army, inflicted the most obvious direct losses on Germany’s order of battle so far in World War II. The siege also blocked Germany’s access to the southeast and the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition is, therefore, a means to an end, at the strategic level to exhaust the enemy and at the tactical to enable maneuver. Too many popular interpretations of World War I, not least those peddled in the United States, fail to observe that that major war ended with the successive surrenders of four powers and allied victory, even if the peace was lost. By the same token, the equivalent narratives of World War II, because victory was more successfully translated into a lasting peace, overlook the importance of attrition on the eastern front in 1941–45, in northwestern Europe in 1944–45, and at sea and in the air throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eighth and last set of assumptions about the expectations put in place in advance of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, concern the United States’ appetite for mirror-imaging its adversaries and their approach to war.&lt;/strong&gt; In the eyes of both the United States and NATO, Ukraine, it is important to remember, was a potential ally, not an enemy. Then U.S. president George W. Bush raised the possibility of Ukraine’s membership in NATO after Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008. The enemy was Russia. For that reason, the United States thereafter focused on Russia’s military modernization: its move beyond the “little green men” of 2013–14, its development of advanced technologies, its restructuring of combined-arms armies, and its growing presence beyond its borders — in Belarus and Syria, as well as in Crimea and the Donbas. U.S. military intelligence and U.S. military analysis were focused here and not on Ukraine. It is worth remembering, too, that the United Kingdom’s 2021 strategic defense review, “Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy,” named Russia as its principal adversary. Moreover, so focused was NATO on Russia that its attention, and with it the United States’, was concentrated on those members of the alliance that looked most vulnerable to Russia — the Baltic states and Poland. In 2016, a RAND study on reinforcing deterrence on Russia’s eastern flank war-gamed the defense of the Baltic states, not of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That attention to Russian capabilities focused on two that the United States expected to have an even greater salience in any expansion of the war in Ukraine than they have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was cyber warfare. Before the invasion of February 24, 2022, much of the Western narrative was disproportionately focused here, as though the war might be so restricted to cyberspace that it would replace more traditional and destructive forms of war. It was anticipated that, at the bare minimum, Russia would precede any invasion with a cyberattack. It did, but Ukraine’s cyber defenses proved equal to the task. It provided clear evidence of Russia’s intent, but it came so late, in the early hours of February 24, that it neither acted as an early warning of Russia’s intentions nor formed a dominant image of the invasion itself. More important, however, is that although cyber has been immensely important to both sides since February 2022, it has been as an enabler, not as a weapon of destruction in its own right. Traditional forms of combat have had as high a salience as activity in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second capability was “shock and awe,” the U.S. phrase coined to cover the establishment of rapid dominance over the enemy, especially through air power in the opening stages of a campaign. One of the reasons for the elevation of Russia’s military effectiveness was its massive superiority over Ukraine in the air, particularly in manned aircraft: 1,857 combat aircraft to 160. Because it would be unthinkable for a NATO land force to deploy without significant air assets, Ukraine’s weakness in this respect promised to become a besetting sin. The prewar commentary emphasized how Russia would — alongside a cyberattack — embark simultaneously on a “shock and awe” campaign directed at Ukrainian cities. An early air offensive would force Ukraine to choose whether to prioritize its ground forces in the field or its civilian air defenses to protect its population. This is not the place, nor would it be right, to play down the impact of Russian aircraft and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians in 2022. Nonetheless, the point remains that the consequences of Ukraine’s inferiority in the air proved far less significant than first feared. The surprising conclusion from the opening year of the war proved to be the reverse of what was anticipated: Ukraine’s aerial defenses, especially over its major cities, were strikingly successful, and the numbers of civilian deaths lower than forecast. It is important to remember that the title “shock and awe” reflected not Russian doctrine but U.S. doctrine. Its use referred not to what might have happened in Ukraine in 2022, so much as what did happen in Iraq in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shock and awe” especially showed how the United States was using mirror images of its adversary to guide its expectations and doing so in preference to sustained analysis of how to avoid or defend against air threats. Moreover, there was a further problem when the United States looked in the mirror. It confused its image of Russia with its image of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. commentators regularly cited two injunctions from their reading of Clausewitz’s On War. The first was Clausewitz’s reminder that the principal task of a state embarking on a war is to recognize the sort of war on which it is embarking and not to mistake it for something else. The second, and the one so often quoted that it is frequently identified simply by the adjective “Clausewitzian,” is that war is a continuation of policy by other means. It implies that war has utility as an instrument of state power. In the debate surrounding the post–9/11 wars, both aphorisms became accusations. The United States’ use of war over the first two decades of the twenty-first century proved an inadequate deliverer of effective outcomes. Neither in Afghanistan nor in Iraq did operations match their objectives. U.S. statesmen overpromised and underdelivered in both countries — and in Afghanistan catastrophically so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, Putin’s record in the same period seemed to be the exact opposite. One analyst described Putin as brilliant in his use of war in the pursuit of policy. Putin had come to power on the back of success in the Second Chechen War, so reversing the result of the First Chechen War; he took “southern Ossetia” from Georgia within days in 2008; he intervened in Syria in 2014–15 and shored up Bashar al-Assad’s stumbling regime; and in 2013–14, he took Crimea and a large chunk of eastern Ukraine. In this last instance, NATO was deterred from trying to stop him. Putin’s calculations seemed to be spot on and, therefore, war delivered on its political objectives. Putin’s record in the use of war was more obviously successful than that of any U.S. president since George H. W. Bush in the First Gulf War of 1990–91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, another analyst, who served as an adviser to U.S. governments in the post–9/11 wars, spoke of Putin’s “undeniable genius.” Commentators constructed the successes against Ukraine in 2014 as the work of this genius, embodied in the use of “little green men” in “hybrid warfare” to achieve objectives in ways that made Russia’s role deniable. One analyst called this “liminal warfare.” One U.S. general, then the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described it as “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of U.S. failure and Russia’s success in the use of force were threefold. First, NATO credited Russia with developing a new form of warfare — “hybrid war” or, in later versions, “gray-zone warfare.” Having created this fantasy, NATO turned it against itself and proceeded to doubt its own internal resilience when confronted by Russia. Second, NATO then emphasized Russia’s readiness to use force and politicized it to make the case for improving its own conventional defense. The Russian army, which had been discounted as corrupt and inefficient, was seen as having turned a corner, rooting out its problems and embracing reform and modernization. Although real enough, the evidence to support this interpretation was elevated for reasons that had more to do with the domestic politics of NATO member states. Third, the enhanced conventional capability delivered by Russia’s military reforms was reinforced by its apparent readiness to use tactical nuclear weapons, which in turn gave Putin escalation dominance before he invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The more nuanced findings of academic scholars working on the Russian military made little impact on these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Putin was unlikely to escalate the war in Ukraine to the nuclear level precisely because that could have provoked NATO to intervene. Russia would have lacked the strength to match NATO in a conventional conflict if that happened. The possibility of “vertical escalation” was further reduced by China’s warning to Russia that it would not tolerate the use of nuclear weapons, an approach fully consonant with China’s own policy of no first use. Nonetheless, Putin’s readiness to use force, reinforced by recurrent rhetoric to that effect, so grips Western imaginations — particularly in the upper reaches of the United States government — that the United States has been self-deterred. Consequently, despite being the weaker power, Russia has appeared to enjoy escalation dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War lies in the realm of contingency and uncertainty. Its course fluctuates, and its outcomes are unpredictable. For this reason, among others, the notion of “applied history” can be a false friend when it is used to analyze war and strategy. Some will say, with justification, that some of the predictions made before February 2022 began to look more sure-footed in 2024 as the war progressed through its third year. That may be true, but it still does not indicate how the war will end. At what proved to be the midpoints of the two world wars, in 1916 and 1941, the eventual victors were on the ropes as plans miscarried and losses mounted. What matters to this analysis is that critical early failings based on false assumptions can tend to have longer-term consequences than missteps later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to avoid the descent into war or to act preemptively could have forestalled war or ended it with the rapidity that gave rise to the short-war expectation in the first place. The result of flawed assessments before February 2022 wrong-footed the United States and its NATO allies and has left them struggling to catch up. The claim that they have been behind the curve of events in their support of Ukraine has persisted. Moreover, if the signals had been better read in advance, going back not just to late 2021 but instead to 2013, Ukraine’s supporters might have read them better, enabling an earlier resolution to the war or — even better — deterring the invasion in the first place. Applied history may not work, but that is not a reason for failing to consider the reasons for failure and for not endeavoring to do better next time by learning from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise occurs in many forms. Many think of it in terms of a surprise attack, but it occurs in other dimensions. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is a good example: the attack was foreseen, but the immediate outcomes were astonishing. To use an old Soviet phrase, analysts misunderstood in fundamental ways the “correlation of forces.” Their judgments about Russian and Ukrainian military capacity were not merely off — they were wildly at variance with reality. And even more perplexing, leading and widely acknowledged experts misjudged with a degree of certainty that in retrospect is no less remarkable than the analytic failure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their misjudgment was not a case of normal error or exaggeration. The expert community grossly overestimated Russian military capabilities, dismissed the chances of Ukraine resisting effectively, and presented the likely outcome of the war as quick and decisive. This analytic failure also had policy implications. Pessimism about Ukraine’s chances restricted military support before February 24, 2022. For years, voices in the analytic community argued publicly against providing crucial military aid for Ukraine precisely because Russia was presumably so strong that a war between the two countries, particularly a conventional one, would be over too quickly for the aid to make a significant difference. Once the war began, some of Ukraine’s most important international friends hesitated to supply advanced weapons, in part out of the mistaken belief that Ukraine would prove unable to use them or would be overrun before it could deploy them effectively. Today, such hesitation remains, with Ukraine still lacking the weapons systems it needs to defeat Russia in its relentless effort to destroy Ukraine as a state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitiveness with which the experts made these erroneous assessments has not been sufficiently examined. Instead, analysts have resorted to a number of inadequate explanations or justifications for them. More to the point: the authors believe that consideration of these failures holds important lessons for other analytic communities, including those concerned with the military balance in the Indo-Pacific and other areas where the prospects of armed conflict are rising. Errors of comparable magnitude at the outset of a crisis leading to war can have profound and lingering effects. While some misjudgments are inevitable, ones that are wildly off are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their general reading, the authors created a database of 181 pieces of research and analysis, mostly think tank reports and pieces released in major media outlets (see Appendix A), focusing on statements published in major journals, publications, and news networks, as well as commentary by acknowledged experts in the field. The investigation deals only with unclassified analyses of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries and the prospective war, though it appears, given the congressional testimony of senior U.S. intelligence leaders, that the intelligence communities in the United States and other countries made comparable errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors broke these sources down based on the sources’ views on the Russian military, the Ukrainian military, and how they believed a full-scale war between them would develop. What the authors found was a remarkable degree of consensus, which is reflected through the use of sources in this report. To show the impact of this analysis, the authors will quote regularly from major journals, prominent think tank reports, and popular media outlets such as prominent newspapers. While there were outliers (noted in the text), what was striking to the authors was the degree of unanimity in the core expert community, i.e., among those identifying themselves, and identified by others, as experts on the Russian military. There were diverging views, but often from sources outside this community — retired military officers who had participated in the training of the Ukrainian military after 2014, for example. The authors noted, finally, that judging by press reports, this consensus view was shared by the intelligence community in the United States. To discuss the findings of this investigation and the possible interpretations of the evidence, the authors convened three workshops. Attendees included senior intelligence analysts from the United States and the United Kingdom, military historians, former government officials, and experts from the United Kingdom and a number of Scandinavian and Baltic countries. While these discussions enriched the work considerably, responsibility for all arguments and conclusions rests with the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may doubt whether one should review in detail errors made two years ago and in a few (though not all) cases rectified within months. The authors disagree. Thorough consideration of why responsible and expert analysts made egregious misjudgments is the best way to avoid a similar outcome in this part of the world or elsewhere. What follows is the documentation and explanation of a large, consequential failure. The potential measures suggested at the end of report, including an uncompromising argument for curiosity, sensitivity to intangibles, and, above all, humility in the face of the uncertainties of war — have real and important implications for analysis in other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-estimate&quot;&gt;The Estimate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ukraine’s paucity of air defences and the weakness of its armed forces means that Russia could drive to Kyiv perhaps as easily as American forces reached Baghdad in the Iraq war of 2003.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia has the ability to carry out a large-scale joint offensive operation involving tens of thousands of personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and hundreds of combat aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air and missile strikes from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into Ukraine to attack headquarters, airfields, and logistics points. Ukrainian forces would begin the conflict nearly surrounded from the very start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Russian military has repeatedly practiced the use of long-range strike and tactical fires cued by drones as well as other means of reconnaissance, both in training and in combat operations in Syria. Russia’s combat aircraft and strategic air defenses give Moscow many more options to control the air and to strike Ukrainian forces, and most Russian pilots have recent real-world experience in Syria.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If Russia decides to seize Ukraine, its attack will be multifaceted. Cyber attacks and sabotage will target economic and communications infrastructure. Agents provocateurs will begin causing chaos in the streets. Organised protests will erupt around the country. Ukrainian civic leaders deemed hostile to Russia will be assassinated. Internet access will likely be suppressed or corrupted, while false information will flood across the airwaves to spread panic and paralysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the same time, Russia has the capacity to conduct an extensive precision strike campaign against Ukrainian military installations using ballistic and cruise missiles and overwhelming airpower. This could suppress Ukrainian air defences, allowing for aviation assaults to seize key bridges, road junctions and critical infrastructure. The capture of these points would pave the way for rapid armoured thrusts with the use of massive artillery strikes to break up defensive strongpoints, and the isolation of key urban centres.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia’s military is far superior. Defense analysts say this gives Russia a range of options if it decides to escalate further, such as bolstering separatists fighting in the Donbas to a full-fledged assault aimed at seizing all of Ukraine. . . . Many defense experts note that Russia has undertaken a remarkable modernization effort since its war with Georgia in 2008, one that has transformed its Soviet-era force into an increasingly well-equipped and well-organized military. Additionally, its members have gained considerable combat experience in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. . . . The great financial resources required to sustain Russia’s recent mobilization around Ukraine is illustrative of the wide disparity between the two countries’ military capabilities.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A Russian military campaign could range from standoff strikes to a largescale invasion of Ukraine’s eastern regions, the encirclement of Kyiv, and the taking of Odessa along the coast. The question is not what Russia can do militarily in Ukraine, since the answer is almost anything, but what kind of operation might attain lasting political gains.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of leading analysts before the Russian invasion on February 22, 2024, the Russian military was so powerful and multicapable that, when presented with an enemy such as Ukraine, it could do “almost anything.” A consensus coalesced around an extreme vision of what Russia could accomplish militarily and a correspondingly pessimistic view of Ukraine’s ability to resist. Analysts widely stated that Russia could open with a devastating blow in the first few hours, Kyiv could be surrounded or seized in a matter of days, and Ukraine could be defeated conventionally in a matter of weeks. Ukrainian citizens were portrayed as having little capacity to affect their fate, being left to choose between capitulation and guerrilla warfare in the cities or countryside. Compounding the discrepancy in military power, Ukrainian identity was so weak, analysts contended, and so enmeshed with Russia that Ukrainian resistance — particularly in the east of the country — would be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was entirely different. From the outset, the Russian military exhibited major shortcomings. The inability of the Russian air force, for instance, to suppress Ukrainian air defenses and control the skies over the battlefield meant that Ukrainian forces, far from being devastated in the opening moments of the war, could maneuver and fight back effectively. Moreover, shortcomings in command and control and logistics meant that Russian forces had difficulty sustaining their advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian conventional resistance, which many had written off before the war, proved robust. The Ukrainian army, far from being swept off the battlefield, fought back effectively with quicker reactions and adaptations than its Russian enemy. Using mostly upgraded Soviet legacy systems, the Ukrainian army forced the Russian forces to retreat from Kyiv after a few weeks of fighting. In the ensuing months, Ukrainian forces compelled Russian forces to retreat from much of the eastern sector (particularly around the endangered city of Kharkiv) and retook the city of Kherson. Ukraine struck the Black Sea Fleet, opening up a vital sea-lane for its exports while denying Russia’s navy the offensive use of the maritime space. Further, Ukrainian forces have struck deep into Russia, though not on the scale of Russia’s continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Since the summer of 2022, Ukraine has liberated far more of its territory than Russia has been able to seize in the opening months of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have found little disagreement within the analytic community, most of which resides at semiofficial or official research organizations such as the RAND Corporation, the Center for Naval Analyses, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and similar organizations. The number of analysts who publicly assessed the Russia-Ukraine military balance before the war and in its early stages and created the most detailed reports on the question was relatively small. Between 10 and 20 analysts dominated the community as the most widely cited and most prominent, receiving regular requests to brief governments and intelligence agencies. The consensus was broad and mutually affirming among this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that these assessments seem to have been largely shared within the U.S. government. Thus, a remarkable exchange between Senator Angus King and the then-director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, occurred in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 12, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: I think the Intelligence Community did a great job on this issue, Senator . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: General, how can you possibly say when we were told, explicitly, Kyiv would fall in 3 days and 2 Ukraine would fall in 2 weeks? You are telling me that was accurate intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: So we were really focused on the Russian forces at the time, and so when we backed . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: And we were wrong about that too, were we not? We overestimated the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: Well, the Intelligence Community did a great job in predicting and talking . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: And I acknowledged that at the beginning of my question. I understand that. Yes, they did. What they failed at was predicting what was going to happen after Russia invaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: So as I look at the totality of the entire operation I think the enormity rests on the predictions of what the Russians were going to do versus whether or not the Ukrainians were going to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: Well, if you do not concede there was a problem on this then we have got a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And such assessments were believed at the top of the United States government and military. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was reported only two weeks before the invasion as saying that Kyiv could fall in 72 hours and having reported as much to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessments-of-the-russian-military&quot;&gt;Assessments of the Russian Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The modernized and massive Russian military force that currently surrounds Ukraine on three sides can muster air and missile strikes that would likely overwhelm Ukrainian airpower and air defenses and severely damage military and other facilities. In particular, Russia’s Aerospace Forces, or VKS, are very different from a decade ago. They have new and modernized aircraft, along with better radar, communications, and targeting equipment. Pilots have generally flown more flight hours and received training in close air support and nighttime operations. And although they have little experience flying through hostile air defenses, 92 percent of VKS pilots have recent combat experience in Syria. The VKS also has adopted . . . more-effective countermeasures against man-portable or short-range air defenses such as Stinger missiles, including flying at higher altitudes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russian forces are not just better armed, but also more fleet-footed. Thanks to improvements in readiness, Russia could probably get 100,000 troops, complete with heavy armour, to a European hotspot within 30 days. NATO might struggle to muster half the number, of lighter forces, in that time. . . . Russia’s armed forces enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They [the Russian military] could disorient the Ukrainian military and society so the conflict is basically over in a day or so.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prewar assessments of the Russian military focused on three key elements: organizational and technological modernization, sophisticated doctrine, and combat experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-modernized-combat-tested-military&quot;&gt;A Modernized, Combat-Tested Military&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts trace the modernization of the Russian military to 2008 and the “New Look” Russian military process. The key figure in this process was Russian minister of defense Anatoly Serdyukov, who served in that role from 2007 to 2012. Motivated by the poor performance of the Russian military in the invasion of Georgia, Moscow attempted to create the New Look military by expending large sums of money — an annual expenditure of somewhere between $150 and $180 billion, approximately 4 percent of Russian gross domestic product (GDP). The investment reportedly influenced all military domains, “from top to bottom,” covering air, sea, and land forces. In 2022, the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported that the reforms had “made Russia a far more capable military power today than at any time since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernization took a number of forms. Older Soviet-era aircraft such as the Su-27 (Flanker) and the MiG-29 (Fulcrum) were phased out. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, these earlier aircraft were the mainstays of the Ukrainian air force but had since passed into obsolescence for the Russian military. In their place, Russia fielded a range of far more capable aircraft, including the two-seater Su-34 fighter/bomber and single-seater Su-35 fighter. The Su-34 was appraised to have performed very well in the bombing of Syria. These aircraft had capabilities that allowed them to engage enemy aircraft at much greater range than anything the Ukrainian military possessed; they were even considered extremely threatening to the air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond aircraft, the Russian precision strike was said to have been significantly improved by the New Look reforms. The Russian navy deployed a large stock of sea-launched Kalibr missiles (used in Syria) while upgrading a number of ship and submarine classes. Reports stated that Russia was deploying hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, which would give the military great flexibility in targeting enemy assets, from government buildings to critical infrastructure to important military targets. At the time, reports claimed that there was no defense against this last system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ground, much of the stress was on organizational changes. Analysts saw Russian land forces as having improved the quality of their soldiers by moving away from a majority conscript force toward more motivated and better-trained contract soldiers. At the same time, the Russian military reorganized their armed forces into innovative and highly effective battalion tactical groups (BTGs). These small infantry battalions, or fractions of them, were reinforced with armor, artillery, and other systems. Russian artillery and rocket capabilities, a traditional strength, reportedly surpassed U.S. capabilities in terms of range and effectiveness. Many experts assessed modernized Russian land forces as capable of quickly overwhelming NATO resistance in key areas along the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, RAND undertook a series of tabletop exercises to better understand the prospects for a Russian conventional attack in the Baltics. Based on open-source estimates, Russia could muster approximately 27 maneuver battalion tactical groups to attack the Baltic countries in a short-warning attack, supported by significant long-range fires. Assuming a week of warning, NATO could deploy 12 maneuver battalions. NATO forces, however, would be light, outgunned, and outmaneuvered by Russian heavier units, and fixed in place or destroyed while Russian forces maneuvered toward the capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts assessed that, in addition to the modernization of key items of equipment and improved organization and terms of service, Russia had restored its Cold War edge in electronic warfare (EW). As part of Russia’s military modernization after its poor 2008 performance in Georgia, the Russian government heavily invested in improvements in this area. EW — described as the fight to control the “invisible” parts of warfare “by exploiting, deceiving, or denying enemy use of the [electromagnetic] spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces” — includes such activities as jamming communications, radar, and Global Positioning System signals, as well as various spoofing and deception activities in the electromagnetic spectrum. Analysts saw Russia as having steadily improved its capabilities in EW throughout the 2010s, while the United States and its NATO partners had let their EW capabilities “atrophy.” By 2022, these Russian improvements in EW had been so successful that they would likely have “an outsized negative impact on Russia’s adversaries.” Indeed, in testimony to the House of Commons just before the full-scale Russian invasion, one analyst claimed that Russia “might be the most capable military in the world in terms of electronic warfare capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond declaring the Russian military modernized and well equipped with some of the most advanced weapons in the world, analysts believed that the Russian military was doctrinally sophisticated. In particular, analysts stated that Russian doctrine — its concepts of operation — had evolved such that the Russian military need not rely on large forces of soldiers suffering significant losses to achieve their objectives. Doctrine, like artillery (and unlike, for example, proficiency in infantry tactics or small-unit leadership), has long been a Russian strength, building on sophisticated Soviet and even Tsarist military thought. During the later stages of the Cold War, Western analysts were particularly impressed by the quality of Soviet military literature, while military historians such as David Glantz painted a picture of the Soviet Union’s World War II performance as being at odds with the image of overwhelming but unsophisticated mass that had brought victory on the Eastern Front. Instead, analysts believed that Soviet operational art, derived from the work of pioneers such as Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Triandafillov, animated the Soviet Union’s plans for deep operations — as well as, presumably, their ability to conduct them. Even as the Soviet Union weakened, Russian military leaders such as Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Ogarkov and General Makhmut Gareev had the respect of Western observers impressed by their portrayal of a revolution in military-technical affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, despite Russia’s evident weaknesses, Western observers portrayed Russia as leading the way in hybrid warfare — the use of nontraditional means to achieve political goals with low levels of force. This doctrinal specialty in hybrid warfare, which could be used with or without more traditional, conventional means of war fighting, was often referred to as the Gerasimov doctrine, after General Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s general staff and respected in the West as an original military thinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to conventional warfare, analysts saw Russian doctrine as espousing “active defense,” an intelligent and multifaceted way of coping with a potentially larger and more technologically advanced enemy, such as NATO. Such a doctrine stressed avoiding dangerous offensives to preserve forces and prevent the extremely costly, if successful, attacks that characterized Soviet operations in World War II. Overall, analysts characterized Russian doctrine as looking for “smarter” ways to engage an opponent, with stress on long-range fires and artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts interpreted Russia’s successful execution of large-scale military maneuvers as a sign of its military progress. The Zapad exercises of 2017 and 2021, particularly the latter, supposedly demonstrated that Russia could quickly and efficiently deploy military forces over a large area. Even though few scripted impediments were in the way of Russian actions, analysts claimed that the ability to undertake these choreographed showpieces revealed very real capabilities. As one analyst claimed, Zapad 2021 “is not just military theater, it affirms that years of defense modernization and reform have made the Russian military a force with increased capability, readiness, and mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to Russian strengths in equipment, organization, doctrine, and training, analysts noted that the Russian military, crucially, had proved itself in battle. This was particularly notable in Syria, where the Russian intervention began in 2015. Before this, the Russian armed forces exhibited serious deficiencies in the invasions of Chechnya and Georgia, and their command and control capabilities, particularly the ability to coordinate land and air forces, were seriously deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the Russian intervention in Syria as showing how much progress the Russian military had made and how prepared it was becoming to execute complex operations. According to the New York Times, quoting a number of the best-known analysts, “Russia used the war in Syria, experts say, as a laboratory to refine tactics and weaponry, and to gain combat experience for much of its force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While analysts noted how Russia’s experiences in Syria helped improve its EW and force deployment abilities, they claimed that the Russian air force had improved the most during the fighting in Syria, with both technological and operational improvements. The Russian military not only introduced a number of their newest aircraft into operations, but they also refined their tactics. In Syria, Russia flew a large number of missions, in particular attacking ground targets, many of them, admittedly, civilian. Flying approximately 9,000 sorties overall, at an average of 70–80 per day, the Russian air force learned a great deal about operating in combat conditions. By the end of the Syrian conflict, analysts considered the Russian air force greatly improved and highly effective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The five years of war in Syria have been the most intense period of transformation for the [Russian air force] since the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The Russian military not only gained an unprecedented amount of experience, but also made substantial improvements in tactics and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-analysts-overlooked&quot;&gt;What Analysts Overlooked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of the Russian military generally avoided addressing some of the more intangible elements of military effectiveness. One of the most extreme examples was the almost total avoidance of commentary on the possible negative impact of systemic corruption, widespread in the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin, on the performance of the Russian military. Although the upper echelon of the Russian military had clearly capitalized on access to the large amounts of money available for the new military, the analytic literature about the Russian military in the run-up to February 24, 2022, almost entirely avoided the word “corruption,” let alone assessing its likely implications for Russian military performance. Rather, “corruption” was far more commonly used with reference to weaknesses in the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analysts mentioned corruption, it was almost always to say that the Russian military had been prone to corruption in the past but that this problem had been heavily attacked during the Serdyukov reforms. For instance, one of the most laudatory pieces written about Russian military modernization, published in The Economist, stated that the Russian military had improved so much by 2020 because corruption had been significantly reduced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia’s once-mighty armed forces were laid low. Moscow bus drivers outearned fighter pilots. Hungry soldiers were sent to forage for berries and mushrooms. Corruption was rife — one general was charged with renting out a mig-29 for illicit drag racing between cars and jets on a German airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No army in the world is in as wretched a state as ours,” lamented a defence minister in 1994. Yet few armies have bounced back as dramatically. In 2008 Russian forces bungled a war with Georgia. In response, they were transformed from top to bottom. . . . Though the days of renting out warplanes may be over, last year Russian military prosecutors announced that 2,800 military officials had been charged with corruption. The amount stolen totalled around $90m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of the few reports that mentioned Russian corruption as a possible negative factor was also one of the few to cast strong doubts on Russia’s ability to succeed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts generally ignored the Russian logistical system, which in many ways failed during the full-scale invasion. A short War on the Rocks piece was one of the few analyses devoted solely to the subject. Larger studies, such as those on Russian modernization, usually asserted that Russia had the logistic lift needed to fulfill its strategic obligations without much evidence to back up that assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the few mentions of corruption and logistics in the functioning of the Russian military, the role of training and motivation in assessing Russian military performance was discussed more often (though considerably less often than issues such as technological modernization). However, the discussion of Russian recruitment, military training, and motivation usually focused on their presumed contribution to Russian military effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, analysts widely assumed that because Russia had moved away from reliance on conscripts, soldiers would have the high morale and motivation to do their jobs effectively. Analysts also stated that Russian soldiers would be well led and trained and able to efficiently execute complex operations. In fact, analysts declared this one of the main areas in which Russia’s military reform had made a massive difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[In the past] senior officers sometimes lived in moldy, rat-infested tenements. And instead of socks, poorly trained soldiers often wrapped their feet in swaths of cloth, the way their Soviet and Tsarist predecessors had. Two decades later, it is a far different fighting force that has massed near the border with Ukraine. Under Mr. Putin’s leadership, it has been overhauled into a modern sophisticated army, able to deploy quickly and with lethal effect in conventional conflicts, military analysts said. It features precision-guided weaponry, a newly streamlined command structure and well-fed and professional soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, when analysts compared the Russian army to the Ukrainian army, they highlighted the Russian army’s significant advantages in experience, training, and leadership. The Russian army operated their new advanced equipment with high levels of “readiness” and their soldiers were being led by “officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria,” which would ostensibly give the Russian forces “quantitative and qualitative” superiority over the Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessment-of-the-ukrainian-military&quot;&gt;Assessment of the Ukrainian Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ukraine does not have anywhere near enough forces to credibly defend against all the potential avenues of attack, which means it would have to choose between defending a select set of fixed strong points — ceding control of other areas — or maneuvering to engage Russian forces that outnumber them. The line of conflict in the Donbas will be but one of many fronts. The Ukrainian fortifications there may well look like a modern-day Maginot Line: prepared for a frontal attack that may never come and bypassed by the mobile forces of an adversary with more-advanced aircraft and more-mobile land forces.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If it quickly found itself overwhelmed, Ukraine’s military could embrace guerrilla warfare, breaking itself into smaller tactical formations with maximum autonomy. That would entail abandoning most of its heavy armor and artillery and focusing instead on infantry armed with shoulder-fired missiles to hit tanks or aircraft. . . . Ukrainian air defenses are in short supply, and they would be unlikely to provide effective cover for most of the country’s ground troops. They would be quickly overwhelmed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The implication for a battle in Ukraine is that where Russian armored units wish to succeed, they will pour vast firepower on defending Ukrainian troops, and then try to overwhelm them with superior numbers. This is how the Soviets planned to fight NATO, and this is how the Russians would likely attack the Ukrainians. Javelins and Stingers can certainly make the Russians pay, because they are indeed great weapons, but they are unlikely to change the operational outcomes. Ukrainian units would no doubt fight bravely, but given the geography of the country, the open topography of much of its landscape, and the overall numerical superiority that Russia enjoys, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to defend itself successfully.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts portrayed the ability of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian society to defend itself very differently from Russia’s ability to invade and dominate Ukraine. In the first case, compared to the analyses of Russia, relatively little was written about Ukraine, and Ukrainian capabilities were not subjected to detailed analysis. As such, analyses of the Ukrainian military tended to stress its limitations and inability to defend the country, often focusing on the supposed differences in the capabilities of Russian and Ukrainian equipment and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second case, whereas there was almost no discussion of how Russian society and politics would diminish Russian military capabilities (and very little discussion of corruption or the degrading influence of Putin’s dictatorship), a great deal of discussion addressed Ukraine’s supposed weakness in these areas. Some analysts considered Ukrainian society lacking in unity, torn between a Russian-speaking east and a Ukrainian-identifying west. Moreover, analysts claimed that the Ukrainian state, with a recent history of disunity and corruption, was a real handicap to Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine could even be portrayed as a failing state, especially compared to the supposedly effective and strategic Russian one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, analysts had a much greater focus on Ukrainian weakness and Russian strength. Possible sources of Ukrainian strength — for example, its political transformation following the Revolution of Dignity (or Maidan Revolution) in 2014 — were rarely considered. Above all, the history of Ukraine’s tenacious resistance to Russia for more than a century received little attention, and evidence of Ukrainian tactical successes at the end of the most intense period of conflict in the Donbas failed to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analysis-of-the-ukrainian-military-and-ukrainian-society-and-politics&quot;&gt;Analysis of the Ukrainian Military and Ukrainian Society and Politics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important point is the lack of analyses of the Ukrainian military as a stand-alone institution. Major think tanks published fewer than five reports on a possible war with Russia from a Ukrainian perspective, and all were pessimistic about Ukraine’s chances to conventionally resist a full-scale Russian invasion. All were published only a few weeks or months before February 24, 2022. Therefore, analysts made seemingly little effort to look at the Ukrainian military from a long-term perspective or to consider its institutional evolution and development, particularly since the 2014 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More commonly, analysts compared the Ukrainian military only with the Russian military, usually as a much smaller addendum, and from that concluded that Ukraine was severely outmatched. The Ukrainian navy was barely worth mentioning, described as “insufficient” to deter Russia in any meaningful way. Analysts claimed that when it came to antiair capabilities, Ukraine was operating at a huge disadvantage, with its systems “woefully deficient in both quantity and quality.” The Russian military in any war would likely make Ukrainian “ground-based early warning radar stations” a “primary” target. Thus, Ukrainian fixed-wing aircraft would have to approach combat with its modernized Russian enemy at a massive disadvantage — flying almost blind. According to one analyst, “Put simply, the [Ukrainian Air Force] will be rapidly destroyed if it attempts to directly oppose [Russian] fixed wing sorties near the lines of contact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Ukrainian navy were inconsequential and the Ukrainian air force unable to contend with the Russian forces, analysts would at least consider the relatively large and combat-experienced Ukrainian army powerful enough to challenge the Russian army. Since 2014, the Ukrainian army has been continually engaged against Russian forces and their surrogate forces in Donetsk and Luhansk. In that time, the Ukrainian forces suffered thousands of deaths but also gained combat experience and, as time went on, improved their performance and capabilities. However, that seemed to matter little compared to the Russian forces they expected to fight. If the Ukrainian forces had improved, the Russian forces had trumped them with the New Look reforms and Russian military experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although reliable numbers are hard to come by, Ukraine’s ground forces might field 50 to 60 battalions against the more than 120 currently mustered by the Russian army, and these battalions do not have the same levels of combat effectiveness. Russia has far more — and far better — artillery, reconnaissance, and logistical capabilities than Ukraine does. The Russian military would have the advantage along every axis of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the Ukrainian forces claimed that they had improved as a fighting force and could meet the Russian forces in the open field, the analytic community disagreed with the assessment of the Ukrainian military. As one report published just before the full-scale invasion read: “Despite the imminent threat of invasion, the Ukrainian military projects an aura of calm confidence in its capabilities. Any assessment of Ukraine’s conventional forces makes this attitude difficult to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;corruption-and-identity&quot;&gt;Corruption and Identity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason analysts believed that the Ukrainian military could not put up effective conventional resistance to a full-scale Russian invasion was that they doubted Ukraine’s fundamental powers of resistance — both the trustworthiness of its system and the commitment of a large percentage of its population. Analysts often mentioned Ukraine as a weak and shaky political and national construct or “the closest thing Europe has to a failed state.” The single most common reason analysts considered Ukraine so systemically weak was that it was supposedly riddled by corruption. According to one RUSI report, Ukrainian corruption was a “legitimate concern” restraining financial aid for Ukraine. Moreover, Ukraine was caught in a catch-22, unable to “tackle corruption” because Russia was destabilizing it. This connection between Ukrainian corruption and the difficulty it would face resisting Russian aggression was also made in a RAND blog post claiming that, over time, “discouraging Russian imperial coercion may depend in large part on whether Ukraine overcomes poverty and stifling corruption and becomes a resilient democracy.” Analysts used the supposed damaging inability of even Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to do anything about corruption to describe his government as weak: “Zelensky’s administration also appears weak and increasingly desperate to find domestic support. He has not done much to reduce corruption or to separate Ukraine from its long tradition of oligarchic rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the issue of corruption were not enough, analysts often portrayed Ukrainians as lacking a strong national identity, certainly one that called into question whether a large part of the population would fight for its existence. Russia’s illegal seizure of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014 seemed to have exacerbated this view. The Council of Foreign Relations wrote in 2014 that the “country of forty-five million people has struggled with its identity since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine has failed to resolve its internal divisions and build strong political institutions, hampering its ability to implement economic reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts usually connected the idea that Ukrainians had a weak identity to the fact that a large percentage of the population had linguistic, cultural, and even strong economic ties to Russia. As a Congressional Research Service report released in late 2021 commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most Ukrainians can speak Russian, whether as a primary or secondary language. In Ukraine’s last national census (2001), 17% of the population identified as ethnic Russians, mostly concentrated in the south (Crimea) and east, where ties to Russia are stronger than in the rest of the country. In Soviet times, eastern Ukraine became home to a heavy industrial and defense production sector that retained close economic ties to Russia after independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts used this weakness in Ukrainian identity to cast doubt on whether Ukraine could muster an effective insurgency once it, as expected, lost a conventional war. One prominent analyst, in an article titled “Why a Ukrainian Insurgency against Russia Is Likely to Fail,” argued, “The Russian and Ukrainian cultures are rather similar, whether in terms of language, culture or history.” This similarity, he claimed, would allow Russian occupiers to appeal to conquered Ukrainians’ sense of “normalcy.” Another analyst, speaking in a Center for a New American Security podcast released on February 14, 2022, used similar language when asked about a possible Ukrainian insurgency: “So, it is hard to tell whether or not there is going to be a true uprising against a Russian invasion or people in certain parts of the country are going to say, ‘Well, I can deal with this for a while; it’s not a big change.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question of a weak or even pro-Russian Ukrainian identity opens up a reverse question about the constitution of the analytic community. It is practically impossible to find an analyst who identified as a Ukrainian specialist before the 2022 invasion. Most were analysts of the Russian military who had spent much of their time studying Russian policy and practice in its involvement in Ukraine. For this reason, few reports specifically addressed Ukraine, whereas analysts constantly published reports on Russian policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessments-of-the-russian-and-ukrainian-militaries-in-the-donbas&quot;&gt;Assessments of the Russian and Ukrainian Militaries in the Donbas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian and Ukrainian militaries were engaged in almost constant combat for years before February 24, 2022 — particularly in the Donbas, illegally seized by Russian forces starting in 2014. The analytic community discussed this war in the Donbas often in the context of the supposed overall improvement of Russian capabilities. This in itself is noteworthy because, as analyses also mentioned, fighting in the Donbas did not lead to major Russian advances and, in time, actually evidenced improvements in Ukrainian performance. However, such phenomena, which pointed to Russian shortcomings and Ukrainian improvements in the Donbas, did not lead to a recalibration in the overall analysis of what would happen if the Russian military launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the Russian successes in the Donbas occurred in 2014 and 2015 at the start of the fighting. Russian deployments to the Ukrainian border throughout 2014 reportedly had achieved substantial logistical successes, proving Russia’s ability to “maintain large formations in the field after rapid deployments and sustain them over extended periods with little obvious degradation in performance.” Furthermore, its operations in Ukraine (and Syria) allowed the Russian military to carry out a roulement of troops across its armed forces to the Ukrainian border, allowing its personnel to gain more practical experience than they would have obtained through exercises: “Ukraine, in particular, has provided Russia with valuable experience fighting a contemporary enemy of comparable capability, in combat involving heavy use of main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of the Russian armed forces in a combat scenario was evident, in particular, during the two large-scale ground offensives in the summer of 2014 and January 2015. Russia deployed thousands of troops to eastern Ukraine and used massive artillery fire to hit Ukrainian troops at range. On July 11, 2014, near the Ukrainian village of Zelenopillya, Russia conducted a short but highly effective artillery strike that killed over 30 Ukrainian soldiers previously spotted by a UAV, wounded another 100, and destroyed two battalions’ worth of vehicles and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Donbas, irregular troops — namely, separatist militias — were employed in the first line of engagement, decreasing the casualty rate of the regular Russian army while providing intelligence and reconnaissance to artillery brigades. These volunteer militias were led by “retired” Russian military officers and equipped with limited amounts of artillery, armored vehicles, and antiaircraft missiles. Regular troops were used only “against significant Ukrainian targets using traditional equipment such as main battle tanks, as well as modern communications and reconnaissance drones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s offensives in Ukraine from 2014 onward characteristically used proxies, irregular forces, disinformation, and cyberattacks. These forms of covert warfare accompanied conventional military operations. At first, Russia achieved tangible results particularly in its occupation of Crimea, and the Kremlin succeeded in temporarily paralyzing the Ukrainian government and multilateral institutions. However, operations soon evolved into an ongoing and inconclusive conflict with Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2015, when the Minsk II agreement was signed, no significant Russian offensive operation has occurred in the Donbas, and the line of contact has remained static. Kinetic activity has been limited to sporadic shelling and exchange of fire along the front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There has been regular, low-level fighting across the LoC, with often-daily loss of life on both sides. That low-level engagement has been punctured by periodic escalations, such as the fighting around the town of Mariinka in summer 2015. This calibrated coercion has drained Ukraine of financial, human, and political resources and put Russia in position to have a decisive say in the international diplomacy regarding the crisis. But Moscow has not sought military victory — e.g., a routing of the Ukrainian military or a significant expansion of rebel-held territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s approach to the war in the Donbas has been termed “calibrated coercion,” meaning that the Kremlin has sought neither a major escalation nor a ceasefire. Rather, it has used proxy forces to maintain a “simmering” conflict, aiming to keep a lever of influence on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia has failed to seize more Ukrainian territory since 2015, primarily due to Ukrainian military improvement. Between 2014 and the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine was engaged in constant low-intensity combat. Ukrainian military officers were thus confident that their troops would be better trained and prepared in case of a large-scale conflict with Russia. The major problem during the Donbas war concerned numbers: the Ukrainian armed forces had limited personnel and reserves. The problems with retaining a sufficient force stemmed primarily from poor salaries and short-term contracts, which caused high turnover of personnel. However, this turnover meant that a large number of Ukrainians had military experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue concerned the shortage of missile and artillery troops and ammunition due to the pre-2014 pro-Russian government of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, which carried out a systematic reduction of missile and artillery personnel and weapons. Due to these shortfalls, officers on the battlefield had to face a challenging situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With 10 brigades covering the entire line of contact in the JFO [ Joint Forces Operation], a brigade frontage at the start of the war was around 20 km. This left a limited reserve and depended on a manoeuvre defence to counterattack against breaches in the line. Each brigade started the war with around 10 days of ammunition, but there was limited confidence — given the threat from artillery — that more would reach the lines if the Russians committed all their capabilities to this axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014 was a turning point for the future of the Ukrainian armed forces. After surrounding the town, Russia targeted Ukraine’s forces with massive shelling that left hundreds of soldiers dead and forced those remaining to retreat and surrender the town to Russian-backed separatists. Following the bloody defeat, Ukraine’s military establishment began a round of reforms. Three key changes occurred before 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian society mobilized, which would become paramount to financing and supplying the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government allowed the formation of militias, which led to the creation of 50 volunteer battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conscription was introduced, acknowledging the need for a standing army.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes were followed by what has been labeled a new “hybrid transformation model,” resulting in the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a more effective command and control structure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the development of a noncommissioned officer corps and special forces operators&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;specific procurement objectives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increased training, advisory, and intelligence support from NATO countries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;strengthening of mission command&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After March 2014, Ukraine focused on rebuilding its artillery capabilities, leading to five new artillery brigades and one new artillery regiment by 2019, which doubled the number of artillery battalions Ukraine had and made it the second-largest artillery force in Europe behind Russia. There were also significant qualitative improvements in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; counterbattery fire; and combat control systems like the Kropyva. Improvements in the use of the latter led to an 80 percent reduction in deployment time for artillery units. Ukraine’s defense establishment also increased the number of tank units between 2014 and 2018, though tanks were employed more as a source of indirect fire than direct action during the conflict in the Donbas. However, while a constant lack of funds prevented the purchase of new tanks, it did allow the modernization of the existing fleet of T-64s and T-64Bs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning antitank capabilities, Ukraine established a school of antitank artillery, and the Ministry of Defence purchased several antitank missile systems — at least 650 Stugna-P and Korsar systems and about 7,000 accompanying missiles, 150 tower systems for armored vehicles with dual antitank missiles and 900 additional accompanying missiles, and 1,600 Cobra and Kombat guided missiles for tank missile systems. Since Russian precision strikes targeted several industrial and energy facilities located in the Donbas, the Ukrainian military enhanced its antiair capabilities by modernizing its radio and radar systems to ensure that it could detect enemy aircraft and missiles from a distance of 300–400 kilometers. Although Ukraine had put major efforts into modernizing and repairing its aircraft since 2014, analysts still considered its air force overmatched from a technical point of view by Russia’s VKS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while analysts saw the opening of fighting in the Donbas as an indicator of growing Russian military efficiency, the improvements the Ukrainian forces demonstrated after 2015, while acknowledged, seemed to play little role in challenging the narrative that Ukraine would be overrun in a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-of-war&quot;&gt;Understanding of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If Russia really wants to unleash its conventional capabilities, they could inflict massive damage in a very short period of time . . . They can devastate the Ukrainian military in the east really quickly, within the first 30–40 minutes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russian military forces — including elements of the 41st Combined Field Army and 144th Guards Motorized Rifle Division . . . would likely outmatch Ukrainian conventional forces and overrun Kiev in a matter of hours if they invaded.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia’s military superiority would enable it to overrun Ukraine’s army in weeks by launching assaults on multiple fronts — including from Belarus and the Black Sea, according to [one analyst]: ‘They’re defending the eastern flank of the largest country in Europe and what do they have? They could very easily be cut off and isolated in the eastern part of Ukraine, which is why they may find themselves fighting an organised retreat if faced with a multipronged attack.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one thing stands out in the analysis of what a war between Ukraine and Russia would look like, it is the extraordinary specificity about how little time it would take the Russian military to achieve its goals and the great speed with which it would move through Ukrainian defenses. One analyst claimed that Russia could “devastate” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country in less than an hour and disorient Ukraine to such an extent that the war would be “basically over in a day or so.” Another said the Russian army could overrun the Ukrainian army in “weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the conventional part of any Russian invasion happening with fast and brutal efficiency, as Russia could effectively deploy military systems to have an “overwhelming” and immediate impact on overmatched Ukrainians. In some ways, the analysis positioned the Russian military as comparable to, if somewhat smaller and less proficient than, the U.S. military. Any full-scale Russian invasion, analysts declared, would start with a shock-and-awe campaign — a direct echo of the U.S. attack on Iraq in 2003 — with Russia assuming (or indeed exceeding) a role akin to that of the United States in its ability to impose itself militarily on its supposedly overmatched foe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key elements of this first stage would be Russia’s long-range strike capability, which analysts assumed would allow Russia to precisely hit almost any Ukrainian target. Analysts also widely stated that these strike capabilities would combine with Russia’s powerful cyber capabilities to degrade Ukrainian systems and “degrade, fragment and paralyze” the Ukrainian armed force and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One analyst described this as part of Russian military thinking and a sign of Russia’s strengths in the operational art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many Russian concepts of operation emphasize a short and intense “Initial Period of War” that may produce decisive effects even before ground forces are fully committed. Standoff weapons — bombs, precision-guided missiles — are unleashed against enemy forces and the infrastructure that sustains the fight: military bases, forward-deployed units, air defense sites, airfields, key transportation nodes, fuel depots, command-and-control targets, power plants, even local news organizations. The aim is to force the enemy government to capitulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the time it would take Russia to inflict such devastating damage as remarkably short — a matter of days or even hours. Russian missiles were supposedly so accurate that Ukraine had no ability to counter them. One analyst summed up all of these visions at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As it stands, Russia is likely to begin any full-scale invasion with a lethal and largely unchallenged assault by bombers, ballistic missiles and artillery, said [one analyst]. “The shock and awe campaign they can launch with those resources against entrenched Ukrainian forces before the main ground invasion begins will be truly devastating,” he said. “The Ukrainian military has no answer for these weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the quick, destructive opening precision-fire phase of the Russian invasion was over, the Russian army would leap into action with its fast-moving and hard-hitting armored forces in a “combined arms ground offensive.” Spread out around Ukraine in a long arc reaching from west of Kyiv in Belarus, around Kharkiv, through Donetsk and Luhansk, and poised to come north out of Crimea, Russian forces were said to be well placed to create maximum problems for the Ukrainian defenders. Indeed, even though many of the same analysts would later claim that it was a mistake for the Russian forces to have developed such a wide, multi-axis offensive plan, analysts before February 24, 2022, broadly saw this as one of the key elements of likely Russian success. They said the Russian military had spread out its forces so much that Ukrainian defensive planning was far more difficult, forcing Ukraine to spread its supposedly less powerful forces too thinly to defend against all possible Russian attacks. As one report put it, “For Ukrainian forces to commit to denying one axis would simply leave another avenue of advance undefended.” Another paper described five axes of Russian advance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to the length of the Ukrainian border, Russia has multiple axes along which it could potentially invade. The first axis, and the most direct, could involve a push west from Rostov Oblast, reinforcing the DPR (Donetsk People’s Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People’s Republic) and assaulting the line of contact. The second axis would be to push south from Russia’s Belgorod Oblast. A third axis would be to push north from Crimea. If performed in conjunction with the second axis, Russian forces could rapidly cut off the JFO. Two further axes have been opened through Russia’s deployment of troops to Belarus. Fourth would be to push south from the Gomel region of Belarus, to encircle or overrun Kyiv, and a fifth would be to push south from Brest, to physically block Ukraine from receiving assistance overland from NATO countries. It is likely that in any conventional invasion Russia would push on all of these axes to fix Ukrainian forces, but weigh the main effort to target Kyiv, or to break the core of the Ukrainian army in the JFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most assessments of the correlation of forces lead to an expectation that Kyiv would be enveloped within days if Russia committed to an all out assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, analysts considered the Russian forces massed on the Ukrainian border, which numbered around 200,000, more than adequate to do the job — though after the initial invasion failed many would claim that the Russian army had been too small. As one analytic blog stated before the invasion,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moscow has amassed enough forces to conduct the largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945. This could involve an onslaught from Crimea in the south, Russia in the east, and Belarus in the north. Moscow could pursue a “thunder run” south from Belarus with the aim of quickly encircling Kyiv and causing the government to surrender or to collapse and install a puppet regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best way to understand how analysts saw the Russian army as an overwhelming threat to Ukraine is to look at a number of the maps generated on or just before February 24, 2022, claiming to show how a Russian invasion could progress. In their scope, the maps were as least as ambitious as the Russian invasion itself — and in some cases even more ambitious, depicting Russian thrusts farther to the northwest than the Russian military actually attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Russian army moved forward in the combined arms stage of the invasion, analysts predicted, the war would end quickly. The Ukrainian military would have little to no chance out in the open, and the Russian forces would drive almost anywhere they wanted, at least in the east of the country. One typical comparison matched the speed of U.S. military operations with Russian capabilities: “Ukraine’s paucity of air defences and the weakness of its armed forces means that Russia could drive to Kyiv perhaps as easily as American forces reached Baghdad in the Iraq war of 2003.” Indeed, for some prominent analysts, the ultimate question was not whether Russia could succeed militarily in Ukraine but how much of the country Putin would take. Would he want all of Ukraine, most of Ukraine, or just parts of the east while installing a puppet regime in Kyiv? One prominent analyst theorized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A full land invasion could entail Russia seizing as much as two-thirds of Ukraine’s territory by deploying troops from the eastern border, Belarus, Crimea and the Black Sea. . . . The big question is, will they look to conduct regime change and then a settlement? Or are they actually intending on partitioning Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show just how little chance analysts thought Ukraine had in a conventional war and how little they discussed the chance of Ukraine surviving, it is worth looking at something analysts discussed in detail — whether Ukrainian forces should, or even could, fight on as insurgents. A great deal of talk, much of it skeptical, surrounded the prospects of a Ukrainian insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts discussed two kinds of insurgency: (1) a campaign of urban resistance centered on Kyiv and the other large cities and (2) a regional campaign, likely in the west of the country only. The urban campaign was thought to be possible because the Ukrainian army stood no chance of fighting the Russian army in the open and therefore might retreat into the cities. Analysts saw this as a potentially promising move as it would allow the Ukrainian forces to exact higher casualties from the Russian forces than they could in a conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regional resistance campaign clearly fed on many of the stereotypical views of eastern Ukrainians, who would supposedly adjust to Russian rule in a relatively straightforward way, and western Ukrainians, who would be willing to resist with greater determination:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the case of Ukraine, a war would have a host of potential long-term consequences. Ukrainian resistance might live on as an insurgency, although, paradoxically, it would be most successful in the one part of the country Russia is unlikely to invade — its west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analysts did not see either of these campaigns as a path toward a Ukrainian victory; the campaigns were rather seen as ways to make the conquest of part, or even all, of Ukraine more painful for Russia. Even then, analysts argued against encouraging Ukraine to start an insurgency on grounds of cost, Ukraine’s supposedly weak sense of national identity, and the low chance of success. In terms of cost, if Ukrainians resorted to insurgency, the Russian reaction would be so brutal, it would be “catastrophic.” Indeed, those who argued against aiding Ukraine claimed that helping the Ukrainians prepare for an insurgency would only worsen their suffering. Moreover, the argument went, Ukrainian resistance would be less effective than pro-Ukrainian optimists thought because it was not clear how many Ukrainians would really strongly resist the Russian invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy to the U.S. invasions of Iraq in 1991 and 2003 was a poor one. In retrospect, allied forces attacking Iraq in 1991 substantially outnumbered their opponents, who were confronted with the full weight of U.S. air and land power near its Cold War height. In 2003, an Iraq weakened by postwar sanctions and isolation was in no position to put up more than sporadic resistance. At the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the differences between the Russian and U.S. militaries were vast. Russia could not orchestrate the intense, continual coordinated air attacks the United States could in 1991 and 2003. Further, the Russian army could not outclass its enemy in everything from technology to training and organization as the United States had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking omissions in the prewar analytic literature was the failure to acknowledge the fundamental unpredictability of war. Analysts portrayed war as a matter of equipment and doctrine, something that could be planned and executed, more as a complex engineering project than as a contest of will, military skill, and personalities. Friction, the fog of war, and the unpredictable nature of military interaction on the battlefield were all notable in their absence from the analyses. This fact is not entirely surprising: the analysts, by and large, were not military historians but analysts of the Russian military and as such seemed not to have thought about war in this broader way. Analysts evinced little humility about their ability to predict the outcome of combat operations, which is, indeed, one of the most striking characteristics of these assessments. Many of the most prominent analyses lacked reservations, qualifications, or simply acknowledgment of the imponderables of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-advocacy&quot;&gt;Policy Advocacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Notionally, helping Ukraine is admirable, but the lack of public discussion and suddenness of this announcement are worrisome. While arming Kiev may seem like an easy political win, it is poor policy. The idea of providing Ukraine with $50 million-worth of anti-tank missiles is eerily reminiscent of Washington’s halfhearted efforts to train and arm the moderate Syrian opposition. . . . The proposal to send arms to Kiev is also untimely. Ukraine has not seen a Russian offensive, or lost significant territory to Russia, in more than two years. Of all the possible ways to help the country improve its armed forces, dumping missiles on an unreformed military hardly seems the smart way forward. This is the time to help the country transform, not play geopolitical checkers with missiles.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The only weapons systems that could plausibly impose costs that could change Russia’s calculus, such as surface-to-air missiles and combat aircraft, are ones that the United States would be highly unlikely to provide the Ukrainians. And, regardless, they could not be procured, delivered, and be made operational — to say nothing of getting the Ukrainian operators trained up to use them — in time to have an impact on this crisis.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One issue when looking at equipping the Ukrainian military is that even if we provide them with very capable conventional weapons systems, if they get into a conventional fight with the Russian military, they are not going to win. A conventional fight is often going to be very lethal and very fast. We should be looking at how we can better equip Ukraine to fight unconventionally against the Russian military.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytic consensus before the war was that Russia was a great power with a modernized and battle-tested military that could project overwhelming force on Ukraine. Ukraine, in comparison, was riddled with corruption and ethnic divisions and had a military that could not compete in a conventional war. Such strong, almost unequivocal language would have qualified as a form of policy advocacy. Helping a corrupt and divided Ukraine against such a mighty Russian military was, after all, bound to be futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the analytic community went beyond using leading language and at times argued specifically against arming Ukraine with advanced weapons and capabilities. Maybe the first example came in 2017 when policymakers seriously discussed sending U.S. antitank missiles to Ukraine. One analyst in a New York Times op-ed warned against sending U.S. missiles to Ukraine, touching on many of the same themes that would typify the discussion of Russia and Ukraine over the coming years. First, Ukraine was primarily of Russian, not U.S., interest. Moreover, Russian “military superiority [was] well established.” The Ukrainian military was “unreformed” and moreover was regularly losing on the battlefield with its own antitank missiles. Ultimately, the analyst concluded, arming Ukraine with U.S. antitank missiles would be a pointless signal to Moscow and would not change the balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widely discussed essay titled “The West’s Weapons Won’t Make Any Difference to Ukraine” — published by one institution as “U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine: A Silver Bullet?” — used similar rhetoric. The piece argued against sending antiair weapons to Ukraine because even with such aid, Russia would overwhelm Ukraine in a conventional war. The authors gave an overview of any likely invasion that followed all of the analytic errors described above. This textbook case exemplifies how the analytic community viewed the military balance between Russia and Ukraine and how it viewed the war as developing from the opening strike phase through a possible insurgency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia has the ability to carry out a large-scale joint offensive operation involving tens of thousands of personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and hundreds of combat aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air and missile strikes from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into Ukraine to attack headquarters, airfields, and logistics points. Ukrainian forces would begin the conflict nearly surrounded from the very start, with Russian forces arrayed along the eastern border, naval and amphibious forces threatening from the Black Sea in the south, and the potential (increasingly real) for additional Russian forces to deploy into Belarus and threaten from the north, where the border is less than 65 miles from Kyiv itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In short, this war will look nothing like the status quo ante of conflict in Ukraine, and that undermines the first justification for U.S. aid: deterring Russia. The Ukrainian military has been shaped to fight the conflict in the Donbas and thus poses little deterrent threat to Russia; provision of U.S. weapons can do nothing to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Russia had Ukraine surrounded; was expert in joint operations from land, sea, and air; and would open the campaign with devastating missile and air strikes on Ukrainian logistics, command and control, and military bases. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, had been shaped to fight a much smaller conflict in the Donbas and had little capacity to deter the larger Russian military. Moreover, the conventional part of the war would be over so quickly, Ukraine would not be able to train to make U.S. weapons operational. As such, U.S. weapons could “do nothing” to change the equation. The authors stated, “In short, the military balance between Russia and Ukraine is so lopsided in Moscow’s favor that any assistance Washington might provide in coming weeks would be largely irrelevant in determining the outcome of a conflict should it begin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having dispensed with any chance for a successful Ukrainian resistance in a conventional war, the authors stated that Western assistance would not help much even in an insurgency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Russia attempts a long-term occupation of areas with lots of hostile Ukrainians, these forms of support could, on the margins, complicate matters for Moscow. But U.S. support to a Ukrainian insurgency should be a matter of last resort during an extended conflict, not a centerpiece of policy before it has even started. The prospect of a marginally more costly occupation is unlikely to make a difference to Moscow if it gets to that stage; it will have already absorbed far more significant costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support to any insurgency should be resisted as the costs would be borne by the Ukrainians. The United States, the authors argued, should “wish” that its partners, the Ukrainians, would not have to suffer so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the analytic community created a catch-22 with respect to military aid to Ukraine. Analysts clearly stated to politicians that Russia was so strong and Ukraine so weak that nations should not aid Ukraine to compensate for its weakness. Just 16 days before the full-scale Russian invasion, one analyst told the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Defence that providing Ukraine with weapons to fight a conventional war was pointless because Ukraine “was not going to win”; the Russian military would be too “lethal and fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the analytic community was generally skeptical about aiding Ukraine because it had such an elevated view of Russian military capabilities vis-à-vis Ukrainian capabilities, it is also worth noting that some in the U.S. think tank community made another strong argument against arming Ukraine. Drawing on older U.S. foreign predilections as well as dissatisfaction with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, think tanks such as the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft offered a policy of restraint. In addition to principled opposition to U.S. entanglement in this conflict and a belief that conventional military aid to Ukraine would be fruitless, some holding this position argued that aiding an insurgency was not only pointless; it was also wrong — as it would be better to keep good relations with Putin’s Russia. Moreover, the Ukrainians might be Nazis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The current front-runner for a more robust response is a scheme to fund and arm Ukrainian fighters to mount a resistance to a Russian occupation. Indeed, there are news reports that CIA operatives already are busily training Ukrainian paramilitary units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a spectacularly bad idea. Assisting guerrillas to maim and kill Russian soldiers might well create an irreparable breach between Russia and the West. The new cold war already is chilly enough without adding to the dangerous tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of the Ukrainian factions that the United States and its allies would be supporting are more than a little unsavory. Western media outlets recently suffered serious embarrassment when they featured flattering news stories about how a Ukrainian military unit was training children and the elderly in the use of weapons, so that they could resist Russian invaders. It turned out that the unit giving the instructions, the “National Guard,” had close ties to the openly neo-Nazi Azov battalion. There are other far-right factions in Ukraine that would eagerly join the line for U.S. weapons and funding. Western governments don’t seem all that selective about their potential partners in a Ukrainian resistance force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the assessments of the larger analytic community studying Ukraine did not support these policy views, some analysts reinforced them, though many showed sympathy with Ukraine’s plight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology-and-consistency&quot;&gt;Methodology and Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One notable aspect of the analysis of Russian and Ukrainian military capabilities and how a war between them might evolve is a great consensus regarding outcomes but the lack of a clearly accepted methodology through which this consensus was reached. Net assessments, judgments, and analyses contained little information as to how they were compiled. Indeed, despite the many types of evidence used, sometimes in different ways, the conclusions were surprisingly uniform. The methodological problem is a general one that confronts those conducting strategic analysis. Making judgments on military power is a complex process, so analysts consider many different variables. Using different methodologies with different evidence can produce very different results. However, in the case of the analysis before February 24, 2022, the various pieces of evidence, even when used differently, produced a remarkable consensus judgment about Russian and Ukrainian military power — let alone about how these nations would interact in the case of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, analysts regularly used certain variables to make the case that Russia was strong, while presenting a weaker case for Ukraine. Analysts used five different evidence groupings — sometimes in tandem, sometimes in isolation — but rarely with a clear methodology. These groupings were the numerical, the qualitative, the doctrinal, the experiential, and the political and social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-numerical&quot;&gt;The Numerical&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts often considered the Russian military much stronger than the Ukrainian military because of its numerical advantages in terms of equipment. Indeed, this numerical advantage was so pronounced in some quarters that analysts assumed that Russia could conquer eastern Ukraine with a relatively small number of soldiers (around 200,000). As reported in one major outlet, “Military analysts say the Ukrainian force has critical gaps and probably would be overwhelmed if Russia decided to mount a full-scale assault. On nearly every battlefield metric — fighter jets, tanks, missiles, troop numbers — Ukraine would find itself outmatched.” This assumption of the numerical difference between the forces was widely held. Indeed, analysts often claimed that Russia had more than enough force to conquer Ukraine, without employing any discernible methodology about what kinds of numerical advantage would be needed to both defeat the Ukrainian army and conquer an area as vast as eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts had a widespread shared understanding as to the numerical size and composition of the Russian force massed on the Ukrainian border. They described it as overwhelmingly powerful: “The modernized and massive Russian military force that currently surrounds Ukraine on three sides can muster air and missile strikes that would likely overwhelm Ukrainian airpower and air defenses and severely damage military and other facilities.” One of the most detailed calculations assessed that Russia had between 150,000 and 175,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in late January 2022 and a strike force of 90–100 BTGs, with at most 100,000 troops. The analysis assumed that at least eastern Ukraine would be quickly overrun. And yet, by most military standards, such a force would have been as small, or not much larger, than the Ukrainian army it was supposed to easily overrun. In the weeks before the full-scale invasion, for instance, the Ukrainian army (independent of the air force and navy) numbered around 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-qualitative&quot;&gt;The Qualitative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers alone were not the only reason for the assessment of Russia’s supposed advantages over Ukraine. Analysts generally considered Russian forces better trained and capable of deploying their systems effectively, and their systems were qualitatively much better. This qualitative advantage, which was generally stated rather than proven, seemed to be based on Russian claims. Thus, analysts assumed that the quality of Russian military personnel was considerably higher than in previous years — and certainly higher than that of the Ukrainian forces. The Russian army, they said, “no longer relies on large numbers of poorly trained conscripts and ill-equipped ground forces as it did in Chechnya. Its modernization program was designed to avoid the kind of disorganized, stove-piped, ground-force dominant operation seen in Georgia in 2008.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian forces, on the other hand, even though they had also been modernizing, were usually considered a class below the Russian forces. One of the few statements directly comparing the two accepted Russian quality at face value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine’s armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014–2015, so have Russia’s. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers — professional servicemen, rather than conscripts — with high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine’s military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also applied Russia’s qualitative advantage to its weapons systems, which they assumed were capable of operating at a very high rate of efficiency. For instance, Russian long-range strikes were believed to be both exceedingly accurate and well-targeted for maximum impact. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, was at such a disadvantage in armaments that it could not prepare or react to a devastating Russian distance strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-doctrinal&quot;&gt;The Doctrinal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One specific area where Russia supposedly had a significant qualitative advantage was in military doctrine. Indeed, analysts had elevated Russian doctrine in the years before 2022 to among the most creative and perceptive in the world. In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts claimed, for instance, that Russia had been a world “trendsetter” in military doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lauding of the high quality of Russian doctrine, which was treated in many ways as a continuation of Soviet doctrine, has gone on for decades. Soviet doctrine traces to the concept of deep battle in the 1930s. Seen as creative and successful, the doctrine has seemed to transfer directly to Russian military thinking over the last decade. Indeed, analysts have considered Russian doctrine so important that they have accorded different parts specific labels, such as the New Look Russian military, the partly mythical Gerasimov doctrine, and the Russian active defense posture. Even the Russian army’s reorganization into BTGs is considered an intelligent adaptation that greatly increased the striking power of Russian units. Overall, Russian doctrine appeared so strong that the Chinese military — though larger and more powerful — attempted to base much of its doctrine on Russian thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, by contrast, did not have a doctrine so much as it was trying to get as close to NATO as possible by taking on NATO thinking. In the end, when the full-scale invasion occurred, Russian doctrine did not appear to be particularly creative or useful for the purpose of subjugating Ukraine. Arguably, the Ukrainian military handled the full-scale invasion with greater initiative and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-experiential&quot;&gt;The Experiential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre–February 24, 2022, experiences of both militaries, in terms of combat and military exercises, mattered a great deal, particularly for Russia. These experiences purportedly provided evidence of Russian combat efficiency and logistical capabilities and revealed significant limitations for the Ukrainian forces. The Syria case study, mentioned earlier, gave an obviously distorted vision of Russian air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much the same could be said about how analysts used Syria to describe general improvements in Russian combat capabilities. In one major news report, analysts claimed that Russian forces poised to invade Ukraine were “steeled with recent combat experience in Syria.” Interestingly, Russia used few land forces in Syria, and Syrians undertook the vast majority of the fighting. Moreover, the activity of Russian land forces in Syria could be considered advanced combined-arms warfare. Still, analysts used the Syria case study to make the case that Russian ground forces had shown significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same could be said about the experiences of Russian maneuvers. Even though the well-known Zapad maneuvers were arguably more choreographed displays than realistic deployments, analysts often held them up as demonstrating real capabilities through experience. Indeed, some claimed that these were not “theater” but made little effort to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the lauding of Russian experiential improvement and maneuvers in Syria stands out because analysts treated the Ukrainian experience in the Donbas very differently. Even though Ukrainians fighting in the Donbas showed noticeable combat improvement in conditions much closer to those in 2022, analysts generally dismissed this experience as of little benefit in helping them correct the massive power differential that supposedly existed between Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-political-and-social&quot;&gt;The Political and Social&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts widely mentioned political and social variables, though once again not in a methodologically consistent manner but more to provide illustration for arguments they had already made. In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts regularly discussed Ukrainian corruption as a weakness Russia could take advantage of, but made little or no mention of corruption in the Russian military, which was just as great or worse. Ukraine was even presented as so corrupt that the European Union would not consider admitting it as a member for at least a generation. However, they rarely mentioned Russian corruption, and when they did, it was as a problem that had been largely rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt about the distinctiveness of Ukrainian identity was also widespread and had persisted for a significant period. Indeed, a long-standing position among some analysts was that the borders of the Soviet republics that emerged as independent states in 1991 were dubious and represented little to the people who lived there. Analysts minimized the linguistic, historical, and political differences between the now sovereign and independent states that used to make up the Soviet Union. By contrast, there seemed to be little in the way of doubts expressed about Russian identity or national self-understanding. Instead, analysts described Ukraine as an object of Russian desire. One report shows the clear subject-object relationship often portrayed between Russia and Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No part of the Russian and Soviet empires has played a bigger and more important role in Russian strategy toward Europe than the crown jewel, Ukraine. The country is essential to Russian security for many reasons: its size and population; its position between Russia and other major European powers; its role as the centerpiece of the imperial Russian and Soviet economies; and its deep cultural, religious, and linguistic ties to Russia, particularly Kyiv’s history as the cradle of Russian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts will never have one shared methodology by which to judge military power and war, nor should they. Analysts who make sweeping and confident judgments about what will happen would be wiser to be up front about the criteria they are using to make such judgments. If this report reveals anything, it is how different methodologies and variables ended up supporting a predetermined vision of power and war. Greater explicitness about the methodologies used might well have opened up a debate about the judgments being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-analytic-failure&quot;&gt;Why the Analytic Failure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic error of some kind is inevitable. But in the case of the Russia-Ukraine military analysis, the errors (a) were well beyond the normal failures expected in any intellectual project, (b) had potentially consequential policy implications, and (c) were not, in most cases, mitigated by any noticeable analytic humility or caution on the part of those committing them. It is also striking that the analysts who were most egregiously wrong in their assessments remained prominent and influential despite these errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As erring forecasters often do, the analysts resorted to classic explanations that seemingly obviate the need for searching self-criticism. The guide to such self-exculpation is Philip Tetlock’s Expert Political Judgment, a powerful study of expert error. The book is particularly interesting in this case because it illuminates some of the retrospective justifications for error. Many of these have indeed been brought to bear in the Russia-Ukraine military analysis problem and take the form of what Tetlock refers to as “belief system defenses,” which, as he puts it, “renege on reputational bets.” Of those he lists, the ones most germane to the failures described here are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-exogenous-shock-defense&quot;&gt;The Exogenous Shock Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exogenous shock defense is the proposition that while the core prediction was correct and solidly based, an unforeseeable event undermined it by deranging the prognosticators’ calculations. In the current case, that exogenous shock would be the exquisite degree of warning that the United States provided the world and Ukrainian leadership about the impending attack. This defense may also include the supposition that U.S. and other friendly intelligence agencies provided Ukraine with the details of the Russian plan, allowing them to make essential tactical adjustments (e.g., dispersing aircraft). As a result, Western intelligence stymied the invasion by mitigating Russia’s overwhelming advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defense falls apart, however, given the open menace that President Putin had presented Ukraine in the preceding year, which the Ukrainian military seems to have taken seriously. The Ukrainian government, by contrast, refrained from publicly predicting and preparing for the massive assault for a variety of reasons, including a hope to avert it. Moreover, the Russian army did achieve local successes, particularly in the south, against Ukrainian forces that seem to have been surprised by the attack. None of this would explain the Ukrainian military’s tactical effectiveness, innovation, and successful counterattacks around Kyiv and Kharkiv. In any case, even though Western agencies were providing detailed information about the Russian buildup well before February 22, the expert community did not modify its predictions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-close-call-counterfactual-defense-i-was-almost-right&quot;&gt;The Close-Call Counterfactual Defense (“I Was Almost Right”)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument has had a good deal of play because of the close-run defense of Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv. On February 24, Russian airborne troops launched an attack on the airport, less than 10 kilometers from Kyiv. They were held back for a day, in part by Ukrainian national guardsmen, the latter of whom were subsequently reinforced by regular units. Although Russian mechanized units and airborne forces took Hostomel a day later, the airport had been damaged, and the delays, analysts argued, prevented Russian columns from suddenly dashing into Kyiv proper, which might have toppled the Zelensky administration overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But was it fortuitous that Ukrainian mechanized units were available to defend the airport? And for that matter, even if the Russian forces had taken Hostomel on the first day, is it right to assume that a Russian column charging into a dense, hostile urban area like Kyiv, filled with armed civilians and light infantry, would have done better than their counterparts in, say, the city of Mariupol in the south? Other similar “for want of a horseshoe nail” arguments include the possibility of President Zelensky being killed on the first night of the war — but it was not for want of trying by Russian secret services, nor was it a coincidence that the president, well protected by his own efficient bodyguards and secret services, was not killed. Moreover, such arguments can play in the opposite direction: Suppose Putin had a fatal heart attack on February 21. Suppose even more Ukrainian forces had deployed to Hostomel, north of Kyiv, and so on. The analysts were not nearly right; they were simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-politics-is-hopelessly-cloudlike-and-the-low-probability-outcome-just-happened-to-happen-defenses&quot;&gt;The “Politics Is Hopelessly Cloudlike” and “The Low-Probability Outcome Just Happened to Happen” Defenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Politics Is Hopelessly Cloudlike” and “The Low-Probability Outcome Just Happened to Happen” defenses are two versions of an argument common to defenses of poor predictions of military outcomes. War is an intrinsically uncertain affair, as every theorist notes; no prediction can claim complete accuracy, and a variety of outcomes are always possible. The problem with either version as applied to the analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before the war is that a serious belief in the unpredictability of war should have moderated analysts’ certainty. As demonstrated, it did not. Instead, analysts depicted war as a large engineering operation in which all the heavy equipment and logistical planning argued overwhelmingly for the success of the aggressor nation. There was no more uncertainty in the prediction than there would have been about the completion of a major construction project, which, after all, has a set of uncertainties associated with it — though nothing like those of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-i-made-the-right-mistake-defense&quot;&gt;The “I Made the Right Mistake” Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final justification for analytic failure is that the Russian forces should have accomplished everything that they planned but were thwarted by the unpredictable and foolish intervention of President Putin and his advisers from the Federal Security Service (FSB). In this version, the Russian general staff had the right ideas and the requisite organizations, doctrine, and technology at their disposal but were undermined by the meddling of an ignorant civilian leader and his incompetent intelligence services. The original Russian plan would have involved fewer axes of advance (three rather than five) and would have had more regard for Ukrainian capabilities, some have suggested. In this view, the president, encouraged by FSB advisers who convinced him that Ukraine was ripe for the plucking and that resistance would be minimal, interfered with a competent general staff that would otherwise have conducted the operation with the results the Western analysts expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is that early Russian failures were multidimensional, and many had little to do with Putin or the FSB. The logistical challenges and the organization and tactics that left Russian armored columns exposed to light infantry ambushes would all have remained the same. There is no evidence of general staff pushback against the simultaneous attack on multiple vectors or apprehension about it; indeed, the idea of such an attack presenting too many challenges for the Ukrainian military to cope with had a certain plausibility to it. It would be closer to the mark to say that the general staff made its own set of mistakes. The “civilian meddling and incompetence” explanation for the outcome, and hence for the analytic failure, is in some ways the most interesting. It represents a seemingly subconscious desire to make the Russian military out to be more formidable than it actually was — perhaps not implausible for those who had devoted their careers to studying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-remedies&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Remedies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytic failure at the outset of the war rippled beyond the conflict. The initial estimates seem to have influenced the tentativeness with which the West armed Ukraine, holding back on advanced weapons systems in part based on the argument that the primitive Ukrainian military could not operate them successfully. Pessimism about Ukrainian chances, hesitation about reinforcing Ukrainian successes, and difficulty in seeing Russia’s true weaknesses were all hangovers from the initial failure, even though many analysts eventually adjusted to the reality of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader implications of the failure are even more important. It is striking how small the analytic community was that made the judgments that shaped public perceptions and, in some measure, government policy. These individuals, for the most part, had similar backgrounds — degrees in political science and experience almost exclusively in think tanks, along with occasional stints in the intelligence community. They were not historians and certainly not military historians. Few had field experience as soldiers. They were overwhelmingly “Russia military analysts” by trade and not experts on Ukraine, often accepting, at a tacit level, deep-seated Russian views about the unreality of Ukrainian nationhood. Their internal system was mutually supportive. They constantly approved citations of one another’s work and treated both the underlying uncertainty and commentary of those outside the community with a degree of disdain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a recipe for what the pioneering social psychologist Irving L. Janis referred to as groupthink. Indeed, the analytic community exhibited many of the characteristics Janis noted: underestimation of the group’s susceptibility to error, stereotyped views, self-censorship of dissent and commitment to unanimity, and even “self-appointed mindguards” who enforced orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this happen? Analysis of the Russian military was a major intellectual field during the Cold War, but it shrank after the war’s end and the emergence of new threats in the form of radical Islam and China. The result was a small community dependent on mutual support, operating in the research institution environment. The latter point is important. Academic disciplines, despite all their faults, promote (at least in theory) sharp debates and disagreement, and professors are usually rewarded for challenging and displacing conventional wisdom rather than elaborating it. Academics can also switch fields of specialization, which can bring in new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much less the case in research institutions, particularly in small areas where patronage by leading figures is necessary for career advancement. In the case of government-funded research — much of it coming from the U.S. Department of Defense, with its vested interests — in the decades before the war there was considerable disincentive to underplay Russian capabilities. Moreover, the initial failures of Russian operations in the opening phases of the war did not change matters much. If anything, the pathologies were reinforced during crisis and ensuing wars as the small group of acknowledged experts became media stars, repeatedly interviewed and quoted in major outlets, on social media, and even by government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts discussed here did not exhibit moral turpitude, much less stupidity or willful blindness. They were the product of their incentive systems and the intellectual structures that produced them. But the failure is a warning because it can and will happen again in other cases possibly more consequentially. Luckily, however, potential remedies are available to governments, journalists, and research organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRING IN THE GENERALISTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-conscious effort by journalists and government consumers of military analysis to critique expert conclusions is a good idea. In the present case, military officers, historians, and Ukraine experts might all have offered useful counters to the analytic orthodoxy. Indeed, research institutions could make contributions in this area by convening reviews of expert consensus in military analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRING IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPECIALISTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the commentators who were most optimistic about Ukraine’s chances came from the ranks of soldiers, particularly those who had served in advisory and training roles in Ukraine since 2014. Diverse intellectual and professional backgrounds might well have changed the weight of expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsiders need to keep book — not with the purpose of banishing or blacklisting analysts but confronting them with their errors and putting them in a position to reflect on why the errors were made. Unfortunately, there are few professional incentives to do this work, reflecting a larger problem in the social sciences, such as the “replication crisis” in psychology and many other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BROADEN THE EDUCATION OF ANALYSTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social sciences and humanities bring different qualities to analysis. Political science and sociology have their strong points, but so does history, which would have been particularly useful in this case. The sensibility of historians — their alertness to contingency, nuance, culture, personality, and much else — differs from that of political scientists. Students of the history of war, in particular, have a much better visceral feel for the imponderables than social scientists usually do. This is, of course, even more true of well-educated soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF DEBATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consensus on analytic forecasts is perilous, as students of intelligence failure have long noted. The problem with the usual solution — an in-house contrarian of some kind — is that it runs the risk of being formulaic. Analysts need venues and incentives to disagree with one another without fearing professional consequences, either for their reputation as oracles or due to retaliation from leaders in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors again stress that they do not find deliberate dishonesty or manipulation, much less simplemindedness or stupidity, in the poor analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before the war. Rather, the structure of the analytic community — its incentive structures and educational formation — makes the failure understandable, if no less disturbing. The authors’ concern is that in an era of severe military conflict, this is highly unlikely to be a one-off case, with quite possibly more cases to come. In such cases, consensus and certainty are not only intellectually problematic, but they are also downright dangerous. Consumers of such analysis, as well as those who produce it, must act to prevent another such failure.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, the Japanese Navy has the fresh and brilliant tradition of the war with China in which many officers and seaman of the Japanese fleet took part.

&lt;p&gt;Military analysis, in one form or another, has existed for millennia. However, only in the last two centuries has it become institutionalized, and only since 1945 has it become industrialized. Before 1945, military analysis was often the remit of random scholars or civil servants, a very small number of research organizations, such as Janes, or soldiers in defense departments or armies. Military analysts had no agreed-upon methodology and little in the way of a shared community, and only occasional authors, such as Antoine-Henry Jomini, Carl von Clausewitz, and Alfred Thayer Mahan, emerged to become widely discussed strategic thinkers. Since 1945, the growth of think tanks and the proliferation of military bureaucracies, with their analytic, intelligence, and educational arms, have vastly expanded the number of military analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as the field of military analysis has flourished and become institutionalized, it has not improved on the surface and, in some respects, may have deteriorated. For the sake of comparison, it might be helpful to briefly discuss some examples of analysis from the twentieth century to better understand how deep the errors were before February 24, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following case studies all have something in common with the Russia-Ukraine War: the Russian navy at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, Benito Mussolini’s military before Italy joined World War II, and the Iraqi military before the United States launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great differences between the analysis of military power before 1945 and the analysis thereafter is that in the earlier period there was little formal organization. To be sure, there were standard yearbooks such as Jane’s and Brassey’s annual surveys of the navies of the world, but these were often static compilations of statistics. When it came to the Russian navy and Italian armed forces, for instance, there were no think tanks producing regular reports on their supposed strengths and weaknesses, although publications like Jane’s and Brassey’s did tabulate order of battle data. Instead, public discourse was mostly dominated by reporters, sometimes specifically military reporters, writing in major newspapers. Within governments, military and naval attachés posted in different countries generated much of the analysis. However, almost all of their reports were confidential, and it is hard to say that any organized methodology drove their different opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because of the lack of a defined community, early analysis tended to shy away from taking overly strong or definitive opinions, as evident in the analysis of the Russian navy at the time of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5). Although many people in Europe and North America likely thought that the Russians were superior to the Japanese due to their European status, public reports on the Russian navy seem to have made no such assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, much of the reporting, as shown by the 1903 New York Times editorial on the war cited above, tended to see the war as evenly matched, with the Russians having no significant material advantage because they were Europeans. The UK Times, which was establishing itself as the paper of record, analyzed the war very similarly. In December 1903, as war clouds were gathering, a Times military correspondent claimed that the Russian and Japanese fleets were evenly matched and, as such, the outcome of any naval war between them would be decided by seamanship and tactics, not materiel. If anything, this was a relatively positive view of the Russian navy, as subsequent analysis of its capabilities tended to focus on weakness. In March 1904, the Times military correspondent pointed out a wide gulf between Russian naval power and that of a major maritime power such as the British or French. By 1905, before the Battle of Tsushima, the analysis revealed a Russian navy with major flaws. Describing its performance during the Japanese attack on Port Arthur, the Times military analyst spoke of “the abasement of the art of naval war by Russian seaman and the Russian Government.” Thus, before the Russian navy’s almost total destruction at the hands of the Japanese in June 1905, the analysis of its capabilities in the leading journals of the United States and United Kingdom was not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reporting about the Italian military right before it entered the pre–World War II fighting was not quite as negative but stressed weaknesses as well as strengths. Certain military correspondents, such as Herbert Matthews in the New York Times, stressed the comparatively large size of the Italian army, the Italian navy’s growing fleet, and the Italian air force’s latest aircraft, arguing that Italy would be a major player in any coming war. When judging the impact of Italy entering the war on Germany’s behalf on June 1, 1940, Matthews wrote that Italy had a “powerful weight to throw into the balance” when the time came. The Times could also rate Italy a major player by relying mostly on metrics, such as the supposed size of the Italian army, which the Times estimated was 1.25 million in the spring of 1939.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the analysis the major papers provided also stressed major weaknesses in the Italian military. Italy’s relative economic backwardness was widely understood as a handicap to Mussolini’s attempts to make Italy a great power. Matthews, for instance, wrote a detailed piece in May 1939 about what a war would be like between Italy and Germany against Britain and France. He argued that the relative economic weakness of the Axis powers would play a huge role in determining the outcome of any such conflict. Even if Italy and Germany had great success at the start, the longer the war went on, the more the balance of production would turn against them. Within this analysis was an understanding that Italy might well lack the resources to sustain full-scale operations. One report, for instance, claimed that because of economic weakness, Italy would have difficulty sustaining naval operations after a few months of intense fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding of basic Italian weaknesses was, if anything, even more prevalent in the attaché community in Italy. The German military attachés, for instance, were known to be very skeptical about Italy’s military capabilities — much more so than German dictator Adolf Hitler. These kinds of doubts played a significant role in undermining the notion of Italian military prowess that Mussolini tried hard to propagate. One of the best examples is the farcical Italian military maneuvers of the summer of 1939, described in the excerpt from Matthews. The Italian government was hoping to impress the world’s press with these maneuvers, which would have them drive off an expected invader (probably France) and then counterattack. However, after a few days, the organization of the maneuvers broke down, and Mussolini decided he could not even risk appearing in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the twentieth century, military analysis could be quite cautious based on a range of factors, not just military metrics but also societal and political efficiency and economic strength. Also, as there was no one analytic community, the analysis lacked consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the twentieth century, however, the caution seemed to have lessened in at least one case: the vision of what the Iraqi armed forces could do to fighting U.S. armed forces during Operation Desert Storm (1991). Before the war there was a great deal of speculation about how the Iraqi military could fight against U.S. military forces sent to Saudi Arabia after Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. One of the most hotly discussed topics was the number of casualties the Iraqi army could inflict on the United States. Many considered the Iraqi military to be battle hardened after its long war against Iran and in possession of very effective military equipment. Analysts widely held that the Iraqi Republican Guard was “elite” and would pose significant problems for U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the estimates of the casualties the Iraqis would inflict on U.S. forces were far greater than the reality. In some cases, professional military analysts estimated that the United States would suffer well over 10,000 dead and more than 30,000 casualties. In the end, U.S. forces suffered 96 deaths in action against the Iraqis. That said, although analysts did not widely believe that the Iraqis would defeat the United States, they overestimated the damage the Iraqis would inflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to argue that military analysis improved in the twentieth century, and there is evidence that as the structures of military analysis grew, the quality of that analysis did not. One reason is that earlier analysis, not being systematized, may have relied on more holistic criteria for understanding military power. Instead of simply counting units and running calculations, early analysts, such as those who addressed the Russian and Italian militaries, often stressed their economic and societal weaknesses, not just the purported strength of their military units. That seems to have happenedless in 1990–91, which could have contributed to a significant overestimation of the Iraqi military. Yet, in comparison to the analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before February 24, 2022, much of the earlier work was more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of the ebb and flow in the Middle East was on display in real time as Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the Kurdistan Region of Iraq on 12–13 September at a time of widening Turkish operations against Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) targets there, and only days after Turkey’s foreign minister attended the ministerial meeting of the League of Arab States in Cairo. As the war in Gaza rages on, it is important not to overlook what is unfolding in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq – a pivotal arena where Iran and Turkey, long aligned against Kurdish separatist movements, have both indirectly clashed through local factions as they seek to navigate their overlapping spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) has escalated its cross-border strikes against PKK strongholds in recent months, with reports that it has advanced as far as 15 kilometres into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The PKK has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK since March 2001 and is also listed as a terrorist organisation in over a dozen other countries, as well as by the EU. While this puts the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) under pressure, it also pits Ankara against Iranian interests, as well as raising concerns among Arab League countries about Turkey’s expansionist regional ambitions. Like Syria next door, Iraqi Kurdistan remains a key battleground for Turkey and Iran, and Tehran in recent years has steadily moved to amplify its influence vis-à-vis the Iraqi Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s decision to step up the intensity of its cross-border activities rests on several considerations. These include the Turkish security establishment’s assessment of a heightened risk of PKK militancy, combined with a weaker and divided political administration in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and re-centralising state dynamics in Iraq that are favourable to Turkish military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turkeys-claw-operation-in-iraq&quot;&gt;Turkey’s Claw Operation in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22–23 December 2023, twin PKK attacks left 12 Turkish soldiers dead in the Harkuk and Dohuk regions in northern Iraq. Then, on 12 January 2024, the PKK killed nine Turkish soldiers and wounded another four in strikes against a Turkish military base. While cross-border operations in the region have been a grim reality since 2018, with periodic casualties among Turkish forces, the proximity of these latest attacks raised fresh alarm bells. Since 2022, Turkey has conducted a military operation known as Operation Claw-Lock to secure the northern Dohuk area in Iraq along its border. And while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on 10 July, “We will close the lock very soon in the Claw Operation Zone”, this is unlikely to mean the end of Turkish military presence in the operational area, including a network of bases, checkpoints and secured military roads to minimise reliance on aircraft for logistical transport and movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, Turkey has expanded its operations against the PKK in northern Iraq, reaching into areas as far as the countryside of Sulaymaniyah and even regions along the road to Kirkuk. Turkish forces have established numerous bases in the areas where operations have been conducted, with consequences for local civilians and agricultural land. In northeastern Syria, the TAF has targeted key infrastructure, and it makes no distinction between Iraq and Syria in its fight against PKK-linked terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Turkish operation in Iraq, which has been conducted below the threshold of a ground invasion, aims to degrade the PKK and deprive it of forward bases, and to prevent insurgents from reoccupying areas that have been cleared. This entails pushing PKK fighters southwards and away from the border, using a series of operations that leverage Turkey’s advanced military capabilities, such as surveillance and air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent phase of Turkish operations has been localised, aiming to secure the Matin mountains within the Amedi district north of Dohuk in northern Iraq. The area is significant because it is crucial for any future operations in the larger Gara mountain range, where the PKK has established a network of sophisticated bases. Gara’s strategic importance stems from its central location, linking Qandil with Syria, Turkey and Sinjar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Turkish pressure and shifting realities on the ground have rendered Baghdad and Erbil more pliable on the question of the PKK in recent years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK established a foothold in Sinjar in 2014 when so-called Islamic State attacked the local Yazidi peoples in a genocidal campaign, leading to mass civilian casualties and atrocities. The region has been penetrated by a medley of groups, including Iran-backed Shiite militias and Yazidi armed groups linked to the PKK. Sinjar is a crucial supply line that allows transit for the PKK across Iraq and Syria; losing its access will lessen the influence it holds in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pkks-posture-in-iraq&quot;&gt;The PKK’s Posture in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three regions stand out for their strategic significance for the PKK: Mahmur, Sinjar and the so-called Medya Defence Zones. Having evolved over four decades, these enclaves represent strategic assets for the organisation, following its shift from bases in Syria and Lebanon to northern Iraq. Over time, the PKK expanded into civilian areas by expanding into cities, towns and villages through social, political and economic structures, giving it access to material assets and overland smuggling routes in the borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish pressure and shifting realities on the ground have rendered Baghdad and Erbil more pliable on the question of the PKK in recent years. The central government’s formal ban of the group – which falls short of the terrorist designation Ankara wanted – is more than a symbolic gesture. Iraqi officials have warned against the possibility of PKK-linked attacks on oil refineries and other critical national infrastructure, an indication that Ankara has made strides in persuading Baghdad that the organisation poses a risk to Iraqi national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the PKK’s slow and steady encroachment into civilian areas, infringing upon the territorial authority of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), has triggered a legitimacy crisis at a time when the latter is already under pressure from Baghdad and local opponents. The PKK maintains a presence in the area of Sinjar, despite the agreement in October 2020 between the central government and the KRG that calls for the withdrawal of foreign fighters from the area. As the PKK’s freedom of movement has grown in the area of Sulaymaniyah, which is controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), tensions have intensified between Turkey and Iran. For Erbil, the effect of PUK cooperation with Iran is to hand greater leverage to Baghdad over the Iraqi Kurds and the ability to degrade the region’s autonomy through economic, judicial and security interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of setbacks to the power-sharing arrangement that has held since 2005, the KRG has seen its autonomy come under mounting pressure from Iranian- and Shia-influenced politics in Baghdad. In February 2022, the Federal Supreme Court decreed that the KRG’s 2007 natural resource law was unconstitutional and its oil exports and contracts illegal. This was followed in January 2023 by a ruling against new federal budget transfers to the Kurdistan region. In March 2023, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favour of Iraq in a decade-long arbitration case that led to the Iraq–Turkey pipeline closure, which remains unresolved. In a further blow, in a February 2024 decision, the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq ruled that the KRG must hand over control of its finances to the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza has amplified the role of various Iran-aligned Shia militias in Iraq, a patchwork of ideologically like-minded groups that have been called to action against US military targets since the 7 October attacks on Israel. Iran views Turkey’s sizeable military footprint as a threat to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ and Shia militias’ areas of operation inside northern Iraq and the border areas. To prevent Turkey from regaining a foothold in areas like Mosul and Kirkuk, and to degrade its existing influence over Erbil and Duhok, Iran has both targeted the KDP in ways that are a throwback to the dynamics which defined the region in the 1990s, as well as engaged with it in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, as US influence receded from northern Iraq, a delicate balance of power took shape among the region’s key players. Turkey threw its weight behind the KDP, while Iran lent support to the PUK. Meanwhile, the PKK entrenched itself in the rugged, mountainous terrain along the Turkish-Iraqi border – territory neither the KDP nor the PUK could decisively control. During this period, the PKK forged strategic ties with the PUK, a relationship that shaped the insurgent dynamics of the region for years to come. The PKK has historically moved to exploit local fractures for its own survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-centralisation-dynamics-in-iraq&quot;&gt;Re-centralisation Dynamics in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the unsuccessful independence referendum held in 2017, the KRG has seen its authority weakened by the federal government in Baghdad through political manoeuvres and tools of lawfare, a series of judicial decisions that Iraqi Kurds believe have incrementally eroded the region’s constitutionally mandated autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ankara benefits from closer security cooperation with the KDP, it has simultaneously benefited from the centralising dynamics that have transferred greater control to the central government at the expense of the KRG’s constitutionally mandated autonomy. Iraq continues to be a key foreign policy and security priority for Turkey, as evidenced by a series of high-level meetings in quick succession early this year. On 14 March, the Turkish defence and foreign ministers and the head of the National Intelligence Organisation visited Baghdad. A Turkish diplomatic win came in March ahead of Erdogan’s visit to Iraq on 22 April 2024 – the first in 12 years – when the government of Iraq designated the PKK a “banned” group on Iraqi soil, effectively rendering the activities of the group illegal inside Iraq and clearing the path for Iraqi state forces (in principle, at least) to pursue, prosecute and punish militants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21 July, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani inaugurated a 115-km power transmission line that had been stalled for 20 years, running through the Kisik station west of Mosul to supply the provinces of Nineveh, Salahuddin and Kirkuk with a capacity of 300 megawatts. This dwarfs in comparison to the proposed $20 billion Iraq Development Road project, a landmark network of railways and highways that will alter existing supply chains and link Asia to European markets via Basra and overland via Turkey. The proposed transit route will traverse through Mosul, the outskirts of Kirkuk, areas of Islamic State cell activity as well as PKK presence, and clearing this insurgent-held territory is essential to minimising the chances of disruption or sabotage. The project will not effectively counter growing Iranian hegemony in Iraq. On the contrary, the route will run through territory that is under Iran’s influence, and if Tehran wants to block it, it probably can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK is unsettled by the deepening rapprochement between its adversary and the Iraqi government, and for good reason. Northern Iraq has long served as a strategic haven for the group, providing a safe zone for its leadership, military assets, and logistical networks. Any disruption to this sanctuary would have cascading effects across the PKK’s operations, both in Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-role&quot;&gt;Iran’s Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq has become even more critical for Iran against the backdrop of the Gaza war. Iraq is a critical node in the highly networked supply chains of logistical and financial support that feed not only the militia there, but also Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and militias in Syria. Iraqi Kurdistan is important for Iran as it seeks to limit the activities of armed Iranian Kurdish groups such as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komeleh and the Free Life Party, consolidate its influence over the country, and apply pressure on Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KDP accuses the PUK of engaging in opaque relations with Baghdad, Tehran and Shiite groups, as worries mount that the increasing influence of the PUK may result in a growing Iranian dominance over the KRG. The KDP initially attempted to counterbalance the alliance between the PUK and Iran-linked Shiite groups by converging with Sunni Arab factions and Muqtada al-Sadr, but this failed as Iran successfully downgraded al-Sadr’s influence and divided the Sunni Arab coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Instability in the Kurdistan Region, and increased Iranian infiltration, does not bode well for wider Western interests in the Middle East&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 15 January 2024, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have targeted an Israeli “espionage headquarters” near the US consulate in Erbil, with Iran-backed Iraqi militias having made similar claims following strikes conducted in December 2023. Iranian sources claimed the attacks were in retaliation for Israel’s role in targeting commanders of the “Axis of Resistance”. Four were killed, including a prominent Iraqi Kurdish businessman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he has consolidated his leadership over the PUK, Bafel Talabani has grown closer to Iran. But he is not alone. In early May, President of the Kurdistan Region Nechirvan Barzani paid an official visit to Tehran, in an attempt to recover from the January strikes and to balance interests between Turkey and Iran. Shortly after his return, the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court issued a ruling that favoured Masrour Barzani’s formal objection to the election law that altered the distribution of seats and the minority quota in the Kurdish parliament. The KDP will be cautious about confronting Iran-linked militia because the stakes are so high. Antagonising Iran may lead to unforeseen circumstances that will work against its claim to ensure stability as the governing party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, three Iranian Kurdish armed groups under the “Komeleh” umbrella were relocated to a “less accessible” camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, restricting their activities, logistical access to weapons and supplies. This stems from a security agreement between Baghdad and Tehran signed in March 2023 that saw Iraqi Kurds push several armed factions away from the Iranian border in order to comply with Tehran’s demands. In July, Nechirvan Barzani attended the inauguration ceremony of President Pezeshkian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These overtures seem to have paid off. On 12 September, Pezeshkian visited Erbil (after touching down in Baghdad) on his first overseas visit since taking office, showcasing the level of priority given to a neighbour that Tehran wields significant influence over and extracts considerable value from. Pezeshkian also visited Sulaymaniyah, effectively acknowledging that the Kurdistan Region has two centres of authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the region’s parliamentary elections, which look to be finally going ahead on 20 October, will impact these dynamics. If the KRG is fragmented further, or the results are disputed by either of the major parties leading to instability, this will impact the federal balance of power in Iraq, as well as complicate US and allied interests in the region. Ankara may opt to take steps to prevent the KDP from falling under Iranian control, a scenario that would curtail the manoeuvrability of Turkey’s counterterrorism operations. One possibility would be supporting the KDP to strengthen the local economy in order to stem popular discontent, which may include building momentum towards finally reopening the oil pipeline to Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As US forces prepare to withdraw from Iraq, the scramble to fill the inevitable void has long been underway. The increased activity of local and regional actors needs to be read within the context of a future US withdrawal, or rather, drawdown. Instability in the Kurdistan Region, and increased Iranian infiltration, does not bode well for wider Western interests in the Middle East, especially given the current fragility in the region. Curtailing Iranian influence is a persistent concern, which is ever more pressing – and simultaneously difficult – given Tehran’s deeply embedded networks and vested interests across the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the 2019 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly could not resist taking the mickey out of her UK counterpart. She boasted that she had gone to the high-level defence ministerial forum with her entourage, plus a carrier strike group (CSG) comprising the Charles de Gaulle carrier, escorted by destroyers, tankers, Rafale fighters and helicopters. The UK, she said with a mischievous grin, “would be kind enough not to reciprocate”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parly’s dig at the UK might have been light-hearted, but the issue of European deployments and engagement in the broader Indo-Pacific is serious business, given the growing geopolitical weight of the region. Consider the numbers: the region includes five of the world’s biggest-spending military powers (China, India, Japan, Russia and the US); four formidable democratic powers (the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue); three powers in an extensive trilateral arrangement (Australia, the UK and the US); two of the biggest global powers (China and the US); and a dynamic regional institution (ASEAN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, many key European powers - such as France, Germany and the EU - have tabled elaborate documents detailing their plans for the Indo-Pacific, and in particular, Southeast Asia. But to many Southeast Asian observers concerned about delicate regional hotspots – such as the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and the Taiwan Strait – the key question is how much military power European countries can bring to bear to bolster deterrence and regional stability. Ultimately, these Indo-Pacific strategies must be complemented by tangible exercises of hard power, particularly given the tough regional environment. As the oft-quoted retort by Stalin goes: “How many divisions does the Pope have?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To their credit, countries like Germany and France have stepped up. The former will send its latest F125-class frigate with a support ship to the region this year (in addition to deployments by the Air Force). As for the latter, French Rafales deployed on the Charles De Gaulle conducted a power projection exercise from the Indian Ocean to Singapore in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, however, the new UK government appears to be lagging in the stakes. It has been two months since Labour became the governing party in the UK, and all signs point to a desire to strengthen relationships across the Atlantic and the English Channel at the expense of the Indo-Pacific region. In his first international visit since taking office, Prime Minister Keir Starmer jetted off to Washington to participate in a NATO summit. He followed this up by hosting the fourth summit of the European Political Community, making good on his campaign promise to forge a stronger relationship with European allies and maintain an “unshakable” commitment to NATO. Following his lead, Chancellor Rachel Reeves also visited New York and Toronto in a bid to shore up investment in key sectors of the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, the new UK government has kept relatively mum on its approach to the Indo-Pacific. There have been some suggestions that Labour will conduct a “full audit” of London’s relations with China, as it puts its “three C’s” approach – “challenge, compete and cooperate” – towards Beijing into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, there has been an emphasis on the need for “progressive realism” – using realist methods to prosecute progressive ends – since before the general election. John Healey, the new defence secretary, has already given a big hint as to London’s overall policy direction. Under Labour, he said in an interview last year, London will remain a staunch ally of Australia and New Zealand. But the UK cannot be a “strong military force in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic simultaneously”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any form of retrenchment from the Indo-Pacific – and in particular, ASEAN – would be detrimental to the UK’s long-term interests in the region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reasonable grounds for such an approach. The UK’s defence budget is stretched. The previous Conservative government sought to raise the UK’s defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% in the long term, but this was conditioned on favourable “fiscal and economic circumstances”. Labour has stated the same aspiration, but contingent on a review of defence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Reeves has made clear that the new government has inherited a £22 billion budgetary hole from the previous Tory government, leaving Westminster with “difficult decisions” to make and portending the need for further spending cuts. Speaking to the Financial Times in July, a senior MoD official said that the UK armed forces could not defend the “British homelands properly”, let alone fight in a “conflict of any scale”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also focused on shoring up Ukraine in the latter’s war with Russia, and on its participation in NATO and European security, particularly with the possibility of a second Trump administration come January 2025. This is true to form for Labour, which has traditionally been an Atlanticist party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, any form of retrenchment from the Indo-Pacific – and in particular, ASEAN – would be detrimental to the UK’s long-term interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has long-standing interests in the region, as highlighted by its “Refresh” of its 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy in 2023. The Refresh doubled down on the UK’s so-called “tilt” towards the Indo-Pacific. In 2021, the UK secured a dialogue partnership with ASEAN. Two years later, it signed the accession protocol to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has also committed itself to AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership with Australia and the US. This will see the forward deployment of a UK Astute-class submarine in Western Australia later this decade. Likewise, the UK is part of the Global Combat Air Programme with Japan and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the UK also remains engaged with regional partners through combined military exercises. In 2023, the UK expanded its annual combined exercise with Tokyo, Exercise Vigilant Isles, marking the “first time British troops have been embedded with their Japanese counterparts”. London also routinely deploys its troops to Australian exercises, such as Exercise Talisman Sabre and Exercise Pitch Black. Moreover, the UK has committed forces to combined exercises with Washington, most notably the deployment of the RAF’s Atlas A400M transport aircraft under the US-led Exercise Mobility Guardian in Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following its withdrawal from east of Suez in 1967, the UK retained a security footprint in the region with the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). It has detachments in Singapore and Brunei and maintains two forward-deployed offshore patrol vessels in the region. As part of the FPDA, the UK also engages annually with Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia through Exercise Bersama Lima and Exercise Bersama Shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the UK was ranked among the major powers as the sixth most strategically relevant to ASEAN in ISEAS’s 2024 State of Southeast Asia Survey, just above Australia (to much consternation in Canberra, which considers itself to be far more involved in Southeast Asia and the wider region than London).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the new UK government cannot argue that more pressing concerns in the Atlantic and Europe should lead to reduced commitments in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida put this across well when he said that “Ukraine may be the East Asia of tomorrow”. That is, conflicts on the western end of Eurasia could come home to roost in the eastern part, and vice versa. Indeed, the aforementioned IISS report suggests that major EU member states, such as Germany, France and Italy, recognise this interconnectedness and have been stepping up their engagement in the Indo-Pacific (albeit in a piecemeal fashion), even as the bloc makes steady progress towards its commitment of spending at least 2% of its GDP on defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, given Labour’s fiscal constraints and the urgent need to reinvigorate growth in the UK economy, what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, the UK should continue to ask for a seat at the table at the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus and the East Asia Summit, building on the momentum of its conferment as an ASEAN dialogue partner in 2021. Participating in ASEAN-led platforms is no panacea, but it would give London access to established regional networks while also signalling the UK’s support for the (much-vaunted) centrality of ASEAN at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the sheer importance of the Indo-Pacific to the UK’s national interests behooves it to lean more towards the region rather than turn away&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a step in the right direction, the UK also announced in early August 2024 that it would deploy a CSG to the Indo-Pacific in 2025. To be led by the HMS Prince of Wales carrier, the group would include Royal Navy escorts and aircraft, and be bolstered by two ships, including a frigate, from Norway. This CSG would train with the navies of the US and Japan – two powers that are key members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which seeks to manage the challenge posed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Southeast Asian countries remain wary about assertive Chinese actions in the South China Sea, the UK could also participate in so-called “Quad-lite” exercises (working with Quad countries, without the “Quad” brand) with like-minded Southeast Asian states, demonstrating the active presence of other powers in the region. A good example would be Super Garuda Shield 2023, which involved six participating contingents (including from Indonesia, the US, Japan and the UK) and nine observer countries. The exercise last year was timely given Indonesia and China’s standoffs in disputed waters off the Natuna islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the UK should provide assistance to countries that are seeking to build their own capacities to defend the existing rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cost-effective option would be a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) with the Philippines, which is at the forefront of the South China Sea dispute with China. This is not a bridge too far: the UK has signed a similar RAA with Japan, while Tokyo inked an RAA with Manila on 8 July this year and a similar agreement with Australia in 2022. The Japan–UK RAA would also allow the UK to generate significant bang for its buck, as the agreement would not require it to maintain a permanent deployment of troops, and would allow for greater flexibility in the conduct of joint training and exercises. In fact, the latter are key to upholding regional stability, as Japan and the UK can plan for “complex military exercises and deployments” in their own territories as well as the wider Indo-Pacific (most likely with like-minded countries such as Australia, the Philippines and the US).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a leaf from Japan’s playbook, London should also consider augmenting its existing training with coastguards in Asia by providing coastguard ships to countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines. Labour has previously expressed its desire to “restore the UK’s leadership in international development” by reversing the Tory government’s decision to reduce the Overseas Development Assistance budget, and it could explore an arrangement akin to Tokyo’s Official Security Assistance to beef up the capabilities of regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a UK military contribution to a Taiwan Strait contingency are low. But it is likely that the US would value the deployment of UK forces already in the region. According to another IISS report, Whitehall should at least consider some forward planning as to the likely assets that it could bring to the region in the event of a conflagration in the Taiwan Strait, be it a naval task group or a brigade-sized land force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that any major power’s regional engagement is contingent on whether it serves the national interest and is sustainable. London’s historic withdrawal from “east of Suez” in 1967 served its interests at the time, given the dire financial straits it was in and its inclination to reduce its global military footprint. Today, the obverse is true: to be a power of consequence, it needs to be present in strength in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, the sheer importance of the Indo-Pacific to the UK’s national interests behooves it to lean more towards the dynamic region rather than turn away.&lt;/p&gt;

Some LAC countries are benefitting from increased access to low-cost, high-quality electric vehicles (EVs) and new investment throughout the value chain from China that can help meet governments’ climate and economic objectives.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;However, this comes with risks, as dependencies on Beijing may be exacerbated at a time when China’s economy is underperforming and geopolitical competition with the United States is on the rise. Washington should find new ways to engage with the region to find solutions that address local demands and simultaneously mitigate U.S. geopolitical risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s external economic engagement is evolving rapidly and is reshaping its relationship with countries in the developing world, including in LAC. Beijing’s continued commitment to industrial policy is causing increasing tensions with countries concerned about overcapacity and a second “China shock.” However, China’s growing exports and nascent overseas production of high-tech green products such as EVs are changing the country’s offerings to regions such as LAC, which exports many critical raw materials, desires more value-added manufacturing investment, seeks to address climate change, and imports an increasing number of vehicles from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing tensions between the United States and China have raised concerns globally, but some countries in LAC see great power competition as an opportunity to position themselves as new nodes in this evolving trade and investment environment. Given LAC’s growing importance to the economic security strategy of the United States, the changing relationship of the region with China is worth analyzing more closely — especially with respect to the EV supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s high-profile Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has shaped its relations with the LAC region for much of the last decade, but this is rapidly changing as the number of new Chinese-backed large-scale infrastructure projects declines. Instead, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) is becoming more common in the region. Although China’s investments remain concentrated in the mining segment of the supply chain, there are signs of increasing interest from Chinese firms to expand their international presence in refining, assembly, and manufacturing, particularly in the EV supply chain. If this trend holds, it would represent a significant shift in Beijing’s offerings to potential partners in the developing world. Crucially for LAC, this would allow China to answer a growing regional call for investment in higher-value segments of the local supply chain while also helping meet governments’ climate goals. LAC is increasingly a market for Chinese EVs as well, and although much smaller than Europe and Asia, it is growing quickly (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ETNz0B0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Chinese EV Exports by Region&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why Chinese firms are considering investments beyond mining in LAC, and why the EV industry appears to be at the forefront of this trend. China’s slowing economy and high levels of competition are encouraging companies to seek new markets. This is particularly evident in the automotive industry, which has received significant state support over the years. Because economies of scale and acquiring more data are crucial to the innovation process and cost competitiveness in the EV industry, companies have a strong incentive to seek new customers globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Chinese companies have been focusing more on developing markets, in part due to partial or complete closures of larger automotive markets such as Europe and the United States through tariffs. However, many emerging economies have their own industrial ambitions in this space. Take Brazil, which became a top importer of Chinese EVs before President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s second tranche of tariffs came into force in the summer of 2024 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m2DrrPf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Chinese Exports of EVs to Select Latin American Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula’s government has also enthusiastically welcomed BYD — China’s and the world’s leading EV manufacturer — which is taking over an old Ford plant to build EVs in the country. This is one of three Chinese automotive companies with plans to make EVs in Brazil. Greater investment on the ground in LAC could allow Chinese firms to meet the region’s growing need for affordable EVs while also boosting the local economy through value-added manufacturing, especially if local workers are employed. It would also integrate the region further with China, both economically and technologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important driver is derisking policies in the United States itself. To comply with requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to avoid tariffs, for example, Chinese companies have been exploring opportunities to expand assembly and manufacturing in third countries, including in the LAC region. Indeed, the United States and other developed countries are putting in place incentives and restrictions that aim to onshore supply chains and direct companies to invest outside of China — especially in places closer to home, such as LAC. The IRA, with its EV tax credit requirements, represents one of the most ambitious policies so far when it comes to redirecting investment in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this paper will proceed by offering an overview of Chinese firms’ involvement in various segments of the EV supply chain in LAC and the implications for U.S. strategy. Although the value chain can be quite complex (see Figure 3), this paper will focus on key minerals (i.e., lithium and copper), the production of battery cells and packs, and vehicle assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BBKTCeo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mining&quot;&gt;Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining industry in LAC has attracted international attention as governments seek to transition to green technologies, which require critical minerals such as lithium, found in large quantities in the region. China is ahead of its competitors in forging partnerships and catalyzing investment in LAC’s minerals space for use in the energy transition. China maintains outsized control over the mining of several critical minerals used in EV battery manufacturing, such as lithium and copper (see Figure 4). It does so by investing in complete acquisitions of local mines, purchasing significant shares in Western mining companies, and partnering with local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ebYHyN4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Chinese Investment in Lithium Mining and Refining in LAC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lithium&quot;&gt;Lithium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of lithium carbonate, the key compound used in EV batteries, has increased tremendously in the last decade. While Australia is currently the world’s largest lithium producer, LAC is home to the renowned lithium triangle — comprised of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile — which is estimated to hold around 58 percent of the world’s lithium reserves. These countries have become major exporters of the mineral to China (see Figure 5). However, lack of infrastructure, weak institutions, and water crises are only a few of the challenges the region faces as it seeks to turn its lithium mining potential into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PzQ4mXU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: China’s Imports of Lithium Carbonate from Chile and Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, Bolivia has the world’s largest reserves of lithium, at 23 million tons, followed by Argentina (22 million tons) and Chile (11 million tons). But Bolivia’s efforts to capitalize on its resources remain mired in domestic politics — namely its effort to nationalize lithium starting in 2008 and the tight political control over the resource since exercised by the state-owned company YLB. In February 2019, President Evo Morales announced that his country would partner with China’s Xinjiang TBEA Group to advance the industrialization of the Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats. This agreement eventually fell apart, however, due to the political turmoil caused by Morales’s election theft and subsequent flight from the country. The latest attempt to advance Bolivia’s lithium production came in June 2023 with the announcement of a $1.4 billion partnership with a consortium led by battery giant CATL to develop two lithium projects in the Uyuni and Coipasa salt flats. It remains to be seen if this venture will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina has positioned itself ahead of Bolivia by retaining business-friendly policies that have attracted investment in its lithium mining sector. These policies have propelled Argentina to become the fourth-largest producer of lithium in the world — after Australia, Chile, and China — generating around 5 percent of the world’s supply at three mines in the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, and Catamarca. According to some estimates, Argentina could overtake Chile as the largest producer in the lithium triangle by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s mining laws and regulatory landscape make it a more attractive partner. While the Bolivian government maintains full control of mining operations in its territory, Argentina’s laws allow local provinces to negotiate mining agreements directly with the private sector and limit royalties owed to the provinces to 3 percent. These benefits, and the ability of foreign companies to buy and operate mines, have allowed Chinese mining companies to acquire lithium mining operations and buy a significant percentage of the shares of other lithium mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Argentine government, there are currently 49 new lithium mining projects under development in the country’s northeast, seven of which are being developed by China. Of the seven lithium projects owned or partially owned by China, the Caucharí-Olaroz project has started production of lithium carbonate and the Mariana project has begun operations and is expected to begin production soon. The rest of the projects are in different stages of development, with two in the construction phase, two in the feasibility stage, and one in advanced exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile is currently the top lithium producer in South America and the second-largest producer in the world, though this position may soon be overtaken by Argentina. In 2022, Chile produced about one-third of the world’s lithium and accounted for 89.5 percent of China’s total lithium carbonate imports, making it a key player in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until last year, Chile’s relatively open business environment attracted companies from the United States, Canada, and key Asian countries such as Japan. However, President Gabriel Boric’s new National Lithium Strategy, a move characterized by some as nationalization, has quickly reshaped the business landscape and may alter investor sentiment. According to the strategy, private sector entities must gradually transfer control of lithium operations to state-owned company Codelco, in what some experts argue is an effort to position Chile higher up the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, lithium extraction in Chile has been in the hands of two private companies, SQM and Albemarle. Albemarle is an American-based company, while SQM is a Chilean company in which China’s Tianqi Lithium has a 22 percent stake. It is unclear whether both SQM and Albemarle will continue their operations in the country past their contracts’ sunset clauses in 2030 and 2043, respectively. Indeed, at the time of writing, Tianqi had initiated an appeal that could slow down SQM’s planned partnership with Codelco. Chinese EV giant BYD was expected to invest $290 million in a new lithium project that combines mining, refining, and a cathode factory, answering Chile’s call for more local investment, but the project was recently reported as being on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges faced by Chinese companies in Chile should be contextualized in the overall strong bilateral economic relationship. Chile was the first country in LAC to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with China, which it did in 2005, a time when China was growing at double-digit rates yearly and rapidly expanding its engagement with the region. Since then, Chile’s trade with China has surpassed its trade with the United States. It remains to be seen if concerns over exposure to Chinese markets and disputes over investments in Chile could lead Santiago to seek a more forceful economic diversification strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Chile’s lithium strategy has created some new challenges for Chinese companies, Mexico’s policies on natural resources over the past few years have shifted the lay of the land for Chinese companies seeking to tap into Mexico’s lithium reserves, estimated at 1.7 million tons. In 2022, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ordered the creation of a state-owned company, LitioMx, which would take over the exploration, exploitation, and refining of lithium in the country. This decree jeopardized major concessions in the state of Sonora given to Bacanora Lithium in 2009, acquired later by Ganfeng, and should they win arbitration, it would cover the largest deposit of lithium identified in Mexico. In June of 2024, Ganfeng filed an arbitration case against Mexico, and although President Lopez Obrador has indicated a desire to find an agreement with the company, the road ahead is one of legal limbo. The incoming president, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, is expected to maintain a similar approach to retaining government control of mineral resources and has been vocal about her desire to expand Mexico’s position as an active player in the EV value chain, including in lithium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;copper&quot;&gt;Copper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not categorized as a critical mineral by the United States until 2023, copper is essential for EV production and is used in components ranging from batteries to wires. This makes LAC a pivotal player, as it produces about 40 percent of the world’s copper and contains the largest deposits of the ore, primarily located in Chile, Peru, and Mexico. China is a leading importer of copper, and its companies have made key investments in LAC to secure access to the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies such as Minmetals (MMG), Guoxin, and Citic are important players in Peru’s mining sector. As a share of Peru’s total copper exports, sales of copper ore and copper concentrate to China have grown from 41 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2022, according to UN Comtrade data. Peru is an important case given its favorable business environment, which enabled Chinese companies to acquire two of the country’s largest copper mines, Las Bambas and Toromocho, though political instability in the country has caused a slowdown in investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Chile is undoubtedly the largest player in the copper industry, which accounts for over half of Chile’s total exports. Copper is a key commodity in the thriving Chile-China economic relationship. In 2022, out of the $22.8 billion in copper ore that Chile exported, $15.6 billion went to China, followed by Japan at $4.0 billion and South Korea at $935 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chile, 72 percent of copper mines are owned and operated by private companies; the other 28 percent are operated by Codelco, the state-owned enterprise, which gives China less latitude to invest in copper mines in the country or to buy them outright. While Chinese-owned firms play a smaller role in Chile than in Peru, China still maintains a strong investment presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, Chinese companies remain important in the Latin American mining industry, but local conditions matter. Resource nationalization and especially political volatility can lead to declining investment overall, as epitomized by Bolivia’s challenges, and could have long-term impacts on the sector. However, tighter controls on the exploitation of natural resources by host governments can be beneficial, among other things, in ensuring more diversified sources of investment and in negotiating greater local benefits. Finally, some countries, such as Bolivia and Mexico, may see Chinese investment as the most realistic pathway to developing domestic resources and tapping into a growing export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refining&quot;&gt;Refining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While investment in mineral extraction is a clear strategic goal, less intuitive are the forces behind a surge in interest in lithium refining in South America. One important driver of this trend is U.S. government policy. Per IRA rules, an EV qualifies for tax incentives if it is assembled in North America and the battery meets a series of requirements regarding mineral sourcing and the ownership of the companies involved throughout its value chain. All of these rules aim to incentivize lower levels of Chinese control over the supply chain and provide incentives for production outside of China. The result has been an immediate interest in countries that have FTAs with the United States (e.g., Chile) and those that may be able to secure sectoral agreements (e.g., Argentina).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the processing of critical minerals is concentrated in China, with some experts estimating that the country refines around 90 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals and 60–70 percent of lithium and cobalt. This has raised global concerns about the potential for disruption, price manipulation, and weaponization of highly concentrated supply chains. China’s 2023 decision to introduce export controls on graphite, germanium, and gallium has further fueled economic security concerns around minerals. Finally, as the United States makes historic investments in the energy transition, policymakers have tried to restrict how much of those financial incentives benefit Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, China’s position as the top smelter and refiner has long gone unchallenged because of the highly polluting and energy-intensive nature of those industries, though recent efforts by China to open new refining capabilities in LAC and Southeast Asia may signal a shift in this trend. In the case of lithium, for example, the raw material must undergo a series of chemical processes to produce lithium carbonate. With current technology, this process is very energy intensive and involves vast amounts of water, which in places such as Chile and Argentina can prove to be a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another driver for Chinese companies to invest in refining capacity in LAC is the policies of countries in the region, most notably Chile. Despite having well-established copper refining operations, Chile’s lithium refining industry is still underdeveloped relative to its mining. With its new strategy, Chile seeks to position itself as the fourth-largest lithium refiner in the world to complement its sizable production of the mineral and, following protests about wealth inequality and development, ensure that more of Chile’s mineral wealth delivers local benefits. In October 2023, President Boric announced an investment of $233 million by Chinese giant Tsingshan Holding Group in Mejillones (located in the Antofagasta region) for a refining plant. Boric and his economic minister linked the deal explicitly to the country’s national strategy, which seeks to facilitate knowledge transfer and generate more value added. The Tsingshan deal followed the now-uncertain commitment by Chinese EV manufacturer BYD to build a refining facility in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium refining is gaining momentum in Argentina as well, with several projects in various stages of development. In 2022, China’s battery giant Gotion High-Tech signed a joint venture agreement with Jujuy’s state-run mining company. Additionally, in 2021, Tsingshan signed a $1.7 billion joint venture with French firm Eramet, aiming to produce 24,000 tons of refined lithium carbonate. Questions remain in Chile and Argentina over the vast water requirements of the industry, which has sparked debates about the long-term viability of their lithium industries. The introduction by Chinese companies of direct lithium extraction technology could ameliorate some of these concerns, though it is liable to raise costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic policies play an important role in attracting investment in segments of the industry with higher value added. Governments are attempting to leverage access to their natural resources (an example set by Indonesia with its rules in the nickel industry) and their commercial links to larger markets such as the United States, as well as potential growth in their own markets. Access to the U.S. market and compliance with IRA tax credit requirements appear to be important factors, especially for Chile, which has an FTA with the United States. (Argentina is hoping for an exception to IRA rules, much like the one granted to Japan and the European Union, in order to qualify for IRA tax credits.) Long-awaited rules by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service — as well as the Department of Energy’s Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rule, which sets ownership standards as low as 25 percent to qualify for tax credits — have raised some challenges for Chinese companies hoping to qualify for tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battery-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Battery Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be nascent signs that Chinese and LAC companies are interested in expanding lithium refining, the Latin American lithium-ion battery industry remains less dynamic. The industry overall is limited to a handful of factories throughout the continent. The only Chinese investment related to battery manufacturing appears to be a BYD plant in Manaus, Brazil, which started production in 2020. It is unclear if the facility can produce battery cells; it appears to be mainly focused on battery pack assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD is largely known for its vehicles, but the company is a leading battery manufacturer and supplies other automakers as well. The Manaus plant, however, appears to be primarily dedicated to producing batteries for BYD buses made at the Campinas plant near São Paulo, which opened in 2015 in southeastern Brazil. This may change as BYD’s new auto factory in Camaçari, in eastern Brazil, comes online in 2025 and increases demand for batteries. BYD also produces solar panels in the country, which are increasingly installed alongside stationary battery storage worldwide. It is not immediately clear if the batteries that support the solar plants are produced by BYD or whether they may be produced locally at the Manaus plant in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD’s battery production in Brazil is likely aimed primarily at fulfilling local demand and supporting the company’s automotive production in the country, which is the largest market in LAC. Indeed, given current transportation costs and the large investments taking place within the United States, it seems unlikely that Chinese-led battery production in Brazil could be aimed at the export market. This is very different from the dynamic observed in refining and mining, where Chinese firms are tapping into LAC natural resources for export to China or are establishing refining facilities to better access markets in third countries such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been at least two other high-profile Chinese battery plant projects that have received news coverage without making any significant progress. Chery, a Chinese automotive manufacturer that is a significant player in the internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV industries, announced a large project in Argentina in early 2023. Although some reports suggest that the proposed manufacturing complex would feature battery manufacturing capacity, this seems unlikely, since the company does not produce its own batteries. Regardless, the project seems to have stalled in the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second project that has failed to come to fruition is a CATL factory in Mexico, first reported in 2022, which could have potentially supplied Tesla’s factory in Texas. However, the plan has been on pause since the fall of 2022 after the IRA was made law. CATL has since pursued a licensing agreement with Ford to make lithium iron phosphate batteries in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CATL’s pivot to the U.S. market reflects a general challenge to building batteries (and EVs) in LAC. The incentives offered by the IRA have led to a surge of investments in the United States by some of the world’s leading battery manufacturers (BYD being a notable exception). The IRA has also helped to drive more refining investment in countries that have FTAs with the United States, including Chile, as well as more manufacturing investment in Mexico, but it has complicated the position of Chinese firms that would otherwise be the biggest players in these sectors. Moreover, given the incentives available in the United States — expected to remain the largest EV market in the Americas for the foreseeable future — there is less reason for battery manufacturers to make investments in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ev-manufacturing-and-assembly&quot;&gt;EV Manufacturing and Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the manufacturing of EVs and their components, two countries stand out: Brazil and Mexico (see Figure 6). This makes sense, as they are the largest markets in LAC, as well as the most sophisticated manufacturing bases — including in the automotive sector. Yet there are significant differences between the two countries and in the types of investments that Chinese firms are making. The biggest variable appears to be Mexico’s special trading relationship with the United States, epitomized by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Indeed, Mexico benefits significantly from the IRA, which allows companies in the country to qualify for the same credits as those making vehicles and batteries in the United States. However, this also means that Mexico has been under pressure to be more cautious in its approach to Chinese investment, as such investment is viewed as a direct pathway to the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gnqgGF8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Chinese Investments in EV Manufacturing in Latin America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these dynamics, there have been no overt investments in Mexico by Chinese EV manufacturers to date, despite significant news coverage. Although BYD has signaled interest in opening a plant in Mexico and is reportedly in discussions with state governments, reports suggest that the project is on pause until at least the outcomes of the 2024 U.S. elections and Mexico’s judicial reforms are known. Similarly, Chery’s subsidiary Jetour announced its interest in investing in a $3 billion facility with a local partner to assemble vehicles, including EVs, in Mexico in 2023, but no progress has been made even in identifying the location. Finally, Foton, a Chinese manufacturer of commercial vehicles that has a plant for ICE vehicles in Mexico, also announced its plans to build an EV factory in the country in 2023. However, no progress has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why announcements may have not led to actual investments is that Mexico City has made clear that it will not offer financial incentives to Chinese firms looking to establish facilities in the country, leaving Chinese firms requesting such incentives from state governments with fewer resources. Additionally, only a few state governments are likely destinations for Chinese auto manufacturers, meaning that only a small subset of states would be likely to receive local benefits in the absence of federal incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with the rapid expansion of Chinese investments in Mexico (most prominently in Nuevo León) in less sensitive sectors that can more easily export products to the United States, including furniture and automotive components. New restrictions on connected vehicles using Chinese software and equipment are expected once the U.S. Department of Commerce completes its security review, likely precluding Chinese companies from exporting to the United States from Mexico. This means that it is increasingly likely that any investments in Mexico by Chinese EV makers would predominantly aim to serve the local market and demand from countries in Central and South America. This is consistent with the strategy pursued in other emerging markets ranging from Thailand to Brazil. Chinese firms may believe that locating themselves in Mexico would allow them to take advantage of its strong automotive manufacturing base and the common language throughout much of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments in Brazil are even more clearly aimed at the domestic and regional markets. In 2023, the Brazilian automotive market reached 2.3 million vehicles, which although by far the largest in South America is much smaller than the 15.5 million sold in the same year in the United States. Yet Brazil’s sizable population — 216 million in 2023, according to the World Bank — makes it a potentially lucrative market as its middle class continues to grow. Most leading automotive companies have an established presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s existing industrial infrastructure, combined with a growing market, has likely been a draw for Chinese firms. Demand for EVs in Brazil has outpaced expectations, surging from 1 percent to almost 5 percent of sales between April 2023 and April 2024. Of the battery electric and plug-in hybrid models sold in the country, the majority are Chinese brands with highly competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great Wall Motor (GWM) took over a Mercedes-Benz plant in Iracemápolis in 2021 and is expected to start production of hybrid models there in 2024. BYD, to great fanfare, began revamping a former Ford factory in Bahia in the same year, part of a large EV manufacturing hub that could help meet President Lula’s green industrial policy objectives. If BYD starts production in 2025 as planned, this would be its third factory in the country, after the Manaus battery facility and the Campinas bus-manufacturing facility. Finally, CAOA Chery, a joint venture between CAOA, a Brazilian company, and Chery, which owns two plants in the country, is reportedly aiming to start production of two EV models in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Brazilian market is potentially attractive, GWM and BYD are likely looking beyond the country’s borders in the long term. Brazil could easily serve as an export hub for the region if demand in LAC countries grows — especially if Chinese manufacturing in Mexico becomes too controversial or does not take off. However, exports to the United States are unlikely at this stage because these factories are not yet operational and will likely be producing vehicles for a different market — at least initially. Regulation of software and data collection capacity through connected vehicles, the subject of an ongoing probe at the U.S. Department of Commerce, may also restrict the ability of Chinese auto manufacturers to export to the United States for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investments in the EV value chain in LAC appear to remain highly concentrated in mining, although more investments are observable in the refining and assembly segments. Market demand, local government policies, and U.S. market access requirements are likely to determine whether investment continues to expand in the industry. Another crucial factor worth watching will be the successes and challenges faced by the Chinese companies that are undertaking these novel types of investments; their experiences will inform decisions by other firms, as well as Beijing’s own strategy of engagement with countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends outlined in this paper suggest that LAC countries may find new opportunities to meet their own development targets and potentially accelerate their transitions to low-emissions transportation sectors. However, for many countries, deepening dependency on China will present risks, especially at a time when the country is unlikely to experience the high growth rates of previous decades. While Chinese investments could offer a welcome path to economic and FDI diversification in some sectors for some countries (e.g., battery and vehicle assembly in Brazil), they may lead to further concentration of critical resources under Chinese-controlled firms in others (e.g., Argentina or Peru). This points to a fragile balance that governments will need to strike to both meet their own goals and maintain a productive relationship with the United States. Indeed, growing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing are unlikely to soften in the short term and could have some negative spillover effects for countries in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is important for U.S. policymakers as they evaluate the risks and opportunities that emerge from China’s engagement with LAC in this space. In many ways, U.S. policy shapes how these investments and supply chains develop. IRA clauses that catalyze investment around the world, including in LAC, can help diversify supply chains and could generate growth in LAC countries. This could help strengthen ties to the United States and should be further explored as a tool that can create mutual benefits with partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, the United States will need to use its political capital carefully. In some situations, Washington may want to discourage specific Chinese investments, should they be a threat to national security. However, encouraging countries to reject Chinese FDI altogether would damage U.S. relationships. This is especially true at a time when the United States is experiencing historic influxes of FDI in the battery and EV industry domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States pursues a policy of limiting Chinese investments that threaten national security, identifying the real risks to U.S. national security in China’s new outbound investment surge will be crucial. What emerges from the case of EV value chains in LAC, for example, is a significant variation in the nature and objectives of the investments, as well as in host countries’ policies to attract investment and manage trade. Although a large number of projects fall under Chinese FDI, their implications and risk levels vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current U.S. economic security strategy is coalescing around the objective of building more resilient and diversified supply chains for critical resources. This points to the importance of tracking Chinese investments in the mining industry in LAC. It is critical to follow which companies are investing where and how those investments fit in the context of the host country, as well as to identify chokepoints and policies that can ameliorate risks. For example, one productive approach could include working with LAC governments to develop policies that ensure more local government control over resources and encourage the cultivation of a diverse set of economic actors. This could include using new technologies to help enforce stricter environmental, social, and governance standards, as well as improving transparency on the part of companies that invest in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC countries could consider new policies that would support their own economic targets as well as U.S. supply chain diversification objectives. For example, they could pursue policies that incentivize Chinese companies to share technology and invest more in value added sectors, such as through joint ventures. Governments could also take more direct action by providing targeted seed funding to universities and companies to encourage them to move up the value chain in key industries. These firms would need markets, and to this end LAC governments could seek reciprocity with China in value-added sectors and diversify exports. Finally, governments should continue to ensure that all investments meet the highest environmental standards. Strong implementation will continue to be important as the mining and refining of critical minerals expands in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturing investment aimed at supplying the non-U.S. market is clearly less of a direct security challenge for the United States, but it may remain a significant challenge for U.S. companies operating in LAC. Mexico’s proximity to the United States puts it in a special position and earns it extra scrutiny. In fact, it is likely that concerns over Chinese investments in Mexican manufacturing will have a deleterious impact on the 2026 USMCA review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LAC manufacturing question points to the bigger issue of U.S. competitiveness. Although Chinese firms in the EV and battery space have benefitted and continue to benefit from large state subsidies, they have also reshaped the automotive industry and raised the bar significantly in terms of performance and affordability for EVs — with affordability often being the decisive sales factor in developing regions such as LAC. An affirmative strategy to incentivize U.S. companies to produce better products for non-U.S. markets would likely have better long-term results than solely focusing on market protection tools. Indeed, competition with Chinese companies may in some cases help U.S. firms engage with cutting-edge technology and improve their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this study has limited itself to analyzing investments in the EV manufacturing value chain, two connected industries will likely become more important in the coming years as EV adoption grows in LAC: (1) software and data managements, and (2) EV charging. Software and data management is an area where more cooperation with places such as the United States, which is hampered by the lack of comprehensive national regulation, and the European Union, which has one of the most developed data protection regimes globally, would be beneficial for LAC stakeholders. Concerns over connected vehicles powered by Chinese software are increasing, and more research would be beneficial to evaluate risks and technical solutions. Without a concerted effort on software and data management issues, Chinese firms could continue to dominate in those industries as they do in LAC’s digital infrastructure and information and communications technology networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of EV charging, Chinese state-owned companies control significant electricity transmission infrastructure in Peru and Brazil. The increased demand for electric charging infrastructure may provide more opportunities for Chinese companies, which could benefit from significant vertical integration despite the existence of strong international competitors. In this sector, as in the others analyzed, the United States would benefit from careful analysis of real risks and alternative pathways to encourage more diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

China’s strategy does not seek to replace the United States in the Middle East, push it out, or outcompete it. Instead, China is working to untie the Middle East from the United States and to make the region and the world more receptive to China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating back to the early Cold War and continuing since, the United States has worked to encourage the growth of free and open societies in the Middle East and around the world. An important part of China’s Middle East strategy is encouraging appreciation that China’s decades of remarkable economic growth, as well as its global rise, occurred under the firm guidance of the Chinese Communist Party. Whereas the United States explicitly encourages imitation among allies — and, in the eyes of many countries, social and political instability — China seeks to legitimize the idea that there are myriad pathways to prosperity and security. China’s Middle East outreach efforts proclaim its noninterference in domestic affairs and a focus on mutually beneficial economic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern states seeking leverage with the United States have seized on the idea of a China model. In part, this is to legitimize their own resistance to U.S. calls for domestic liberalization. But equally importantly, expressing openness to engagement with China on looser Chinese terms puts them “in play” and allows them to demand more from the United States. Even close partners of the United States, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have expressed interest in drawing closer to China. Their interest is in part due to China’s rising global influence, but it also reflects a desire to blunt what they see as U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, increased Middle Eastern interest in a China model specifically, and closer ties to China more generally, calls for a three-pronged effort. The first prong is largely internal and requires clarifying U.S. priorities in the Middle East and the role the United States seeks to play. As part of this, the United States should consolidate its 20-year effort to transition from security provider to security partner. The second prong is gaining a better understanding of regional governments’ concerns and motivations. The United States needs to tailor U.S. engagement more closely to regional governments’ needs, and it needs to untangle slow bureaucratic processes that make sense to Americans but not to those they seek to help. The third prong is to get better at imposing consequences for bad behavior and incentivizing good behavior, for allies and adversaries alike. Doing so would inject dynamism into U.S. regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Middle East looks forward, the region’s urgent strategic need is to grow its human capital. This is necessitated both by the rising number of young people seeking employment and the implications of the energy transition. The U.S. ability to contribute to regional governments’ efforts to address this need — in terms of education, training, and a business climate that helps build capacity — is unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will continue to seek to increase its role in the Middle East. The United States should not fear China’s presence. Rather, the United States needs to sharpen regional understandings of the value of U.S. partnerships, lower the costs of maintaining them, and clarify the consequences of undermining them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Saudi horsemen bearing Chinese and Saudi flags surrounded Chinese president Xi Jinping’s limousine as it entered the lush gardens of Riyadh’s Yamama Palace in December 2022. The disparity between the honor guard in brilliant white robes astride stallions and the sleek black limousine gliding on a spotless stone pavement was striking, but this is the image the Saudis seek to project to the world: simultaneously traditional and modern, powerful, hospitable, and very much in control. Cameras captured Xi’s arrival from the side, the front, and overhead, ensuring full appreciation of the majesty of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s visit was a marked contrast to President Joe Biden’s visit to Jiddah the previous July. Biden’s arrival was captured in a carefully scripted fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A single official Saudi photographer captured the moment, and a single image was released. Although the crown prince normally beams when photographed greeting guests, his expression in this photo was almost blank, perhaps through prearrangement. The fist bump, ostensibly a Covid-19 precaution, became the shorthand for the visit. One could say it was warm, one could say it was contrived, but there was one thing it clearly was not: normal. The White House had such an aversion to the idea that Biden would be photographed shaking the beaming crown prince’s hand that it seems to have carefully negotiated an alternative. In doing so, the U.S. government created an indelible image of the strained and shifting U.S.-Saudi relationship and paved the way for a sharply contrasting visit by a Chinese head of state six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are accustomed to occupying a position of primacy in the world, and particularly in the Middle East. This is derived partly from a conviction that the whole world wants to be like the United States. Centuries of immigration to North America from every corner of the globe have persuaded many Americans of the enduring attractiveness of U.S. society, as well as its universal adaptability to peoples and cultures. Spreading what many Americans saw as the blessings of freedom and prosperity across the North American continent was a key U.S. government priority until the end of the nineteenth century; for much of the twentieth century, countless U.S. officials maintained an equally sharp focus on sharing what they saw as the gifts of the American way of life with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many foreign governments, and especially those in the Middle East, have deep reservations about becoming too much like the United States. They see the U.S. path as one that threatens their culture and history, risks wrapping them in chaos and failure, and jeopardizes their power at home and abroad. For some of them, China represents an exemplar of a society that has remained true to its roots, nurtured a vibrant economy, managed social change, and maintained tight political control, all by following a path very different from the U.S. one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four decades of the Cold War conditioned the United States to treat admiration as a zero-sum game, and capturing the imagination of governments and societies as they think about their future has been an important aspect of U.S. soft power for much of the last hundred years. As Joseph Nye wrote in his seminal essay on the topic in 1990:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A state may achieve the outcomes it prefers in world politics because other states want to follow it. . . . This second aspect of power — which occurs when one country gets other countries to want what it wants — might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has increased its own soft-power efforts, intended at least in part to dent what Chinese officials see as U.S. hegemony. While China has generally not promoted a discrete “China model” for other states to emulate, there has been a substantial, albeit superficial conversation in Middle Eastern states about what lessons China’s experience holds for their development. While China is not necessarily provoking this conversation, it is nurturing it. This conversation has geopolitical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do countries such as China and the United States use the power of example to engage in competition and advance their interests in the Middle East? How do Arab governments view U.S. and Chinese attempts at influence and models of development, and why is there a greater affinity toward a China model in the region? Given the above, and China’s increasing influence in the region, what are the policy implications for the U.S. position and for U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing these questions, this paper explores the popular discussion of a China model in the Middle East, as well as how Arab governments and the Chinese government use the idea of a China model to push back on what each sees as the excesses of the U.S. government. These countries’ interests are not identical, but they are congruent. Arab states are seeking to maximize the value they derive from the sum of their varied diplomatic relationships, increasingly pursuing cooperation in parallel with global powers rather than joining one discrete bloc or another. They also seek to maintain control over their domestic environments, blocking social trends and political movements that they believe will undermine their stability. Deeper engagement with the Chinese government, and the Chinese example itself, advances their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s interests are more complicated. The country’s economic growth depends on imported energy. About half of that imported energy comes from the Middle East, where the United States is the predominant power. Beijing is wary of conflict with the United States in the Middle East, and it seeks neither to compete head-to-head nor to displace Washington. Instead, China seeks to make inroads into the region without either getting bogged down or tipping the Middle East into instability. Doing so means enticing countries currently aligned with the United States to adopt a more unaligned posture, and it often uses state-directed economic engagement as its calling card. The Chinese government explicitly contrasts itself with the U.S. government, noting that it can move more quickly and predictably, that it neither second-guesses nor lectures its partners, and that its goal is not to remake them in China’s own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle for much of this is the impression — probably stronger in the Middle East than in China itself — that there is a tangible China model that can guide radical economic transformation without accompanying social and political disruption. The “China experience,” as some Chinese prefer to call it, is an impressive one: decades of double-digit growth accompanied by huge investments in industrialization and massive internal migration. Even so, most Arab understandings of China remain remarkably superficial. Arab states impressed with China’s remarkable rise often seem more interested in China’s outcomes than the path China took to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what this means for U.S. interests, this paper analyzes how the Chinese and Arab governments each use the inchoate idea of a China model as a key tool through which they advance their own interests vis-à-vis the U.S. government. This study is especially salient now. Middle Eastern states are uniquely focused on how the energy transition will force a profound change in the region’s political economy in the next three decades. With so many Middle Eastern economies tied to hydrocarbons — either producing them or relying on worker remittances, investment, and government assistance from energy-producing countries — regional governments are especially open to exploring alternative models of development. The Arab uprisings of 2010–11 gave governments an experience of political discontent boiling over. China is still largely able to project an image of strong economic growth and political stability. Many Arab states are urgently seeking to diversify their economies while sustaining the prevailing political and social order. For them, China’s example suggests an enticing set of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, which has been the preponderant global power in the Middle East for more than a half-century, the Middle East’s rising fascination with the China model is an important phenomenon. In part, this is because the United States retains a vital strategic interest in the Middle East deriving from the region’s roles in global energy markets, in the global economy more broadly, and in global nonproliferation efforts. Middle Eastern states’ use of the idea of a China model to develop leverage against — and potentially undermine — U.S. policies toward the region creates a need for a thoughtful U.S. policy response. In addition, because China-U.S. competition has become the overwhelming strategic focus in the United States, China’s instrumentalization of Middle Eastern states’ admiration to advance its own policy interests at the expense of the United States becomes an issue of strategic concern with bearing on U.S. interests in Africa, Latin America, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this paper demonstrates how Arab governments and China converge on the idea that there are ways to achieve U.S.-style economic performance without embracing liberal societies. It does not seek to evaluate whether such approaches are viable or if the plans that governments carry out hew more closely to U.S. or Chinese development models, in part because China itself seems not to care. But it is also because Middle Eastern governments themselves are seeking to strike a balance between multiple imperatives rather than make a binary decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper will proceed as follows. First, it begins by reviewing how states that have seen themselves on the brink of change think of different models of development. It further explores how the U.S. and Chinese governments have thought about their own development experiences, what parts of that they believe are relevant to other countries, and how they have sought to share their lessons. Second, this paper examines the broader context of U.S.-Chinese competition, and how that competition has manifested in the Middle East, paying close attention to both countries’ perceived stakes in the patterns of governance in Middle Eastern states. In particular, this section carefully explores China’s efforts to engage broadly with three states:Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries are of varying size, have different political economies, and have had different trajectories. All of them are important to both the United States and China. The section analyzes how these major Arab states perceive both China’s actions and China’s lessons for their own societies. Finally, the essay concludes with the implications of its findings and recommendations for U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competing-and-contested-development-models&quot;&gt;Competing and Contested Development Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspirational power of the American experiment has been a thread running through much of U.S. history, but it is only in the last three-quarters of a century that Americans have drawn a clear and consistent connection between spreading that model and advancing U.S. national interests. China has had a relatively more complicated task in the last 35 years. It has sought to navigate between advancing its interests in the globalized world that the United States and its partners constructed while ensuring that its engagement in that world does not advantage the United States at China’s expense. China’s breathtaking economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s involved its partial adoption of Western mores. At the same time, it involved an assertion of China’s distinctiveness. China’s success in doing both simultaneously has had more benefits for China than one might initially suspect. It has both helped boost international interest in China and encouraged other states to assert their own distinctiveness and reject U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and China are seeking to tap into an enduring trend in the Middle East and around the world. While all governments seek agency over their futures, sometimes governments undergoing especially profound transitions have sought inspiration from external models to help them guide changes more purposively. Faced with innumerable challenges and decisions, foreign expertise has often helped to inform their choices and model their trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broad historical terms, both countries are newcomers to foreign admiration. For governments considering their options in the nineteenth century, neither the United States nor China was of much interest. The United States was too different, inhaling immigrants from much of Europe and conquering its own vast continent. Its proud pioneer culture and robust individualism had no equivalent, and no bearing, on much of the world. China was in the midst of its “century of humiliation,” as the depredations of foreign powers ate away at the withering Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was a European model of development, manifested in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by colonial administrations that sought to impose modernity and order on societies while extending investment opportunities for European private capital. They passed laws and created capital markets, and they advanced notions of citizenship that gave rights to local inhabitants even as they often gave superior rights to citizens of the metropole. European colonial powers fostered coteries of elite clients in their colonies, but for ambitious local governments, it seemed perilous to get too close to the colonial enterprise. The danger of being swallowed up in the European imperial maw always lurked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, Prussia seemed much more relevant, and it seemed to be a power on the march. For example, as Meiji Japan watched Western countries capitalize on China’s relative weakness, Japanese officials sought to replicate the Prussian experiment with great urgency. More than 50 years ago, Barrington Moore argued that similarities between imperial Germany and Meiji Japan were, in the words of Mark R. Thompson, “the product of political learning. Meiji Japanese reformers, after carefully examining several Western countries’ political systems, chose the German model because of its illiberal but modern politics.” In this reading, Japan’s leaders explicitly chose a German development model, with economic, political, and military implications for Japan and for the world in the century to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s modernization project also cast a wary eye on development models that sought to engender liberal systems. Many recall Ataturk’s zeal for Westernization — he famously adopted the Latin alphabet, banned the fez, emancipated women, and put secularism at the center of politics. Yet despite adopting superficial aspects of Western style, it was the Soviet experiment in state-driven industrialization that seemed genuinely enticing to him and his circle. The Soviet model not only promised rapid results while reinforcing state power, but it also presented an opportunity to “overturn Western economic and political dominance,” which had been an Ottoman sore spot for more than a century. Turkish nationalists did not seek to align with the Western bourgeoisie that had helped dismantle the Ottoman empire; they sought to develop the state so as to give Turkey the strength to be an independent power. The noncommunist aspects of the Soviet model, with its modernization agendas, five-year plans, and skepticism of Western intentions, aligned closely with the new Turkish leadership’s instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of fascism in the interwar period represented a wholesale rejection of the Western liberal development model. Fascists offered the European public a clearly formulated and comprehensive solution to a status quo that was, to some, economically, politically, and socio-culturally unsatisfactory. In the words of Michael Mann, a prominent chronicler, “All of these regimes worshipped order and protected private property; all embraced authoritarian statism, rejecting federalism, democracy, and their supposed ‘vices’: disorderly class conflict, political corruption, and moral decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case noted above — Meiji Japan, Ataturk’s Turkey, and fascist Germany and Italy — states sought what they believed to be scientific efficiency, in stark contrast to what they saw as the weak and disorderly approach of liberal democracies. Meiji Japan adopted illiberal Westernization, Turkey sought to adopt more liberal social policies while embracing more authoritarian economic policies, and fascism was largely a rejection of liberalism more broadly. In all cases, ruling elites were unwilling to leave the fate of the nation in the hands of an unruly and self-interested cosmopolitan business class. All of these movements called for a firm hand from the top and limited engagement from below. It is an instinct that is in stark contrast with the U.S. model, and more consonant with a Chinese model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-example-of-social-and-economic-development&quot;&gt;The U.S. Example of Social and Economic Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s Cold War efforts to win hearts and minds throughout the world were an innovation. While priorities shifted from administration to administration, underlying all U.S. efforts was a deep belief in both the desirability and replicability of American patterns of life. Inspired by mostly European philosophers such as John Locke, few Americans have ever doubted the universal relevance of American truths. What was in question, instead, was the level of effort Americans should put into spreading them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the world in the nineteenth century, the United States did not have much inspirational power. This is in part because the U.S. government’s tasks were unique: populating a continent, exploiting seemingly endless natural resources, and capitalizing on the country’s almost complete isolation from potentially hostile powers. But Americans often took their country’s inspirational potential for granted. It is not a coincidence that much of the U.S. engagement with the rest of the world in the nineteenth century was through missionaries and traders, not through diplomats and soldiers. Their “Good News” was only partly religious. Echoing the themes stressed by the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America, many were guided by a broad belief that uniquely American values stressing the importance of individualism, industriousness, property rights, and political expression provided a universal key to both prosperity and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States began to play a more active role in global affairs immediately after World War I, the post-war isolationist current ran strong. The Wilsonian impulse to “make the world safe for democracy” soon ebbed, and U.S. politicians expressed fear that internationalism would merely benefit profiteers at home and draw the United States into endless European conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, after World War II, U.S. officials were convinced that securing the country required blocking Marxist inroads in the developing world and expanding the circle of freedom to reach the billions who lived there. They took their missionary heritage and set out to replicate U.S. conditions abroad, using the U.S. historical experience as their template to use economic and political development to prosecute the Cold War. Drawing on Louis Hartz’s notion of an American liberal tradition, Robert Packenham suggests in his 1973 study that four propositions long guided U.S. policymakers working in the developing world: “1) Change and development are easy 2) All good things go together 3) Radicalism and revolution are bad 4) Distributing power is more important than accumulating power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the anti-colonial sentiments of the Roosevelt administration converged with the anti-communism of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, many believed that the United States was well positioned not only to win the Cold War, but also to eliminate much of the world’s poverty. Commonsense U.S. efforts such as those of the Tennessee Valley Authority and cooperative extension programs were the salve the world needed. Such programs would provide enabling environments for private enterprise rather than an enduring role for repressive governments. Spreading prosperity to long-immiserated populations would do more than merely improve their quality of life. It would also inoculate these populations from the appeal of Soviet communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this U.S. strategy included a heavy dose of self-interest. If foreign elites were enveloped in a warm embrace of shared goals and common interests, they could help lead their states to carry out policies that advance those goals and interests, creating a world more favorable to U.S. priorities. While the U.S. model seeks to be competitive, it does not seek to bolster U.S. dominance to ensure that the United States wins every economic competition. Instead, it seeks to incentivize counterparts to participate in the system compatible with U.S. interests, enable them to compete successfully, and dissuade them from swinging into opposition. It was the manifestation of Nye’s soft power, whereby the United States would encourage other countries to “want what it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, after World War II the United States led the construction of a global system of institutions to regulate and arbitrate between economic interests. The United States broadly advanced a policy that emphasized private enterprise, free markets, open trade, and the integration of national economies into the world economy by emphasizing the comparative advantage of exports. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, multinational corporations, and U.S. government all worked to advance these policies. Embedded in these international institutions was attention to the rights of the individual and adherence to the rule of law. Land reform and community development played a significant role in postwar development efforts, seeking to develop communities of freeholders who could shape their own societies and destinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-so-implicit adversary in this was the Soviet Union, which linked the collapse of colonialism with the end of capitalism. The Soviet model retained a strong Leninist strain, requiring a party to assert a dictatorship of the proletariat to help guide society toward communism and avoiding the rights-driven approach of the United States and its allies. The Soviet Union saw a need to win supporters, though. Seeing similar stakes to the United States, the Soviet Union invested in major international development projects, sometimes at the expense of Moscow’s direct interests. The Soviet Union’s construction of Egypt’s Aswan High Dam was a part of this effort. Picking up a project that the World Bank had abandoned under U.S. pressure, Soviet engineers partnered with Gamal Abdel Nasser in a project to reshape Egyptian agriculture and the whole Egyptian economy. Abdel Nasser’s embrace of “Arab socialism” was not a condition of the dam’s construction, but his increasing alignment with the Soviet Union and increasingly strained relations with the United States represented a victory for Soviet policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-record-in-middle-east-development&quot;&gt;The U.S. Record in Middle East Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of its history, the U.S. government treated the Middle East as an afterthought. The United States mostly forsook the European scramble for influence in the region in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, until the rise of the petroleum age coincided with the decline of European regional power and the rise of Soviet communism. Fearing a vacuum, Americans perceived heightened stakes of projecting U.S. influence into the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the Middle East was not the principal focus of U.S. efforts, nor was the U.S. government’s focus in the Middle East independent from its approach elsewhere in the world. The United States established security relationships with a wide array of regional governments, and it stepped up those efforts when Great Britain pulled back from the region after 1970. The United States also engaged in economic development efforts, limited in most places but significant in some, and especially significantly with Israel and the Arab states that made peace with it. It built educational and cultural ties, as elite Arabs in the 1970s and 1980s eschewed Cairo and sought university educations for their children in Princeton, Cambridge, and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that the United States embraced a Cold War commitment to helping Middle Eastern states develop along U.S. lines, U.S. efforts to promote economic development overseas have yielded mixed results. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has invested more than $30 billion in Egypt since 1978. According to the USAID website, its “Economic Growth” program has sought to “improve the policy and business regulatory environment, stimulate entrepreneurship, strengthen enterprises, improve the workforce, and enhance trade.” As part of its efforts, USAID has also maintained a democracy and governance program in Egypt to promote values of democracy, human rights, and inclusion alongside improvements in economic performance. USAID has sought to increase the accountability and efficiency of public institutions and remove barriers to economic and social participation for marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, after four decades of continuous economic assistance that have made Egypt one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid in the world, the World Bank continues to classify Egypt as a lower-middle-income country. Successive Egyptian governments have regularly rebuffed U.S. efforts to engender a more vibrant private sector and spread democratic values, or they have frustrated them. Egyptian officials have long complained that U.S. aid represents unacceptable meddling in the country’s internal affairs and that economic aid funds ultimately end up lining the pockets of U.S. firms rather than benefitting Egyptians. Democracy and governance programs have been a special sore point. In an extreme instance, an AMIDEAST employee contracted to work on the Administration of Justice Project said that the U.S. and Egyptian governments took a decade merely to agree on a scope of work. In part because of tensions over priorities and implementation, U.S. economic assistance has been diminishing since 1998, from a high of over $800 million annually to current levels of just over $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not been targets of U.S. development assistance in anything like the same way, although the U.S. government provided technical assistance to both countries as their governments sought to create modern institutions for what had until recently been tribal sheikhdoms. The strong involvement of U.S.-based oil companies in the development of the petroleum industry, before and after the nationalization of oil production, helped ensure that both countries’ national economies developed along lines compatible with U.S. interests. U.S. government efforts to promote democracy and governance were often more subtle, in part because of fewer opportunities in the absence of aid vehicles, and in part because both countries are ruled by royal families that consider the prospect of participatory politics with alarm but are keen to pursue a strategic alignment with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-chinese-proposition&quot;&gt;The Chinese Proposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s history differs starkly from that of the United States. Over three millennia the country experienced great power and wealth. The so-called “century of humiliation” that preceded the country’s communist revolution was a reminder of the constant threats that Chinese governments feared looming beyond their borders. The richness of Chinese culture spoke for itself, but China never saw that culture as a universal proposition with much relevance outside of China. China extracted tribute from surrounding states and expanded its continental reach into Central Asia, but as European imperialism spread in the nineteenth century, China saw itself as the victim of global powers rather than their peer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of Mao Zedong’s revolutionaries in 1949 put China in an unaccustomed place, ideologically committed to a political project with global ambitions and presumed universal relevance. China’s actual efforts in that regard were modest, however, and Deng Xiaoping’s effective renunciation of the Marxist-Leninist global project removed an area of conflict with the West. Even more strikingly, Deng’s “four modernizations” — the urgent need for advances in agriculture, industry, national defense, and science — pushed China to open to the outside world while relying on the communist party to insulate the country from the depredations of foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, China’s history has combined with the legacy of Deng’s instincts to prompt the country to be modest in its claims and defensive in its posture. While Chinese “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” under Xi Jinping has been more assertive, in part because it presumes a broader decline in Western power, it generally has been less interested in asserting the wisdom of its model to foreign audiences than in protecting its own legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has engaged increasingly in the Middle East in the last 25 years, it has backed away from Soviet concepts of a zero-sum ideological competition with the United States. Instead, China often has gone out of its way to appear nonthreatening to Middle Eastern states and Western powers alike, advertising its modesty and trumpeting an interest in “win-win solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also avoided being doctrinaire about its approach. In contrast to the Marxist-Leninist tracts of Soviet authors, there is a lively debate within and outside of China about what constitutes a China model for development, or if one exists at all. Western analysts have tended to treat it as an argument for authoritarian-led economic development that is exemplary in its ability to “make large, complex decisions quickly, and to make them relatively well, at least in economic policy.” Although some argue that authoritarian development already had a strong history in Southeast Asia by the time China adopted it after Mao’s death and that Chinese expatriate communities in adjacent countries may have been involved in triggering its execution in China, China’s size and its dramatic pace of growth in the two decades between 1990 and 2010 made it a very different kind of example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, when the Chinese economy was growing most strongly, some of the greatest successes occurred in cities that took very different approaches from each other to economic development. Chongqing’s charismatic communist party secretary pushed an approach that some scholars described as populist and “Maoist-revivalist,” Guandong pursued a policy that seemed largely neoliberal and capitalist, and the Shanghai government seemed largely technocratic and technologically focused. The experimentation that Deng opened in the late 1970s continued to expand for decades in China. Yuen Yuen Ang argues persuasively that the Chinese have pursued varying strategies at different times and places, and she argues that Chinese government policy is best characterized as “directed improvisation.” Whereas Mao pursued ruinous top-down strategies, his successors set dynamic parameters for local officials to follow. They set boundaries, defined criteria for success, and encouraged the flow of industry and capital to less-developed regions. The “China model,” then, can be seen less as a set of processes than as a set of philosophies that produced strong outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s interest, arguably, is less about winning over imitators than it is about gaining legitimacy for its efforts. While Chinese leaders speak openly and repeatedly about a “China solution” (alternately translated as a “China proposal”), Chinese leaders take pains to limit its reach. Xi Jinping told a group of leaders of political parties in 2017, “We do not want to ‘import’ models from other countries, nor do we want to ‘export’ the Chinese model, still less will we ask other countries to copy the Chinese practice.” Noting that China itself adopted communism from overseas, he continued, “As a Chinese saying goes, a stone taken from another mountain may serve as a tool to polish the local jade. The CPC will embrace and approach the achievements of other cultures with an open mind and a broad perspective. We stay committed to engaging in dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with the people and political parties of other countries.” Just as Xi asserted, “We are eager to draw on the achievements of other cultures and apply them in the Chinese context,” implicit in his statement is an invitation to draw on Chinese achievements and apply them in diverse local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in 2017, at a Belt and Road conference, Xi put great emphasis on China’s fundamental belief in mutual benefit. Suggesting that the ancient Silk Road was all about reciprocity, Xi noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese silk, porcelain, lacquerwork and ironware were shipped to the West, while pepper, flax, spices, grape and pomegranate entered China. Through these routes, Buddhism, Islam and Arab astronomy, calendar and medicine found their way to China, while China’s four great inventions [papermaking, printing, gunpowder, and the compass] and silkworm breeding spread to other parts of the world. More importantly, the exchange of goods and know-how spurred new ideas. For example, Buddhism originated in India, blossomed in China and was enriched in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added, for good measure, “We are ready to share practices of development with other countries, but we have no intention to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, export our own social system and model of development, or impose our own will on others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Chinese leadership’s rhetorical approach has been that it merely seeks to inculcate respect for difference. For example, Xi noted in his September 2020 speech to the UN General Assembly, “We should respect a country’s independent choice of development path and model. The world is diverse in nature, and we should turn this diversity into a constant source of inspiration driving human advancement.” Yet, Elizabeth Economy suggests that appeals to tolerate diversity soon yielded to a more pointed strategy. In the period after 2017, she argues, “both in rhetoric and reality, China has become increasingly comfortable in its efforts to export its state-centered political and economic model globally.” Noting that China’s efforts have both defensive and offensive motivations, she argues that China is committed to “supporting the creation of laws and regulations that enhance state control, limit individual freedoms, and favor state-led economic development.” It remains unclear “whether China is acting offensively to forge a more illiberal world or defensively to make the world safe for China’s brand of autocracy.” From the perspective of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East, the difference is not especially relevant. The Chinese approach legitimizes their resistance to calls for democratization and human rights, providing living proof that there are multiple paths to combining economic growth with social peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern assessments of China’s approach have been overwhelmingly positive. Writing in the widely circulated, Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat, a Lebanese professor lamented, “It is our misfortune that we know nothing of China except its products.” She made clear that China has experienced many of the same “declines and failures” as the Arab world, yet Arabs are disinterested in how it has triumphed. After a visit to China, one Arab journalist was smitten: “May God help us for our lack of planning and our inability to see the future, which is either the scourge that hinders the progress of nations, as in our case, or the reason for advancement and progress, which is the Chinese case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s recent soft-power efforts that build on the idea of a China model are distinct from its soft-power efforts in the past. China has maintained bilateral ties with developing countries — and especially with former revolutionary states such as Algeria — for decades. China was the first non-Arab state to recognize Algeria’s National Liberation Front government in 1958 when it was fighting for independence from France, and after independence was won in 1962, China provided a range of material support: wheat, steel, school equipment, a 13,000-ton freighter, and four transport aircraft. China also dispatched a medical team and supplies and extended a low-interest loan. China began sending medical teams to Algeria in 1963 and has sent more than 2,000 in total. China has also sent more than 2,000 medical personnel to Yemen, and 60 Chinese workers lost their lives between 1959 and 1962 building a mountainous road from what is now the Yemeni capital of Sanaa to the port of Hodeidah. All of those efforts were very much on the government-to-government level, reflecting a sensitivity in China — shared in much of the Arab world — toward foreign governments that seek to go over the heads of local governments to speak with their people. Throughout the twentieth century, China was seeking diplomatic recognition and bilateral partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the twenty-first century dawned and China grew more self-confident, its efforts to seduce foreign governments were accompanied by increasingly active efforts to seduce foreign publics. Joseph Fewsmith has argued that Pan Wei at Beijing University sought to popularize the idea of a China model in the early 2000s. Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz argued in 2002 that Arab societies should diversify what they borrow from abroad to include lessons from China, as China’s historical and social traditions more closely resemble the Middle East than the West. An Emirati scholar of China wrote in 2008 that the China model proves “there is another pathway for governments of the world to follow in order to successfully pursue economic growth.” While 500 articles with the phrase China model in the title could be found on the internet in 2007, there were 750 in 2008 and fully 3,000 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proximate cause for the popularization of the idea was the 2007–09 Global Financial Crisis, which Chinese officials saw as an opportunity to stress Chinese resilience. Another was a multi-billion-dollar soft-power push by the Chinese government that followed the Beijing Olympics. As Willy Lam noted, “the Hu leadership is convinced that the sorry state of the American model has thrown into sharp relief the superiority of the Chinese way of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study of China’s soft-power efforts succinctly summarizes the “China brand” in the Middle East as resting on three principles: “1) The nation’s impressive economic rise, 2) China’s interest in becoming an economic rather than security partner to the region, and 3) China’s continued and evolving status as a developing nation, as a peer — rather than a superior — to Middle Eastern nations.” The authors suggest that the goal is not to inspire imitation, but rather to “promote local acceptance of the growing Chinese commercial, diplomatic, and expatriate presence in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, Africa has been on the front line of Chinese efforts to revise their global engagement strategy. Africa is the source of key natural resources necessary for Chinese (and global) economic development, making it a logical focus for Chinese attention. Equally important, Africa has not been a major focus of other great powers’ efforts, giving China a relatively unencumbered path to continental influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African elites have been receptive to China, not entirely because of Chinese efforts, but also out of frustration with a Western focus on human rights, democratization, and governance. For instance, the former president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, started questioning the sincerity of the West and its democracy promotion when the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on the country because of his regime’s human rights abuses. It is only then that he launched the Look East Policy and cultivated stronger diplomatic relations with China. The driving force for Mugabe was the need for an alternative development partner and source for diplomatic support, foreign direct investment, and development financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 McKinsey report noted that Africa-China trade had grown approximately 20 percent per year since 2000 and was almost four times U.S.-Africa trade. Yet, despite the fact that Chinese investment was growing 40 percent year-on-year in the mid-2010s, China’s foreign direct investment in Africa remained less than half that of the United States. Where China excelled was in the financing of African infrastructure. There, China’s 2015 commitments were $21 billion, exceeding the combined total of the African Development Bank, European Commission, European Investment Bank, International Finance Corporation, World Bank, and G8 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach to Africa was broadly consistent with its approach to Asia, which took off after the 2013 announcement of the Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative, which stresses the importance of infrastructure construction and trade, is centered around a wide array of loans to finance work by Chinese companies. Completely enwrapped in Chinese promises of “win-win solutions,” and accompanied by a conviction that Chinese attention would grow, Asian governments — including West Asian governments — were intrigued by the prospects of deep partnership with a rising power. Yet, some of those governments came to decide that the terms of Chinese partnership were badly skewed in China’s favor, requiring the “surrender to Chinese management the entire strategic infrastructure of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the loans plummeted after 2017, both in size and number. According to a project at Boston University, the average Chinese loan commitment between 2018 and 2021 was 70 percent of the average loan between 2013 and 2017, and the average size of area-based projects was just 18 percent of the size of projects from the earlier period. While some ascribed the change to a decline in China’s diminishing current account surplus, the diminishing emphasis on Belt and Road projects may more clearly reflect a conclusion that they are more problematic than anticipated and that success is harder to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is emerging, then, is a pattern of both U.S. and Chinese behavior that is broadly similar throughout the world. While not always expressed in stark terms, the struggle to inspire imitation — or at least to blunt the inspirational power of an adversary — has grown increasingly important as the U.S. and Chinese governments have approached the Middle East. The United States has long sought to spread a model of development that encourages the proliferation of liberal systems (in the classical sense), with free market economies and civil liberties. China has increasingly seen such efforts as a self-interested U.S. effort to constrain competitors and adversaries and to delegitimize their accomplishments. As a consequence, Chinese officials increasingly portray their own successes as disproving the premises of the U.S. model, not merely for China, but for other countries that seek to inspire similarly sharp increases in economic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-china-competition&quot;&gt;U.S.-China Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rise, and what many Chinese scholars describe as U.S. decline, has spurred a global Sino-American competition for power and influence. Third countries’ perspectives are often left out of U.S. discussions of this competition. Many Middle Eastern officials are quick to tell U.S. audiences that they fear becoming collateral damage in superpower conflict. A senior Gulf minister visiting Washington in 2021 viewed the rising great power competition and cited the proverb, “When the elephants fight, it is the ants who get killed.” Yet, at the same time, many of those same countries welcome the mere idea of competition. They do so partly because they see it helping them accrue leverage to deploy against the United States and China, and partly because they see it curtailing what they believe to be the excesses of U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to define China’s global ambitions, as well as to discern how its actions advance them, are increasingly fraught. In the last five years, Western analysis has sharply diverged. For some longtime analysts of China, there is nothing especially unique about Chinese behavior. As a former U.S. national intelligence officer for East Asia put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is making a bid for strategic influence, economic and technological advantage, international respect, freedom of action, and accommodation of its interests — all in areas where the United States has long enjoyed preeminent power and influence, and is not inclined to concede it. But China is making this bid on the basis of reasonable great power aspirations, some valid historical grievances, considerable resources, growing confidence, a readiness to compete globally — and, it should be noted, a genuine interest in constructive and cooperative relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper response to China’s rise, in this account, is a certain degree of empathy and understanding, and a fair amount of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others take the opposite tack. In some of the harsher articulations, “We are now in an existential struggle with China,” and “Beijing’s goal is a world without America.” In this view, the United States and China are not merely competing, but locked in a zero-sum conflict. China’s victory would not only be devastating for U.S. interests — China’s victory actually requires devastating U.S. interests. By these lights, the only responsible strategy to pursue is to seek China’s defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate about Chinese intentions does not occur in a vacuum. It is accompanied by an increasingly robust domestic U.S. debate over the country’s proper role in the world and the breadth of its international ambitions. Amid a sharp rise in policy circles’ talk about “restraint” and questions about both the wisdom and capacity of the country to advance maximalist goals overseas in the wake of long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some argue that the United States must be more mindful of its limits as it constructs its China policy. At one side of that spectrum, some analysts suggest that any U.S. effort to pressure China must necessarily be “accompanied by an equally robust path for mutual adjustment, cooperation, and shared achievement.” At the other side of the spectrum, analysts stress a need for “a steady state of clear-eyed coexistence on terms favorable to U.S. interests and values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite differences, it is clear that U.S. views on China are hardening across the U.S. political spectrum. Chinese actions at home and abroad alarm Americans for a host of reasons, and Congress’s focus on the need to meet threats from China enjoys deep bipartisan consensus. Even so, there is rising alarm in some parts of the China expert community in the United States that the way the United States is approaching challenges from China is self-defeating. Describing the first meeting of the congressional Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, Jude Blanchette complained, “If you were an alien and you tuned into this, you would think the United States is a pathetic, weak, scared nation, which is being beset by an omnicompetent, omnipresent enemy of just galactic proportions in terms of its capabilities. . . . If we continue to follow the playbook outlined at that committee, it will lead to . . . tragedy and devastation and extraordinary amounts of waste.” Former State Department policy planning staff member Jessica Chen Weiss worried that a U.S. determination to compete with China at all costs pushes the United States to be reactive, to operate without any sense of priorities, and to drive conflict. And former Bush administration official Evan Feigenbaum cautioned five years ago that a U.S. approach premised on the idea that China was seeking to subvert the U.S.-led order misses the much subtler but important threat that China was seeking to infiltrate that order to bend it to be more responsive to Chinese preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;liberalism-vs-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;Liberalism vs. Authoritarianism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is abundantly clear is that China and the United States have been pursuing radically different agendas in the Middle East for three-quarters of a century and achieving different results. Referring principally to the Middle East, Indian minister of external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar observed in 2020, “For two decades, China has been winning without fighting, while the US was fighting without winning.” The United States maintains a robust military footprint and asserts itself as the protector of partners against external aggression, while China has pursued efforts to be a commercial partner to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jaishankar’s analysis downplays the interaction of those two trends. That is to say, China benefitted for decades from the U.S. Navy’s efforts to secure freedom of navigation for Gulf energy, as well as from U.S. actions that undermined terrorist networks’ efforts to attack infrastructure, topple governments, and undermine trade. China benefitted, too, from the efforts of U.S.-backed international financial institutions to grow the economies of Middle Eastern states, and from the efforts of generations of Western energy executives to identify and develop the Middle East’s energy infrastructure. A half-century of U.S. efforts to create a Middle Eastern bulwark against Soviet aggression in the Cold War helped ensure that the region had strong national governments with which China could seek bilateral relations. Ironically, it was a half-century of the United States pressing regional governments on governance issues that helped prime regional governments to be open to Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, Middle Eastern authoritarians came to appreciate China’s resolute noninterference in the domestic affairs of its partners, which stood in stark contrast to the U.S. approach. As the United States used force to seek political change in the region, and as U.S. diplomats worked to more tightly intertwine U.S. engagement, economic partnerships, and political liberalization, China promised a radically different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many in the U.S. foreign policy community, the U.S. insistence on pushing for better governance is a key instrument of national power. As Hal Brands wrote in Survival, “The chief defender of the existing international order is a liberal democracy that has traditionally sought to shape the global environment in accordance with its ideological values as well as its strategic interests. The leading revisionists are autocracies that practice a distinctly authoritarian version of capitalism and see the advance of liberal ideals as an existential threat to their legitimacy and power.” This is different from the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, in which each side competed to spread its ideology. In the current ideological contest, China is not seeking to promote its own ideology or any other. Instead, it simply seeks to undermine an opposing one. Brands sees authoritarians’ fundamental goal to be an effort to vest authority in a “small elite headed by a paramount leader.” Repression and coercion provide a semblance of legitimacy. These tools replace the elections, accountability, and rule of law that secure liberal democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen this way, authoritarianism broadly challenges a liberal world order, but liberalism is a much more acute threat to authoritarian rule. Liberal states were born amid authoritarian peers, and it is relatively rare that liberal states slide into authoritarianism. Authoritarianism, after all, is not a model that appeals widely in most democracies. Yet a democratic wave would pose a profound challenge to governance models in authoritarian states. The fundamental question for authoritarian leaders is whether liberal democracies are an attractive model to their own populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the Cold War and its immediate aftermath, the United States and many of its allies considered the answer to that question to be obvious. Francis Fukuyama’s seminal 1989 article in the National Interest, “The End of History?” marked Americans’ rising enthusiasm for the universal attractiveness of the liberal model. U.S. policymakers took the almost immediate crumbling of Soviet client states in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the relatively rapid rise of more liberal and democratic governments on the ashes of four decades of communism, as confirmation that liberal ideals were both attractive and viable even in distant regions of the world. Central to the U.S. strategic approach to Iraq after 2001 was confidence that once the country was stripped of its Ba’athist authoritarian veneer, Iraqis would embrace liberalism and democracy just as Poles, Czechs, and Albanians had done in the 1990s. Central to the U.S. approach to the 2011 Arab Spring was a quiet confidence not only that positive outcomes were likely, but that the end of authoritarian regimes was to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious extension of this issue is whether the U.S. government’s almost evangelical approach to promoting global liberalism is intended principally as a way to advance its own interests through promoting global stability, or rather to undermine China’s interests by constraining and inhibiting the country’s global ties. Seen another way, and perhaps from a Chinese perspective, the question is whether the United States is a fundamentally conservative or revisionist power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one of China’s leading strategic thinkers, Wang Jisi, the official view is clear: “In Chinese eyes, the most significant threat to China’s sovereignty and national security has long been U.S. interference in its internal affairs aimed at changing the country’s political system and undermining the CCP.” He adds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beijing believes that Washington was the driving force behind the “color revolutions” that took place in the first decade of this century in former Soviet states and that the U.S. government has ginned up protest movements against authoritarian regimes around the world, including the Arab revolts of 2010–11. The CCP believes that those alleged U.S. interventions will supply a blueprint for Washington to undermine and eventually topple the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s response, then, is to portray the United States as a power that is both hegemonic and homogenizing, imposing not only its own political model, but also social and cultural mores premised on the American experience and beliefs. Seen this way, the United States sweeps away local existing power structures to empower U.S. agents who will contort societies to grow U.S. wealth and power at the expense of local interests. China’s growing focus on “South-South” relations seeks to sharpen attacks on the U.S. approach and build solidarity broadly with countries in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-modesty&quot;&gt;China’s Modesty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China crafts a very different self-image. It portrays itself as approaching difference with respect and humility. China’s five principles for peaceful coexistence — mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence — were first promulgated in 1954, but they have been playing an increasingly prominent role in Chinese rhetoric because they serve so effectively to contrast with the U.S. approach. One could argue, for example, that U.S. policy in the Middle East for the last two decades has been a refutation of each and every one of those five principles. In the face of the quite mixed, and often negative, consequences of U.S. actions, China’s strategy is to embolden objections to the U.S. approach rather than to promulgate discrete alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is scrupulous not to criticize any of its non-Western partners publicly, and it pushes its non-Western partners to reciprocate (which they do with a startling and almost uniform silence on the conditions of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang). This, too, appeals to Middle Eastern governments because it enhances their domestic legitimacy. Their apparent embrace by what is not merely a global superpower, but also a rising force in the Middle East with an impressive record of its own economic growth, creates a halo of competence and effectiveness around Middle Eastern rulers. As Middle Eastern governments weather criticisms, conditionality, and condemnation from Western governments, China provides a reputational refuge, not to mention significant opportunities for bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;APPLICABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genuine applicability of any sort of China model to modern Middle Eastern states is unclear. Regional states are starting from a different place than China did, and they are likely headed for a different place as well. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, for example, have relatively few people but rich mineral resources. Their economies thrive on imported labor, and industrialization is scarce (and industrial work by nationals, or even any private sector employment by nationals, is scarcer still). Their economies are profoundly cyclical, tied to the price of hydrocarbons. For example, Saudi GDP grew 11.2 percent in 2003, contracted 2.1 percent in 2009, and grew 11.0 percent in 2011. Saudi Arabia’s economic volatility is even greater if one goes further back in time: the country’s GDP grew 58.6 percent in 1970 and fell 20.7 percent in 1982. Although all of the GCC economies are eager to diversify from energy exports, those exports remain the engine of the economy, and they will remain so for years into the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment for Gulf nationals skews heavily toward government jobs, where productivity is hard to measure, unlike the factories employing rural migrants that were the engine of China’s economic miracle. Foreigners continue to provide most of the services in the Gulf’s service-oriented economies, and while some of their earnings stay in the country to pay for things such as housing, much of it is repatriated to their countries of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries, such as Egypt, have more similar economies. While Egypt’s 100 million people have been urbanizing for more than a century, agriculture remains a key component of employment. The World Bank estimates that 21 percent of Egyptians worked in agriculture in 2019, versus 25 percent of Chinese, and identical percentages (27 percent) in the two countries were engaged in industrial employment. As with China, state-owned enterprises constitute an important part of the industrial base. Also similar to China, Egypt has a sprawling military-industrial complex, although in the Egyptian case, the military’s economic interests dip deeply into normally civilian activities such as bottled water, gas station convenience stores, and cement manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian military’s role in the economy, combined with what many political economists describe as a system of crony capitalism in Egypt, may be partly responsible for major differences in economic outcomes. Egypt’s economic liberalization has provided outsized benefits to individuals and families close to the government, and those advantages have often spanned generations. While that may be considered analogous to the benefits accruing to members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is less evidence that Egypt’s political insider communities were nearly as meritocratic as their Chinese counterparts, or that the rotation of elites has been nearly as frequent. The current Egyptian government is the descendant of secret political cliques within the Egyptian military that overthrew the monarchy in 1952. The pervasiveness of military networks, and the taboo against discussing the Egyptian military’s economic activities in public, undermines scrutiny and accountability. When Hisham Geneina, the head of Egypt’s Central Auditing Organization, charged in 2016 that corruption was rife in several of Egypt’s government institutions, especially related to real estate development, he was fired. Convicted of “insulting the army” for threatening to reveal clear evidence of malfeasance, he was imprisoned by a military court for five years, only to be released and charged in civilian court for “joining a terrorist group and spreading false news.” The new charge makes the former auditor subject to immediate arrest at any time. While China has had its share of corruption scandals — not least the rise and precipitous fall in 2012 of Bo Xilai, who was the CCP party secretary in Chongqing — China after Deng Xiaoping has avoided fashioning ossified economic elites who remain in power for decades and generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the lessons that China might offer to Middle Eastern governments are less important than a vague idea that it has lessons. China’s remarkable economic growth, begun under Deng and continuing for more than four decades, remade the global economy. Although China’s record of double-digit GDP growth, particularly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, will not return, bringing 800 million people out of poverty remains an enduring accomplishment. Similarly, China has managed a tremendous amount of economic and social change with relatively little political disruption. China shifted from a country where fewer than one in five Chinese were urban in 1979 to two in three today, accompanied by the creation of a massive, literate, and consumption-oriented middle class that is the country’s economic driver. Throughout, the CCP has maintained control over public life and sustained its coherence and solidarity. The ability to do so in the face of such extraordinary material, social, and demographic change is not an obvious outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-courtship-of-the-global-south&quot;&gt;China’s Courtship of the Global South&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has used its twentieth-century experiences to deepen its ties with billions of people around the world. The country tells billions that it shares their grievances and feels a strong sense of solidarity with them. Since the 1970s, China has emphasized the need to create a “just and equitable new political and economic order” by addressing “economic and political inequalities between the developing world and the developed world, between the Global South and the Global North.” Despite a sharp rise in income, especially in the last two decades, China has resolutely defended its developing country status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this, China continues a version of Mao’s 1950s strategy to support revolutionary movements against imperial powers. As European empires fell, local leaders arose who harbored a sense of grievance, injustice, and disempowerment. After more than a half-century, these countries’ leaderships continue to highlight legacies of exploitation and submission to explain their contemporary problems, and the Chinese leadership — drawing on China’s history — asserts its strong identification with the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China promotes the idea that there is a coherent entity of disenfranchised states that can be termed the Global South and strives to be perceived as a leader of it. Doing so boosts China through building solidarity with governments and populations that feel persistently marginalized in terms of power, influence, money, and respect. China has artfully positioned itself as both a status quo power that supports the self-determination and sovereignty of local governments and a revisionist power that seeks to reform international relations to enhance the role of countries that aspire to a greater voice in global affairs. China portrays this in explicit contrast to the United States, arguing that the United States seeks to force its ideas of domestic reform on sovereign governments while maintaining unjust influence for itself and its allies, who continue to benefit from the power they enjoyed 75 years ago when the UN system was established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China approaches Arab states with avowed humility and modesty. The tone is well articulated in its 2016 “Arab Policy Paper,” the first six paragraphs of which celebrate two millennia of consistently aligned objectives between China and Arab states, from “sovereignty and territorial integrity” to “the establishment of the friendly and cooperative relationship oriented toward the 21st century.” An early paragraph contains the sentence, “China will continue to uphold the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation, be committed to peaceful development, pursue a win-win strategy of opening up and promote the formation of a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation.” In fact, the phrase “win-win” appears 11 times in the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedded in more than 4,800 words are a slew of Chinese commitments: to expand official and unofficial exchanges, to boost trade and investment, to strengthen civilian nuclear cooperation, and to deepen military and counterterrorism cooperation, health care exchanges, and many other efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the single obligation imposed on the Arab side is an oblique one. The document observes that the Taiwan question “concerns the core interests of China” and that Arab states and organizations have “refrained from having any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan.” For this, China expresses its appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many countries, China’s approach to foreign policy emphasizes bilateral relations between states rather than with multilateral regional organizations. The Middle East has at least two relatively robust multilateral groupings — the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council — but China has put its Middle East emphasis on five states: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Iran, and Algeria. With each of these, China in the last decade has proclaimed a “comprehensive strategic relationship,” although regional foreign ministers sometimes chuckle and say they do not quite understand what that actually means. Yet, by setting a public set of priority countries, China has helped to signal to these countries and to the world where it seeks to focus its energies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;egypt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the country that feels most in need of a Chinese embrace is Egypt, which has been casting about vigorously for a strategic reset for most of the last 150 years. Egypt’s first brush with ambitious economic and social development nearly bankrupted the country in the mid-nineteenth century. Under Khedive Ismail Pasha, the government borrowed tens of millions of pounds, mostly from Great Britain and France, to construct the Suez Canal, build out transportation and irrigation, and grow the industrial base. When European lenders grew concerned at what they saw as the khedive’s profligacy, they seized control of Egypt’s finances, and when army officers revolted over the Europeans’ control, the Europeans pressed the Ottomans (who had nominal control of Egypt and were facing their own profound problems) to install a khedive who would be more accommodating of Great Britain’s efforts to secure its debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt gained greater independence from Britain after World War II, and especially after Gamal Abdel Nasser led a 1952 coup that overthrew the Egyptian monarchy. Abdel Nasser initially seemed inclined to explore a range of economic development models, pursuing aggressive land reform on the backs of the nobility and seeking to drive industrialization by making land speculation less attractive. Ultimately, however, Abdel Nasser’s was a military regime that favored a command economy and state-led industrialization over invigorating the private sector. A tentative U.S. effort at land reclamation and resettlement in Egypt in the mid-1950s sought to promote freehold farmers, cooperative extension, and local self-rule in a project called the Egyptian American Rural Improvement Service. The military’s preferred option was “Liberation Province,” a regimented land reclamation effort that brought peasants into labor on collective plots in work shirts color coded according to their area of specialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Suez Canal crisis in 1956, Egypt turned more sharply toward the Eastern Bloc and embraced what it called “Arab socialism.” The country’s economic strategy was more statist than Marxist, and it seemed guided more by a desire to eviscerate the wealth of the regime’s potential political challengers than an effort to empower the proletariat. The project to construct the High Dam at Aswan brought hundreds of Soviet engineers and construction workers to Egypt, but Soviet economists and theoreticians did not follow. In fact, Egypt’s minister of industry from the mid-1950s, and later deputy prime minister for industry and mineral resources (and prime minister from 1972 to 1973), was Aziz Sidky, whose 1951 Harvard doctoral dissertation was a study of Egypt’s iron and steel industry. While Egypt was broadly committed to import substitution industrialization, Egypt’s industrialization strategy was, in fact, subordinated to its political strategy. The political strategy, in turn, was the product of army officers with long experience in secret organizations. It may, in fact, have owed as much to thousands of Nazis who fled to Cairo after World War II and helped organize the domestic security services as it did to the economic models Egypt was seeking to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abdel Nasser’s death, Egypt swerved away from Arab socialism, but not completely. Anwar Sadat’s Infitah, or “open door,” created opportunities for the private sector after the 1973 war and the abandonment of Soviet ties in favor of an alignment with the United States. Yet, while the United States poured billions of dollars into Egypt in economic assistance after the Camp David Treaty, and international financial institutions began to engage more deeply with Egypt, the Egyptian system remained a patchwork. The military continued to maintain a privileged position in the economy, and the state maintained a robust system of subsidies and state-owned industries. A pattern of five-year plans begun in the 1960s persisted, as did the focus on import substitution. Public sector employment remained robust. In 1998, after two decades of large-scale U.S. economic assistance to Egypt, 39 percent of the Egyptian workers were either government employees or worked for public enterprises. Egypt was not so much pursuing a development model as it was resisting one. The government consistently sought international support while simultaneously seeking to preserve the status quo to the greatest degree possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While scholars can disagree on the precise cause, and it is an open question whether a clearer development model would have delivered different results, Egypt fared far poorer than many Asian economies that were in similar conditions in the 1950s and 1960s. Egypt’s per capita GDP in 1965 was $161, Thailand’s was $142, and South Korea’s was $109. In 2021, the respective numbers were $3,699, $7,066, and $34,998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt pivoted away from the Soviet Union in 1970 and aligned with the United States in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The Camp David agreement of 1979 established the promise of $2.1 billion per year in U.S. foreign assistance, partly intended to replace Gulf Arab assistance that all parties believed would be cut after an Egyptian-Israeli agreement. The U.S. assistance — $1.3 billion in military aid and another $800 million in economic help — was significant in 1979. But the Egyptian economy grew, the population grew, and inflation ate away at the value of the assistance. Starting in 1998, and in parallel with a change in U.S. aid to Israel, the United States agreed to reduce economic assistance to Egypt significantly. While the number has fluctuated, in part due to congressional concern about Egyptian human rights conditions, U.S. economic aid to Egypt now stands at approximately $100 million per year for a population of more than 100 million Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a bilateral perspective, Egyptians came to regard U.S. economic assistance as an entitlement, and it bred Egyptian resentment. In the early 2000s, an Egyptian diplomat at an informal gathering in Washington bristled at proposed legislation that would condition a portion of U.S. assistance on Egyptian human rights performance. “If you want to condition additional assistance on what we do, that’s your money and you can do what you wish. But this is our money,” he complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID has proudly trumpeted its achievements in Egypt over 40 years. U.S. government efforts have helped eliminate polio, lower infant and maternal mortality, improve early literacy, expand telecommunications networks, reduce lead in the air in Cairo, and improve water and wastewater supplies for 25 million Egyptians. Included in the assistance was $1.4 billion to support Egyptian agriculture, including helping farmers buy land, liberalizing markets for fertilizers and seeds, and matching Egyptian farmers with local and international buyers. And yet, Egyptians have long complained that their partnership with the United States has been a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Egyptians seeing persistent poverty around them have argued that a true partnership with a superpower such as the United States would have lifted them to prosperity (as many say the United States has done with Israel, and as others argue the United States has done with South Korea and Japan). They have objected that USAID contracts are designed to support U.S. contractors and not Egyptians. Additionally, Americans have worried that international support for Egyptian projects has actually inhibited Egypt’s development of indigenous capacity to address its development issues. For example, international aid programs have used robust salaries to lure the most capable Egyptian experts out of the Egyptian bureaucracy to implement projects. While that has helped ensure that the projects are successful, it has weakened the Egyptian government’s capacity to carry out other work independently. For these reasons and others, it is not entirely coincidental that Egypt shares a distinction with a number of other long-term recipients of U.S. foreign assistance: rather than creating strong popular support for the United States, the bilateral aid relationship seems to have contributed to strained ties. In 2010, the Pew Research Center polled countries around the world about favorable attitudes toward the United States. Of the 21 countries polled, the lowest ratings (hovering close to 20 percent) were in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey, all significant recipients of U.S. assistance over decades. While U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may have played a role in dragging numbers downward, one might have thought that decades of partnership might have mitigated some of the frustration. It is also worth noting that U.S. favorability ratings in Lebanon were above 50 percent. Remarkably in light of the current round of great power competition, U.S. favorability ratings in Russia and China were 57 and 58 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian-Chinese relationship is newer and, at least superficially, more robust. Since first going to China in 2014, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi visited six times in six years and signed at least 25 bilateral agreements. A former Egyptian ambassador to China, now the vice chairman of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship Association, gushed to the Chinese-published Global Times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Egypt and China enjoy a lot of similarities, that has been so obvious since their two leaders took over as president. They have both almost identical and profound appreciation of world politics. Their mutual understanding got deeper and deeper over the past few years. They met many times and developed mutual understanding, in particular with regard to the priority that should be given to sustainable development in their nations, to the building up of their economies, to striving to aim at raising the standards of living of their people and to the preservation of our two nations’ national security, peace and stability, because any country, if it’s stable and strong from within, no other country could threaten its peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two presidents have the political will to work together to develop further and further their two nations’ bilateral relations, this is beneficial for the two nations and the two peoples. The presidents are willing to work together to further develop Arab-China relations, Africa-China relations, and our mutual relations with other developing nations. Both countries are focused on the idea of creating a joint future because we have a common destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One businessperson who has dealt extensively with China raved about implicit comparisons between China and the United States. “There is no conditionality on financing, and they finance on comfortable terms,” she said. “They provide financing and know-how . . . and they provide long installments with a grace period. It is a less arrogant model, and they are not interfering in politics.” Another businessperson with extensive investments in Egypt’s new capital city complex in the desert east of Cairo also highlighted the financing issue: “The Germans, French, and Chinese are investing with financing on easy terms. The U.S. is letting go and blaming Egypt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, China’s engagement with Egypt has been measured, and China has pulled back when it has judged Egypt to be overreaching. On the New Administrative Capital, for example, Chinese firms originally were slated to play a major role in constructing the government administrative district, but as one senior Egyptian official put it, “It didn’t work for economic and political reasons.” A Chinese colleague commented privately that the dispute was over commercial terms and that “the Egyptians thought they were the only ones who were supposed to make money.” The Chinese focus shifted to building towers only in the central business district, a smaller area for which they have specific technical expertise, some of which the Egyptians hope will be transferred during the construction process. The commonly accepted figure for Chinese investment in the central business district is $3 billion, although the terms of the investment are hard to discern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suez Canal Zone has become an area of special focus for China. It is one of the few sites in Egypt where the Chinese have made investments, and those investments have yielded returns. A 2002 effort to establish a free zone had weak results, but parliament amended the law in 2015, and the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) expanded its facilities there significantly. Presidents Xi and Sisi inaugurated an expansion of the so-called TEDA-Suez project during Xi’s 2016 state visit to Egypt. The project now occupies an area of more than 7 square kilometers, with a long-term planning area almost three times as large. According to the organization’s website, “It is an industrial project mainly covering processing and manufacturing, logistics, bonded [sic], technology development, commerce and modern services and other major industries, housing, commerce, finance, and other functions.” The area has gymnasiums, libraries, Chinese restaurants, and even a “dinosaur paradise” for recreation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant economic enterprise in the TEDA-Suez zone is a Jushi fiberglass plant, which produces 200,000 tons of fiberglass annually. The plant reportedly employs 2,200 Egyptians, and according to a former Egyptian diplomat, only 14 Chinese workers. Most of the work, however, is done by robots. A 2015 master plan projected for the TEDA-Suez zone to create a million jobs for Egyptians by 2030, but so far, only about 50,000 Egyptian jobs have been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There often seems to be a gap between the perception of Chinese investment in Egypt, Chinese partnership with Egypt, and the reality. Agreements are struck and heralded, but sometimes projects are quietly shelved without clear explanations of when or why. For example, the Egyptian press widely reported in January 2016 that the Ministry of Transportation had signed a memorandum of understanding with China Railway Construction Corporation for a $3.5 billion project to design, plan, and build Cairo’s sixth metro line, noting that financing was still being negotiated. Eighteen months later, the press reported that Egypt’s National Authority of Tunnels had signed a nonbinding agreement with Quebec-based Bombardier to develop a plan for the sixth metro line and made no reference at all to the prior Chinese agreement. There is no public record of what went wrong with the earlier project or when it foundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, sustained attention has been paid to the Chinese role in constructing the electrified light rail between Cairo, 10th of Ramadan City, and the New Administrative Capital. The $1.25 billion project, whose first phase is a 66 kilometer line with 11 stations, opened in July 2022, approximately five years after being agreed to. The construction of the railway is an example of China’s ability to build infrastructure more quickly and affordably than Western firms, drawing from China’s extensive domestic experience building railways and helping to drive Egypt’s economic development. Because Egyptians see China as a fellow developing country, there is a tendency to see the railway more as a partnership of equals, with an implicit hope that some of China’s economic magic rubs off on Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Egyptians argue that what attracts them is not so much a Chinese model specifically, but an Asian model more generally. One former diplomat argued, in part, that Asian countries are often willing to embrace “strategic latency” and allow diplomatic processes to unfold over time, without forcing rapid and explicit decisions that can be destabilizing. The explicit example he cited was China’s decision not to take either Hong Kong or Macao by force, but surely the evolution of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as an instrument of consensus building was an element of his thinking. Contrarily, he also admired that “In circles of government, Asia is fascinated by performance, speed, and growth rate.” To accomplish that, he said, “Sometimes you need an iron fist, especially after three to four years of revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might interpret this seeming contradiction — a simultaneous admiration of Chinese patience and impatience — as an embrace of realism, practicality, and outcomes over rigid ideology. Many Egyptians complain that Western efforts to improve systems and transparency are self-interested diktats cloaked in supposedly principled altruism. China makes no such demands and no such pretense, and as with the construction of the light rail line, it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a line of argument in Egypt that the turn toward a Chinese option is a practical one that has been forced on them. As one businessperson said, “The U.S.-Egypt relationship is in the DNA of Egypt. Egyptian officials hate dealing with the Chinese.” Another said, “We have no hostility to China, but it is not like the American dream.” But however much they might prefer dealing with the United States, Egyptians assess that China is interested in Egypt, and that the United States is not. “The U.S. is letting go and blaming Egypt,” one businessperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf has a very different attitude toward both the United States and China, in part because the fundamental problem Gulf governments have had for the last half-century or more has been how to spend money rather than how to acquire it. In Saudi Arabia, the discovery of oil in 1938 meant money flowed to lands that had not had a major capital injection for most of human history. Spending only became deliberate when Prince Faisal established control in the early 1960s. When Faisal became king, Saudi Arabia became a more conventional developmental state, adopting a pattern of five-year plans starting in 1970 and quickly becoming more ambitious as energy revenues exploded. Foreign consultants helped some. For example, the California-based Stanford Research Institute helped staff the Central Planning Organization. Even so, as oil revenues grew sharply on a relatively low economic base, there was never much opportunity to develop a robust private sector. This was in part because the state was such an outsized economic actor, and in part because plentiful government employment opportunities made Saudi labor expensive, especially in comparison to expatriates. Saudi Arabia evolved into a system in which a low-wage, high-productivity foreign workforce supported a high-wage, low-productivity native workforce. The private sector, with mostly Saudi owners and foreign workers, focused mostly on traditional sectors such as services, light manufacturing, agriculture, and, importantly, construction for state-funded projects. The Saudi state led the major industrialization efforts, the growth of a petrochemicals industry, and, of course, the upstream oil sector. A sympathetic journal article asserted that Saudi development plans had combined “capitalist and Islamic values” and eschewed the socialist instincts of most five-year plans in the developing world. Yet, although the 1980 five-year plan explicitly endorsed private capital, the state was overwhelmingly the country’s largest employer, and citizens enjoyed a series of social subsidies and benefits that were the envy of any socialist state. From 1980 on, each five-year plan called for reducing the number of expatriate workers and boosting Saudi employment. Each plan failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge that has bedeviled Saudi development plans is wild swings in oil revenues. When Saudi Arabia established its first five-year plan, revenues blew past predictions, and expenditures could not keep up. That happened with the second five-year plan as well. By the time the third five-year plan was implemented, prices fell well short of expectations, and they remained relatively low until climbing steadily in 2002 and afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has had persistent difficulty shifting gears to take advantage of oil windfalls. One management consultant told then Saudi minister of labor Ghazi al-Ghosaibi in the early 2000s that economically, Saudi Arabia was “on a path to Mexico, not the U.S.” By 2010, McKinsey published a short paper arguing that Saudi Arabia was “on a path to Pakistan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saudi Vision 2030 plan, announced in April 2016, is an ambitious effort to completely reframe the Saudi development debate. Designed quickly by leading U.S. strategic consultancies, most prominently McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group, the plan was an effort to simultaneously recast the kingdom’s future trajectory and legitimate the leadership of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was elevated to crown prince just over a year after the plan’s introduction. The vision encompasses 13 “vision realization programs,” each of which has its own set of objectives, commitments, and key performance indicators (KPIs). A National Transformation Plan was put in place to address 37 strategic objectives across eight different themes, measured through 92 main KPIs and 224 sub-KPIs implemented through 433 initiatives and projects. As the plan has been implemented, the number of KPIs and sub-KPIs has increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, many Western observers openly wondered how Saudi Arabia could manage economic development without encouraging social and political liberalization. As a reviewer of an account of Saudi economic planning wondered, “How can a population whose majority is conservative and still living in a Medieval time frame accommodate and absorb the technology of the Western world, which is mainly based on a liberal and material background?” In the four decades since, Saudi Arabia has provided an answer to that question. For several decades, it aggressively coopted most potential domestic opposition and paid particular attention to pursuing a symbiotic relationship with the clerical establishment, which legitimated the ruling family’s patrimony. Under the Vision 2030 plan, the country has pursued an aggressive plan of social liberalization (or, perhaps more accurately, a strategy to “coerce tolerance”) that promotes many forms of social and economic liberalization while becoming even more sensitive to expressions of political liberalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uae&quot;&gt;The UAE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is a more heterogeneous state than either Saudi Arabia or Egypt, and its development spurt happened relatively later. Not only was oil not discovered until the 1960s (and the state itself was not formed until 1971), but emirates such as Dubai and Sharjah had histories of trade and commerce long before Abu Dhabi became a global oil giant and the country’s economic driver. Baked into the agreement forming the UAE was a relatively weak federal government and significant local autonomy. A symbiotic relationship developed between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular, where Abu Dhabi acted as a frequent financier for Dubai, and many of the oil operators found an entrepot such as Dubai a more hospitable base than the relatively underdeveloped and relatively more parochial Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before statehood, the emirates that became the UAE formed Trucial Oman under British protection. By most accounts, local rulers lamented Britain’s 1971 departure. This may be in part because a pattern of British payments to local rulers throughout the early twentieth century gave the rulers dominion over local commercial families, creating a pattern of patrimonialism in the UAE that persists to the present. Regardless, British technical advisers were present throughout the emirates, and a British consulting firm helped guide the plan to dredge Dubai Creek that began in 1959, which laid the groundwork for Dubai’s spectacular economic growth in the decades since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the British left reluctantly, and because the Emiratis were, for the most part, sorry to see them go, the UAE economy grew amid a robust pattern of partnership with Western development experts. Such experts helped advise on the creation of a currency board in 1973 and on the creation of a central bank in 1980. Revenues quickly outstripped the federal government’s ability to spend them, but the government sought to develop infrastructure rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one author wrote, it is clear why the UAE had no overall development strategy in the early years of statehood: the Emirates “were in need of practically every amenity, and therefore, everything had to be done very quickly.” Yet, individual emirates were each pursuing development independently of each other, often replicating each other’s efforts. Each emirate built its own cement plant, and four different emirates raced to build their own international airports. The Ministry of Planning conceived of a five-year plan to begin in 1981, but it lacked the authority to enforce its will nationwide, and it proved ineffective even in communicating with local development planners, let alone coordinating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of central control, or perhaps because of it, the UAE developed robustly by its own lights. Arguably, this diversity of approach and hunger for results resembled the multiple strategies China pursued in the 1990s. Dubai in particular developed a reputation for urgency and ambition, which in recent decades Abu Dhabi has sought to match. The state — in this case meaning both the federal government and the governments of individual emirates — remains the key driver of economic decisionmaking, which it maintains through state-owned conglomerates such as Dubai World, Dubai Holdings, and a government-controlled property development firm named Emaar. Dubai has an “Executive Office” (and Abu Dhabi has an Executive Affairs Authority) that allows rulers to mesh their governmental and economic roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore has been a particular Emirati inspiration for almost 30 years. One of the most prominent developers in the UAE, Mohammed al-Abbar, was posted in Singapore from 1987 to 1992 as the representative of Khaleej Capital. When he returned to Dubai, he spent five years creating the Department of Economic Development. Based in part on his Singapore experience, al-Abbar wrote Dubai’s first 10-year strategic plan as the emirate began to diversify into transport, real estate, logistics, and tourism. The first Singaporean ambassador resident in the UAE judged that Emiratis were attracted by Singapore’s “stability, one-party rule, and economic dynamism,” and while Dubai was the first emirate to send delegations to understand what made Singapore tick, Abu Dhabi was not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Saudi Arabia, the UAE maintains a deeply patrimonial system with an antipathy to anything that reeks of political opposition. The UAE has a nod to political participation with a partially elected Federal National Council, although the rulers of each emirate select electors. For all of its embrace of change and swiftness, the UAE has been on its current development path for decades, explicitly welcoming foreigners’ deep engagement in the Emirati economy and embracing an internally heterogeneous approach that seems to reward experimentation. By contrast, Saudi Arabia’s current approach represents a much more sudden break from the past. Until recently, the country had a strong emphasis on homogeneity, presumably as a mechanism to manage social and economic change. If the UAE sought inspiration from Singapore, Saudi Arabia seems belatedly to have found inspiration — and rivalry — in the neighboring UAE. That rivalry is not always friendly, and its stakes are clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gulf-attitudes-toward-the-united-states-and-china&quot;&gt;Gulf Attitudes toward the United States and China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf’s economic growth has been intimately tied to the price of oil. Much of the region was deeply impoverished in the interwar years, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that oil production made a meaningful difference in the lives of most Gulf Arabs. During that period, teachers, lawyers, physicians, and professionals from Egypt and the Levant were the bridge between Gulf governments and the world’s developed economies. An even more fundamental change occurred after oil prices shot up after 1973. Massive infrastructure projects, a flood of workers from South and Southeast Asia, and large teams of Western professionals rendered most of the region’s cities unrecognizable, and a spike in Gulf Arab students training in Western universities laid the foundation for a much different future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the oil boom, the whole notion of economic development in the Gulf took on a different coloration than for a country such as Egypt. The region was not ideologically attracted to socialism — indeed, the Gulf monarchies had a strong aversion to Gamal Abdel Nasser and his Arab socialism project — but it essentially set up socialist systems funded by oil revenues. Almost all citizens were quickly brought out of poverty, often on the backs of nonnational workers who labored in poverty. Guaranteed government jobs, free education and health care, and subsidized utilities were all part of the ruling bargain for citizens, and still, there was plenty of money to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant economic systems blended capitalism and socialism in ways that had few antecedents in either the United States or China. Politically and socially, the tribal, clan, and family systems of the Gulf increasingly had to cope with the cosmopolitan demands of fast-growing cities, mobility, and generational change. Here, too, there was not an obvious direction in which they might adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, economic development called for more democratic, or at least more liberal, systems. To these people, the dynamism of the modern world was synonymous with greater individualism, which in turn would encourage excellence and intellectual independence. The so-called “Red Prince” of Saudi Arabia, Talal bin Abdulaziz, went into exile for several years in the early 1960s for his embrace of such reforms, and he was merely one example of the region’s liberalizing current. Kuwait first established a legislature in 1938 as a way for merchants to ensure that the ruler was sharing oil revenues with the population. Although it was soon dissolved, it has proven mostly durable since its reestablishment in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, more democratic systems have not always correlated with liberalization. The advent of democratic politics in Kuwait, for example, has had the paradoxical effect of nurturing tribal politics. Tribes organize to ensure their representation in parliament, and then they use that representation to maximize their share of state benefits. Rather than push individualism, Kuwaiti elections have spurred collective consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of Gulf rulers, collective consciousness is not a bad thing as long as the leaders of the collectivities respect the leadership’s rule. Indeed, it is easier to manage individuals when that management can be delegated to a small number of subnational authorities who can both reward compliance and punish deviance. Gulf governments have not embraced systems of large domestic security forces with widely placed informants, as countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq pursued in the 1960s and beyond. Rather, the networks of affiliation that pervade Gulf societies serve to reinforce loyalty and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has quietly pushed for greater democratization in the Gulf. It worked to ensure that Kuwait reinstated its parliament after the U.S. liberation in 1991, and it encouraged Saudi efforts to strengthen its advisory legislature, the Shura Council, and sought to bolster municipality elections in 2015. For the most part, U.S. diplomats have recognized that their ability to push Gulf partners to adopt open election systems is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, U.S. officials have relied on a more indirect tool. For more than three-quarters of a century, the United States (and to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom) has been the aspirational educational target for Gulf elites. As a destination for students, the trickle turned into a flood as oil wealth spilled into the Gulf in the 1970s. Numbers shot up again after 9/11, when the King Abdullah Scholarship Program sent more than 100,000 Saudis to the United States to study. In the last two decades, U.S. universities have arisen throughout the Gulf, in some cases as branches of U.S. campuses and in others as independent institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and social impact of U.S.-style education — obtained both at home and abroad — is debated in the region. To some, the exposure to cosmopolitanism imbued by the 600,000 Saudis that have studied abroad necessarily has seeped back into the country. Whether it is encountering unfamiliar ideas, being pushed toward independent thought, or being exposed to women who live unencumbered by the desires of their male relatives, education forces Saudis to navigate profoundly different cultural environments for extended periods. In addition, Gulf students have built their English language skills as part of their education, not only to attend international schools, but increasingly to attend national universities in places such as the UAE and Qatar. With the expansion of the internet and social media in the last two decades, intimate awareness of Western societies has increased markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in the Gulf consider this to be a mixed blessing. While they find much to admire in the West, they also find a great deal that is unattractive. They are quick to raise not only the problems in the West such as poverty, crime, and drug abuse, but also a social code that seeks to make room for protecting blasphemy, disrespecting parents, and condoning homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments in the region that seek to rule through what they say is a benign authoritarianism, they argue that liberalism would open the door not only to what they see as the social ills of the West, but also a conservative reaction by extremists that would undermine necessary progress. That is to say, they insist that governments must play a central role in managing contestation in society, and more open politics would only drive polarization and hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that the Chinese model of government management of the confluence of economic, social, and political change becomes attractive. As a former U.S. diplomat with extensive Middle East experience said of the current president of the UAE, Mohammed bin Zayed, “he wanted to develop a benevolent autocracy. He thought that vision plus resources plus grip would equal success.” One Kuwaiti investor said, “Our experience with democracy is not so constructive. Many people think, stupidly, it is what is holding the country back, rather than incompetent government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one UAE-based think tank scholar put it, “The UAE is asked to be apologetic for lots of stuff, especially its political system. . . . The China model achieved success. They are doing more than any Third World democratic country. They created a parallel model. We don’t need to apologize anymore.” This scholar continued, “We have an Islamic background, so family is first. But in civilization we are closer to the West because Islam is an Abrahamic religion. Even so, the radical individualism of the West is sometimes offensive. For example, the right to decide gender doesn’t resonate with our sense of the boundaries of individualism.” Another UAE-based scholar asked, “Who comes first, the individual or society?” He suggested that democracy was one way of improving governance, but that improved governance without democracy also represents an attractive path forward. As he put it, “China is making people think we have another choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior Arab League official made a similar point. He argued that there is a sense of revelation that comes from Chinese success: “They did a miracle. The West said it wasn’t possible. If you want economic progress, there is one way forward, and that requires liberalization and democratization.” China refutes that premise, and from an economic point of view, China can represent a more conservative bet. The Arab League official argued that “the China model has continuity. The democratic model has disruptions all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Gulf understandings of the Chinese political economy are almost entirely impressionistic. There is no literature in Arabic on China’s economic and political development, aside from a few newspaper columns. Academic articles about China’s role in the region rely almost entirely on secondary English-language sources rather than Arabic or Chinese material or primary documents. There is no community of elite Gulf businesspeople who have lived in China and can act as a bridge. Similarly, there is no community of Chinese living in the Gulf who mix easily with their Arab counterparts. On the popular level, Chinese goods are widely thought to be of inferior quality, and Chinese construction is below the standard of Western or Northeast Asian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-chinese-parallel&quot;&gt;The Chinese Parallel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there remains a cultural fascination with China among Gulf rulers that manifests itself in intriguing ways. In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Culture sponsored the first Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale from December 2021 to March 2022. The town is especially significant among the country’s current leadership. It was the birthplace of the Saudi state in the eighteenth century, and it is now the target of a $63 billion development giga-project funded by the Public Investment Fund, which is closely associated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show’s curator, Philip Tinari, curates China’s leading contemporary art museum and is based in Beijing. The show’s title was “Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones.” A display at the exhibit explained that the expression became common in the 1980s in China to refer “to strategies for implementing and adapting to the massive economic and cultural transformations that were then taking place. Saudi Arabia finds itself today in a similar moment of optimistic energy, willingness to ask questions, and openness to new futures.” A further display panel explained, “Moments of rupture, such as we have experienced recently around the world, are those most likely to unleash new waves of retroactive understanding and codification, as well as of reassessment of earlier orthodoxies. The past might be best understood not as a source of immutable tradition, but as an unstable function of the present.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a clearer invocation of the applicability of China’s modernization experience in the 1980s to what Saudi Arabia is experiencing now. China went through a wrenching social and economic transformation as brutal experiments in collective farming were abandoned, cities exploded in size and complexity, and room was made for private enterprise. Political elites were purged, many of whom had purged their predecessors not so long before. Iron-clad ideological principles were abandoned, and new ones were adopted. It led to world-beating growth in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vision 2030 process in Saudi Arabia envisions a similarly dramatic shift. For many decades, prayer times shaped the rhythm of daily life in Saudi Arabia. The government dominated the economy in every way and employed most Saudi citizens in the workforce. Saudi women were almost entirely absent from most sectors of the workforce despite high levels of education. Saudis reveled in the country’s uniqueness, in the formal alliance between the rulers and the religious establishment, and in the rules and roles that provided lifetime employment and protected Saudis from economic downturns. While the country changed dramatically over the twentieth century, it proudly charted its own course while seeming to pick and choose the aspects of Western modernity it would accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five years, the government has worked actively to reduce the influence of religious institutions on daily life and, in particular, to liberate younger people to socialize and celebrate in diverse ways. While the government still plays a commanding role in the economy, it is seeking to become more of a strategic investor than a regular employer. The private sector is growing, much as it did in China in the 1980s and 1990s, and the rigid ideologies of the past are visibly yielding. Another parallel is rapidly shifting dress patterns. In China, the monochromatic Mao suits of the 1950s and 1960s yielded to patterned Western-style clothing in many places; in Saudi Arabia, the uniform of white thobes for men and black abayas for women is breaking down quickly. Men increasingly wear jeans and t-shirts, while women’s abayas are in a riot of colors and are increasingly worn open with only the lightest hair covering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is similar, too, is an understanding that the newfound freedom has clear limits. In China, the CCP still has complete control over politics, and the government closely monitors public expression for political content. The same is true in Saudi Arabia. While the economy is increasingly unbound and social options are increasing, there is little tolerance for unsanctioned political expression. Saudi officials have privately admired the efficiency of China’s internal transformation. As the metaphor of “feeling the stones” suggests, Saudis see China as having experimented on small matters while ensuring that the country was making deliberate progress, all in the context of a centralized decisionmaking structure with a clear destination in mind. Saudis have also admired the results: a society that was profoundly transformed into an economic powerhouse without an accompanying political transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prominent retired Arab diplomat spoke with deep admiration for China’s feat. Comparing Russia and China, he argued that China superseded Russia because the leadership showed flexibility and innovation. Dismissing Mikhail Gorbachev as an idealist who “played games through perestroika and glasnost,” he argued that China succeeded in part because it focused entirely on the economic task at hand without delving into deep political reform. “The industrial base in Russia should have allowed success,” he said, but because of the Chinese leadership, China came out ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area of contemporary art captures Saudi ambition especially well. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been at the forefront of encouraging creativity among young people in Saudi Arabia, itself a revolutionary concept in a religious tradition that was consistently interpreted to frown on innovation (bid‛ah). Not only had the government formerly frowned upon art and music when not intended for religious purposes, but the clerical establishment sought to constrain it. Artists were barred from depicting human forms, and the religious police confiscated and sometimes destroyed musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the contemporary art scene in China suggests that even creative artistic expression can be encouraged while it is simultaneously closely monitored for political content. Indeed, one can see China’s efforts to nurture a creative class removed from political or social consciousness as a model for Saudi ambitions. China’s implementation of this practice also models how the institutionalization of political censorship in the art world can help regularize the role of censorship in society more broadly by simultaneously highlighting the power of censors and the narrowness of the censors’ ambit. Because both China and Saudi Arabia have long histories of strict censorship in the past, they are able to cast current patterns of censorship as part of a pattern of liberalization. They place emphasis on a flowering of artistic freedom rather than the guardrails that are strictly maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reluctance to push adherence to a unitary China model makes tracing Chinese assistance on issues such as censorship difficult, and neither China nor authoritarian governments feel any obligation to publicize cooperation on security-related issues. At the same time, evidence from the Arab side suggests that the Chinese role in this and similar endeavors is more inspirational than practical. The apparent distance serves both sides well. China’s interest is less in advancing Chinese-style solutions than in undermining a belief that Western-style solutions are the only option; from the perspective of Arab governments, if the Chinese experience does not exactly undermine Western calls for liberalization, it helps boost the resolve of liberalization’s critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, from the point of view of Arab governments, articles in Western publications that describe Chinese government strategies toward censorship are more than adequate to demonstrate both what the Chinese government does and what its effects are. They helpfully boil down Chinese government action into brief and salient points, and they avoid the formal and sometimes formulaic cadences of official Chinese government documents. Of course, many Arab government elites speak and read English, and few speak or read Chinese. For countries that already have well-developed censorship functions, the specific details are less important than the principles, anyway, and Western journalists and academics have covered the principles extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-soft-power&quot;&gt;China’s Soft Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might ask what broader Arab publics make of the China model, and in what situations these perceptions matter. Recent polling by the Arab Barometer Project found that, in eight of the nine countries where they were able to poll, the publics have a more favorable attitude toward China than the United States. Notably, in each of the nine countries polled, respondents were more likely to view the development of U.S. economic power as a “critical threat” than the development of China’s economic power, and in eight of the nine countries surveyed, at least a third of respondents viewed U.S. economic power through this critical lens. It is important to note, however, that the Arab Barometer’s polls do not touch many of the countries most important to the United States and China, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Institute for Near East Policy has commissioned polls that ask a different set of questions. One poll released in December 2022 (but fielded before Xi’s trip to Riyadh that month) found that 57 percent of Saudis surveyed believed that the Saudi-China relationship was either very important or somewhat important, while only 41 percent said the same was true of the United States. Meanwhile, 61 percent of Saudis agree at least somewhat with the proposition, “We cannot count on the United States these days, so we should look more to other countries like China or Russia as partners.” A similar Washington Institute poll in the UAE fielded in November 2022 found similar numbers, with 56 percent arguing that strong China ties were important, 44 percent saying the same about the United States, and 61 percent supporting the hedging proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, numbers in Egypt were much more evenly divided. A November 2022 poll found that 55 percent of Egyptians believed that the Egypt-China relationship was important, compared to 52 percent saying the same about the United States, a gap that is within the poll’s margin of error, and Egyptians were evenly split 49 percent apiece on whether the country should hedge against U.S. abandonment through closer China and Russia ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those polling numbers are not a clear assessment of soft power, and they say little about public attitudes toward the more liberal models of the West and the more authoritarian model of China. It is hard, in fact, to imagine how one could get research permission in those states to ask those questions broadly. It is significant, though, that these are nations that have been the targets of substantial U.S. attention — both through educational exchanges and cultural efforts dating back to the 1970s, and strong government-to-government cooperation on security issues that in some cases has lasted even longer. That a larger fraction of the public believes in the importance of close ties with China than with the United States, and the widespread belief in the importance of having a balanced relationship between multiple powers rather than aligning as closely as possible with the United States, represents an important victory for China’s global strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least when speaking with a U.S. researcher, English-speaking Arab elites are keen to highlight the differences between the United States and China. “China is a market, not a model,” one Emirati researcher suggested, and a Kuwaiti businessman complained, “It is not clear how they do business.” While China provides a lower-cost structure, the Kuwaiti felt communication was easier with the West. An Egyptian businessperson cautioned that while the Chinese model can provide financing, “You have to look at the intentions, too.” This Egyptian argued that Chinese financing in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa led to default, and ultimately to Chinese ownership. An Egyptian official who has negotiated with the Chinese had a more balanced view, suggesting that the Chinese “are tough in negotiation, but they control their temper. They are masters of micro and macro. They are patient negotiators, and they don’t lie.” Yet, that description is an almost clinical description of negotiations, with no sense that personal chemistry can help bridge differences. A former U.S. ambassador, long resident in the Middle East, said that culturally, Arabs “don’t understand the Chinese. They can’t figure out what makes them tick. There is no cultural communication.” A veteran Arab journalist who is close to the Egyptian government said simply that the Chinese “are not good at mixing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an analytical level, some Arabs are skeptical that partnerships with China can yield all that is promised. Kuwaitis have watched the highly touted “Silk City” partnership with China languish for more than a decade, although they are as critical of the Kuwaiti role as the Chinese one. Similarly, Chinese cooperation on Egypt’s New Administrative Capital has waxed and waned and has ultimately yielded much less than initially promised. One Egyptian business executive argued that both the scale and pace of bilateral cooperation are “too aggressive. There are 44 new cities in the pipeline,” he said in March 2022. “It’s too much, especially if there are external shocks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some Arab leaders wonder just how applicable the Chinese experience is to Arab governments after all. A veteran Arab diplomat argued that there is no way to repeat the China experience in the Middle East, “Because the human factor is completely different. . . . [They] are not in a position to replicate it because of the nature of the people.” A former Egyptian government official concurred, suggesting that Islam had created a “fatalistic attitude toward development” that engenders passivity. Former New Yorker China correspondent Peter Hessler moved to Egypt, and in one memorable 2015 article wrote about expatriate Chinese entrepreneurs there. The entrepreneurs had a dour view of the country’s workforce and economic prospects. They argued that the work ethic was poor, especially among men, and gender roles blocked women from full economic participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some Chinese say their understanding of the Arab world is superficial at best. A Chinese diplomat told a former professor that “the United States and Great Britain have many . . . human resources, but our channels are basically official. We don’t know many people. We don’t know the kings and bankers and complicated Arab camps and different political colors, family relations, clans.” The scholar added that with almost no heritage speakers who can act as a bridge, “We Chinese have a hard time integrating into that region,” adding also that anti-Muslim bias is widespread in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether such comments are intended more as straightforward analysis or represent a Chinese effort to — in Deng Xiaoping’s formulation — “hide capabilities and bide time” is unclear. Yet the two are not contradictory. China is quite intentionally not seeking to imitate the U.S. path, and part of the U.S. path is inspiring imitation. One could imagine China would gain significantly by emboldening others to resist imitating the United States without inspiring a simultaneous imitation of China. The “China model,” in this case, can be seen as promoting global resistance to the adoption of Western liberalism. Arguably, the China model represents the notion that governments around the world can follow the Chinese path, in that the economy flourishes and stability is maintained while the government picks and chooses those aspects of modernity their populations will embrace and rejects aspects that it sees as contributing to instability or immorality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-responses&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy challenge China poses to the United States is an unconventional one. Whereas the Cold War pitted the United States and the Soviet Union against each other, China argues that there is no contradiction in building stronger relations with the United States and China simultaneously. China and Middle Eastern states alike point to the vague notion of a China model to undermine what each sees as undesirable U.S. hegemony. All of these countries agree that they are merely seeking to foster a respect for legitimate difference, and no one is choosing sides. In the process, each country is enhancing its leverage against the United States and making it harder for the U.S. government to accomplish its goals in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain instinct in the U.S. government to fall back on Cold War models and see Sino-American competition in the Middle East as a zero-sum, symmetrical affair. The United States works with an array of allies and partners to weave together diplomatic cooperation, military basing, commercial relations, and a host of other ties to drive a common purpose and isolate an adversary. It assumes China is doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, China is playing a different game. It is not looking for allies and, in fact, does not pursue formal alliances at all. Instead, China is seeking to undermine the solidarity of U.S. partners to create a world dominated by ad hoc, at-will bilateral relationships — in which China is the dominant party. It obscures some of this by embracing a slew of loosely held multilateral groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the BRICS, all of which hold meetings that are long on verbal expressions of solidarity and short on binding mutual obligations. These groups play a very different role than the treaty-based organizations that are fundamental to U.S. foreign policy. Through these efforts, China is not seeking to out-align the United States so much as it is seeking to undermine U.S. alignments, thereby nullifying many of the advantages that the United States enjoys in global affairs. It does so partly defensively, to avoid U.S.-led isolation, and partly opportunistically, to exploit opportunities that the United States creates through its own efforts to isolate adversarial countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this can be seen working in practice. The United States built a 35-country coalition to repel Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Amid the war in Ukraine, U.S. partners and allies in the Middle East have been circumspect about aligning with the United States against Russia. They have been reluctant to condemn Russian actions and reluctant to enforce sanctions against Russian entities. It is easy to see how this trend advances Chinese interests. If states are reluctant to act collectively against Russian aggression, they are even less likely to act against future Chinese aggression, should it occur. After all, most countries have only distant relationships with Russia. China is the leading trading partner of most of these countries, an important source of technology and infrastructure, and a country that most assess to be a rising global power. Even Western European countries with deep and strategic U.S. ties and long histories of close cooperation with the United States are uneasy about being drawn into a Sino-American rivalry. Middle Eastern states that see diminishing U.S. interest in the region are even more reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper U.S. response to this set of circumstances is threefold: establishing a clearer set of U.S. priorities, making a clear-eyed assessment of partners’ motivations, and crafting a mix of incentives and consequences to shape partners’ behavior. The first of these is both the most obvious and most important. The United States must determine where the Middle East fits into the U.S. global posture. Too often in recent years, U.S. visions for the region have been asserted negatively rather than positively, as an indication of what the United States will no longer do — or what it will no longer do to excess — rather than what it will. Yet, the Biden administration’s commitment to align U.S. ambitions in the Middle East with available resources without specifying those resources has led many to judge that the drop-off will be acute. In addition, dramatic shifts in policy and strategy between different administrations, and in particular the Trump administration’s skepticism of alliances and the Biden administration’s warm embrace of them, cannot help but provoke hedging behavior by allies and partners alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is little that any presidential administration can do about the policies of its predecessors and successors, there is much that it can do to assert its own priorities. Still, administrations are often reluctant to do so with much clarity. This is in part because the U.S. system often finds it far easier to accrue priorities than dispense of them. It also reflects a concern that publicly shedding priorities has more costs than benefits. U.S. national security advisers often fall back on the formulation that “the President has no higher priority” to reassure audiences, inadvertently highlighting the profound challenge of even beginning to order the myriad objectives of U.S. foreign policy. Even so, a clearer U.S. articulation of its enduring priorities — including but not limited to energy security through the energy transition, freedom of navigation for global seaborne trade, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism — is a task of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this priority, the United States needs to redefine the U.S. security role in the region from policeman to security partner. For more than five decades, the U.S. security approach has been to push Middle Eastern militaries to build capabilities that are complementary to U.S. capabilities while simultaneously pushing them to buy U.S. equipment. The consistent assumption has been that in the event of actual hostilities, U.S. soldiers would do much of the fighting and dying. The American public is increasingly skeptical of that bargain. A more sustainable approach would have two components. The first is to push regional states to develop more genuine capabilities, as Israel has done for some time and the UAE has done more recently. Rather than end direct U.S. support, as some have advocated, the goal here is to raise the threshold of actions that require direct U.S. support. Developing these capabilities is a multi-decade process that must touch on everything from personnel to logistics to acquisitions to doctrine, as the Saudis have discovered since embarking on their own defense reform effort. Enhancing these efforts needs to be a strategic priority for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of redefining the U.S. security role is to make good on two decades of efforts by U.S. administrations to integrate the security capabilities of regional states. Many are too small by themselves to develop full-spectrum capabilities, but the ability to operate as a coalition — which requires efforts to align doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities, as well as aligning efforts at early warning — would give each a significantly larger margin of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the instinct of many is to use speeches and statements to proclaim bold U.S. intentions and then work toward making them a reality, it is the wrong approach here. The approach the U.S. government should adopt is to act first and create a record of accomplishment, and then deliver speeches and statements that connect the dots for a skeptical audience. The security space is not only one of profound U.S. advantage compared to China, but also one where China is unlikely to be able to compete effectively for decades, if ever. There are two principal challenges for the United States here: managing a maturing in these security ties while maintaining the confidence of partners and maintaining enough influence with partners to dissuade them from embarking on open-ended military adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing a clearer set of U.S. priorities, the second piece of the puzzle is gaining a better understanding of how Middle Eastern states view the potential for deeper relationships with both the United States and China. Part of China’s attraction is the government’s ability to make and implement agreements swiftly, and part is the lower cost of Chinese goods. Part, too, is the sense that opening up to China gives them leverage in all of their negotiations, on everything from pricing to terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of speed, the U.S. government needs to see its slow and bureaucratic processes for what they are: a competitive liability against China, and thus a strategic vulnerability. Some of these processes are well justified to ensure proper diligence, some are a consequence of law, and some are a consequence of bureaucratic inertia and accumulations of custom. To the extent that the U.S. government identifies great power competition as a core security concern across all domains of government, and not just the Department of Defense, accelerating U.S. government decisionmaking and implementation needs to become a strategic priority — across the entire interagency process and on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition must push U.S. officials to both understand what the Chinese are offering and what Middle Eastern states are seeking. To do so, they must put as much time into understanding what the Chinese government puts on offer as Chinese officials do of their American counterparts. Some Arab officials report that when Chinese delegations come in, they essentially red-team the U.S. side, presenting what they believe the U.S. proposal will be, at what price, and with what conditions. They then present their own counteroffer. Too often, U.S. officials take comfort in the logic of the superiority of the U.S. side and presume to know the needs and expectations of their partners. Yet, the result is that Middle Eastern states sometimes treat U.S. cooperation as a luxury good: something that is too expensive to rely on every day and something that should be acquired only in instances when it can be seen easily or when superior performance is vital. Thinking creatively and critically about the U.S. value proposition, and understanding better how to both enhance it and articulate it, is a vital priority that is too often neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a competitive perspective, the hardest puzzle for the United States to address is its desire to move the world toward systems that embrace human rights and rule of law, as well as China’s hostility to linking morality with international affairs. That difference — which should be sustained — is likely to represent a persistent aspect of advantage to China. Yet, it need not be a debilitating difference. The United States has had enough experiences in its history, both further back and in the more recent past, to have some humility about the effects of its choices and the strength of its foresight. Countries as different as South Korea, Chile, and the Czech Republic have taken very different paths toward greater democratization, and countries such as Peru and Myanmar have once seemed on a very different democratizing course and endured significant backsliding. Massive U.S. efforts to promote democratization in Iraq and Afghanistan have fallen profoundly short of their goals. The United States should not seek to be the referee of whether countries’ political and economic journeys are in the right direction and at the right pace, nor should it see itself as the principal catalyst for change in foreign lands. Efforts should focus on both the complexity and necessary duration of efforts to foster positive change. The United States should seek to reward those inside of government and out who make courageous efforts to build more robust systems that support the rule of law and ensure that the U.S. political system serves as a positive example to countries around the world. The last part is the hardest, but ultimately, it is the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece — imposing consequences for negative behavior and incentivizing good behavior — is far easier to describe than to execute. It has several aspects. The first is reaching a clearer internal understanding of what is most important. As noted above, the U.S. system is often bad at prioritization, and it accrues objectives far better than it sheds them. U.S. government bureaucracies each seek to advance their own priorities, and they are often quite different. Yet, from the perspective of target countries, the U.S. system produces a muddle of demands that cannot possibly all be satisfied, and that even the United States does not expect to be fully satisfied. A clearer set of targets from the U.S. side — in what areas and regarding what issues the United States insists on being preeminent — would help address this weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is the need to maintain discipline in imposing consequences for malfeasance. When adversaries and competitors are waiting in the wings to fill gaps that the United States leaves, there can be a U.S. instinct to seek comity and compromise. Creating credibility for U.S. parameters worldwide is more important than any single deal or any single relationship. Communicating this effectively to partners and allies is both delicate and difficult, although a more streamlined set of priorities should ease this task. When the U.S. response is both clear and expected, it may become less necessary over time. In this regard, the United States already has demonstrated important guardrails on Middle Eastern states’ Chinese ties. For example, an agreement to sell the F-35 fighter to the UAE has been delayed, reportedly because of U.S. concerns that the UAE’s installation of Huawei’s 5G telecommunications network would open the door to deeper Chinese understandings of U.S. weapons capabilities. The Emiratis suspended talks over the deal in December 2021, and the agreement may not go through at all. Both sides have expressed their limits, and each appears willing to walk away from a significant agreement that each side wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third aspect is being willing to invest in incentives. Priorities help here, but equally important is a sense of both empathy toward regional governments as well as creativity. The Middle East is looking at profound change in the coming decades as young graduates flood the workforce and the energy transition upends economies. In the near term, cheap Chinese infrastructure can buy political support, but long-term political survival requires solutions with technical, educational, vocational, and business components. The United States has a considerable comparative advantage in these areas. China builds things for money and repatriates the profits to China. U.S. companies invest in people and processes, and they develop management cadres that endure for decades. The legacy of Aramco, which began as a consortium of four U.S. oil companies, is instructive in this regard. It became an increasingly Saudi company that for decades has produced ministers and the country’s top technical, engineering, and management talent. There are few major projects in the kingdom that do not have leadership that encompasses at least some Aramco alumni, and Aramco is a company that is shot through with U.S. DNA. As the region prepares for the coming transition, it will need an invigorated cadre of people and institutions that stay in the region, not foreign construction workers who return home to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When combined with the possibility that some adversaries, such as Iran, may have an even harder time with these challenges and provoke additional security threats as they struggle, the U.S. security proposition, when embedded in a broader economic growth relationship, becomes even stronger. Although the sentiment in the United States often seems to trend toward divesting from the Middle East, investments tied to encouraging closer ties are more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, the energy transition appears destined to enrich the region in the near term, as low-cost production (in terms both of dollars and carbon emissions) will give Middle Eastern producers a larger share of global markets, even as those markets are shrinking. Awareness of the challenges ahead is also making regional leaders especially focused on their long-term sustainability. China’s own economic problems, partly self-inflicted during the coronavirus pandemic, dim China’s luster. As the region went through a period of writing off the United States and its sustained interest, its sense of comfort and entitlement has diminished. A focused U.S. effort would not need to be expensive, and it could reap broad returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected to all of this is a need to bring the U.S. public along. The United States cannot effectively compete with China in the Middle East when many Americans are hostile to U.S. involvement there. Decades of war have persuaded the U.S. public that the Middle East’s most serious challenges have military solutions, and they resent putting U.S. soldiers’ lives at risk in exchange for arms sales. The Middle East will remain vital to the global economy and to global security for decades to come. Even if the United States is principally focused on China, China and the world will have a strong focus on the Middle East, and the United States will need one too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have to find an alternative to condescendingly screaming at people not to follow the China model,” a U.S. military veteran with long experience in the Middle East explained. “I think that liberal democracy, capitalist democracy, scares the shit out of them. It’s not entirely consistent with their culture and their history . . . and it was brought there by the colonizers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for many in the United States, it is unimaginable that the U.S. model of economic and political development would not have universal appeal. Small minorities with financial or political stakes in the status quo would be expected to defend their privilege, but the masses should be naturally pro-American. After all, for many in the United States, the country is a “city upon a hill,” as John Winthrop admonished fellow New Englanders almost 400 years ago — some combination of a manifestation of divine providence and a model for global emulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, Americans took their missionary heritage and set out to replicate U.S. conditions abroad. U.S. officials were convinced that securing the country required blocking Marxist inroads in the developing world and expanding the circle of freedom to reach the billions who lived there. The U.S. historical experience was their template for using economic and political development to help prosecute the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War ended and a unipolar world emerged, echoes of the same instinct to equate global economic prosperity and freedom with U.S. security emerged after 9/11. The Bush administration made unprecedented efforts — and investments — to spread democratic institutions and improve governance throughout the Middle East. Speaking to the National Endowment for Democracy in 2003, President George W. Bush argued, “Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for, and standing for — and the advance of freedom leads to peace.” He added his belief that “the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress of a people are directly determined by [the] extent of their liberty,” and the rise of middle classes strong enough to protect their rights contributes to the spread of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, U.S. officials had confidence that economic growth would help guide “China’s peaceful rise.” In the estimation of then deputy secretary of state Robert Zoellick in 2005, “China does not believe that its future depends on overturning the fundamental order of the international system. In fact, quite the reverse: Chinese leaders have decided that their success depends on being networked with the modern world.” As a more integrated China became more prosperous, Zoellick suggested, China would open up internally, because “closed politics cannot be a permanent feature of Chinese society. It is simply not sustainable — as economic growth continues, better-off Chinese will want a greater say in their future, and pressure builds for political reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative then, through 75 years of U.S. policy, was that the world was ineluctably moving toward greater freedom, prosperity, and peace. U.S. policy to promote imitation of the U.S. path would hasten that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has had a different narrative, predicated on the country assuming its rightful place in world affairs after more than a century of humiliation and subjugation. China has had no interest in following a U.S. path, nor has it thought one was necessary. Instead, China has been cautious and circumspect while pushing its global rise. It has led with trade, touted its embrace of “win-win solutions,” and widely advertised its commitment to noninterference in the domestic affairs of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is an especially sensitive case for China. The country’s economic growth depends on imported energy, about half of which comes from the Middle East. Yet, China recognizes that the United States has been the overwhelmingly dominant power in the region for more than a half-century, with an unequaled military and diplomatic presence. China is wary of conflict with the United States in the Middle East, and it neither seeks to compete head-to-head with the United States nor to displace it. Instead, China’s regional strategy is to make its own inroads in the region while neither getting bogged down nor tipping the Middle East into instability. Doing so means enticing countries currently aligned with the United States to adopt a more unaligned posture, using state-directed economic engagement as its calling card. China explicitly contrasts itself with the United States, noting that as a state it can move more quickly and predictably, that it neither second-guesses nor lectures to its partners, and that its goal is not to remake them in China’s own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle for much of this is the impression — probably stronger in the Middle East than in China itself — that there is a China model for radical economic transformation without an accompanying social and political disruption. The “China experience,” as some Chinese prefer to call it, is an impressive one: decades of double-digit growth accompanied by huge investments in industrialization and massive internal migration. Yet, Arab states impressed with China’s remarkable rise often seem more interested in China’s outcome rather than the path it took to get there, and China has little interest in inspiring imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what is important to both China and the Arab states is undermining the presumed Western monopoly on pathways to development. Societies premised on Lockean notions of natural rights, the sanctity of the individual, and the centrality of private property are understood to be but one of an array of options. The Chinese experience gives Arab states leverage to resist Western efforts to reshape their societies, introduces what the Chinese presumably see as a useful friction between Arab states and the West, and adds luster to bilateral cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its allies, a proper assessment of the situation is the first step to addressing it. China is not trying to supplant the United States, it is trying to supplement it. U.S. partners and allies in the Middle East — and the region contains eight “major non-NATO allies” of the United States — are similarly seeking to supplement their U.S. relationship. They partly want military equipment the United States is reluctant to sell, and they partly want investment and financing for capital development projects. Even more, though, they want to be courted, to not be taken for granted, and to be able to pursue benefits from every corner. Just as all four of President Donald Trump’s addresses to the UN General Assembly called for the United States to pursue an “America first” strategy, and for every other country to do the same, virtually all Middle Eastern states believe they would benefit from more aggressively pursuing their own individual interests and adopting positions of greater nonalignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context matters here. No Middle Eastern country is seeking to follow a China model with any fidelity; at the same time, no country thinks it is either realistic or desirable to take a purely American path. No Middle Eastern country considers itself to be “premodern,” and as a consequence, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century clarity that inspired countries such as Turkey and Japan to pursue radical modernization along the lines of the Soviet Union or imperial Germany has yielded to a muddle of incremental options. Governments are seeking to grow their strength, balancing efficiency and effectiveness with stability, security, and resources. They see improved governance as a tool with both costs and benefits, and they see it as obtainable irrespective of whether they follow a more authoritarian or liberal path. Indeed, there are aspects in which China’s governance outperforms the United States. These countries view themselves not as choosing between options but among them, experimenting with contradictory initiatives in hopes of making gradual but steady improvements in an increasingly crowded and noisy policy environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many in the Middle East, pure imitation of the U.S. path is both unwise and unattainable. It relies on citizens who are entirely different from their own, in a robust legal and policy environment and a vibrant economy. For years, Arab officials visiting Washington have averred that U.S. democracy took 200 years to reach its current state and that they need a century and a half to catch up. The Arab uprisings of 2011 continue to reverberate in the region. In places such as Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen, governments continue to struggle to assert control over their entire territory; in other places, governments see potential revolutionaries continuing to lurk. The United States needs to be sensitive to the charge that it is both sanctimonious and reckless, lecturing partners while leading them into anarchy. Under current conditions, many regional governments consider mainstream U.S. advice to constrain government authority, liberalize political activity, dispense with patronage, expand free speech, and empower political opponents to be madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the United States is not without options. The U.S. government needs to be clearer that in seeking a world that is more prosperous and stable, it is not seeking mere imitation. Every country will treat its own issues in its own way, but should countries seek partnership, the United States is both a superior choice and a possible one. It needs to better articulate the benefits of a closer alignment, the costs of a looser one, and the criteria by which closeness is judged. The answer to this question is likely to vary from administration to administration, which itself will promote some hedging behavior from regional partners. Even so, a clearer framework — and one that allows for both resilience and dynamism — would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already we have seen the U.S. government articulate redlines for Chinese engagement, particularly on issues of technology, infrastructure, and military hardware. This is appropriate. Yet, the United States should not seek to list comprehensively every activity it frowns upon, implicitly encouraging partners to come right up to the line of what is permitted and what is forbidden. The United States should be clearer in outlining principles and examples, pushing partner states to judge what is consistent with acceptable boundaries and what is outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more important than communicating the costs of some kinds of Chinese ties, the United States needs to help its partners better understand the unique value proposition of closer U.S. ties, especially when it comes to the development of human capital that will shape the region’s future in the next five decades. China’s offerings in this regard are weak, not only in terms of university education, but also in terms of developing management experience. China’s record of empowering local employees in the Middle East and grooming them to take on leadership positions pales in comparison to the United States and its allies. While there is certainly a role for Chinese-style industrial development in countries’ overall plans, it is hard to imagine it provides a pathway toward national prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In science and technology, a key to future prosperity, Western science — especially in the United States — developed a robust Covid-19 vaccination. Leaving aside the question of Chinese officials’ role in containing the Covid-19 virus in its earliest stages, China’s broad efforts to promote a homegrown vaccine and distribute it widely made good headlines but not good public health outcomes. Reports of widespread vaccine hesitancy throughout the Arab world to take the Chinese vaccine validate the fundamental U.S. value proposition: the United States provides robust solutions to complicated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On economic issues as well, a U.S.-guided path toward more open markets, a well-functioning banking system, and a capable and well-educated workforce may not provide the “sugar rush” of results that directed government grants (or in the case of wealthy Gulf states, government spending) provides, but it provides benefits that endure. U.S. government officials have no monopoly on wisdom in this area, and they need to work hand-in-hand with private sector leaders in business and banking to develop robust systems, but as U.S. allies in East Asia demonstrate, these patterns develop virtuous circles that endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The superiority of such systems is likely to become more evident as the “Chinese economic miracle” recedes in the public memory, the Chinese economy cools off in the post-Covid era, and China begins to grapple with the economic realities of a shrinking population. Strong patterns of growth in U.S. partners such as India, some of which are being boosted by Gulf investment, can help reinforce this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of these opportunities, the United States will need to continue to push for ways to lower the transaction costs of partnering with the United States. A combination of law, regulation, and U.S. bureaucratic inertia can mean that straightforward transactions can take months or years to implement. Chinese officials regularly approach Arab officials with proposals for economic cooperation — one said, “I receive a proposal every week” — while sometimes explicitly “red-teaming” the U.S. government response by outlining the timeline and conditions of U.S. cooperation while explicitly outlining a supposedly superior Chinese offer. Within the parameters of law, the U.S. government should seek ways to advance the agility of its decisionmaking process. It should explore amendments to laws that would speed up implementation while preserving necessary checks on abuse. Too often, Arab officials say, the United States acts as if it has a monopoly. One of China’s advantages to them is that it reminds them that they have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, though, the United States needs to remember that Middle Eastern states are not making a choice as they did during the Cold War. There is no Iron Curtain, and the dilemma is not to choose sides. These states see themselves in a dynamic market in which they are constantly seeking to assess their own worth and sense the demand signals. In this, the United States has significant advantages alongside some vulnerabilities. No country is seeking to fall into a Chinese orbit, and China has no interest in creating an orbit into which they can fall. Likewise, few seek to isolate themselves from the United States. The United States is likely to remain predominant in the region as long as it seeks to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, China is seeking to chip away at U.S. hegemony in the Middle East, undermining efforts to strengthen a U.S.-led global system that the Chinese government views as directed against it. The idea of a China model to which states can aspire helps advance Chinese goals in this regard, if only to entice states to push back on the United States and draw closer to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China and the United States are each other’s largest trading partners, both sides understand that competition, contestation, and cooperation necessarily coexist. It will be so in the Middle East as well. Sharpening understandings of the value of close U.S. partnership, lowering the costs of maintaining U.S. partnership, and clarifying the consequences of undermining U.S. partnerships in the Middle East provide the best path forward for U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the afternoon of 17 September, pagers belonging to Hezbollah fighters, collaborators and civilian supporters exploded across Lebanon. The pagers beeped for a few seconds before exploding, leading to injuries primarily to the face and eyes. By the following morning, 11 people were dead and more than 2,000 injured. Among the injured were senior Hezbollah officials and the Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini. While initially, two main theories – a cyber attack and the use of explosives – emerged, it soon became apparent that tiny quantities of explosives had been placed in the pagers sometime between production and distribution. The pagers were distributed widely among Hezbollah and its affiliates and were part of a batch only recently purchased by the group. While the attack represented a security breach for the group, it constituted a great success for Israel and (likely) Mossad, even if – as some suggest – Israel was in a “use them or lose them” predicament. The attack also raises important issues that have to do with the conduct and signalling function of covert operations, international legality and legitimacy, and the increasing risk of regional escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is confirmed that Israel used explosives hidden in the pagers, such an operation entails both novel and recurring elements in Israel’s (covert) foreign policy. The attack is unprecedented in terms of scale and reach. It occurred in a denied country where it should be harder for Israel to conduct operations. Be that as it may, Israel has shown great ability to target individuals in Beirut and even Tehran in recent months. The number of pagers distributed is also impressive, as is the ability to modify them to explode simultaneously. Such prowess also entails an ability to interfere effectively in a supply and distribution chain. The operation to sabotage the supply chain and insert a few grams of explosives in the devices must have taken months. It remains unclear when this intervention took place. The pagers were seemingly produced under the label Gold Apollo, a Taiwan-based company, but the president of the company was quick to distance it from the attack. Instead, he pointed the finger at BAC, a company based in Budapest with the rights to produce under the Gold Apollo label. The operation’s conduct and outcome is likely to have provided Israel with an even better picture of the group, its collaborators, its capabilities and its main locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The operation is likely to damage Hezbollah’s morale, and many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is not the first time that Israel has used explosives; it has often hidden them in civilian items and/or communication technology. As Ronen Bergman detailed in his history of Israel’s use of assassination, the practice was particularly prevalent in the late 1970s. In Lebanon, in a close historical precedent, Israel placed explosives in oil and fuel drums that were later distributed to the families of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters. Explosives have also been used in the assassination of high-level targets. In 1973, Israel hid explosives in the marble stand of the phone of PLO leader Mahmoud Hamshari in Paris. Having confirmed Hamshari’s identity by phone, Israel exploded the device. He was severely injured and later died in hospital. In 1996, Shin Bet assassinated Yahya Ayyash, Hamas’s chief bomb-maker, by smuggling a small explosive into his mobile phone, which was then remotely detonated. Perhaps more famously, in 2009, in collaboration with the CIA and then Director Michael Hayden – who had received the green light from President George W Bush – Israel killed the terrorist Imad Mugniyeh by placing a bomb in the spare wheel compartment of his SUV, an area not checked by his security detail, while he was in Damascus, Syria. More generally, Israel is not the only country that has explored the use of explosives, often placed in “exotic devices” for use in assassination. The US government and the CIA famously developed explosive cigars and considered an explosive seashell in their many attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. The explosive seashell plot was ultimately abandoned, and it isn’t entirely clear what happened to the cigars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the practicalities of the operation, on which more details are likely to emerge in the next few weeks, a key question is the rationale behind the operation. One can think of many possible answers. First, the wide-ranging attack and the targeting of individuals including civilians, as well as collaborators in civilian settings, points to the aim of terrorising the local population. Such an attack could be considered a form of psychological warfare. Early reports after the attack pointed to the level of chaos in Lebanon: overcrowded and struggling hospitals, traffic and ambulances coming to a standstill, general shock among the population, and a fear of answering phone calls. Second, as with many covert operations, part of the rationale was signalling. Here, the target was not solely the Lebanese population at large, but Hezbollah and its collaborators more specifically. The manner in which the attack occurred highlights this dimension. In February, Hezbollah’s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah had warned his fighters against using their phones. They are more dangerous than Israeli spies, he had warned, pointing to how they had been used to track and kill Hezbollah fighters and leaders. While the group had used pages for years, this increased after Nasrallah’s call and after the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as revenge for the 7 October attacks. Israel has long demonstrated prowess in exploiting hi-tech devices for its operations, including assassination; such a widespread attack against low-tech objects tells Hezbollah that it has nowhere to hide. In this case, the operation is likely to damage Hezbollah’s morale and – from a more practical point of view – many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries. Third, the attack will also have reverberations within the international community and international politics. It will increase concerns surrounding supply-chain sabotage, with a greater focus on low-tech items in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel has increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to emerging rumours, Israel might have decided to conduct the operation earlier than it expected, when some Hezbollah leaders raised concerns about the pagers. If this is the case, one could speculate that the initial aim of the operation might have been to target specific high-level individuals, perhaps including the Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon, Amini, who was among the thousands injured in the attack. Another theory currently floating around is that the attack – had it happened when Israel wanted – would have been the first salvo in a broader attack against Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the attack certainly violated Lebanese sovereignty. Questions remain regarding the proportionality and the effort to distinguish civilians from combatants in conducting the attack. While Israel might have known who the carriers of the pagers were, it would not have known where they would have been located at the time of the explosion. Israel has disregarded international humanitarian law and international human rights law in many of its recent operations against Gaza, Hamas and Hezbollah. It has also increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war. This is particularly glaring since the attack happened one day after the visit of Amos Hochstein, senior envoy of the Biden administration, whose mission aimed to prevent a further regional escalation. The US, which has struggled to moderate its regional ally – often contributing to the war effort – was not told in detail of the operation. According to Axios, Israeli Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant only warned US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin moments before the attack that an “intelligence operation” was about to take place. As with many similar operations, then, Israel has put the ball into Hezbollah’s and its regional allies’ – primarily Iran’s – court. Will they respond with a further escalation as they have threatened, or will they de-escalate? At the same time, has the Biden administration lost credibility and leverage with Israel and those it is fighting?&lt;/p&gt;

This monograph explores America’s evolving role on the world stage and highlights key strategies to navigate the critical shifts reshaping the international landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events of the past four years have triggered a fundamental shift in the global international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war and China’s political alignment with Russia have brought an end to the era of global economic integration. Geopolitical forces are intricately reshaping political and economic landscapes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has adopted a new philosophy, replacing the “hide and bide” strategy of the past. President Xi has developed a more assertive posture, politically, diplomatically, and militarily. Tensions have risen in the South China Sea over artificial islands and claims over exclusive sovereignty. Japan has transitioned from a modest defense posture to doubling its defense spending. India is seeking greater cooperation and coordination with the United States on defense matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic prompted corporations to undergo a fundamental reassessment of global supply chains. During the 30 years prior, businesses primarily drove global sourcing of materials and components by pursuing the lowest input costs. In the post-Covid era, the reliability of supply has become an equally important factor in these decisions, causing a shift or a duplication of supply chains as hedges for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ascent in the global manufacturing value chain has heightened tensions with other manufacturing power centers, particularly concerning goods related to the energy transition. Europe and the United States are now considering trade restrictions on electric vehicles and batteries. This builds on U.S. restrictions regarding semiconductors, causing a geopolitically driven rift in global economic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic consensus on active international leadership is now a debated issue in Congress and between the presidential candidates. The role of the United States as the global indispensable leader was set over 70 years ago. America’s allies are now rich. American politicians and citizens are now actively questioning: Do we need to spend so much of our national treasure on defending wealthy distant allies while we have security challenges at our border? What is the true value of American international political leadership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global South countries (defined here as countries with low-income economies, generally in the Southern Hemisphere) question the value to them of blindly following the so-called Washington Consensus. Joining the Western-dominated international political and economic order hasn’t accelerated their development. China offers a compelling alternative model and resources to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modest-burdens-enormous-benefits&quot;&gt;Modest Burdens, Enormous Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of America’s long-term strategy was to build an operating international order that was based on three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consensus with key partner countries on the fundamental values, notably rule of law, government accountability, and constructive international cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alliances with key partners most fundamental to our security interests&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Active participation in international organizations that directly benefited American well-being&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government’s international affairs budget currently is less than 20 percent of the total federal budget and amounts to approximately 3.5 percent of GNP including defense-related expenditures. While the defense budget is enormous, in relative terms it is a small burden for the U.S. economy. The development budget and the cost of diplomacy is a tiny percentage of GNP and a very small percentage of federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit from these investments is enormous. U.S. alliances and partnerships have created a global security environment that greatly favored U.S. interests and benefited the U.S. economy. America’s per capita and national income have soared above all other countries in the world over the past 50 years, outpacing all major allies; collectively with our allies, we dwarf the income capacities of opponents, despite the burdens of international leadership. The United States and Europe primarily set the norms for most global industrial standards, ensuring market access for American products; U.S-established global business norms have given American products pricing power compared to competitors. Americans travel the world freely and at unprecedentedly low costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While America’s prosperity has outpaced all others over the last half century, our prosperity is not uniformly distributed. There are wide and widening disparities of opportunity and benefit in American society. If the United States is to secure a stronger future, it must address these disparities. But neither political party has a coherent growth agenda for the future. One of the most pressing requirements for a secure future is to build a national strategy to grow the economy, and to do so in ways that do not exacerbate inequality or environmental quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will only be achieved with a much stronger commitment to innovation as the cornerstone of a national economic strategy. The economy must grow and become more productive. That will come only with a stronger commitment to making innovation the centerpiece of a domestic economic strategy. This requires greater spending on research and development, strengthening the patent system, and changing immigration policies to recruit more highly skilled talent to help innovate in the field of cutting-edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competing-more-effectively-on-the-global-stage&quot;&gt;Competing More Effectively on the Global Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing economy and a more dynamic and open society will be attractive to people around the world. Still, it will not address the fundamental challenge of competing effectively in the Global South. At present, China brings tangible benefits to lower-income countries, while the United States often brings strong lectures about its virtue and paltry support for tangible activities. China has supplanted the United States and Europe as the primary trading partner with African countries. China offers attractive financing for development projects, and increasingly, Chinese companies are making major investments in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes at a time when populations — particularly in Africa — are exploding. The challenges this presents to the world could be enormous — continued pressure on the climate, heightened levels of migration, challenges of new pandemics. America and our allies have a direct and tangible opportunity to help foster accelerated economic growth in the Global South to effectively address these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities of such rapid growth. But this takes a more thoughtful development strategy than we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs to return to an earlier vision of boosting economic growth in poorer countries. This can only be practically accomplished by the private sector. The U.S. government development agenda now needs to emphasize enhancing economic growth through promoting private sector investments in the Global South. The U.S. government also needs to address the risk headwinds that currently drive up borrowing costs in the Global South. It has the authorities and institutions to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is deep questioning of whether America can or should remain the leader of the international order it created 70 years ago. There are overwhelming benefits to American citizens by retaining global leadership — benefits that directly contribute to the security and prosperity of individual American citizens. But this will require creating a national strategy that builds on the structural advantages we created and updates them for our day. What follows is only a framework, not a comprehensive delineation of actions. It does contain sufficient specific recommendations for initial implementation. At its core, it requires a consensus that it is fundamentally in America’s self-interest to again welcome the burden of global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategic-framework-for-the-twenty-first-century&quot;&gt;A Strategic Framework for the Twenty-First Century&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs a new strategy for the international order that is emerging. China has become a formidable strategic competitor. Often this new era is framed as a new “cold war,” but it would be a huge mistake to label it as such. To understand why the analogy is wrong, we need to first review the factors that informed the Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-world-in-19461950&quot;&gt;The World in 1946–1950&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to World War II, America never sought global leadership or responsibility. In the 1800s, America was consumed by managing its internal energies and tensions. Slavery, left unresolved by the formation of the United States, led to a tragic and consuming civil war. The government was absorbed by securing its borders and territories, keeping the British government and the Royal Navy at arm’s length, and establishing the foundations for astounding economic growth, fueled by technology-driven expansion in productivity and exploitation of the vast resources of the country. At the end of the nineteenth century, American leaders sought a larger international role, but exclusively on their own terms. The United States avoided the geopolitics of Europe and cherry-picked its larger involvement in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War II changed everything. Where America could retreat from the larger international order after previous wars, it could not do so at the end of World War II. The country initially faced two overwhelming problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Europe was shattered by two wars separated by a massive recession. World War I proved enervating to the leadership sentiments of European government leaders. World War II broke their economies and displaced tens of millions of people. Allied armies met in Germany after crushing the Wehrmacht. Initially, the United States hoped to rapidly demobilize and convert its war economy toward renewed domestic rebuilding. But the Soviet Union sought to retain a massive military establishment and expropriate resources from what was left of Europe to help rebuild the Russian economy. Europe was prostrate, and the Soviet Union was prepared to use military power to install compliant governments as far as it could. The starkly different political systems — the authoritarian model of the Soviet Union and the liberal, open economic model of the United States — were now directly in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American leaders realized that it was in the country’s core national interest to help rebuild Europe consistent with American political and economic values. This required neutralizing the threat of the Red Army that continued to occupy Eastern European territories captured from Nazi Germany while helping to rebuild Western European economies with liberal political ideals and free market economic principles. America needed to retain a large standing military in peacetime, breaking with a tradition that went back to its founding. The country also needed to take the lead in rebuilding the economic foundations of a new international order, built on American values of an open market economy and rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem that confronted America’s leaders was in part a derivative of the collapse of Europe. The old colonial European empires were losing vitality, accelerated by the enervating impact of World War I. World War II shattered what little remained of the old European-centric colonial system. Within only a few years, dozens and dozens of former colonies now emerged as new states. But which alternative economic system would prevail: the U.S-led system built on liberal government, free market principles, and the rule of law, or the Soviet Union’s system of command mobilization and authoritarianism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-bretton-woods&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 1 Bretton Woods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While World War II was ongoing, the United States started thinking about the world after the war. The country was dedicated to creating a new global system that would promote commercial ties around Western concepts such as due process and transparent markets. What emerged was the so-called Bretton Woods system. The United States initially envisioned a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate international commerce and monetary systems. This led to promoting the establishment of three major institutions: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (then called the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development), and the International Trade Organization, which would set rules and adjudicate disputes, thereby promoting expanded global trade. The U.S. Senate supported creating the IMF and the World Bank but rejected establishing the International Trade Organization. That forced the Truman administration to support a weaker alternative, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT remained in effect until the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deal with both problems, but especially the second, the United States took the lead to create a system of international organizations that would manage problems that extended past the sovereign remit of any individual country. The priority was economic reconstruction, and what became the so-called Bretton Woods system (see Box 1). Working with wartime allies, the United States pushed to create the United Nations. Everyone had lived through the profound failure of the League of Nations experiment. The authors of the United Nations conceived of a more balanced system that recognized the realpolitik interests of the great powers but also provided a normative structure for the aspirations and interests of newly emerging countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War era advanced, there was further elaboration on the structure that U.S. government leaders created in the early days after World War II. The United States expanded the Bretton Woods institutions beyond the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The UN system became more sophisticated and diverse. The United States augmented its defense agenda with NATO and bilateral defense and security treaties and agreements. The foundation was set. The United States would be an active leader in the world, with its military ensuring security while its diplomacy and commercial activity would help build an international system of institutions designed to promote broad prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grand strategy that emerged in the competition with the Soviet Union was a big success. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1989–1991, unable to sustain its economic model, afford such a massive security establishment (both domestic and military), and keep subordinate allies in line. It all collapsed, thankfully without widespread violence. As discussed below, the end of the Soviet Union was not the end of history, instead leading to the happy emergence of a benign international order built around Western liberal economic and political values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-is-not-your-grandfathers-cold-war&quot;&gt;This Is Not Your Grandfather’s Cold War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superficially, there are broad strokes of comparability between the Cold War and the current era. The current geopolitical competition with China (and secondarily with Russia) is fundamentally a standoff between two competing political philosophies about how best to structure and lead countries. The United States, Europe, and many important ally and partner countries, including in Asia, share a political philosophy in which the role of government is to ensure a fair and level playing field for the private sector. The government works to balance the interests and demands of individual liberty with the collective requirements of an orderly society. This “Western” model is based on concepts such as the rule of law; open (but regulated) markets; due process in judicial, political, and administrative procedures; transparent governmental decisionmaking; an open and free press; and open and free elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China embraced an authoritarian command mobilization model. The government’s legitimacy derives not from a mandate from citizens but from the transcending authority of a sole dominant political party. The Chinese Communist Party decides what is best for individual citizens and for society. China has adapted some structures from the Western model, but there is no question where power lies, or with whom the coercive powers of the state reside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great competition with the Soviet Union was primarily a military and a diplomatic competition. The Soviet Union was never an economic competitor. By contrast, China is an economic powerhouse, with four times as many potential consumers as the United States. It sets the political terms of access to Western companies that want to compete in the Chinese market. Neighboring Asian countries cannot resist the enormous economic pull of the vast Chinese market. The government provides enormous subsidies to start-up companies and to education and research establishments. China has created an impressive array of university laboratories and centers that are engaged in cutting-edge research. The government collects intelligence on other countries and companies, stealing intellectual property. China has also been effective in its diplomatic outreach to countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South America, championing the interests of poor countries against the interests of rich Northern Hemisphere countries, tapping into the lingering resentment over colonialism and the general disregard by American leaders for the issues of the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, China is a full-dimension competitor, unlike the Soviet Union. China offers a development model that is far more compelling than was that offered by the Soviet Union, and it has mass and momentum in its diplomacy. But there are other factors that make this era starkly different from the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while the United States remains the largest economy in the world, it is not the towering, dominant actor on the global stage. Whereas America’s economy was roughly 50 percent of world GDP in 1946, it is only slightly more than 15 percent today, after adjusting for purchasing power. In 1950, human talent was highly concentrated in American universities and research facilities. Today, human talent is global and connected in unprecedented ways through modern communication systems. The United States continues to dominate global financial markets, but many new tools are available to individuals, corporations, and countries to work around U.S. financial dominance. The United States is an innovation powerhouse, but so too are Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Israel, and, increasingly, many other pockets around the world. America remains strong, but not omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, despite its strengths, America’s political system is now fractured, disputatious, and dispiriting. Both dominant political parties have adopted the same strategy to win elections — mobilize their angry base voters and exploit real or invented flaws in the opponent to sway unaffiliated voters. Fear and anger are seen as more powerful motivating sentiments to win elections than are specific proposals or broad sentiments of hope and encouragement. This rancorous politics projects grotesque images on the international stage, images exploited by opponents and occasionally by friends. It is hard to see how America can continue to be a welcome leader in the world when it is riven by bitter politics at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, technological advances are moving far faster than the ability of democratic governments to deal with the implications of these technologies. Social media has turbocharged anger and divisiveness in U.S. politics. But there is absolutely no consensus on how the U.S. government should manage the problem. The astounding advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) will only amplify this gap between social and commercial developments and government policy. The speed of technological advancements far exceeds the deliberative pace of government. The ultimate “product” of government is due process, which takes time. The widening gap between advancing technology and government review is now a challenging problem. These technology developments accelerate a broader political pattern seen over the past 60 years where priority is often given to the rights of personal liberty and private benefit over the collective needs of a community. There has also been a sharp rise in alienation in American society, propelled mightily by social media that has no objective standards for truthfulness. Reading or seeing something that validates one’s prejudices now constitutes evidence in popular political discourse, making the task of explaining the complexities of problems and the sophistication of policy formulations all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted a fundamental issue concerning modern commerce and society. Problems move speedily around the world, but the mechanisms of coordinating effective response are weak and fractured. All of the complex and hard problems in the world today are “horizontal,” but all sovereign governments are “vertical.” Really hard problems — pandemics, illegal drugs, refugees and migration, climate change and pollution, illegal money laundering, and terrorism — span far beyond the reach of any individual country, no matter how powerful. By contrast, the structures of international collaboration and coordination are weak. Poverty and weak governance in a distant land create fertile conditions for criminality and terrorism. For example, weak regulatory systems in China show up as a flood of precursor chemicals fueling dangerous illegal drug manufacturing in Mexico and the United States. The problems confronting the world today are more complex and multidimensional than was the case in the late 1940s, while the structure of coordination (and even the competency of governments) has remained static, at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, countries in the so-called Global South no longer see Northern Hemisphere countries as benefactors or agents of positive change. There is a deep and widely held view that Europe and the United States have largely ignored the needs of the Global South. By contrast, China has effectively presented itself as a “developing” country, sharing the sentiments of aspiring Global South governments and citizens. Developing countries see commercial protectionism enacted by rich countries. Countries in the Global North will gladly take university-educated citizens but block poor migrants. Climate change advocates champion renewable energy sources to low-income countries without recognizing that many of these countries place a higher priority on affordable energy for economic development. International institutions seem structurally biased in favor of the wealthy countries in the Northern Hemisphere. The International Criminal Court seems only to concentrate on wayward African leaders, but never confronting leaders of developed countries. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the ambivalence that countries in the Global South feel about a conflict that they see as unrelated to their needs or aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of 2023 is not at all like the world of 1947 and 1948. The strategy that successfully guided the United States through the Cold War will not be adequate for the current day. The United States needs a new national strategy to navigate these complicated waters. What follows is not a strategy. Instead, this report proposes a framework for thinking strategically about the United States’ choices and directions. There was no blueprint master plan to survive and succeed during the Cold War. Many of the most important elements of the Cold War strategy emerged only when America confronted an intractable new problem. The strategy for this new era will be similar, but there are outlines of a framework that could guide the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-survive-as-a-nation&quot;&gt;To Survive as a Nation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common for corporations and other organizations to adopt a mission statement. The most apt mission statement for the U.S. government is simple: to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people. The U.S. Constitution used different terms but clearly articulated these goals in the opening sentence by stating that the purpose of the new American government is to “provide for the common defense” and to “promote the general Welfare” of American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days following World War II, the immediate problem facing U.S. government leaders concerned the security of a shattered Europe. Tensions with the Soviet Union built up during the war but soon became an urgent priority. This led the United States to break with history and to maintain a large standing military establishment, augmented by alliances and partnerships, and to shape the international environment by creating a network of organizations and procedures that would influence the emerging world along lines more favorable to U.S. national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;starting-with-what-we-inherited&quot;&gt;Starting with What We Inherited&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a strategy, you need to know your goals. What are national goals? Every modern American president usually adopts a formal National Security Strategy. But these documents outline the administration’s security strategy, not a grand strategy for America’s future. Presidents usually articulate elements of a national strategy as part of a political agenda to promote their party’s philosophy of governing. The United States does not have a tradition of developing an integrated national strategy that incorporates all of its potential resources, channeled to accomplish specific goals. And a national strategy requires identifying what the country will not do as a nation, which is hard in a polyglot society with a geographically defined representative legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, the United States lacks the government structure to develop such a strategy. Congress is divided into dozens of committees and hundreds of subcommittees. There is no way for Congress to develop an integrated national strategy. In theory, a president could create a national strategy, but the cabinet system divides operational jurisdictions into over a dozen stovepipes, hardened by congressional oversight that impedes cross-cutting integration. Within the White House, the president has a National Security Council and a National Economic Council, each competing for the president’s time and focus. Important elements of the U.S. economy — such as U.S. universities and research institutions — have only a weak channel into the most senior levels of decisionmaking in the White House. In short, the country lacks a structural focus for creating a new national strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop a new national strategy, we return to the fundamental mission statement for the U.S. government from the Constitution: to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people — to “establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two great pillars of a national strategy must deal with these primary goals: (1) to survive as a nation, and (2) to prosper as a people. This report will explore them separately, but they are inextricably connected. Security is a prerequisite for prosperity, and prosperity is required to support the structures of government that guarantee security. As stated by a wise observer, “We must be safe before we can get rich, and we must get rich to remain safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustain-hard-defense-resources&quot;&gt;Sustain Hard Defense Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the United States pursued two primary channels for national security in the early years of the Cold War. The first was to maintain in peacetime a large and sophisticated military establishment and to base elements of that force in countries close to the enemy. These actions were seen as necessary to deter hostile forces acting against U.S. interests. The United States continues to maintain a large and sophisticated military establishment and continues to deploy military units around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long-standing bipartisan consensus is now being challenged. Conservatives are divided. A growing faction argues that the United States should pull back from foreign deployments and focus on domestic security needs, such as securing the southern border of the country. This group of conservatives questions the need for massive defense spending. The other group of conservatives — still a majority, but a declining one — believes that the country has weakened the military through inadequate investment in new kit. These conservatives challenge the Biden administration and have increased the administration’s defense budget request every year. Meanwhile, some progressives argue that the United States spends as much on national defense as the next eight countries combined. Democrats support current operations because they do not want to undercut a Democratic president, but progressives are primed to shift funds from defense budgets to domestic needs when the politics permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these obviously significant differences in priorities, annual adjustments to defense spending and to the defense establishment are relatively minor, reflecting a general consensus among voters. Generally, the American public wants a significant military establishment and accepts the argument that basing forces forward to support allies is beneficial to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States must sustain a strong military, the country must take a serious look at how efficiently it spends money on national defense. The defense budget is enormous, by any measure. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, Congress appropriated $853.0 billion for defense spending. We need to put this in context, however. It is critical to exclude the war costs of the past 20 years. However, even including those costs, the $853 billion is not hugely out of scale with spending in the past. FY 1985 saw the peak spending of the so-called Reagan buildup years. When President Reagan came to office, he campaigned on the poor conditions of the U.S. military and weak defense spending in the Carter budget years. President Reagan sought to reverse the decline of spending following the Vietnam War. The height of the Reagan buildup — expressed in FY 2024 dollars — was $718.6 billion. Adjusting this year’s $853 billion to FY 2024 inflation brings it to $877.8 billion. So the spending appropriated by Congress in FY 2023 was 22 percent greater in real terms than the height of the Reagan buildup in 1984. But it is instructive to compare what the United States bought with these two budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, the United States had nearly 300,000 military personnel stationed in Europe. Today, that number is just 66,326. The United States stationed 41,718 Army and Air Force personnel in South Korea in 1985. Today, that number has shrunk to approximately 25,372. In the intervening 40 years, the United States has had five rounds of base closures and has closed over 300 military facilities. In short, with a budget that is 22 percent larger today, the country has a significantly smaller military force than at the height of the Cold War. It is therefore critical to understand how the country is spending more and getting less every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there have been new mission requirements. There was no Cyber Command back in 1984, space-based resources were more limited, and the U.S. intelligence community has grown significantly, particularly since September 11, 2001, with much of the budget embedded in Department of Defense (DoD) accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the primary reason why this United States is spending more and getting less is there has been far too little fundamental modernization of the DoD organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Congress passed the hugely important Goldwater-Nichols reform legislation in 1986, which fundamentally transformed and improved the warfighting capabilities of the DoD. At that time, Congress presumed that wars would be fought through the regional combatant commands — European Command, Central Command, Pacific Command, and Southern Command. But the United States does not fight wars through the unified commands. Today the country establishes joint task forces to conduct actual combat operations, yet the formal structure of regional combatant commands and sub-unified commands has remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two headquarters staffs in the Pentagon — the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Staff of the Joint Chiefs. Neither staff fights wars, except against each other in conference rooms. These two staffs largely parallel each other, with little value added for the redundancy. And both have grown hugely over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, American business removed the institutional barriers between warehouse and transportation functions. Now the private sector seamlessly manages goods, whether they are located on a truck in transit, in a warehouse in stockpiles, in vendor inventories, or on supermarket shelves. The DoD has made only tiny progress in adopting streamlined operations for matériel support. The last real reform occurred over 30 years ago when some administrative functions (such as finance and accounting) were removed from the military departments and placed in expanded defense agencies. Still, ancient business practices persist with astounding inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress has periodically legislated reforms on the DoD, but the result has been a larger, more cumbersome bureaucracy. The number of Senate-confirmed positions has grown from 47 (excluding the trustees of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences) to 66 over the past 38 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement costs have also soared, while the quantities of kit being delivered have shrunk. Enormous sums are required for overhead functions. The result is that the country has accommodated soaring costs by shrinking the size of its military forces and buying less-modern equipment for operating units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the United States needs to retain a strong and capable military force. But the current trend is not a viable path. It needs serious reform and faces hard choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress also needs to scale back the astounding micromanagement it imposes on the DoD. The National Defense Authorization Act in 1985 was 169 pages. In FY 2023, the annual authorization act was over 1,770 pages. There has been an explosion in the size of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. In 1985, there were 18 senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Today there are 25. The House Armed Services Committee grew from 44 to 59 over the same period. More members inherently mean more congressional staff, resulting in ever-greater micromanagement of the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of greater impact, Congress blocks needed efficiencies proposed by the DoD. Congress refuses to close surplus and unneeded facilities, to rationalize its extended laboratory system, or to shut down or streamline depots and arsenals. Congress will often stipulate that a military department must continue to operate an obsolete weapon system in order to preserve activity at bases in members’ congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD is certainly responsible for inefficient use of resources, but Congress equally shares blame for massive waste of resources through micromanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should continue to support a significant military establishment and sustain forward basing and operations of U.S. forces as an essential element of U.S. security strategy. But extending current activities and practices will erode U.S. capabilities over time. The United States now needs a fundamental management streamlining of the DoD. Congress should lead the way by cutting the size of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees by 50 percent and cutting the staff on the defense committees by a similar amount. Fewer people will lead to less micromanagement. Congress should commission a nonpartisan commission of experts and former members of Congress to identify fundamental streamlining opportunities for the DoD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shaping-the-international-environment-to-favor-national-goals&quot;&gt;Shaping the International Environment to Favor National Goals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second element of the Cold War strategy is still relevant, but there is less consensus on its content. In the early days of the Cold War era, the United States sought to create a network of institutions that would establish global norms of behavior and expectations. These global norms were fundamentally favorable to American interests and included principles such as the rule of law, stable and convertible currencies, the relaxation of barriers to commerce and investment, due process in judicial and administrative proceedings, the prioritization of peaceful dispute resolution and diplomacy, and a normative bias toward representative government and the rights of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to pause at this point and reflect more directly on the purpose of creating international institutions and norms. The French philosopher Henri Bergson is credited for once saying (my wording) man invents ideas, but institutions sustain them. The purpose of creating institutions is to establish the sustaining framework that embodies the policy goals and norms desired to be implemented by a government, and to teach those norms to rising generations through the work of those institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States took the lead to create institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and United Nations as well as the UN agencies, regional development banks, security alliances, and bilateral treaties. This was all done for the same purpose: to shape the future in ways that would make it easier to achieve American interests. America’s leaders believed that the interests of other countries would be served by these institutions as well. But the United States did not create them or support them because of some detached nobility of sentiment. It created them because they would help the United States achieve its national goals. Fortunately, what was excellent for the United States also proved good for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for a global superpower. Most countries — including other great powers — have numerous interests, some in tension with other interests. But no country has the same span of interests as the United States. It is very hard for a global superpower to provide the focus and intellectual capacity required to manage dozens of challenging developments. Having a network of international institutions shaped generally around U.S. political values is enormously beneficial to the country’s national goals. Many of these problems can be managed primarily within an institutional framework that is favorable to American values, but without requiring intense American involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, any international treaty and treaty-based institution does constrain sovereign flexibility to varying degrees. Historically, the United States has managed this in several different ways. The first, obviously, is to not agree to join the organization or sign the agreement. The United States has refused to join the International Criminal Court because of concern that third parties would turn the court against the United States for a political agenda. The United States has also refused to sign treaties that would be beneficial to U.S. interests — such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Ideological opposition tracing back 40 years continues to stymie ratification of a treaty that becomes more important every year. But abstinence is the default choice in the face of controversy. The second option involves some form of a “sovereign immunity” clause that allows the signatory parties to uphold core fundamental interests of their nations. But the third and most common way that sovereign states have protected their interests is to design the relevant international institution in such a way that its powers are inherently weak and cannot threaten core national interests. We see this vividly in the UN Security Council. The United States and other World War II powers ensured their flexibility by giving themselves permanent veto rights over any action proposed in the council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have brought a new phenomenon. The United States has participated in drafting treaties, only to then decide not to enter into the treaty for domestic political reasons. Presidential administrations state that they will observe the conditions of the treaty, but the Senate opts not to ratify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nations craft ways to preserve their sovereign flexibility when they join treaty-based international institutions or enter into treaties, the point remains that we ratify treaties and join international organizations because there is more benefit than risk in the work of the institution. Countries join treaties and treaty-based organizations that constrain independent national flexibility because those rules also constrain the flexibility of other countries, which is perceived to have greater value in the long run than any perceived loss of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliances-partnerships-and-international-organizations&quot;&gt;Alliances, Partnerships, and International Organizations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed earlier, America set out on a course after World War II that it had previously avoided. The United States entered treaty-based alliances, bilateral security agreements, and treaty-based international organizations. The impulse was not based on romantic idealism or philanthropy. America created these structures to shape the international environment, bending issues into predetermined channels where we had support from others to deal with the problem. Below, we will examine each of these dimensions of structured international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE RISE OF STANDING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern agenda of creating more effective international institutions accelerated in the years after World War II. America and allied countries anticipated the collapse of the previous European-based international order. The United States invited allied countries before D-Day to participate in a series of conferences to create a new international finance structure. The purpose was to facilitate the reconstruction of war-damaged economies, to establish a durable framework for stable exchange rates for international commerce, and to create a framework for helping the economic development of former colonies that gained independence following the collapse of the old European imperial system. Remembering the trauma of the global recession following World War I and the dreadful political consequences that emerged during that time, the Bretton Woods system envisioned a world of open markets, reduced barriers to trade, and international mechanisms to assist in the resolution of national financial crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-multinational-governance&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 2 Multinational Governance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multinational governing institutions are a relatively new innovation. The first functional international institutions were the International Telegraph Convention in 1865 and the Universal Postal Convention in 1874. The first International Sanitary Conference in 1851 was Europe’s effort to prevent the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases following the opening of the Suez Canal. Still, it took four decades to produce a more permanent framework for public health.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and U.S. allies launched a parallel effort to replace the ineffective League of Nations. On April 25, 1945 — before the formal end of the war, but with victory in sight — 50 nations met in San Francisco to start the process of drafting a charter for the United Nations. A core dilemma challenged the drafters of the UN Charter: Should the structure of the United Nations be built around the practical power reality of the day, or should it be designed to promote the world we wanted to create? The League of Nations failed because it could not balance the practical power dynamics of the interwar period with the idealism codified in the league’s charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drafters sought to accomplish both goals. The UN Security Council was organized around the practical power dynamics of the day. The major wartime allies were given permanent veto authority over any matter brought before the Security Council. Idealism informed the creation of the General Assembly, where all countries had equal standing. Individual countries and groups of countries could stimulate a focus on a topic of interest. The structure of the United Nations sought to balance the world as it existed with the world that leaders wanted to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been consistent arguments for reforming the UN Security Council. Most countries naturally resent the permanent veto rights given to the victors of a war concluded nearly 80 years ago. While the United States and China represent leading powers today, the other three permanent members have declined in global power. Still, their positions as permanent members of the Security Council ensure that they will not tolerate a dilution of their status. Any meaningful reform is unlikely in the near term (see Box 3). Presently, the Security Council is significantly frozen because of the war in Ukraine and growing tensions between authoritarian powers such as Russia and China and their Western counterparts such as the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-challenges-to-reforming-the-un-security-council&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 3 Challenges to Reforming the UN Security Council&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Efforts to reform the UN Security Council started in 1993. The G4 countries — Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan — have pushed to become permanent members because of their considerable economies and regional influence. A group of countries informally called the Coffee Club opposed the G4 and proposed instead to restructure the Security Council on the basis of regional representation. The African Union has proposed that two African states be made permanent members, though individual African states cannot agree on which two should be given those privileges. In short, regional and international rivalries continue to confound any serious effort to reform the body.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growing Ambivalence about the United Nations and the UN System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is considerable ambivalence within American political circles about the United Nations, there are important functions undertaken by the UN system which Americans need and value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing political problems in the absence of a functioning government:&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States has not used the United Nations in this capacity in recent years, one of the body’s valuable functions is to step in to serve as the provisional administrative authority when countries or regions lack a coherent government entity. The deterioration of governance in Haiti is a good example of where this function has been used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undertaking peacekeeping operations when core U.S. interests are not at stake:&lt;/strong&gt; Presently, there are 12 UN peacekeeping operations around the world. The United States contributes funding and some administrative support to these operations, but largely they are executed by forces contributed from other countries operating under a UN Security Council mandate (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping to establish standards for international commercial activity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Nations has several agencies that provide a global forum for important activities that require explicit international standards. For example, the World Intellectual Property Organization works to facilitate protection of intellectual property throughout the world and to harmonize national legislation when there is disagreement. The International Civil Aviation Organization coordinates global standards for safety, environmental preservation, security, and operational efficiency for worldwide commercial aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating international response to natural disasters and humanitarian need:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) operates the world’s largest healthcare delivery organization, administering over 2 billion vaccinations annually to low-income countries and communities. The World Health Organization took the lead in helping African countries deal with the recent Ebola virus outbreaks. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme deliver critical food to countries enduring famine or war-related food insecurity. While criticized in the United States for its ambivalence during the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization remained the only authoritative source of advice and support for the vast majority of lower-income countries in the world. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) mobilizes aid for and supports crisis-affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing nuclear activity:&lt;/strong&gt; The International Atomic Energy Agency sets standards for safety and security for civilian facilities around the world and is a fundamental monitoring agency to detect the diversion of commercial nuclear resources for covert development of nuclear weapons (see discussion in Chapter 5).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are examples of activities undertaken by international institutions that are valuable to the United States. Not all UN agencies are uniformly helpful, but they serve an important function that benefits America’s security, economy, and society. As a nation, the United States would struggle to sustain the pace and rhythm of modern life and manage a wide range of second-tier problems without the United Nations and its agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stronger U.S. Support — and Stronger Oversight — for the United Nations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost from the outset, the United Nations was beset with great power competition and controversy. But in recent years, America’s enthusiasm for the United Nations has waned dramatically. Giving Cuba the chairmanship of the UN Human Rights Council struck most Americans as absurd and offensive. For many years, the United Nations considered resolutions condemning Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. The United States often had to veto these resolutions, which contributed to growing disenchantment with the United Nations in U.S. political circles. This has only become far more intense now with the ongoing war in Gaza. The UN system has become a platform for amplifying the agenda of nongovernmental organizations, many with a goal of forcing change on U.S. stances on foreign relations. This has fueled the critique that the United Nations threatens U.S. sovereignty. And there are frequent reports of abusive behavior by UN peacekeeping forces toward civilian populations. All of these problems have contributed to a significant deterioration in support for the United Nations among American political figures. These criticisms are valid, but they do not negate the value of having a functioning organization that can coordinate needed international collaboration when it is directly or indirectly affecting American interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the United Nations and the wider UN agency system have considerable legitimacy and moral authority around the world, both to governments and individuals. While the United Nations may not enjoy high standing in the United States, it is highly regarded around the world. The United States’ strained relationship with the United Nations wins the country no admiration in these nations and capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made a major push to become a leader within the UN system. It has sought leadership roles in major UN agencies and contributes thousands of peacekeeping soldiers to UN operations while the United States contributes almost none. Table 3 below shows the top 10 state contributors of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations as of 2022. China is 10th in the world. The United States, with 30 staff officers and 3 experts on mission, ranks 78th. The United Nations has been a major channel through which China has projected its claims to better represent the interests of developing countries. China is on the march within the UN system, while the United States is often observing from the sidelines, occasionally booing the play of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6dzaL7O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations does offer significant benefits to the United States. But there are legitimate questions about its efficiency and the accountability of UN leaders and agencies. The United States should continue to support the United Nations, but it should also take a larger role in leading UN deliberations. In exchange, the United States needs greater accountability of UN leaders and operations to restore credibility that the United Nations is worthy of U.S. support. The United States should join other like-minded countries to demand a stronger process of performance reviews and assessments of UN activities. The United Nations needs an independent inspector general function that reports to the Security Council, not just the secretary general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should strengthen its work through the United Nations but demand new structures to evaluate the effectiveness of UN agencies and personnel. This should include the creation of an independent inspector general, reporting directly to the Security Council. The G7 countries should jointly establish performance standards for the new inspector general structure and issue biennial reports on the efficacy of the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADAPT AND STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries join security alliances for varying reasons. It might be to draw more strength to manage a core problem facing the country. It may be to strengthen another country whose security is judged essential to its own national interests. It might be to present a more complex security challenge to an opponent. The reasons vary, but they all share a common attribute: treaty-based security alliances are designed to provide strategic depth for a country. The United States joined or created military alliances after World War II because the agreements added strategic depth to our sovereign power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a second common reason for security alliances. These structures are normative, creating a framework for a shared agenda of security-related political objectives. The framework developed by one generation of leaders carries over to succeeding generations so long as the conditions attendant to the treaty remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was evident in the way NATO responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Even though Ukraine was not a signatory member of NATO, Europe collectively saw the risk posed to the continent if Russian aggression was not countered. The NATO treaty gave structure and coherence to the deliberations before and following the invasion and led to an aligned response across the spectrum of European politics and priorities. The compelling attributes of NATO led both Finland and Sweden to seek membership. Nearly 75 years after the founding of NATO, national leaders today understand the structure of defense and the values of the alliance because of the normative qualities of standing treaties. And again, for emphasis, the NATO treaty provides strategic depth for all signatories, and especially for the United States. America’s primary security priority today focuses on Asia and managing the rise of China as a superpower. NATO makes it possible for America to make decisive contributions in Europe while sustaining its strategic focus in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine also highlights yet again the relatively weak defense capabilities of European countries. European countries have generously donated combat equipment to Ukraine, but few of the weapons have been accompanied by spare parts or maintenance equipment. Munition stocks are thin. European defense establishments still devote excessive percentages of resources to parochial infrastructure, such as national training establishments, parallel command headquarters, and redundant acquisition establishments. The United States still must provide the integrating structure and impetus for collective action by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retool NATO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is gratifying to see the focus and energy in Europe on defense matters, now is the time to undertake serious retooling of NATO. At the end of the Cold War, NATO shifted its focus to preparing and integrating new member states. The political dimension of NATO grew, and warfighting preparedness declined. When Russia invaded Crimea, there were no operational war planners in NATO headquarters. The regional war-fighting headquarters had been disestablished. There were no operational command structures between the NATO operational headquarters and a battalion in the field. Since 2014, America and European partners have undertaken strong efforts to put muscle tone back into NATO. These organizational and operational investments have been crucial in the current effort to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine now highlights the underlying strategic premise of NATO: it is a collective security alliance designed for unified action against a direct threat to members of the alliance. The only direct threat to NATO comes from a revanchist Russia. Clearly now there are four primary theaters of combat facing NATO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcing Finland primarily and the Nordic states secondarily&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing the Baltic Sea for unfettered NATO operations and commercial navigation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcing the central frontline states (primarily Poland, the Baltic states, and possibly Ukraine in the future) against a ground invasion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing effective air and missile defenses for all of Europe&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO now needs to realign its operational command structure around these four theaters of operation. In addition, NATO needs a serious restructuring of the support mechanisms required for combat operations. This would include a NATO-wide logistics and transportation command, a NATO-wide training organization for advanced combat and combat support training, and a NATO-wide command to manage test-and-training ranges and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently individual countries largely make solo decisions about procurement priorities and organizational competencies. There is no blueprint for what the European side of NATO needs for capabilities and where it stands in providing those capabilities through the efforts of individual member nations. The European component of NATO needs organizational rationalization as well as a blueprint to guide forward plans and investments by individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: NATO should establish four new operational command headquarters for the four primary security theaters of operation, and it should create new NATO-wide commands for vital combat support functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While NATO is inherently valuable as an operational collective security structure, it is especially important because America’s strategic security focus has shifted to Asia. Back in 2011, President Obama directed a strategic security review in light of the budget agreement with congressional Republicans to cut back on defense spending as part of a broader agreement to constrain federal budgets. At the conclusion of that review, President Obama proposed a “pivot to Asia.” He was then criticized because while the pivot was welcome, there was no subsequent buildup of forces in Asia. This policy shift was made in the context of plans for major defense budget reductions. President Obama basically committed to preserve U.S. military strength and operational pace in the Pacific while cutting back on military activities in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salient importance of this pivot was not recognized at the time. It was the first time in American history when the U.S. government said that Asia, not Europe, was the country’s highest security priority. This remains true, despite active U.S. support of Ukraine through NATO. The war in Ukraine would have been far more challenging for the United States had the framework of NATO not been in place to share the burden of reinforcing Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are things that can and should be done to strengthen NATO further. European defense ministries are still woefully underpowered because so much of their budgetary resources are devoted to purposes such as redundant headquarters, training establishments, and acquisition bureaucracies. Collectively, European NATO partners have spoken for years about rationalization, pooling, and sharing of resources. But very little has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ demand for modernizing NATO must go beyond hectoring European countries to spend more money. There needs to be a concrete blueprint for what the European element of NATO can and should become in the future. Rather than just tuck into various areas of American-led forces, Europe needs a coherent integrated defense capability. And that can come only through serious rationalization of defense contributions, consistent with a blueprint that would produce a coherent integrated European defense establishment. This should be the current focus, using the recent experience of Russian aggression as a yardstick for measuring how well European defense forces could manage an invasion like that experienced by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should demand that European NATO countries develop a comprehensive plan for an integrated defense capability that can accomplish the four tasks noted above. The United States should provide technical support as needed, but Europe needs to develop its side of the alliance and build a self-standing defense capability, with the United States playing a reinforcing role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. PARTNERSHIPS IN ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense in Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean War globalized the great security standoff with the Soviet Union. The victory of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, followed by the Korean War, convinced American government leaders at the time that communism was on the march and that Asia needed a collective security structure like NATO. In September 1954, the United States and seven other countries created the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Tellingly, five of the eight countries — Australia, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States — were primarily culturally European. Both the Philippines and Thailand were treaty partners to the United States, and Pakistan joined primarily to seek support in its standoff against India. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were given presumed military protection through a protocol instrument but were never formally part of SEATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATO had no organic roots in Southeast Asia, despite its name. It lacked geographical propinquity. The central organizing concept was alignment against the Soviet Union and China, which led as many countries to eschew membership as to join. Pakistan pulled out in 1973, South Vietnam was defeated in 1975, and SEATO formally ended in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States was developing deeper security structures with Japan and South Korea on a bilateral basis, which met with greater success. The threat posed by China was more immediate, and the United States had opportunities to create a much wider range of contact points with both countries than it did with Southeast Asian countries. The Korean War caused the United States to retain significant conventional combat forces in Japan and South Korea and pushed it to focus on developing the domestic political structures of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security ties with Japan and South Korea were important, but even more important was the way both countries would develop powerful, vibrant economies that generally embraced U.S.-European geoeconomic norms. America kept significant military forces in both countries as part of the larger security structure designed to manage the rise of China in Asia. Initially, the United States had a containment strategy for China, but that shifted dramatically with President Nixon’s outreach to China, which was accelerated by China’s decision in 1978 to drop a policy of autarky and instead open its economy to global markets and global investments. The security dimension of the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea relationship remained relevant, but the transition within China following the economic reforms shifted the focus to economic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needed both Japan and South Korea as major components of its security architecture. This was complicated by the tensions that remained between them, significantly because of Japan’s brutal occupation of the Korean Peninsula prior to and through World War II. Most recently, the Biden administration has demonstrated considerable skill in creating a working trilateral relationship. The rise of a more pugnacious China, the continued bellicosity of North Korea, and the election of pragmatic politicians as prime minister and president respectively in Japan and South Korea with prominent security agendas have led to landmark structures of closer collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Asia remains a theater where security arrangements represent networks of relationships, but with no overarching security structure like NATO. The most important recent development is the establishment of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, most commonly called the Quad. The Quad is comprised of four countries — Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. It was initially proposed by Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo back in 2007 in conversation with Australian prime minister John Howard, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, and U.S. vice president Dick Cheney. The idea languished for a decade as political sentiments shifted in Australia, India, and Japan. In 2017, three new leaders plus Abe again committed to support the Quad dialogue, stimulated by concerns over Chinese island building in the South China Sea. Started during the Trump presidency, the Quad picked up momentum under President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad is not and will never be a security treaty, despite China’s loud complaint that it is a mini-NATO. There is no geographical propinquity to the Quad, and each country has wide-ranging political and economic priorities that are at times in tension with each other. The unifying feature of the Quad, however, is a concern about a rising, more pugnacious China and the need for coordination to counter Chinese political and military intimidation in the region. The Quad will also likely never grow into a larger group. The unstated but obvious purpose of the Quad is to counter China. No other country in the region wants to join the Quad, knowing it will unleash intense pressure from China. There is no need for more members. Each of the four members of the Quad brings its own networks of diplomacy, commercial ties and mutual support agreements with other countries in the region. The Quad is primarily a network of networks providing reassurance and stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Void: The Lack of an American Trade Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the security framework architecture for Asia is in place, there is a gaping void with the absence of a real American trade policy for the region. For most countries in Asia, foreign policy is trade policy. The value of a comprehensive trade policy for Asia is that it becomes the backbone of a rules-based international system of mutual interest and support (see Box 4). In 2006, four small economies in the Pacific region developed an economic framework that expanded to become the most ambitious trade agreement in recent times. In 2009, the United States joined this process and sought to use its leverage to create higher standards and a broader structure for the agreement. What emerged was the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which President Obama formally endorsed in the spring of 2016. Opposition in Congress (Republicans did not want to give President Obama a victory, and Democrats were cowed by opposition from labor unions and environmentalists) prevented ratification during the Obama administration. President Trump subsequently withdrew from the treaty on January 23, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-from-tpp-to-cptpp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 4 From TPP to CPTPP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2006, four countries across the Indo-Pacific developed a trade agreement to bring their economies closer together. The four countries — Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore — established an agreement lowering trade barriers and increasing interconnection. The agreement showed benefits, and soon other countries expressed interest in joining. By 2009, eight additional countries sought to join, creating new pressures and challenges to reaching agreement. To work through those issues, negotiations began on what became known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP, negotiated between 2009 and 2016, brought together 12 countries from North and South America, Asia, and Oceania, in what was intended as one of the world’s largest free trade agreements. The other 11 countries (beyond the United States) collectively represented the largest bloc of exports from the United States to the rest of the world. Proponents of the agreement argued that it would result in more than 1 percent annual growth for participating countries. Within the United States, this could have amounted to approximately $131 billion in increased annual income, additional jobs, and increased U.S. exports up to $357 billion annually by 2030.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The TPP was more than a trade agreement. It also represented a geopolitical effort to establish a new standard for international trade that raised the bar in a range of areas such as environmental and labor standards, requiring countries to reach those standards before entry. This was important because it was increasingly clear to countries around the world by 2016 that China was backsliding on its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession commitments to make progress toward a range of WTO standards. Even though it was backsliding, China represented too large a share of companies’ profits for countries to threaten meaningful consequences to China for noncompliance with its commitments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Within the United States, however, the TPP faced significant opposition. The academic community was not uniform in its support. Several studies showed that the TPP may actually have resulted in a loss of jobs and a reduction in GDP due to trade dislocation. With negotiations only establishing the final text in 2016, the crucial push to sign and ratify the agreement would have had to come in the middle of a presidential election campaign. President Obama’s public position on the TPP was tepid. Republicans in Congress were disinterested in providing a political “win” to Obama and the Democratic Party amid an election season. Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed opposition to the TPP on the campaign trail. Then candidate Donald Trump pledged to withdraw from the TPP on “day one” of his administration. Only two days into his administration, he made good on that commitment and withdrew the United States from the TPP, effectively killing the effort for all parties because the rules of the agreement would come into force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The remaining 11 countries that had negotiated the TPP, however, were unwilling to let their own benefits fall by the wayside because of a U.S. decision. Under leadership from Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo, the TPP-11, as they came to be known, reconvened and negotiated a similar agreement, this time called the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This agreement came into force for the first signatories on December 30, 2018, and an additional six countries have applied for membership. Among those countries, the United Kingdom has been granted membership, and China, Taiwan, and Ukraine have all applied for membership.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the United States withdrew from the TPP, the agreement was not ratifiable under its existing terms. The late prime minister Abe saw an opportunity for Japan to play a larger leadership role in Asia. Japan took the lead, using the bulk of the TPP agreement as the basis for a streamlined version relabeled as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). For Abe, even without U.S. participation, the CPTPP was important for setting rules for trade that were not based on a Sino-centric view. Presidents Trump and Biden have since ignored it, and the United States remains outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to criticism that it lacked a trade policy, the Biden administration has proposed something called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The title reveals its true nature. IPEF is just a framework, outlining the conditions that the United States will insist upon in discussing trade matters with other Asian countries. Asian partners and allies have met IPEF with a polite yawn. Asian countries believe IPEF offers few tangible benefits. They are willing to engage the United States through IPEF, believing that this is as much as the United States can muster these days. And while there are small steps forward within the IPEF framework, for all practical purposes the United States has no real trade policy for Asia. This is a theater where trade policy is he foundation for foreign policy. The sad irony is that the Biden administration often champions an international rules-based order as its strategic objective. That was what the TPP was and now the CPTPP is. But it is not something the Biden administration will now champion or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States needs to either join the CPTPP agreement or implement elements of it to become a partner in regional trade dynamics in Asia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-prosper-as-a-people&quot;&gt;To Prosper as a People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence states clearly the purpose of the U.S. government, specifically enshrining the goals of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The pursuit of happiness sounds a bit superficial, but fundamentally it means the government should enhance the well-being and prosperity of its citizens. This forms the second great element of our national strategy framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unites States has not done badly over the past 50 years. In 1970, the income per capita was a little less than $26,000 (expressed in constant 2015 dollars). By 2021, this figure exceeded $60,000, far higher than the world average of around $11,000 as shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to other countries, the United States started with a remarkable set of advantages — a large landmass with very productive agricultural resources, abundant mineral and energy resources, long coastlines on two oceans with good harbors, relatively temperate climatic conditions, and a tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world. Many of America’s strengths are also grounded in decisions made — and sustained — by governments and institutions over time. The United States remains a world leader in university-level education, with top-notch businesses, strong government and nongovernmental institutions, and a dynamic civil society. And the United States retains the most capable military in the world. Each of these attributes of power has contributed to — and derived benefits from — growing prosperity in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eAarsKY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing and diverse population:&lt;/strong&gt; By 2053, the United States is projected to reach a population of more than 370 million, up from 336 million in 2023. About 75 percent of that growth, or about 25.5 million people, is projected to come from net immigration. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of the next 40 years will be people who are “Two or More Races,” suggesting that tomorrow’s Americans will more accurately represent the long-held concept of America as a melting pot. Perhaps as important, tomorrow’s Americans may be better positioned to move within and among global cultures, leveraging America’s diversity as a strength in both diplomacy and business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A world-leading innovation ecosystem:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States remains a world leader with its innovation ecosystem. Arguably, much of that strength starts with the United States’ university system. Global rankings indicate that 39 of the world’s top 100 universities are in the United States, including 17 public universities. The strength of America’s educational institutions translates into a high level of education among Americans. About half of Americans aged 25 to 64 have post-secondary degrees, up from 42 percent in 2010. The education Americans receive enables them to tackle more complicated and sophisticated challenges. Within the United States, approximately $656 billion goes toward research and development every year. Of that, the government share is 22 percent. Finally, the strength of the U.S. innovation ecosystem is globally recognized. The United States is the top destination for foreign patent filers; more non-residents file for patents in the United States than residents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A top-notch business environment:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States remains the strongest consumer and capital market in the world. It provides a high-standards, relatively low-cost business environment for firms. Fifty-nine of the world’s 100 largest firms are in America, with the United States holding 65 percent of total market value, equal to more than $20 trillion. This is more than four times the number of leading companies based in China and four times their market capitalization. There are over 33 million small businesses in the United States, which employ more than 61 million people. Approximately 3.2 million businesses are immigrant owned, employing more than 8 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A vibrant and thriving civil society:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States retains a vibrant and dynamic civil society spanning nonprofits, social support organizations, and religious institutions. There are more than 1.6 million registered charities in the United States. Donations to those charities consistently account for approximately 2 percent of GDP and support approximately 10 percent of the U.S. labor force. Individual contributions provided 64 percent of the support to charities in 2022. This broad spectrum of organizations enables U.S. society to adapt and adjust relatively quickly to shocks, including natural disasters and sudden migration flows, or to better understand the impact of changing laws and policies. Few other countries have such a strong network of civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, these advantages have helped America become an economic powerhouse. Today, it constitutes 25 percent of global GDP (not adjusted for purchasing power parity) despite accounting for only 4 percent of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-progress-is-very-uneven-in-america-today&quot;&gt;Economic Progress Is Very Uneven in America Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate data suggests that America has done very well over the past seven decades. But aggregate data such as income per capita masks a far more complex reality, as shown below with data as of October 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top 10 percent of households by wealth held 69 percent of total household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom 50 percent of households collectively held only 2.54 percent of total household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black and Hispanic families owned only a quarter of the wealth of white families on average.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Families headed by someone with only a high school education had only 22 percent of the wealth of families headed by a graduate from a four-year college or university.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Families headed by someone with less than a high school diploma had only 10 percent of the wealth of families headed by a college graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portion of Americans are born with advantages well beyond the reach of the majority of citizens. The gap between upper-class and lower-class cadres is widening. People who work with their hands find the wind in their faces. People who work with their minds find the wind at their backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strengthening America’s Economy Starts with Addressing the Income Gap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the gap in annual income between high-income workers and medium- and low-income workers has widened significantly. And this has become a major dimension of the United States’ domestic political debate. As was said pointedly in the days during and after the recession of 2009, “blue collar workers lost their jobs and bankers lost their bonuses.” We see a widening gap in incomes between urban centers with high concentrations of “mind workers” and rural and rust-belt America where more workers work with their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widening income and wealth gap matters from a macroeconomic perspective. Flat incomes for the bulk of workers limits their capacity to consume. Soaring incomes of well-compensated workers esult in savings that need to find a channel for investment. The past 30 years of globalization and the opening of the vast Chinese labor market have created enormous disparities in the United States. Competing against 400 million hungry Chinese workers, blue-collar American workers have struggled. Returns to labor have remained flat in real terms. Returns to capital — moving the unconsumed savings of highly compensated individuals — have soared, particularly due to new investment opportunities in Asia. Yes, blue-collar workers have benefited from cheap T-shirts and sneakers manufactured in China, but the widening income gap has also delivered stagnant wages and dying neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has contributed to the great unresolved debate now underway in America about “fairness” in the economy. It was the foundation of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better agenda. In this agenda, progressives defined what they thought it would take to remove the barriers facing blue-collar workers. Conservatives saw it as a massive expansion of government bureaucracies and programs, and a return to redistribution politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report does not choose to enter this debate or take sides in it. It does, however, want to use it as a springboard for its first fundamental observation. America is a rich and prosperous nation, but the distribution of income now is limiting future growth. Roughly 70 to 75 percent of GDP goes to consumption. If wages for the bulk of American workers remain stagnant, future economic growth will be limited. Highly compensated workers end up investing their income in other countries where markets are growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of equal concern is the accumulation of massive deficits caused by our desire to spend more on government than we are prepared to pay through taxes. The federal government now has accumulated deficits exceeding $34 trillion. In addition, we need to add to this figure the over $34 trillion of unfunded commitments for entitlements, such as social security, government pensions, Medicare, and Medicaid. A modern and successful society should provide security for its population, but it also must pay these bills. At present, the United States is pushing these liabilities onto the shoulders of Americans’ children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMITTING TO A GROWTH STRATEGY FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs a new political commitment to economic growth. Progressives are more interested these days in economic justice than they are in economic growth. Progressives also believe economic growth threatens the environment. Conservatives, meanwhile, have become preoccupied with “woke capitalism.” Because the two political parties are so evenly balanced in Congress, the battles are endless and incremental. Strategically important issues fall victim to tactical posturing for temporary advantage in the next election. The Biden administration will argue, with justification, that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was designed to stimulate new jobs in the context of boosting renewable energy. The jury is still out on whether these incentives are sufficient to create the irreversible momentum needed to transform the fundamental position currently held by hydrocarbon energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress did pass, on a bipartisan basis, the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides financial support to boost manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States. The CHIPS Act also provides authorization for a wide range of much-needed support for U.S. universities, research institutes, and other elements of the ideas industry, but only the semiconductor provisions were funded. Still, the CHIPS Act does indicate that the United States can indeed undertake industrial policy on a bipartisan basis. It is doubtful that the CHIPS Act would have passed without the unifying fear of China as a geopolitical and geoeconomic competitor. But the CHIPS Act was authentically bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are welcome examples, but they are exceptions to the current political landscape. Neither political party has a coherent agenda to boost economic growth in America. Without a growing economy, the two political parties will be battling over a shrinking pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: America now needs a coherent and well-developed strategy to expand the economy. Such a strategy must address income disparities to ensure growth is sustainable in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-liberal-conception-of-the-role-of-government&quot;&gt;The Liberal Conception of the Role of Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America is confronting a great competition with China. China has a profoundly different concept for the role of government in Chinese society. America’s concept traces back centuries, drawing heavily on ideas that emerged in the writings of French and English political philosophers as well as movements such as the Scottish Reformation. The purpose of government is to create the appropriate balance between the rights and liberties of individuals and the needs and responsibilities of society. This is best accomplished through a government structure with checks and balances. The best articulation of this is still found in the Federalist Paper No. 51, authored by James Madison: “The great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the other.” One element of the government can effectively stop the unilateral action of another branch. All must work together for a durable new policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In economic matters, the role of government is to ensure a fair and level playing field for the private sector. This requires multiple actions. The government must create and maintain a stable currency. It requires a system for protecting intellectual property that properly balances individual benefit and societal need. The government must establish a fair and transparent legal system based on due process, as well as a system for standardizing specifications for goods and services so that commerce can occur beyond a small neighborhood. In today’s world, this likely means that the government will have to take a greater role in cybersecurity, especially in developing solutions to ensure the authenticity of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this objective and transparent framework, the private sector is free and encouraged to operate based on perceived opportunity. Entrepreneurs will decide what new opportunities can be created. Customers will decide if they want these products or services, and at what price. Technologies advance and open new ideas and channels for entrepreneurs and potentially new products and services for customers. The marketplace decides winners and losers, not the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our political leaders have changed and expanded the definition of what is required to provide a fair and level playing field. Abraham Lincoln felt that America’s future was limited without a significant boost in higher education sponsored by the government. To protect investors in financial markets, the government created the Securities and Exchange Commission. To protect consumers from exposure to adulterated food or dangerous products masquerading as drugs, the government created the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To ensure safe air transportation, the government created the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government plays a significant and vital role in modern American society by ensuring that the marketplace is fair, stable, and safe for consumers who otherwise could not protect themselves through their own agency. This has not been a conflict-free process. The government has expanded as problems were identified and possible solutions were explored and adopted. And political conflict carries on after the establishment of a new policy. In a representative government, conflicting perspectives must be reconciled through a legislative process where all parties have access to the representatives and senators who will ultimately decide what is needed. But the controversy does not end there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive branch regulation is required to implement broad new legal policies, but this “rulemaking” process is always filled with tension and controversy. The politics that lead to the creation of a new government regulatory mandate invariably requires extensive and contentious rulemaking procedures for implementation. Aggrieved parties may take a judicial route to try to change the approach used to implement the legal mandate. And these issues will change as new economic or technological developments advance and require some adjudication in the regulatory process, and sometimes through judicial action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy that accompanies government regulation, there is an important byproduct that has greatly benefited America. Quality government oversight creates value. Stringent regulation of financial markets and a strong judicial system have fundamentally made America’s financial markets attractive for investors worldwide. Stringent regulation of drugs and medical devices has effectively created a value premium for any U.S. product that is approved for sale by the FDA. Stringent air safety standards have made America the aviation leader of the world and ensured that U.S.-manufactured aircraft are valued around the world. High-quality regulations create high-value products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the modern administrative structure of the U.S. government has created enormous inefficiencies through elaborate processes and regulations. Regulatory burdens in the United States result in capital resources moving to other countries where it is easier to build factories and hire people. China has come to dominate the processing of critical and rare-earth metals because America raised environmental standards while China welcomed investment with little regard for the environment. But once these enormously capital-intensive investments have been made, long-term patterns of commerce are locked in. America’s current regulatory environment and culture of litigiousness has become a major factor that will inhibit returning mining and manufacturing to American soil. If America is going to compete more effectively in the future, it needs to streamline the regulatory burden presented to companies and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The government needs to undertake sustained streamlining of regulations, protecting essential goals while lowering the burdens of compliance. Special interest advocacy groups have created excessive ways to slow government deliberations. The Constitution stipulates that accused parties have a right to a speedy trial. This should apply to government regulatory reviews as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-policy&quot;&gt;Industrial Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “industrial policy” was politicized when then president Jimmy Carter tried to boost his flagging popularity before reelection by formally launching a national industrial policy initiative. Candidate Ronald Reagan strongly condemned the idea, and from that moment, the term “industrial policy” has been burdened by politics. Over the past 40 years, “industrial policy” is routinely condemned, but the argument is superficial. In reality, America has always pursued sensible industrial policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln, as a candidate, had two main pillars in his campaign platform. One called for government investment in infrastructure, and the second called for government spending on university education. He followed through, pushing legislation to create incentives to build the transcontinental railroad and encouraging the creation of the so-called land-grant universities that became the backbone of higher education in America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General Dwight D. Eisenhower saw the power of the limited-access, high-speed autobahn road networks in Germany. He recalled his time in the Army in the 1930s, taking three months to move across the United States on poorly designed and constructed roads. When he became president, he pushed to create the Interstate Highway System.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senator Pete Domenici, wanting to help support the Department of Energy’s nuclear labs in his state, pushed for funding in nuclear weapons labs for the first mapping of the human genome, a step that has completely revolutionized modern medicine and biological research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense began developing the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1970s. While designed for the precision targeting of weapons systems, the GPS signal was offered to the public for commercial exploitation. GPS is now ubiquitous in American commerce. It not only makes ride-hailing services possible but is also used as a fundamental resource for synchronizing distributed computer systems, enabling activities such as using credit cards to pay for gasoline at self-serve stations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration initiated a series of public-private partnerships to boost quantum research and development. The Department of Energy funded the costs of these new quantum research centers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just examples of historic steps that America has taken with the explicit goal of creating incentives and structures to promote new economic opportunities and to ultimately enhance prosperity. The CHIPS Act is fully consistent with this rich history of shaping incentives for important new opportunities. These examples share a critical common dimension: American industrial policy generally funds the infrastructure of knowledge that cannot be built through market forces alone. No single company could afford to build a transcontinental railroad back in 1862. But once built, the railroads opened the vast heartland for countless opportunities, such as helping farmers get raw or semi-processed food to distant markets. Research on the genome in a nuclear weapons laboratory created part of the infrastructure that permitted the development of mRNA vaccines to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the obvious need to develop a thoughtful national industrial policy strategy, the U.S. government is poorly suited to create it. Modern commerce and new technologies cut horizontally across the stovepipes of the cabinet departments and across the jurisdictions of congressional committees, which basically map (sometimes a bit incoherently) against the structure of the executive branch departments and agencies. Which cabinet department is responsible for AI? Which cabinet department should take the lead in shaping the realignment of global supply chains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cutting-edge developments and opportunities do not fit neatly in the existing structures of the federal government. They come together only in the White House, but the White House is also the platform for one political party at any one time. Initiatives springing from the White House inherently carry political baggage. America needs a novel way to develop a national industrial and national security strategy. We need a national strategy for making strategic investments, both in the government and in the private sector. Development of that strategy should be sponsored by the U.S. government, but no members of the U.S. government (other than support staff ) should prepare it. A national commission should be appointed for a three-year period to develop a national strategy. Members of the commission would be nominated, half by the president and half by the Congress. All members would have to be confirmed by the Senate. (For administrative support, the commission should be supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.) The commission would be responsible for highlighting important new technological and societal developments that will have significant impact on future prosperity and security, as well as highlighting the gaps in American public and private resources regarding expertise on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Create a standing process for national-level commissions outside of government that would chart industrial policy ideas for consideration by the president and Congress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-the-foundations-of-innovation-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Strengthen the Foundations of Innovation in the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the world’s leading innovation power. To remain competitive in the future, the United States cannot simply assume today’s advantages will persist without continued investment. There are three areas where the United States can act in the near term to drive its competitive position forward: strengthening the U.S. role in standards setting, updating the patent system for the present day, and increasing the United States’ ability to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S ROLE IN STANDARD SETTING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting standards to shape American commerce started at the very beginning of our country. To bring together 13 separate colonies into a coherent new government, our first leaders knew that a pound of flour in Virginia needed to weigh the same as a pound of flour in New York. Standard setting seems a simple and uninteresting topic. However, operating on common standards is what allows companies to sell products widely, and to innovate quickly. Explicit standards ensure that consumers reap the benefits of new ideas without being locked into one company’s products. With explicit standards, products can improve in an open competitive market. An example of critical standards that have helped transform the world comes from those that govern wireless communication protocols — no matter where you are or what device you own, connecting to Wi-Fi works the same. This standard did not happen randomly. It was developed through engagements between competing firms, policymakers, and academics working to develop a standard that maximized consumer benefit, streamlined production requirements, and met necessary safety standards for communications devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a cutting-edge issue that would benefit from concerns for global standards is the energy transition. Currently there are inadequate standards for measuring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gases embedded in manufactured goods. The Department of Energy is already working on this front, and a canonical counting of carbon could become strategic high ground in a border-adjusted world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s global standards are the product of decades of American leadership and the astounding technological advancement of the past 50 years. China has seen the power of global standards and now seeks to gain leadership positions in global standards-setting organizations. Sujai Shivakumar, director of Renewing American Innovation at CSIS, notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s determination to dominate standards extends to controlling communications and discourse. Linking internet governance and standards, Chinese president Xi Jinping has stated that in cybersecurity and telecommunications, the “game of great powers is not only a game of technology but also a game of ideas and discourse power.” Developing standards for the digital economy therefore also requires reference to standards for political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When new technology opens up new concepts for products or services, there is generally no accepted standard to guide commercial exploitation. For example, there is currently no set of standards for AI. Many governments, including China, India, the European Union, and the United States, are all embarking on efforts to begin regulating this new area of technology, though doing so before any standards are set can also create a balkanized world where standards become different in different markets, reducing efficiency and slowing innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has a unique approach to standards setting. In the United States, the private sector sets the standards. The role of government is to recognize and enforce them and ensure that the standards are developed broadly within an industry. In China, setting standards is an explicit act of government control. In Europe, the European Union plays a very large role in shaping standards. Because America’s approach leaves it to the private sector, we face a challenging future if China comes to dominate standards-setting venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed in the emerging standards-setting competition, the United States will need bipartisan and consistent focus on resourcing standards-setting organizations and ensuring that the United States nominates strong and experienced leaders to these institutions, specifically including individuals capable of setting clear, achievable agendas and developing the necessary coalitions to succeed in setting standards that embody U.S. values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Congress should appropriate funds to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide financial support to academic experts, experts in innovative small companies, and consumer representatives to participate in international standards-setting conferences and processes. NIST will play no role in determining standards (other than for government-specific technologies) but will help identify and support private sector representatives to participate in international standards-setting venues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATING THE PATENT SYSTEM FOR THE PRESENT DAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has always been a nation of inventors. An important aspect of U.S. competitiveness over the past 100 years has been the strength of the U.S. patent system. The patent system has sought to balance the interests of the inventor and the interests of consumers by allowing inventors to derive the sole benefit of their innovations for a set period of time. This system has propelled forward an ever-accelerating wave of creativity. The United States’ innovative spirit rests on a complex network of economic rules favoring market-based competition, predictable legal arrangements for patenting and securing intellectual property, and incentives for investors. For decades, the United States set the global pace on patents. Over the past 20 years, global innovators, especially in China, have closed the gap and, in some cases, exceeded U.S. patent output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the successful track record of the U.S. patent system, there are growing calls within the United States to fundamentally reform the patent system. In many cases, the proposals include decreasing or eliminating the duration of patent benefits, arguing that the duration of the exclusive use period of the current patent system stifles innovation by limiting access to new technology. If these so-called reforms reduce or eliminate the exclusive use window of a patent, the financial incentive to make the necessary investments to develop new technologies is effectively eliminated. The benefits of innovating will be eclipsed by the ability to rapidly copy emerging technology. Only China would benefit from such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the intersection of standards and patents are standard essential patents (SEPs), patents that form the basis of industry standards and allow both consumers and a broader array of firms to participate in innovation. Common in a range of technologies, including telecommunications, wireless systems, the internet of things, and AI, SEPs are offered at terms determined to be fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (F/RAND). SEPs allow a company to develop and profit from a technology that becomes an industry standard without leveraging that position to eliminate its competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Ensuring that U.S. innovators can derive the benefits of their inventions has propelled the U.S. economy for more than 200 years. Ensuring the patent system remains robust will be critical to incentivizing entrepreneurs to stay focused on the U.S. market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INCREASING THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN GLOBAL TALENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the final report of the CSIS Trade Commission on Affirming American Leadership, “The United States thrives when it invites the best and brightest from around the world to set up shop and contribute to the U.S. economy.” Yet immigration policy now is one of the most contentious issues facing the U.S. government, with very little consensus on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis below draws heavily on work undertaken by Remco Zwetsloot while he was a trustee fellow at CSIS; William Reinsch, Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS; and his colleague Jack Caporal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of immigrants in the U.S. economy is often overlooked as a driver of both innovation and growth. As of 2021, there were 3.4 million immigrant entrepreneurs in the United States. As of 2017, immigrant-owned businesses employed 8 million people. Those businesses had cumulative sales of more than $1.3 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In innovation, immigrants to the United States also contribute at levels above their share of the population. According to a 2022 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, from 1990 to 2016, immigrants accounted for approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population but created approximately 16 percent of inventions, 23 percent of patents, and 24 percent of top patents. Altogether, they contributed more than 25 percent of market value of the firms benefiting from the patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, the United States sets aside 416,000 green cards for permanent immigrants. This allows non-citizens to live and work in the United States on an unlimited basis. Total green cards are subdivided into three groups: 226,000 for family-preference green cards; 140,000 for employment-based green cards, reserved for skilled workers as well as investors; and 50,000 “diversity” green cards for individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Not only are there numerical caps imposed on green cards every year, but there are country limits that preclude more than 7 percent of green cards every year going to one country. This has a major impact on green card applicants from countries such as India, China, the Philippines, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is no longer recruiting foreign talent at the same pace as in earlier eras. From 2000 to 2016, foreign enrollment in U.S. universities doubled from 500,000 to over 1 million students. Growth slowed, beginning in 2016–17, and turned negative by 2019–20. The Covid-19 pandemic saw foreign enrollment drop by 15 percent, with only a modest rebound in 2021–22. In 2022, 54 percent of international students majored in science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM) programs. A large portion of foreign STEM students historically came from China, but the current tensions with China have had a dampening impact on Chinese students applying for admission to American universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to declining numbers of international students enrolling at U.S. universities, it is difficult for firms to hire foreign nationals, even if these individuals are highly qualified. The CSIS Trade Commission notes that “the H-1B visa is capped at 85,000 visas annually, despite consistently hitting the limit months before the deadline for companies to apply.” Further, visas are distributed by lottery, “discourag[ing] companies from hiring international students and foreign workers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of H-1B visas available has been steady since 2004. From 1999 to 2003, however, H-1B visa quotas were set at between 115,000 and 195,000 per year based on two laws passed in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act and the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States has an enduring asymmetric advantage over nearly every country, it is immigration. For centuries, the United States has drawn talented and ambitious people from all over the world. We see this today in U.S. universities and across the cutting-edge American economy. Innovation relies on access to the most talented people. For much of the twentieth century, the United States leveraged deep investment in domestic education and a pipeline of foreign talent to drive American innovation to new heights. As one CSIS expert put it: “The U.S. government risks squandering that advantage through poor immigration policy. Without significant reforms to STEM immigration, the United States will struggle to maintain long-term competitiveness and achieve near-term technology priorities such as semiconductor supply chain security, leadership in AI, and clean energy innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are entering a period of accelerating need for human talent. America’s immigration policy is heavily weighted toward reuniting families. Other countries, such as Canada, have an immigration policy focused on attracting highly educated and skilled migrants for entry into the workforce. Many countries adopt this practice and are making immigration rules more flexible to attract needed talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see large numbers of foreign students in American universities and graduate schools, but all of them are in the United States on student visas or limited work visas. There is no fast track to a green card for highly capable and desirable student visa holders. America’s high-tech industry has complained for many years about the constraints it faces due to the limited availability of H-1B visas. Recently, the congressionally chartered National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence called for a massive increase in educational training domestically in AI, as well as for a major program to recruit more AI talent from other countries. The United States is in a global competition for talent, and current U.S. immigration policies are a significant roadblock to competing internationally for this talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States maintains a bewildering number of visa categories for everything from an athlete coming to a competition in the United States, to temporary agricultural workers following seasonal harvest requirements, to physicians. This discussion focuses specifically on permanent immigrant workers (green card holders) and temporary non-immigrant visas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Congress should authorize the reuse of unused green cards, with priority given to employment-based applicants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Given the importance of innovation to economic growth and the outsized role immigrants play in driving innovation — particularly in high-tech fields — the United States should immediately expand H-1B visas back to 195,000 per year. The United States also should double the number of green card allotments, putting first priority on highly qualified technical talent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should explore ways to incentivize academic performance by foreign students, extending the length of time they are allowed to work on a J visa based on academic performance and contributions in fields judged to be crucial for future American productivity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-a-dynamic-trade-policy&quot;&gt;Develop a Dynamic Trade Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2021, the CSIS Trade Commission on Affirming American Leadership issued a series of reports on why trade is vital for America’s future growth and strengthening America’s broader values in the world of international commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the latter half of the twentieth century, the United States championed the expansion of global trade as a means of advancing U.S. interests in growing its domestic economy and in expanding international markets for its goods. China’s rise, including both the expansion of China’s industrial labor force and its adroit navigation “between” World Trade Organization (WTO) rules pose significant challenges to the existing WTO-centered system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current system is far from perfect. It was developed at a time when issues such as the digital economy, climate change, and rent seeking by the world’s second-largest economy were hard to imagine. Dispute evaluation and resolution mechanisms now take longer than the market cycles they intend to correct. Reforms and updates are nearly impossible in a consensus-based organization comprising 164 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than retreating from the WTO — and ceding standards setting there to China’s autocratic economic model — the United States should reinvigorate efforts to drive forward a WTO based on U.S. interests and advantages. These include transparency, fair and market-based competition, and common global rules for trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A road map exists for what the United States should do to reinvigorate trade in a manner consistent with U.S. values and domestic interests. It starts by working with a subset of like-minded countries to commit to a compact reflecting a more ambitious approach to trade rules, with the aim of bolstering rather than replacing the WTO. In addition to deepening trade ties, compact members should identify and implement means to counter non-market economic practices. Compact members should also engage in discussions on leveraging trade to reduce the impact of climate change and on “best practices to mitigate trade’s disruptive impact on workers and on trade’s potential to improve working conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should work to secure greater commitment from the WTO as an institution to impose penalties for non-compliance with existing WTO rules, and to reform and accelerate the dispute resolution mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: At home, the United States needs to bolster its domestic policy framework for resisting non-market economic actions from foreign actors — including China — while sustaining U.S. adherence to transparency, clearly applied standards, and consistent application of rules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competing-more-effectively-with-china-on-the-global-stage&quot;&gt;Competing More Effectively with China on the Global Stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-us-foreign-assistance&quot;&gt;Overview of U.S. Foreign Assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the Cold War, the United States well understood that it was in direct competition with the Soviet Union in presenting a development model to former European colonies around the world that had recently become independent states. America took comprehensive steps to strengthen its agenda in this global competition, including creating the United Nations and the Bretton Woods organizations like the World Bank. The United States also has created a range of institutions and programs at the federal level to help guide and support new leaders of young nations with weak economies and limited depth of talent for administering a country. The following list includes key U.S. institutions that have worked to develop stronger economies and more effective governments in developing countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):&lt;/strong&gt; USAID is an independent agency of the U.S. government with primary responsibility for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance. USAID’s budget for operating expenses and capital investment in FY 2023 was 2.08 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC):&lt;/strong&gt; The DFC provides financing and insurance for private companies developing economic projects in developing markets. The DFC underwrote $7.4 billion of projects in FY 2022 and currently administers over $9.3 billion of ongoing investments. The DFC returns a profit to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC):&lt;/strong&gt; Established in 2004, the MCC focuses on economic growth, poverty alleviation, and institution strengthening in low-income countries. Based on a rigorous, competitive application process, the MCC prioritizes creating sustainable impact in partner countries while delivering a return on investment for U.S. taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA):&lt;/strong&gt; The USTDA works to promote U.S. job creation through assisting U.S. firms to export goods and services for infrastructure projects in low-income countries. It funds feasibility studies, technical assistance, and pilot projects at early stages in foreign countries, better positioning partner countries to understand the advantages of working with U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TALENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulbright Program:&lt;/strong&gt; In FY 2020, the Fulbright Program sent more than 2,500 Americans overseas for research and teaching and brought more than 4,000 of the world’s brightest to the United States to study and engage. Over 75 years, the program has connected many thousands of people around the world to the United States and given Americans deeper understanding — and enduring relationship advantages — around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OTHER PROGRAMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace Corps:&lt;/strong&gt; The Peace Corps was created in 1961 as a permanent federal agency within the State Department, and in 1981 it became an independent agency. It was established as a way to more actively involve Americans in the cause of global democracy, peace, development, and freedom. Since its inception, the Peace Corps has sent over 200,000 Americans to serve in 139 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Information Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Information Agency was established in 1953 to promote U.S. messages abroad, especially into the Soviet Union and aligned countries. Many of its functions were consolidated into the U.S. Department of State, especially the undersecretary for public diplomacy, before the agency was closed in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for Global Media:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees U.S.-funded programming abroad, including six media organizations, such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In 2022, it reached a global audience of 410 million people weekly with programming in 63 languages, supported by an $885 million appropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Department of Commerce and the Department of State have created major undersecretariats designed to promote American businesses working internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these various efforts have been successful. Generally, the world America wanted to create following World War II — a world dominated by Western commercial and political values — has come to pass. The country has championed independence, representative government structures, and open markets as normative goals for the rising world. The government has encouraged major American foundations and universities to establish programs to accelerate leadership development in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the passage of time, America became distracted by security issues that came to dominate U.S. international engagement policies. This is evident when we look at American development funding for various regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CkKyRpB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: U.S. Foreign Aid (2016 U.S. dollars, millions).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://world101.cfr.org/&quot;&gt;“World 101,” Council on Foreign Relations, n.d.&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignassistance.gov/agencies&quot;&gt;“U.S. Foreign Assistance by Agency,” ForeignAssistance.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American foreign assistance has largely reflected the primary political agenda confronting the United States at any particular time. The United States provided considerable aid assistance to Europe between 1946 and 1955 (seen in light blue in Figure 2). This was the start of the Cold War, when America launched the Marshall Plan to jump-start the rebuilding of European economies. When the Soviet Union started to implode and ultimately collapse, there was a modest increase in spending for Europe. Foreign assistance to South and Central Asia (purple) became considerable as the confrontation with China increased and during U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam. That funding ended sharply in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development assistance to Central and South America (dark blue) paralleled the threat perceived there by Cuba in the mid-1960s and the U.S. effort to contain radicalism in the Americas. That tapered off, only to be boosted in the 1980s in the so-called war on drugs. The last spike in spending in the 2000s involved Plan Colombia, a coordinated effort to keep Colombia from disintegrating into a narco-state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa (yellow) saw a significant boost in spending during the second half of the Bush administration in the early 2000s, when the United States devoted considerable resources to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That funding has remained high through commitments of resources for Feed the Future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East and North Africa (green), two developments largely account for U.S. assistance. The first was the result of the end of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, when the United States committed to providing significant defense resources on an ongoing basis to Israel and Egypt. The most recent spike reflects spending on economic development in Afghanistan and Iraq following the invasion of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this abbreviated survey shows that U.S. foreign assistance has largely been shaped by urgent geopolitical objectives that have evolved over time. Development funding was an extension of our overall political agenda. The United States has significantly increased assistance when a crisis (or perceived crisis) has developed and then cut it back to shift focus to other priorities. Our original goal to use American foreign assistance to build a structural world favorable to our strategic interests evolved into a tactical complement to a broader foreign policy. Our focus on new states struggling to develop took a back seat over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-new-competition-with-china-in-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The New Competition with China in the Global South&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, U.S. policymakers have increasingly complained about China’s rising influence in Africa and South America. It is important to put this in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made a priority of courting countries in the Global South. China has been actively building projects throughout the Southern Hemisphere. It is often noted that these projects represent opportunities for Chinese workers, not local workers. Still, China has made significant investments throughout Africa and increasingly in South America. These investments are paralleled by active diplomacy. President Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), through which China has loaned over $1 trillion to countries to pay for major infrastructure projects. Many of those projects were launched without adequate economic analysis, and China now finds itself as a major creditor country with loans that cannot be paid without significant restructuring. China generally does not forgive debt. This has had a dampening effect on China’s willingness to finance massive projects and on the willingness of receiving countries to take on large loads of debt. Much of the debt sustainability crisis facing the Global South is directly attributable to BRI projects. Still, the BRI has created pathways of influence for China in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 34 years, China has convened the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which has become the premier conference bringing African heads of state to Beijing. President Xi invariably spends days personally with these African leaders, collectively and individually, throughout the conference. By contrast, America’s history of engagement in Africa is very uneven and rarely at presidential levels. To his credit, President Biden hosted a conference for African heads of state, but it stands out as a rare exception for an American president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, China has made major commercial inroads in the Global South (Figures 3 and 4). In 1980, the primary trading partners for South American countries were the United States and Europe. Where there was active trade in Africa, it was generally with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, China had become a dominant trade partner for much of Africa and a good portion of South America, not to mention all of Southeast Asia. China has had an integrated strategy to build infrastructure that supports its own commercial activities in these countries. This commercial and geopolitics. In short, China has had an integrated strategy to advance its influence in the Global South, while the United States has no strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UunJ5F0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, while the United States has struggled to sustain a consistent focus in its development policies, China has been stealing the march. The United States’ development agenda now tends to reflect domestic political priorities and controversies, not a grounded interest in building the economies of countries in the Global South. The United States’ inconsistency has been countered by an integrated Chinese strategy that has entailed significant commercial and development investments in all three major regions of the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to another fundamental observation: economic development has shifted from aid to trade, and from pilot projects to direct investments. China is doing far better in this new dimension of development than the United States. The United States has used development funding to pursue important social goals, while China has used its financial resources to build access to stronger markets. As a president of an African country noted to one of the authors of this report: “China gives us money, and you give us lectures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe do not need to duplicate China’s mercantile policies to be effective, but they do need to change their thinking about the problem. America has not had an effective trade policy for a number of years. Protectionism has been more dominant in U.S. trade policy than global economic growth. In the early years of the Cold War, the United States saw the clear need to help newly emerging countries grow and prosper and shape their economic preferences for the U.S.-inspired Bretton Woods system. The infrastructure of the United States’ soft power agenda remains in place, but the world has changed. The United States does not have a trade policy designed to draw African and South American countries increasingly into Western commercial orbits. Indeed, for several disastrous years, Congress blocked the work of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (now replaced by the DFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs to return to the vision we championed in the early days of the Cold War. At that time, policymakers understood that the United States was competing against an alternative vision of economic development. The country is in this competition again, but with a far more capable opponent. America believes in free markets and competition. China believes in “managed democracy,” government-controlled markets, and preferential treatment of favored Chinese firms. African and South American governments are trying to improve the material lives of their citizens. The United States firmly believes that its model is superior, but it is failing to prioritize economic growth in African and South American countries as a key policy objective. If the United States is to succeed in the great competition with China in the Global South, it needs to shift its focus to promoting economic growth, commercial development, and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be most vividly illustrated by looking at Africa. African states have a combined population of approximately 1.4 billion people today, and given the exponential birthrates on the continent, this number will surge to nearly 4 billion by the end of the century. The majority of its economies are still considered low income. Studies have shown that birth rates around the world almost invariably drop to replacement level or lower once GDP per capita reaches about $10,000. High birth rates in low-income economies is but one example of further intensified environmental and climatic demand pressures that the world will be facing in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a known fact that developed countries plus China have contributed the most to carbon loading in the atmosphere to the present day. These countries are increasingly making major commitments to transition from carbon-based to renewable energy sources, though their actions to date fall short of what is required to meet the goals set in the COP process. In addition, such commitments are counteracted by the increasing energy demands associated with rapid and unmanaged population growth. It is crucial to recognize that Africa is not to blame. The African continent has every right to become prosperous, and economic growth directly depends on affordable energy resources. However, the developed world has no effective program to offer lower-income countries that seek economic development. Under current trends, said development will inevitably cause continued high consumption of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued high consumption of hydrocarbon-based energy will only heighten the water crisis that is now spanning the world. As African economies grow, we will see significant increases in urban populations and even greater stress on water and energy resources. In short, the global environment and America’s future well-being will be directly affected by boosting prosperity in Africa, responsibly managing population growth, and mitigating the negative consequences of increasing energy and water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should develop a strategy that integrates development financing with trade liberalization to boost per capita incomes in Africa to $10,000 by 2040.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The Department of Commerce and the Development Finance Corporation should develop more programs and strengthen existing ones that encourage direct U.S. commercial investment in Africa, initially providing risk premium support to make commercial projects viable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climate-change-and-energy-security&quot;&gt;Climate Change and Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fossil-fuels-and-energy-consumption-today&quot;&gt;Fossil Fuels and Energy Consumption Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global energy consumption is highly correlated with economic growth. Indeed, the availability of lower-cost energy largely drove the Industrial Revolution and has led to an astounding increase in per capita incomes across the world. Energy consumption has grown dramatically worldwide over the past 60 years, but it is now causing great challenges because of the impacts on climate change. Scientists have estimated that global temperatures will continue to inexorably rise because of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by the burning of hydrocarbon-based fuels. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce consumption of the primary hydrocarbon fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has presented both good and bad news in this regard. Threatened by Russia’s aggressive posture, Europe has launched major investments in advancing renewable energy sources. For the first time, European energy policies are more closely matched with European energy promises in the Conference of the Parties (COP) process of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But the war’s immediate threat to energy supplies caused an enormous spike in prices of natural gas and has driven world consumption of coal to an all-time high. Developing countries do not have the same capacity as Europe and the United States to massively subsidize conversions to renewable energy. Consequently, fossil fuel demand will remain very high for at least the next 30 years. Fossil fuel consumption will go down somewhat after 2030 but will remain at 90 percent of the peak established in 2030 (see Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary reason fossil fuel consumption rates remain high is because populations in emerging and developing countries in the Global South are growing dramatically and remain relatively poor while hydrocarbon energy resources are currently relatively affordable. As countries grow richer, citizens seek a higher quality of life, and this often means air cooling for homes and offices (a trend that climate change will accelerate) and personal transportation. Currently, about 80 percent of the global population without access to electricity — roughly 600 million people — lives in Africa, where electricity is overwhelmingly required for cooling. Currently, 5 billion people globally live in regions that require cooling, but only one-third of these individuals have air conditioners. As climate change intensifies, the number of people who need cooling is anticipated to grow to 7 billion. Today, there are 1.5 billion air conditioners, and that number is expected to grow to 4.4 billion by 2050, driving much higher consumption of electricity, particularly because the air conditioners that most people can afford to buy are not very energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been astounding progress in the efficiency and cost of photovoltaic solar power generation, but photovoltaic power generation and wind power are still intermittent sources. They work well in smaller-scale settings, but are difficult to scale to larger grid networks. Urbanization will heighten demand for reliable electricity, and at present, this is most likely to be met through carbon-based electricity generating facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need accelerated economic growth in developing countries to allow for better resource management. However, increased personal wealth will lead to greater demand for energy, and achieving economic prosperity depends on affordable energy resources. Under current trends, these countries will repeat the unfortunate pattern set by high-income economies that developed at the expense of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESURGENT INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistent high demand for fossil fuel power generation has again prompted interest in nuclear power. Nuclear power generation does not emit carbon dioxide or other gases that cause greenhouse gas effects in the atmosphere. Climate and energy security considerations have led several countries to adopt new strategies for energy security that involve nuclear energy. South Korea and Belgium have altered plans to retire existing nuclear production facilities. Japan has again restarted shuttered generation plants and plans to replace older nuclear generating facilities. Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom have plans on the books to build new generating facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power has been plagued by high construction costs, serious cost overruns, and construction delays. This has led to a significant interest in small modular reactors. Currently there are a dozen companies developing designs for small generators that would range from 30 to 350 megawatts of power generation. Theoretically, these facilities would not require the extensive and expensive construction costs of larger reactors and can still incorporate designs that ensure safety, but to date, the promise of small modular reactors is more aspirational than a likely reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, construction has begun on 31 new large-scale reactors. However, all but four of them are being designed and built by either Russia or China. Herein lies a great concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR ENERGY AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial nuclear power generation is invariably the foundation for a nuclear weapons program. Countries have developed nuclear weapons without commercial generation facilities, but invariably countries develop the expertise to manage nuclear weapons and generate fissile materials when undertaking commercial nuclear power programs. This was understood when the Eisenhower administration launched the now famous Atoms for Peace program, announced at the UN General Assembly back in 1953. President Eisenhower and his advisers understood the enormous potential positive benefit of nuclear power as a generating source for electricity, but also knew the danger posed by nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led the United States to take the lead to develop a comprehensive architecture of controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States encouraged the development of commercial nuclear power under the strict surveillance of an independent UN agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was established in 1957. IAEA inspectors travel around the world monitoring the nuclear power programs in 30 of the 32 countries that currently operate commercial nuclear power plants. (North Korea was included until 2002, when it kicked out IAEA inspectors as it set out on its current path of building nuclear weapons.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then led to the establishment of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly called the NPT. The NPT had three pillars. The first pillar committed all signatory states to not starting nuclear weapon programs and to accepting IAEA safeguard inspections to ensure that their nuclear programs conform to peaceful commercial power goals. The second pillar committed the countries that possessed nuclear weapons to getting rid of them. There is considerable criticism of nuclear weapon states for not following through on this commitment. At the time the NPT entered into force, there were only five acknowledged nuclear weapon states — China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel has long been a nuclear weapon state and has refused IAEA safeguards. India and Pakistan subsequently developed nuclear weapons but eventually agreed to IAEA safeguard inspections. North Korea had been an IAEA signatory but withdrew from the NPT treaty in 2003 and expelled all IAEA surveillance systems in order to develop nuclear weapons capabilities. While other countries have toyed with covert weapons programs (notably Syria, Iran, and Libya), generally the NPT has effectively limited the spread of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of the NPT treaty authorizes the peaceful use of nuclear energy for commercial and research purposes. Of the 32 countries that have commercial nuclear power plants, only 9 countries currently have nuclear weapons. It is strongly in America’s interests to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT has been reasonably successful in establishing norms of transparency and accountability that have limited the proliferation of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we must return to the key fact that since 2017, 31 new nuclear reactor programs have been started, and 27 of them involve Russia and China. Russia and China were signatories to the NPT, but they have never been active champions of the IAEA or of non-proliferation. China actively aided Pakistan in developing its nuclear weapons, and Russia is now actively collaborating with North Korea, but it is unclear if this involves North Korea’s nuclear program. The burden of sustaining the NPT was largely carried by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, joined by Germany and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency says it politely: advanced economies “have lost market leadership” in commercial nuclear technology. It goes on to explain that despite having nearly 70 percent of global nuclear capacity, investment has stalled, and the latest projects have run far over budget and behind schedule. America’s commercial nuclear power industry has substantially deteriorated. For 15 years, the United States has had to import enriched material from other countries, though recent legislation has provided funds to restart enrichment in the United States. The United States retains design teams but largely contracts for pressure vessel construction from Japan. Advocacy for commercial nuclear power has been weak over the past two decades, largely because of the cost, and cost overruns for new plants have damaged the commercial viability of nuclear power generation. We are now seeing encouraging signs of stronger interest in commercial nuclear energy, though price signals in the marketplace remain a major impediment to fielding a new generation of reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reasons-to-again-promote-commercial-nuclear-energy&quot;&gt;Reasons to Again Promote Commercial Nuclear Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States now has three compelling reasons to promote a resurgence of commercial nuclear energy. The first is the need for non-carbon power generation. Once in operation, nuclear power plants emit no greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Second, due to its past significant commercial nuclear power industry, America has developed gold standards for safety and security for operating commercial plants. And third, America needs to stay active in commercial nuclear power to sustain its leadership of the non-proliferation architecture. These goals are existential and require active American leadership on commercial nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should develop a strategy to introduce small modular reactors into the Global South, assuring an expansion of nuclear power by countries that comply with and champion the compliance standards of the NPT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s success has been astounding, by any measure. The vast majority of Americans today live better than did Queen Victoria, only 150 years ago; Americans today have far superior medical care, warmer clothes and houses, ubiquitous and inexpensive entertainment, and far more comfortable transportation. This is not meant to minimize the inequity in America, nor the country’s scandalously high levels of hunger and poverty despite being the richest country in the world. But the human condition in the world — and especially in the United States — has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astounding improvement in the human condition over the last 70 years is a direct byproduct of the way the United States championed an open, liberal economic order and promoted liberalized trade during this period. This growth accelerated amid globalization, when geopolitical tensions were diminished, and new global supply chains and markets flourished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as they say in the world of public investing, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. We are facing a challenging time. America has fractured domestic politics, a divided electorate, disappointing public education performance, and frightening new technologies for which the government has no reliable framework for protecting the public. And the United States faces a formidable competitor on the global stage that offers a compelling narrative to a significant portion of the global population. This narrative suggests that Americans either take them for granted or, even worse, exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does need a new strategy for this era, but it has a remarkable foundation for success well within its grasp. The United States’ driving goal is to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people. America certainly has all that it takes to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this monograph is not to delineate the intricate dimensions of a new national strategy. That requires the full commitment and efforts of hundreds or thousands of leaders in the United States. It rather offers a simple reflection of what challenges the American people face and what principles should guide the country going forward. This monograph attempts to outline a broad framework to guide the hard work of developing detailed policies and plans. Recounted here in summary form are the basic elements of this framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must retain a strong military establishment capable of anticipating and addressing potential future challenges. The country has a strong establishment now, but it needs to become more efficient in its deliberations and strategic planning. Retaining a strong military will require serious streamlining and reform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States still needs to play a leading role in shaping the global policy landscape to facilitate its accomplishment of national objectives. This means actively investing in stronger international institutions capable of managing complex modern problems. In addition, it must increase investment in alliances and partnerships with countries that share the same fundamental values. These alliances, partnerships, and institutions add strategic depth to U.S. national capacities, making it easier to manage an increasingly complex set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America needs a growth strategy for its economy. Without significant expansion, Americans will contend to fight over a shrinking pie. It is crucial that we foster growth and ensure that the benefits are more evenly spread to establish a self-reinforcing economy. By prioritizing an agenda focused on growth, other problems in the country will be easier to address. Without ample economic growth, all problems will be harder to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To grow the economy, the U.S. government must bolster its commitment toward the expansion and success of the private sector. The United States needs to take a more active role in helping the private sector lead in setting global standards. The country needs to reform and fortify the intellectual property protection system. It also needs to ameliorate the immigration system to recruit more highly qualified people to expand the talent pool in the country and assist it in competing more effectively on the global stage. We also need serious reform of regulatory processes to remove the impediment of investing in the United States compared to investing in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States needs one comprehensive trade policy, for two reasons. First, such a strategy is the best way to widen the appeal and efficacy of a rules-based international order, which is fundamentally in America’s national interests. Second, the government needs to boost economic growth, both here in the United States and around the world. The vast growth in American prosperity and in prosperity around the world in recent decades was the product of increasing international trade. Today, the Global South perceives that America champions the international rules-based order to protect its privilege and amplify its growth at the expense of developing countries. The best way to reverse that perception is to create a vibrant trade agenda that prioritizes growth here and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is particularly important to support the economic development of low-income countries in the Global South. These nations will become customers of U.S. goods and services. More importantly, this presents an effective approach to curbing unmanaged population growth while addressing the challenges of economic migration that is presently confounding Europe and the United States. At the start of the Cold War, U.S. leaders understood that helping other countries become more prosperous was going to be good for America — for both economic and security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are to address climate change effectively, the United States must deal with the reality of explosive population growth in the developing world and the comparably rising demands for energy. That means that the United States needs to shift its thinking on development from aid to trade. We also need to support these countries in their efforts to find development paths that are less exploitative and damaging to the environment. Seventy years ago, bringing economic growth and development to African, Asian, and Middle East countries was central to the U.S. strategy to win the Cold War. Now it likely is essential to win the battle against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America again needs to champion nuclear power. American leadership produced the credibility to shape a global system of rules and norms to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. America’s ambivalence now about nuclear energy could cede the international market to Russia and China, neither of which is a champion of non-proliferation. Expanding commercial nuclear power would also make a major contribution to reducing reliance on carbon-based sources of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a strategy but a framework that can guide the development of detailed plans to secure the future of the United States as a nation and ensure the prosperity of American citizens. The country finds itself once again in an era of strategic competition. Our primary competitor — China — possesses capabilities far exceeding those of the Soviet Union. While this is not Cold War 2.0, it is a competition between alternative philosophies of governance. There is a large segment of American society that is looking for sensible direction for a stronger future. There is no reason that the twenty-first century should not be the American century. However, that will only happen with pragmatic and constructive approaches to our shared future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US closed its last military base in Niger, located in Agadez, on 5 August 2024, following the earlier withdrawal of 800 troops from the Niamey base in July. This move came in response to demands from Niger’s military regime which, in March 2024, revoked the military accord with the US, signalling a shift in the country’s stance on foreign military presence. On 19 April, the US agreed to withdraw its troops from Niger. At that time, there were around 1,000 US troops in the country, stationed at two military bases, including a drone base near Agadez that is essential to US interests in Africa. Concurrently, while the US was discussing the modalities of its withdrawal, a Russian plane landed in Niamey on 12 April carrying a large amount of military equipment, including a Russian air defence system and 100 Russian soldiers from the Africa Corps, referred to as instructors. While according to local sources some of the instructors have left, the anti-aircraft defence system should enable the country to control its airspace against neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two events exemplify, in a concrete way, the re-composition of the geostrategic landscape taking place in the Sahel, where countries such as Russia and China have increased their influence, while countries such as France and the US have seen theirs diminish. This change has been marked by a strategy of partnership diversification, which has characterised Sahelian foreign policy under military governments since 2021. This strategy is based on a principle of national sovereignty that prioritises the renewal of partnerships to seek strategic “win-win” agreements for each sector, without having to rely on one partner for everything. On the other hand, it calls into question previous agreements with traditional partners, as the new military governments now perceive that these partners may not have the best interests of the Sahelians at heart or do not fit in with the government’s strategy. One example was the non-renewal of the UN stabilisation mission in Mali, MINUSMA, in 2023 after the Malian authorities demanded its termination. The Malian transition authorities argue that the mission does not meet their expectations as the context requires “a force to fight terrorism, going beyond the doctrine of the United Nations peace mission”. A second example of this can be seen with the US withdrawal from Niger, where a spokesperson for the Niger military authorities, the Conseil national pour la sauvegarde de la patrie, said: “Niger regrets the intention of the American delegation to deny the sovereign Nigerien people the right to choose their partners and types of partnerships capable of truly helping them fight against terrorism”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A strategy of partnership diversification has characterised Sahelian foreign policy under military governments since 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, there have been many examples of the exiting of various Western missions from the region. This started with the withdrawal of French forces under Operation Barkhane from Mali in 2022) and from Burkina Faso (Operation Sabre) and Niger in 2023, as well as the European missions EUMPM and EUCAP Sahel Niger in December 2023, and now includes the departure of the US from Niger. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that most Western international actors have not withdrawn from the Sahel, and most of the aid and humanitarian assistance programmes in the region are still led by European and North American countries. The deterioration of relations with the West, especially since the coup d’état in Niger, has also been used as an excuse for Sahelian countries’ political and security approaches at the regional level. In January 2024, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso decided to suddenly withdraw from ECOWAS. The reason outlined by the junta is that ECOWAS has strayed from its original principles and has fallen under foreign influence (referring indirectly to France).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As relations between the military juntas and the West have deteriorated, other partners have stepped in to strengthen relations with these three Sahel countries. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have strengthened their relations with Russia, especially in the security sector, with deployments of Russian and African Corps troops. China and Turkey have also increased their influence in several vital sectors in the Sahel countries. A recent example involving China is the construction of Africa’s largest oil pipeline, a 2,000 km long pipeline to export crude oil from the fields of Agadem in southeast Niger to Benin. This pipeline is not only significant from an economic investment standpoint, but it has also become an essential component of diplomatic aid for the Nigerien junta. In mid-April the Nigerien government announced that it had secured a $400 million loan from its Chinese partner as an “advance” for forthcoming crude oil sales, expected to commence in May. This economic capacity will allow the Nigerien government to stabilise its economy after the comprehensive sanctions imposed on it following the coup d’état. Turkey, meanwhile, has become an essential partner for these three countries in the defence sector, facilitating the sale of drones which will be a significant boost to their air capabilities. On 8 April, Burkina Faso received two dozen combat drones delivered by Turkey (Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Akinci), forming a critical component of the country’s counterterrorism strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Western powers are reacting too slowly to the emergence of other partners in the the Sahel, which highlights a shifting global landscape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the three countries have also increased their presence in the communication sphere of the three Sahelian countries. The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) formed by Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso is set to launch a certified digital platform, featuring an online TV channel, on 16 September 2024, coinciding with the organisation’s first anniversary. This initiative follows a key virtual meeting held on 10 July 2024, where the ministers of communication of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso established the foundation for a unified communication strategy. The ministers prioritised creating an emergency communication plan to inform citizens about major AES initiatives and “counter orchestrated misinformation campaigns”. Another recent example of control over the media came at the end of April when the Higher Communication Council of Burkina Faso suspended access to the websites of DW, The Guardian, Le Monde, the BBC, VOA and TV5 Monde (among others) until further notice. It has also suspended the broadcasting of programmes from these channels (for those broadcasting in Burkina Faso) for 2 weeks. The reason for the suspension is that these channels have shared a Human Rights Watch report accusing the Burkina Faso armed forces of carrying out executions of civilians. While these media outlets are downsizing, other media outlets such as TRT and Anadolu Ajansı from Turkey, as well as Chinese agencies such as Xinhua and Russia’s RT, are growing their presence significantly, positioning themselves as media outlets with alternatives to traditional sources such as the Agence de Presse Française. In addition, while this analysis has focused on Russia, Turkey and China, many other regional powers have also forged closer ties with the Sahelian juntas, such as the Gulf monarchies, North African countries like Morocco and Egypt, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding influence of these three powers in the region, alongside the declining influence of Western states, clearly demonstrates the multipolarity of the current era. It is evident that there are viable alternatives to Western partners, and countries in the central Sahel region are demonstrating a preference for working with them on issues such as counterterrorism. Unlike Western partners, these alternative powers can respond more effectively to the needs of military juntas, operating without the red lines often tied to standards on civilian protection and human rights, as well as the promotion of democratic transitions. Western powers are reacting too slowly to the emergence of other partners in the region, which highlights a shifting global landscape. These evolving dynamics necessitate a reassessment of traditional diplomatic approaches and strategic alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

They also reflect the commitment of each to cyber as an international policy area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership demonstrates the value of targeted engagement driven by operational activities across multiple policy areas. Effort should now be made to ensure that the momentum that has defined the first year of the Partnership is sustained, that challenges are overcome, and that the impact of engagement on cyber continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership and considers the factors that determine how it functions. It recommends further activities for the Partnership to undertake within its existing strategic priorities, and advocates for an expanded scope. The paper makes the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability development.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and the UK should expand mutual efforts on personnel development through training, exchanges and exercises. Furthermore, continued dialogue on policies to retain and recruit technical personnel will ensure best practices are mainstreamed. Similarly, establishing trusted and secure processes to share information and intelligence is crucial to driving greater depth and breadth of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public–private partnerships (PPPs).&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and Japan should amplify cyber engagement led by non-governmental stakeholders: for example, emerging regional cyber clusters should be encouraged to continue developing bilateral partnerships. Efforts should also be made to promote connections between sectoral Information Sharing and Analysis Centres. Both governments should take a more proactive approach to expanding and supporting commercial cyber-security engagement, through facilitating partnerships and identifying areas of competitive advantage. Finally, existing efforts to promote bilateral involvement in national PPPs, such as Industry 100, should be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/strong&gt; There is significant opportunity and willingness to expand bilateral cooperation on cyber capacity building across ASEAN and the wider Indo-Pacific, and to provide targeted support to deter adversaries. Japan and the UK should also pursue closer collaboration to promote global rules and norms in cyberspace by working together, conducting joint attributions, and so on. Both should also consider how to align their approaches to providing proactive international cyber crisis support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-resilient ecosystems.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and Japan should continue expanding the scope of the Partnership in response to need and opportunity. “Cyber-resilient ecosystems”, understood as cooperation on reforms to government structures, legislation, regulation and resilience, is one such area. The UK and Japan should further explore alignment on cyber-security professional standards, and establish a bi-annual dialogue on standards and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other activities the UK and Japan should undertake include: sufficiently funding engagement activities; trialling deeper cooperation on cyber education; and regularly assessing the progress of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s findings, which inform these recommendations, are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is currently momentum, enthusiasm and opportunity to continue and expand the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber security is both a distinct activity within the bilateral relationship and an enabler for further activities, for example in national security and defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation can be expanded on reforms to Japan and the UK’s cyber ecosystems, but it must be undertaken as peers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s commitment to reforming government structures, improving information security and developing capabilities will be decisive in deepening the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges and obstacles impact the tempo and scope of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that the Partnership remains on its current trajectory. Stakeholders across both countries believe that the Partnership has positive momentum and that there is space to expand engagement. Seizing this opportunity, while avoiding wasteful or unnecessary activities, can advance the wider bilateral relationship. As Japan and the UK expand their bilateral partnership, cyber security can be a springboard to achieve operational successes and enable broader strategic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the UK and Japan signed a joint statement agreeing they were “each other’s most important partners in Asia and Europe, respectively”. Since then, the bilateral relationship has benefited from successive governments in each country prioritising engagement. Shared interests on diverse issues have presented opportunities for cooperation. To reiterate the importance of the Japan–UK relationship and to continue expanding the strategic partnership, the two countries agreed the Hiroshima Accord in May 2023. The Accord provides a strategic framing for the relationship by setting out the following bilateral priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic prosperity underpinned by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global resilience against threats such as climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defence and security, and within which a specific commitment to a UK–Japan cyber partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership is a landmark agreement to pursue a “full spectrum” of cyber cooperation, based on core strategic areas of cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening public–private partnerships (PPPs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These strategic commitments have informed initiatives pursued under the Partnership, for example the meeting of the Japan Business Federation (“Keidanren”) with the UK’s National Cyber Advisory Board (NCAB), and joint exercises conducted by Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the British armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed strategic priorities and concrete activities demonstrate that the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership has momentum. They also reflect the commitment of each country to cyber as an international policy area. The progress of the Partnership to date shows the value of bilateral engagement on cyber, not just as one part of broader UK–Japan cooperation, but also as an enabler of other dimensions, such as defence industry cooperation, economic security and resilience. Priorities should be: determining which of the Partnership’s initiatives have been effective; examining why this is; and identifying how to further increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further develop the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, both countries should regularly reassess existing initiatives and anticipate future opportunities. They should consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What activities are currently pursued under the Cyber Partnership and how do these contribute to bilateral objectives?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could the Cyber Partnership be better leveraged to meet additional national cyber priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What further activities and areas of strategic engagement should be considered for the Partnership?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a sustainable and deliberate expansion of the breadth and depth of the Cyber Partnership to further address existing mutual strategic priorities. Chapter I provides background on the UK–Japan relationship and the two countries’ respective cyber ecosystems. Chapter II outlines cyber engagement activities, detailing the actors involved and their remits. Chapter III examines how the strategic priorities of the Cyber Partnership align with wider bilateral cooperation, and whether national cyber strategies reveal additional areas for cooperation. Chapter IV offers strategic considerations for the Partnership and recommends further activities across its existing scope, as well as proposing an additional pillar: “cyber-resilient ecosystems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper was conducted as part of the Indo-Pacific Cyber Programme, funded by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO). The programme is delivered by a consortium, of which RUSI is a member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper was conducted between November 2023 and February 2024. It consisted of qualitative research methods: a rapid evidence assessment; semi-structured interviews; and a roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid evidence assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers conducted a short review of open source academic and grey literature published in the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers conducted 29 semi-structured interviews, both online and in person in London and Tokyo, with UK and Japanese stakeholders in the public, private and civil society sectors. The interviews took place between November 2023 and February 2024. All interview data has been anonymised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundtable:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers ran one data-gathering roundtable for stakeholders to discuss relevant thematic issues, including respective approaches to cyber governance and PPPs on cyber security. There were more than 15 participants, primarily from the Japanese private sector. The roundtable was held as an in-person event in London on 18 January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has made limited use of literature or interviews in Japanese. One researcher, a Japanese speaker, conducted some discussions with relevant stakeholders in Japanese. The research team also used online translation software (Google Translate and DeepL) to review limited Japanese-language literature. Researchers acknowledge the limitations of non-bilingual data-gathering in identifying comprehensive findings and would welcome further research conducted by Japanese think tanks and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-shape-of-cyber-ecosystems-in-the-uk-and-japan&quot;&gt;I. The Shape of Cyber Ecosystems in the UK and Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides context on the cyber ecosystems of the UK and Japan, and the factors that shape the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-posture-and-governance&quot;&gt;National Cyber Posture and Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan score well on international cyber rankings. The International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cybersecurity Index ranked the UK 2nd and Japan 7th globally in 2020. Similarly, the UK is ranked 9th on the e-Governance Academy’s National Cyber Security Index 2016–2023, with Japan ranked 52nd. While Japan has increased its focus on cyber security in recent years, partners have urged the country to move faster. Comments in particular from US Admiral Dennis Blair and then Director of the US National Security Agency, Paul Nakasone, have emphasised Japan’s need to match the capabilities of its allies and partners. The need is recognised in the commitment in Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy for response capabilities in cyber security to be “strengthened equal to or surpassing the level of leading Western countries”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivating the shared focus on cyber security of both the UK and Japan is the growing cyber threat. Ransomware attacks conducted by cyber-criminals in 2023 included those on the Port of Nagoya in Japan and on the British Library in London, inflicting significant financial and societal damage. It has been estimated that cybercrime against businesses has cost the UK over £30 billion per annum, with interview data suggesting that Japan also experiences significant costs. State-sponsored attackers are a persistent threat. Cyber attackers affiliated to China have been associated with a hack into Japan’s military in 2020, and into the UK Electoral Commission in 2022. Interstate competition, reflecting geopolitical tensions, has driven greater attention towards national cyber defence in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK significantly reformed its national approach to cyber security in 2016 by establishing the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) as a central authority. The NCSC is part of GCHQ. The closest equivalent to the NCSC in Japan is the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC), which sits within the prime minister’s office. Compared with the NCSC, the NISC has limited cross-government influence or powers beyond convening; moreover, it does not have a permanent staff – officials are seconded from industry and other parts of government. Furthermore, the NISC has many fewer technical personnel than the NCSC. Technical officials sit instead within the Information Technology Protection Agency (IPA) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy commits to restructuring the NISC into a new organisation that can “comprehensively coordinate [cyber] policies” – interviewees indicated that the UK’s NCSC may be used as a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have had several national cyber strategies. The UK launched its first strategy in 2009, Japan in 2013. The UK’s current National Cyber Strategy 2022 outlines five central pillars: the domestic cyber ecosystem; national cyber resilience; achieving technological advantage; pursuing global leadership; and countering threats. Japan’s 2021 national cyber-security strategy, Cybersecurity for All, has three pillars: promoting socioeconomic development; safety and security in a digital society; and contributing to international peace and stability. Across their strategies, both countries acknowledge the importance of taking a multi-stakeholder approach – the UK refers to this as a “whole of society” approach, Japan as a “whole of nation” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-bilateral-cyber-engagement&quot;&gt;Drivers of Bilateral Cyber Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research participants identified several factors that support continued buy-in to the Cyber Partnership across both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, several participants noted that the Cyber Partnership and the wider bilateral relationship are mutually reinforcing. Activities that build trust in one another’s cyber capabilities reassure each country that wider cooperation is secure. Likewise, cooperation on diverse activities, such as defence and security or standards development, encourages deeper engagement on cyber security. The Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), the UK–Japan–Italy initiative to build a sixth-generation fighter jet, was regularly cited by interviewees as an example of how cyber-security engagement is a requirement for and enabler of the wider bilateral relationship. Were high-level domestic commitments to the relationship to weaken, there is a risk that the Cyber Partnership would lose the momentum built around the Hiroshima Accord. For example, if a headline activity such as the GCAP experienced significant and public issues, they could undermine other activities. To deepen the Cyber Partnership, it is important to continue making the case for engagement on cyber security, and to entrench operational areas of cooperation that will maintain a close and trusting relationship. Choosing the right framing for activities under the Partnership and adopting a long-term mindset, including bilateral exchanges or multi-year commitments to joint exercises, is thus a valuable way to harness the opportunities the partnership presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor identified by participants that drives the Cyber Partnership is geopolitical alignment. Under the late former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan revitalised its approach to defence and security, modifying the interpretation of its right to “collective self-defence” (“集団的自衛権”) and pioneering the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”. Japan’s cyber strategy has drawn on these ambitious changes in advocating for a “free, fair and secure” cyberspace, a call supported by various reforms, such as the introduction of “active cyber defence” (ACD – for differences in understandings of ACD, see next section, “Common Misunderstandings”). The UK has committed to supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and the country’s Indo-Pacific “tilt”, confirmed as a permanent pillar of UK strategy in the Integrated Review Refresh 2023, emphasises the relationship with Japan. Similarly to Japan, the UK is committed to a “free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace”. Amid geopolitical tensions, the two countries align on major international security issues, such as supporting Ukraine against Russia’s illegal invasion and engaging with Taiwan on building resilience. The Cyber Partnership has thus far benefited from bilateral alignment and there is little reason to expect this to change in the coming years, with neither the UK Labour Party nor Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party showing signs of reneging on the commitment at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, several Japanese research participants remarked that their perception of the UK as a “first mover”, its transparency on various aspects of cyber policy and its comparable size all motivated engagement. The UK was regarded by research participants as a first mover for convening the AI Safety Summit and co-leading the Pall Mall Process in 2023. Compared with the US, the UK was also seen as more similar to Japan in terms of scale, spending power and cultural attitudes, among other things. When discussing transparency on cyber policy, interviewees referred to the UK National Cyber Force’s guidance on “Responsible Cyber Power in Practice”, which outlines how and why the UK conducts cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, multiple participants emphasised the importance of trusted in-country representatives as facilitators and enablers of the Partnership. Participants specifically praised the efforts of embassy officials in London and Tokyo who focus on cyber aspects of the bilateral relationship. Their presence ensures that cyber-specific face-to-face meetings can regularly take place. This offsets the obstacle of geographic distance, which can increase the time and financial commitment required for Japan–UK government engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-misunderstandings&quot;&gt;Common Misunderstandings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership is impacted by different uses of terminology and a low awareness of respective capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misunderstanding can arise where key concepts are used differently, for example ACD. In the UK, ACD is a programme of interventions led by the NCSC to tackle high-volume commodity attacks. In its 2022 National Security Strategy, Japan committed to its own version of ACD, consisting of three activity areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing information sharing from the private sector to government in the event of cyber attacks, and improving incident response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with domestic telecommunications providers to identify and block malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing required authorities for government to “penetrate and neutralize attacker’s servers and others in advance” of cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this definition, some members of Japanese civil society understand ACD as creating expanded scope for surveillance and permitting extra-territorial offensive cyber operations. This has raised questions about whether ACD violates the constitutional right to privacy and secret communications, and about Japan’s application of the principle of self-defence. Political sensitivity about ACD has delayed its implementation and created scepticism among potential private sector partners. ACD has also created some confusion in the bilateral relationship, as the UK and Japanese definitions and approaches differ. Some interviewees reported that translations of Japanese ACD activity areas have been confusing. For example, one interviewee remarked that “侵入・無害”, translated in the English language version of the National Security Strategy as to “penetrate and neutralize”, does not necessarily include the “and” in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language barrier has meant that difficulties in aligning understandings of strategic and policy frameworks are reproduced to some extent at an operational level – neither the UK nor Japan has a strong reputation for linguistic aptitude. In some cases, slightly different Japanese phrases are used for the same term in English. For example, the broad English term “information sharing” is translated as “情報交換” (which has connotations of exchange), but also as “情報共有” (which has connotations of common ownership). In other cases, terminology is imported into Japanese discourse from English through transliteration, rather than translation. For example, the transliteration of “attribution” as “アトリ ビューション” introduces a degree of uncertainty as to whether this is best represented in Japanese as “特定” (“specify”) or “帰属” (“attribute”). Awareness of nuanced differences and attention to precise detail in communication will mitigate such problems and help manage expectations in the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research participants generally reported that Japan’s cyber-security capability is low in all areas. They frequently cited well-known issues about Japan’s information security, particularly in the defence sector, as evidence. Nonetheless, there are also capabilities which are often overlooked. Multiple Japanese ministries have had PPPs since the early 2010s. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has the Initiative for Cyber Security Information-Sharing Partnership of Japan, the Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has the Cyber Defense Council, and the National Police Authority (NPA) has the Japan Cybercrime Control Center. Additionally, Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which sits under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), has established a cyber-security capacity-building centre with ASEAN to train government and critical national infrastructure professionals. Concerns about Japan’s cyber-security capabilities, particularly related to information security, are well founded and widely acknowledged. Nonetheless, a one-dimensional understanding of Japan’s cyber capability discounts the progress that has been made and implies that peer-to-peer engagement is out of reach. No country has a perfect record. A mature and sustainable UK–Japan cyber partnership should honestly acknowledge where each country needs to improve, while appreciating how the other’s existing and emerging strengths can improve mutual resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-cyber-engagement-progress-so-far&quot;&gt;II. Cyber Engagement: Progress So Far&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an overview of UK–Japan cyber engagement activities and assesses their composition and intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;partnership-activities-and-engaged-actors&quot;&gt;Partnership Activities and Engaged Actors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows cyber engagement activities between the UK and Japan. Listed activities are linked with relevant actors, assigned a type of engagement, and assessed as to whether they align with the themes of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities outlined in Table 1 were identified through interviews and from open source information. As far as the authors are aware, Japan and the UK do not maintain a shared list or overview of all activities under the Partnership. By collecting activities which can reasonably be linked to bilateral cyber cooperation and assigning them a theme, type and responsible actors, the table provides a snapshot of the Partnership. This snapshot is not an authoritative list of activities under the Partnership, as it is not confirmed by either government, nor did the research take place at a classified level. Assumptions based on the list of activities must therefore be made with caution and with the awareness that the list may not be conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kdMKnZK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Overview of Cyber Partnership Activities, 2023–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors, based on interviews and open source information. Notes: For acronym meanings, please refer to the Abbreviations list at the start of the paper. “Themes” include specific priorities of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership – PPPs, capability development and advancing shared international interests – as well as governance and miscellaneous other themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Partnership matures, more transparency on implementation and resourcing should be considered. For example, there is currently little public communication about how it is monitored and resourced. Publicly agreed milestones, for example, could emphasise the importance of appropriate resourcing to meet Partnership commitments. While too much transparency carries the risk of watered down or vague commitments, the UK and Japan should nonetheless consider clearer communication on the details of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity Themes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows that cyber engagement activities broadly align with the priority areas of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership themes with the most activity were “advancing shared international interests” and “capability development”. This aligns with statements by research participants that assigned the most significance to cooperation in these areas. Participants explained this in the following terms: that these areas have multiple implementing actors with clear remits and motivations to engage, and increased resourcing on each side to implement these commitments. For example, Japan and the UK have worked closely in forums where they are both members, for example the Counter Ransomware Initiative and the OEWG, but – perhaps more importantly – they have prioritised participating in and supporting each other’s minilateral initiatives, such as the Pall Mall Process and the Keio International Cybersecurity Symposium. Similarly, data gathering indicated a particular focus on joint exercises to develop and refine capabilities, and initiatives for skills building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities to advance shared international interests through multilateral platforms have built on existing engagements and reflect that the Partnership does not take a zero-sum view of cooperation. UK–Japan cooperation on cyber does not preclude engagement with other countries, nor can it. Efforts on capability development have concentrated on defence and security. Joint teaming on Exercise Locked Shields was particularly emphasised as an activity that built capabilities, reinforced trust and signalled alignment internationally. Nonetheless, select UK government officials expressed uncertainty that they would continue to pursue joint teaming in exercises, explaining that it is difficult to over-commit personnel in operational roles. Concerns about resourcing were not frequently raised by research participants. Researchers concluded that this was either because top-down prioritisation of the Partnership made for fewer resourcing obstacles, or because the activities were not excessively costly. If ambitions for the Partnership continue on their current trajectory, resourcing activities may become more challenging due to limited cyber workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities on PPPs show promise for closer cooperation but have thus far been focused on Japanese firms operating in the UK. Researchers believe this can be explained in part by the smaller number of UK firms active in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers created an additional theme of “cyber-resilient ecosystems” to categorise activities that support national reforms and concern standards and regulations. This theme recognises activities that already exist or are ongoing, and reflects insights from research participants who stressed the value of Partnership in this area. Discussions between counterparts on areas including structural reforms, secure AI, standards and so on are particularly important. Neither the UK nor Japan is part of a supranational regulatory body such as the EU, nor do they have the market power of the US or China. More dialogue on regulation and approaches would provide opportunities for Japan and the UK to influence global headwinds, share learnings and best practices, and deepen the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity Types&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper assigns 12 different types to identified activities. These types attempt to group and rationalise activities to support the Partnership in structuring further cooperation. Again, while the list of activities may not be definitive, the diversity of types reflects positively on the Partnership’s ambition to be diverse and broad based. The sub-section below discusses the most salient of these activity types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, there is significant depth and breadth of activity focused on government-to-government (G2G) dialogue. These discussions span a variety of issues, including sensitive topics such as defence and security. Regular substantial dialogue is important to ensure mutual understanding and to identify further opportunities for cooperation. Regular G2G and multi-stakeholder dialogue also facilitates other activities. Research data noted that activities, such as joint agreements on standards or product security, often emerge from initial wide-ranging conversations, such as between the UK’s Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and Japan’s METI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity types where research participants indicated there was good opportunity for more cooperation are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants identified the opportunity to accelerate the technical assurance and accreditation of cyber-security companies, for example by the UK’s NCSC. Existing activities facilitated market access for Japanese firms and provided benefits for UK consumers. Further activities could build on this work, including improving access for UK companies in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterrence/international norms.&lt;/strong&gt; UK stakeholders placed significant importance on this type of activity. The UK sees joint attributions with close partners as highly impactful. Japanese officials are aiming to expand attribution activities and consistently emphasise the importance of accuracy. Some research participants believed that Japan has little capacity to conduct technical assessment to support attributions, and are wary about sharing data due to information security concerns. While Japanese officials acknowledged that they would like access to more information and intelligence, they do receive inputs from the NPA, the NISC, the Japan Cyber Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) and the IPA, which can inform political decision-making. Expanding cooperation on this type of activity is more likely to be a political question than one of technical capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devolved engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers were surprised by cooperation between regional cyber clusters in the UK and Japan, specifically Cyber Hiroshima and Cyber Wales. This included sharing best practices and trailing joint activities. Both organisations demonstrated significant enthusiasm for the Partnership, and this model offers a clear value case for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and the UK both have advanced digital economies with substantial high-tech sectors, including robotics, smart cities and AI. Cyber security is significant for these industries and data gathering indicates that companies from both countries have opportunities to work with counterparts, and to export and purchase products and services. Data gathering did not include in-depth market research, but researchers would recommend that government trade ministries produce and publish such information to support companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber capacity building (CCB).&lt;/strong&gt; Research participants from both the UK and Japan emphasised CCB as an area of opportunity. JICA and the FCDO each have a good international reputation for CCB. The UK-funded training course delivered through the ASEAN-Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre (AJCCBC) in February 2024 is consistent with Japan’s focus on personnel development and demonstrates the ability to cooperate on this type of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe it is also likely that a rather low level of current activity on the above areas informed research participants’ belief that there is opportunity in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actors Involved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of actors involved in activities listed in Table 1 demonstrates that cyber cooperation is decentralised, and that organisations often establish and maintain relationships with bilateral partners independently. Multiple officials validated this perception, including one who argued that decentralised, whole-of-government engagement is preferable for Japan in advance of expected reforms to the NISC. While a central coordinating actor can be beneficial, if Japan and the UK aspire to have a high tempo of engagement across multiple areas, diverse government actors will need direct points of contact with their counterparts. Determining how centralised cooperation should be is important. Too much centralisation can create barriers to engagement, leading to delays, too little can result in siloed activities that are unaligned with bilateral strategic priorities. Moreover, too few centralised initiatives that facilitate engagement can result in some government entities not being involved in bilateral cooperation: for example, Japan’s IPA featured infrequently in research participants’ accounts of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A challenge to cooperation is that some counterpart organisations do not have the same roles and responsibilities. For example, the coordination of public attribution in Japan sits with the National Security Secretariat, fed by technical information from the NPA and other members of the intelligence community, and advice from the MOFA on the diplomatic consequences. This contrasts with the UK, where the FCDO holds political responsibility and the NCSC provides technical advice. In practice, a ministry or agency may have different counterparts on different policy or operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for effective conveners who can facilitate bilateral connections between counterpart organisations is a key dependency for the Partnership. In their absence, there is a risk that an inability to identify and connect with relevant counterparts will undermine engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-institutional and departmental career paths can be beneficial to enhance dialogue between actors working on various aspects of cyber policy in different governmental departments. This avoids government departments working in silos on overarching topics such as cyber. This is already practised in the UK, where civil servants move within cyber-relevant institutions, for example from positions in the National Crime Agency (NCA) to the NCSC or the National Cyber Force. While temporary secondments are common in Japan, dedicated cyber career paths could further strengthen the government’s cyber workforce and international engagement, with officials developing trust and competence over multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines additional considerations that have shaped the development and prioritisation of activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informal networks drive activity take-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Primary data gathering indicated that several activities happened because officials had personal connections with counterparts and together identified opportunities for cooperation. Participation in annual cyber dialogues was identified as a particularly important way to build these relationships. Reports that some government stakeholders were unable to join dialogues because of funding restrictions are therefore worrying. While governments should ensure value for money, bilateral cooperation benefits from personal relationships. The geographical and linguistic distance between the UK and Japan therefore presents obstacles. The resources required for officials to engage can be prohibitive, especially in a context of limited budgets. Given the scale of resources required, whether these are provided will likely depend on political will – if there continues to be high-level commitment to the Partnership, sufficient funding is likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation is complex.&lt;/strong&gt; The activities identified in Table 1 are summarised and organised into delimited categories. While this offers a snapshot of the Partnership, some areas of engagement cannot be understood as discrete activities. For example, while few activities were assigned under the cyber-resilient ecosystems theme, several senior decision-makers conveyed that this area was their primary priority. While this could show that prioritisation had been ineffective, data gathered instead indicates that engagement on this theme can proceed without distinct activities – demonstrating a limitation of assessing a partnership solely through listing activities. Multiple Japanese stakeholders referred to the UK’s structures and legislation as a model, and explained this was because of similarities between the two countries, and the depth of wider cooperation. Further, in addition to activities identified under “advancing shared international interests”, other informal, ad-hoc and small-scale cooperative efforts regularly take place in multiple forums not listed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited scope for impact in some areas.&lt;/strong&gt; More cooperation does not guarantee more impact. The introduction of initiatives in areas of cyber not well suited to UK–Japan cooperation could be inefficient or disadvantageous. An example of this is formalising operational cooperation on cybercrime investigations. In practice, very few of the cases covered by the UK’s NCA and Japan’s NPA overlap. In the rare cases that are linked, agencies engage on an ad-hoc basis to meet operational objectives. Any well-intentioned move to formalise this limited engagement would neither be a good use of resources nor create efficiencies. The difference in each country’s cybercrime threat landscape is mirrored to some extent in state threats. Japan is focused on cyber threats from China and North Korea, whereas the UK often prioritises Russian threat actors. This could mean that information sharing is less relevant – however, multiple research participants framed the difference as complementary. Where information sharing can take place, it could bolster each country’s national cyber defence. Officials from the UK and Japan should be on the lookout for areas where there is modest scope to expand valuable engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;III. Strategic Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter contextualises existing activities and assesses how existing Partnership commitments align with wider bilateral priorities, and considers whether national strategies point to further opportunities for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aligning-the-cyber-partnership-and-the-hiroshima-accord&quot;&gt;Aligning the Cyber Partnership and the Hiroshima Accord&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership focuses on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening PPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed above, these priorities broadly correspond with cyber cooperation activities identified in this paper. The only exceptions are activities that the authors associate with a new area (“cyber-resilient ecosystems”) and several others that fall into the “Other” category – entirely G2G dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership was set out under the Hiroshima Accord. The Accord commits to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Strengthening our shared security capabilities to help safeguard global peace and stability”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deepening our economic relationship to create shared prosperity and increase trade and investment”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Leading international efforts to deliver a better and more sustainable future for all”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Partnership is mentioned within the first of these three categories, implying that the Partnership focuses on defence and security. This is reflected in activities identified in Table 1, for example the combined SDF and UK armed forces exercises. Nevertheless, other activities have addressed, for example awareness and skills building and aligning standards and regulations, thereby suggesting that the Partnership is broader than defence and security. Discussions with officials have supported this conclusion. While the Partnership was founded with a focus on defence and security, it now also addresses – albeit informally – other Hiroshima Accord priorities: shared economic prosperity and leading international efforts for global resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to pursuing activities across the Partnership that align with all three Accord priorities has shown some signs of success, but prospects for a higher pace of engagement are uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive signals have been sent by both governments on deepening economic ties through cyber security. Japan has contracted a British company to provide cyber-security training to SDF and JMoD officials, and the NCSC has invited Fujitsu UK to join its Industry 100 scheme and accredited Nihon Cyber Defence as an incident response provider. Nonetheless, the growth in trade and investment in cyber has been slow. Private sector stakeholders are wary about the difficulties of entering foreign markets, with several anticipating high costs and, in the defence sector, expressing anxiety about the ability to acquire required clearances. The lack of a common language is a significant challenge. Translation software, which is increasingly AI-enabled, partly mitigates language differences, but these still present a barrier. Market structures also present challenges. Japanese companies often procure cyber-security products and services from a small number of large vendors. Vendors are risk averse, and slow to integrate small- and medium-sized-enterprise (SME) products and services. This disadvantages both Japanese and British SMEs. Larger UK cyber-security companies are less likely to use a vendor, and while they have sufficient resources to set up offices locally, there is a significant time and cost investment. UK companies reported significant difficulties in hiring qualified and bilingual Japanese employees, who were seen as essential to business operations. Research participants from Japanese companies similarly reported anxiety about entering the UK market, but were able to identify fewer specific concerns. Officials in the UK and Japan are enthusiastic about deepening the economic Partnership through cyber, although data gathering indicates there are outstanding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third priority of the Cyber Partnership already aligns somewhat with the third pillar of the Hiroshima Accord. It is possible to advance shared interests – building influence, countering adversaries and so on – while simultaneously delivering a better and sustainable future internationally. For example, both the UK and Japan undertake CCB to support cyber resilience, awareness and security in recipient countries. In addition to building recipients’ capacity to mitigate cyber harms, CCB can also meet influence, security and economic objectives. The UK has several global CCB programmes, including the Indo-Pacific Cyber Programme, while Japan currently focuses on Indo-Pacific countries – JICA intends to expand its activities in Oceania and Africa. Additionally, Japan has established the AJCCBC as an axis for CCB in the Asia Pacific region. As detailed in Table 1, the UK has deployed CCB through the AJCCBC. The UK and Japan each have ambitions for CCB, and further alignment could act as a multiplier for their efforts. The extent to which the UK and Japan can coordinate their CCB efforts will depend on strategic and practical considerations. Do the countries agree on where, how and when to expend resources on CCB? Further, can they effectively work together on an operational level – are their ways of working, processes for information sharing and so on aligned? While the UK and Japan are like-minded partners, diverse individual factors shape their respective foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-strategic-alignment-and-additional-overlaps&quot;&gt;National Strategic Alignment and Additional Overlaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan each have an overarching national cyber-security strategy, the pillars of which are shown in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan share a strategic commitment to increasing the security and resilience of their digital societies. Japan’s overarching stated objective is to ensure “a free, fair and secure cyberspace”, while the UK vision is for a “free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace”. The strategies echo one another, and the two countries have similar priorities in cyber policy. Both recognise the necessary role of the private sector, are increasingly prioritising standards and regulations, and are committed to using cyber to pursue international objectives. Additionally, they share an understanding of the nature of the threat. These points of convergence provided the impetus for the Cyber Partnership and have driven its first year, focused on PPPs, advancing shared international interests and capability development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several areas where the UK and Japan have strong strategic crossovers, but which present more difficulties for cooperation. These include: interoperable standards; cyber threat intelligence sharing; joint hunt forward operations; and research and academic partnerships. Chapter IV discusses the benefits and challenges involved in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-strategic-considerations-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;IV. Strategic Considerations and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper finds that there is valuable momentum in the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership across multiple areas, driven by shared challenges and opportunities. Nonetheless, the Partnership is still in its infancy and there is significant space to grow. While current strategic priorities are appropriate for the bilateral Partnership, further activities can be pursued, and areas of focus expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter makes recommendations for the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, highlighting strategic considerations and suggesting practical activities as the Partnership moves into its second year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-considerations&quot;&gt;Strategic Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In approaching the recommendations outlined below, Japan and the UK should consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay the course:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, and the Hiroshima Accord within which it sits, are relatively new initiatives. Bilateral relations between the two countries have been warming over the past decade, but domestic political priorities can divert attention. It is important that the achievements of the Partnership to date are properly communicated and that the areas of cooperation it has identified are entrenched. Continued attention to the Partnership will provide benefits across the wider relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Partnership as one piece of the puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt; Viewing bilateral cooperation in isolation is unhelpful. The UK and Japan are like-minded partners which sit within a latticework of other multilateral and minilateral agreements. While the importance placed on bilateral activities is understandable, neither country should be discouraged from pursuing initiatives that involve other partners within groupings, such as Five Eyes, AUKUS and the Quad, that have aligned strategic interests. Nonetheless, opportunities for bilateral cooperation to drive comparative advantage for both the UK and Japan should be pursued where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Successful cooperation on cyber reforms is a two-way street:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan’s cyber legislation and structures are undergoing significant reforms. Japan’s international partners, including the UK, are keen to provide input and assistance to this process, and Japanese stakeholders want to learn from international best practices. Nonetheless, the Partnership should not be framed as a capacity-building initiative. Engagement between the UK and Japan, for example the GCAP, takes place on peer-to-peer terms. Thus, the Partnership should continue to frame itself as a peer-to-peer initiative. While Japan is looking to “catch up” with the UK on cyber, there are still learnings to share in the near term and, as Japan’s capabilities quickly improve, significant opportunities for in-depth cooperation in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber security as an enabler and an activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased trust and cooperation on cyber security open the way for deeper engagement on diverse areas of partnership. This is especially important as the UK and Japan prioritise defence and security cooperation. Equally, cyber-security engagement should be seen as an end in itself. Assessing and appreciating the value of the Partnership in these terms is important to determining how much resource to assign to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate delays and dead ends:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership has achieved good momentum in its first year, despite several challenges and obstacles that are unlikely to disappear in the near term. These issues have been highlighted throughout this paper, across strategic risks such as domestic political commitment and conflicting international priorities; tactical obstacles including resourcing, language, information security, different threat landscapes and geographical distance; and the lack of a common implementation plan. While this paper raises these challenges, it focuses on outlining the strategic motivation for the Partnership and identifying bilateral activities. Further research is required to better understand the significance and breadth of challenges to the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommended-activities&quot;&gt;Recommended Activities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Capability Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a global shortage of cyber skills. Governments are struggling to train and retain skilled officials, which impacts their ability to assess, develop and implement technical solutions. Shortages of skilled personnel have downstream effects on governments’ access to cyber-security products and services that contribute to national cyber defence. Internal capability gaps within governments and non-specialist companies have led to a greater reliance on cyber-security providers and implementers. The following recommendations detail how the UK and Japan can continue to cooperate to develop and improve capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Establish repeatable and department-neutral personnel development cooperation activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinating agencies, national technical authorities and ministries of foreign affairs should establish limited and distinct personnel development activities. Such activities should be relatively reproducible by different parts of government and should encompass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training.&lt;/strong&gt; Technical training is an important way to upskill personnel and provide a non-financial incentive to remain with an organisation. For Japan, the scale of the training required will necessitate private sector assistance – Japan’s MoD intends to have around 4,000 cyber core personnel of SDF units by the end of Japan’s Financial Year (JFY) 2027, up from around 890 in JFY2022, and around 20,000 cyber-related personnel in the ministry, including the cyber core personnel of the SDF units. The UK cyber-security sector has many companies that conduct this kind of training: they should be incentivised and facilitated through the Partnership to bid for Japanese government contracts. Non-technical training should also be included in this offer – there is a particular opportunity for interactive sessions on defence doctrine, although this should likely involve direct participation from the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchanges.&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese and UK agencies, departments and ministries that engage regularly and have clear areas of overlap should pursue personnel exchanges. DSIT, METI and other organisations focused on cutting-edge cyber and technology regulation would especially benefit. This activity will likely be impacted by the language barriers outlined throughout this paper. Creative solutions, including intensive language training, may limit the impact of this obstacle but can be resource intensive. Participating agencies could instead link exchanges to language upskilling opportunities offered to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercises.&lt;/strong&gt; Joint teams at international exercises and participation in each other’s national exercises builds operational familiarity, develops participants’ skills and signals partnership internationally. These benefits should, however, be managed against understandable concerns about trade-offs in resourcing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the private sector is involved in these activities, Japan and the UK should encourage partnerships involving companies from both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Continue informal discussions on retention and recruitment policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD and JMoD should continue to discuss retention and recruitment efforts. They should commit to sharing learnings with other parts of government that employ cyber operators, such as the police. This could also include proposals for cooperation initiatives between UK and Japanese cyber reservists. Including reservists in cooperation efforts brings strong expertise to the table and can limit demand on limited personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Establish processes for more effective sharing of information and cyber threat intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a higher tempo of cooperation, Japan and the UK should more effectively and actively share information. Information must include cyber threat intelligence but should not be limited to it – for example, intelligence about the organisation of threat actors is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share information, better processes are required. Practices to enable cyber threat intelligence sharing are an example of where reforms are underway to balance the need for equivalence with country-specific demands. Reform of Japanese policy and processes on information security, security clearances and classifications are proceeding at the same time as the UK security establishment is refining its understanding of how to approach a satisfactory level of equivalence. Sustained bilateral dialogue through the channels of cyber-security cooperation facilitates convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP has driven efforts to converge approaches to information security. The timeline to achieve an operational capability by 2035 is tight, and there is pressure to accelerate information-sharing questions at all classifications. In the absence of streamlined information sharing, the concern is that GCAP will be less efficient, and a delayed timeline will mean it offers a less effective response to increasing threats from adversaries. Currently, the commitment to establishing a secure digital platform enabling GCAP partners to work together and share information in a real-time collaborative environment is still in the process of delivery. A sixth-generation fighter cannot be designed with first-generation techniques. Solving information sharing is a technical problem, but it is also a political one. The primary responsibility at present sits with government officials, who are understandably risk sensitive. To ensure significant and timely progress is made on information sharing – which is necessary for GCAP and across the wider Partnership – political decision-makers will likely need to engage more actively to drive implementation. Part of this will involve making tough decisions about trust and information security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. PPPs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private companies are critical actors in cyber and technology. Japan and the UK have acknowledged a need to work with the private sector, each developing multiple PPPs. Building cooperation on PPPs between the UK and Japan, however, presents significant challenges. There is no common language, business cultures differ, motivations to engage with two governments rather than one vary, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Enable partnerships between regional clusters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devolved administrations working with trade ministries should encourage partnerships between regional cyber clusters. The support of Cyber Wales in establishing Cyber Hiroshima and their continued partnership is a non-governmental success story for the Cyber Partnership. As more Japanese municipalities look to establish cyber clusters, trade and digital ministries from each country should facilitate introductions with existing UK clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Promote connections between sectoral Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant ministries and agencies, including the NCSC, NISC and IPA, which work closely with national sectoral ISACs, should facilitate discussions with their bilateral counterparts. Agencies should then encourage and partially support cooperation between sectoral ISACs where there is clear interest, such as nuclear, finance and automotive. This activity should be careful not to duplicate existing international ISAC cooperation, nor unnecessarily promote engagement where there is no clear need and interest. One opportunity is to build additional cooperation on the foundation of the existing good relations between the UK’s Cyber Defence Alliance and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center – non-profits that work with the private sector and law enforcement to combat cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Take a more proactive and targeted approach to expanding commercial cyber engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s METI and the UK’s Department of Business and Trade (DBT) should determine a strategic approach, in partnership with their respective private sectors, to promote market access in the UK and Japan. This could include: encouraging and facilitating partnership with UK/Japanese firms; enabling SMEs and primes to present a consolidated UK/Japan offer; and identifying and promoting relevant niches where UK/Japan industry has a relevant comparative advantage. These principles should continue to be supported by regular trade missions. These activities are important to lower the perceived barriers to trade in cyber security, as well as creating opportunities for companies to explore partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METI and the DBT should further explore providing a landing-pad function for the UK’s and Japan’s cyber-security companies. This would complement other efforts, for example the Industry 100 scheme including Japanese firms with a UK presence, to demonstrate the opportunities for British and Japanese businesses. Non- or quasi-governmental organisations, especially trade and industry bodies (for example, Keidanren, the Confederation of British Industry and the National Cyber Advisory Board – NCAB), should also be facilitated to support bilateral commercial opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Explore further opportunities to expand national PPPs to include UK or Japanese companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government organisations operating national PPPs should assess whether they can expand these schemes to include foreign (Japanese/UK) companies. This should include multiple types of initiative, such as cyber threat intelligence sharing and personnel secondments. The UK has begun to take this approach through the Industry 100 scheme, admitting two Japanese companies with a UK presence. Japan could consider a similar approach in the Cyber Defence Council (a defence industry PPP) through the Cybersecurity Council, or by inviting secondees from UK companies with a Japanese presence into the NISC. For this to happen, however, UK companies would need to expand their presence in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Advancing Shared International Interests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan are like-minded liberal democracies that share many geopolitical concerns and ambitions. Both support a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”, value a responsible approach to cyber, and face common adversaries. The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership provides an effective channel through which cooperation to achieve shared international interests can be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Promote the AJCCBC as a hub for CCB in ASEAN, use it as a model in the Indo-Pacific and develop cooperative offerings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JICA and the FCDO should develop joint CCB projects leveraging existing initiatives. These projects should use current products/services such as CYDER (Cyber Defense Exercise with Recurrence) trainings delivered by the MIC, and Cyber Security Capacity Maturity Models developed by Oxford University. The FCDO should also consider expanding its deployment of CCB activities in ASEAN via the AJCCBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JICA should explore linking the AJCCBC more closely with other Indo-Pacific centres of cyber excellence on CCB and other topics, for example the ASEAN Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence and the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise’s Pacific Hub. This would involve building on existing regular exchanges between the AJCCBC and these organisations. The FCDO should offer to support this effort, drawing on its experience of coordinating and implementing CCB activities and its commitment to Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual UK–Japan cyber dialogues should commit to discuss and, where possible, strategically align decision-making about CCB. This alignment should entail deconfliction at a minimum. More ambitious alignment would include coordinating efforts to improve regional partners’ cyber resilience and defence to deter, deny and disrupt adversaries. The 2024 UK–Japan cyber dialogue should consider Mongolia and Taiwan as high-priority partners for trilateral engagement on CCB. In the latter case, this is more likely to involve peer-to-peer-type activities, such as joint exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Pursue closer collaboration to promote international rules and norms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the UK should expand and continue to align structural and activity-based cooperation on international rules and norms. The FCDO, MOFA and other ministries participating in international structures, such as the Counter Ransomware Initiative or the UN Open-Ended Working Group, should, where possible, adopt consistent positions. They should further work cooperatively to advocate for a free, fair, responsible and open cyberspace among countries that have not committed to this principle, particularly in ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCDO, MOFA and relevant technical agencies should continue to actively identify opportunities for joint attribution or statements that reiterate their positions on international rules and norms in cyberspace. An example of this is Japanese support for the UK’s attribution of APT31, a Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actor, in March 2024. Reforms to clearances and increased information sharing will enable more joint statements, as will focusing attribution efforts on less sensitive adversaries. Nonetheless, both partners should appreciate the other’s specific thresholds and willingness to make public statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Align proactive international cyber crisis support efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministries of defence and foreign affairs and relevant technical agencies should explore cooperation on proactive international cyber support to third countries at high risk of experiencing large-scale cyber incidents. Engagement on proactive international cyber crisis support should include identification of cooperation activities and alignment on strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation activities could include joint deployment in initiatives in the style of hunt forward operations. Additionally, relevant government departments should share lessons identified through providing international crisis support to, for example, Ukraine. From this, the UK and Japan should discuss involvement in a jointly funded mechanism to respond to large-scale incidents in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When expanding cooperation on international cyber crisis support activities, the UK and Japan should clearly set remits, thresholds and priorities for these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Cyber-Resilient Ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber-resilient ecosystems rely on clear, well-assigned roles and responsibilities across government. Since establishing the NCSC in 2016, the UK has made few changes to its cyber governance; Japan is in the midst of major reforms to its cyber governance. The UK and Japan are both actively considering how, where, and when to regulate cyber security. Both countries are outside the orbits of the largest regulators: the EU; China; and the US. Cooperation on governing cyber security is important as each country navigates a complex global regulatory environment. With the UK planning a new Cyber Security Resilience Bill and Japan committed to the reforms discussed above, cooperation on cyber-resilient ecosystems and the necessary reforms should be seen as a “two-way street” as the Partnership progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Provide consolidated learnings from the development of government structures and processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In partnership with other relevant government departments and former officials, the NCSC should provide a consolidated summary of UK cyber structural and legislative reforms since 2016. Areas of importance within this summary are: responsibly using investigatory powers; the creation of structures to integrate confidential and non-sensitive intelligence; the expansion of PPPs from operational to strategic functions; and the development of products to support whole-of-society cyber security. Japan’s Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters and the NISC could use this resource to inform their reorganisation, while also providing feedback to British counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Discuss learnings from the development of military cyber functions and enabling processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Cyber Force, the MoD, armed forces and intelligence services should continue to conduct bilateral dialogues with Japan’s SDF and JMoD, including its Cyber Defence Group and Defence Intelligence Headquarters. There should be a focus on discussions of processes to declassify and share information and the development of cyber capabilities in a responsible and transparent manner – each was considered a priority concern by several Japanese government interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Pursue mutual recognition of cyber professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSIT, METI and relevant national bodies, such as the UK NCSC, should explore mutual recognition of cyber professional standards. This effort should aim to integrate with the existing Cyber Skills Partnership between the UK and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Create a bi-annual dialogue to explore standards alignment and interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSIT and METI should lead and coordinate bi-annual dialogues to promote alignment on cyber security and related standards. These should reinforce existing efforts on app security, AI and the Internet of Things, by addressing areas such as software supply chain security and industrial control systems. The UK Department of Business and Trade and METI should also work with industry to identify where interoperability is most important to promote trade, including schemes such as Cyber Essentials, which are required to compete for UK government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the priorities of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership should determine most bilateral cyber cooperation, actors should not be closed to other opportunities. Dispersed cooperation with multiple points of contact between the governments presents many opportunities, but may be hard to track centrally and could draw resources from priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Continue supporting enabling engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufficient funding should be committed to ensure proper cross-government representation at annual cyber dialogues. Maintaining person-to-person relationships is crucial to achieve mutual ambitions for an increased tempo of bilateral engagement on cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued visits by senior officials and government representatives should also be pursued. Top-down pressure provides government officials with motivation and authority to prioritise bilateral efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Deepen partnership on cyber education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the UK’s Department for Education, and relevant higher education authorities should explore measures to encourage university-level partnerships on cyber security. These should include promoting joint degree programmes between universities and exploring special exemptions or allowances for language tests to encourage higher-education mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant departments should assess the effectiveness of the pilot Japan Cyber Fellowship and Cyber First competition, and determine whether to expand the programme. Further activities should be trialled across all stages of education to test whether bilateral engagement can promote better safety and skills outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Produce a report every two to three years assessing the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary responsible organisations (likely the FCDO, MOFA, the NISC or the NCSC) should continue to regularly review the progress of the Cyber Partnership to assess areas of success, learning and further opportunity. This assessment should also be used to examine whether the existing remit of the Partnership is sufficient. Within the assessment, both countries should commit to an approach to implementing the objectives of the Partnership that can be measured against agreed milestones. While aspects of this assessment cannot be made public, the UK and Japan should commit to releasing a progress report similar to those issued by the Japan–UK Digital Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on cyber security between Japan and the UK effectively furthers mutual interests through specific operational activities, and enables the wider partnership. The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership should aspire to continue the momentum of its first year and expand the depth and breadth of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has provided an overview of the activities and strategic priorities of the Partnership and has set out recommendations for its development. Current priorities within the Partnership are appropriate and provide opportunities to develop further activities. Furthermore, engagement outside the remit of set priorities represents an opportunity to expand the scope of the Partnership. Cooperation on cyber-resilient ecosystems would recognise existing efforts while also creating more space for engagement, particularly on digital government, technology standards and structural reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant space to expand activities across existing priorities. Japan and the UK both face challenges in scaling, developing and retaining cyber capabilities. Exchanging knowledge, identifying opportunities to cooperate, and sharing information can help to strengthen capability. Promoting commercial cooperation is a priority for the Partnership. Issues such as differences in language present challenges, but platforms to lower barriers to entry exist for companies, and there is a clear value case for users and providers. Worsening geopolitical tensions present concerns for both countries. Increasing cyber cooperation to advance shared international interests should include a focus on CCB, closer alignment on rules and norms, and consideration of international cyber crisis response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Partnership can expect to continue benefiting from key drivers. Japan and the UK are closely aligned, exist within a network of common partners and face similar challenges and opportunities from cyber security. They share long-term joint initiatives, such as the GCAP, which provide a platform for close engagement over the long term. Japanese partnership with Pillar II of the AUKUS programme on advanced technologies would add to this. Nevertheless, the Partnership faces speedbumps which, if unresolved, could impede the pace and scope of activity. These include the need to tackle issues relating to information sharing and ensuring that the Partnership is sustainably resourced in a context of competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK’s new Labour government conducts its national security review, its approach to nuclear modernisation will send a crucial message to the US. The UK’s nuclear deterrent is not just a national asset; it is a cornerstone of NATO’s collective defence strategy. How Labour navigates this issue will have far-reaching implications for transatlantic relations and the future of the Western alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of the UK’s nuclear capabilities was recently underscored by the US Strategic Posture Commission. In its comprehensive report, the Commission emphasised the critical role of the UK’s nuclear forces in maintaining NATO’s deterrence posture. The report explicitly states: “The United Kingdom and France provide important nuclear forces that contribute to the NATO Alliance. The United Kingdom, in particular, contributes to deterrence and complicates adversary planning with its independent nuclear arsenal.” This assessment highlights how the UK’s submarine-based deterrent enhances the credibility of NATO’s nuclear policy and presents additional strategic challenges for potential adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent. In a recent speech, he stated: “A strong, modernised nuclear capability is not just a pillar of our national defence – it’s a cornerstone of our commitment to NATO and global security.” This clear stance from the former opposition leader underscores the cross-party support for nuclear modernisation in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment to nuclear modernisation was recently strengthened by the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. In a bold move, the review announced an increase in the UK’s nuclear weapon stockpile cap from 180 to 260 warheads. This decision demonstrated the UK’s resolve and ability to be flexible in the face of evolving global threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has expressed support for this decision, noting: “In an increasingly unpredictable world, we must ensure our deterrent remains effective. The increase in our stockpile cap is a necessary step to safeguard our national security and uphold our NATO obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s commitment to nuclear modernisation was further reinforced in March 2024 with the publication of “Delivering the UK’s Nuclear Deterrent as a National Endeavour”. This strategic document reaffirms the critical importance of the nuclear deterrent to UK national security and outlines a comprehensive approach to resourcing and upgrading the country’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the paper emphasises several key points that underscore the UK’s unique position in global nuclear deterrence. Firstly, it highlights that the UK is the only power besides the US that has pledged its nuclear deterrent to NATO, underscoring the UK’s indispensable role in the alliance’s overall deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the document recognises the UK’s critical role in helping the US confront what it terms a “two peer problem” – referring to the challenge posed by simultaneously deterring both Russia and China. It stresses that with the right support from the US, in line with historical agreements, the UK can play a pivotal part in addressing this complex geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the paper acknowledges the significant challenges ahead and outlines a comprehensive response. Under the banner of a “National Endeavour,” it proposes mobilising a wide set of measures to ensure the continued effectiveness and credibility of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has praised this document, stating, “The March 2024 strategic review provides a clear roadmap for ensuring our nuclear forces remain cutting-edge and capable of meeting future challenges. Labour fully supports this forward-looking approach to our nuclear policy, recognising it truly as a national endeavour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Labour now conducts its own national security review, it must carefully consider these key points and translate rhetorical assurances into concrete policy decisions and resource allocations. The review should build upon this foundation, exploring ways to further enhance the UK’s nuclear capabilities and its contribution to NATO’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the UK could demonstrate its commitment to a robust nuclear deterrent is by considering the adoption of a nuclear capability outside its current Continual at-Sea Deterrent construct. Currently, the UK relies solely on its submarine-based Trident missiles. While this system has proven effective, diversifying the nuclear arsenal to include a second delivery method could enhance flexibility and resilience. The original Polaris Sales Agreement could serve as a model for future engagement and additional capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signals sent by Labour’s ongoing review will be particularly significant in the context of an increased emphasis on allied burden-sharing. A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme, to include a second delivery platform, would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a strong UK nuclear posture would help maintain strategic stability in an era of renewed great power competition. As Russia continues its aggressive behaviour and China rapidly expands its nuclear capabilities, the deterrent value of Western nuclear forces has only grown. The UK’s nuclear arsenal, though smaller than that of the US or Russia, plays a vital role in this broader deterrence landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high, and the world will be watching closely. Translating the new prime minister’s rhetoric on nuclear modernisation into action and resources will help ensure the continued effectiveness of the Western deterrent and the stability of the transatlantic alliance for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously argued, international diplomacy continues to prioritise engagement between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This binary thinking is understandable given that what little attention Sudan receives is fixated on delivering greater humanitarian access and a workable ceasefire – outcomes that are sorely needed. By every measure, the situation remains catastrophic. Roughly 26 million people (over 51% of the population) face acute food insecurity (the worst levels ever recorded by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification in-country); nearly 9 million are displaced, up to 5 million of them children; and over 2 million are now refugees. Against this backdrop, reports suggest “national cereal production [has] collapsed by almost half”, correlating with an 83% hike in the price of basic goods. Despite considerable “data gaps”, monitors accurately predicted (manmade) famine conditions by June; fatalities could exceed 2 million by late September and hit up to 10 million by 2027. With fighting across the breadbasket states of Gezira and Sennar, many in the worst affected areas are already “eating leaves to survive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, relief efforts appear hampered by theft, violence, poor logistics and superfluous bureaucracy. Crossing the frontline is a “deliberately time-consuming” process, with SAF originally banning the “delivery of supplies via Chad” and blockading Khartoum. In March, the RSF likewise barred aid from Port Sudan from reaching El-Fashar. Trucks have often been confiscated and local responders “harassed, detained, and otherwise abused”. Visas, travel permits, and operating licences are routinely withheld by the military-backed Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a well-established front for profiteering recently emulated by Hemedti’s Sudan Agency for Relief and Humanitarian Operations (SARHO). Elsewhere, warehouse raids persist – in one case, militiamen looted stock that could have fed 1.5 million people for a month – and stories are emerging of NGO workers coerced, on video, into saying that the RSF has “acted in accordance with international humanitarian law”. Even without this disruption, there is a risk that aid modalities themselves are becoming outdated: unlike rural, highly localised crises of the past, Sudan is now grappling with a nationwide, largely urbanised food emergency – dynamics the “UN…[has] little experience in addressing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramping up and refining the response is therefore a priority, one the global community continues to bungle. Of the $2.3 billion requested by UN stakeholders in 2023, for instance, only 43% was eventually secured. Even after the much-hyped Paris Conference in April, donors stumped up less than 50% of this year’s appeal, pledges deemed “gravely inadequate” by Médecins Sans Frontières. While resourcing for Sudan’s “Emergency Response Rooms” – volunteer support networks – has gradually improved, many international organisations also face administrative and structural difficulties in accommodating mutual aid methodologies, which prioritise “community accountability ahead of traditional NGO reporting”. Instead, UN recognition of SAF as the country’s legitimate authority leaves interventions truncated and increasingly susceptible to extortion. Though pragmatic, such approaches are defined by long-standing perceptions of state-centric dependency, tempering the leverage humanitarians could otherwise exert. As experts like Joshua Craze, Kholood Khair and Raga Makawi make clear, better arrangements are possible, however imperfect they may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparable problems characterise efforts to impose a ceasefire or, crucially, to prevent a possible genocide. Amid explicit patterns of ethnic cleansing – identity-based pogroms, an erasure of cultural signifiers, mass killings, expulsions and sexual violence – external engagement has generally remained disjointed and inconsistent. Before June’s declaration on El-Fashar, the UN Security Council had only passed a single resolution calling for a (temporary) cessation of hostilities. Mutasim Ali and Yonah Diamond have also criticised major powers for failing to “take decisive action” or even “name the genocidaires and their sponsors” – diplomatic posturing that has “not changed [significantly] since the first weeks of the war”. Although UK officials were relatively quick in adopting more appropriate language, a drip-feed of sanctions with little coordination between London, DC and Brussels is unlikely to have any real effect on RSF decision-making. Notably, US senators are still debating whether to pursue Hemedti personally, despite mounting evidence of “gross human rights” violations. Yes, this could reflect long-standing discrepancies between atrocity prevention and conflict resolution, but it also speaks to a fundamental lack of vision over how external parties can constructively intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Successful humanitarian and peace-making processes must also account for the contested realities of the “new” Sudan, a very different political, societal and normative landscape to that of April 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As John Prendergast, among others, argues, an effective sanctions strategy should, at the very least, target the (transnational) networks of “cutouts, collaborators, and companies” propping up RSF operations, designed multilaterally and iteratively to “account for any changes in nomenclature and structure”. While specific firms have been designated, such as Al-Junaid Multi Activities Co Ltd and Tradive General Trading, the RSF is allegedly affiliated with over 50 commercial entities, including shares in Al-Khaleej Bank. With relationships cross-cutting the UAE, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, this one node alone could reportedly provide second-order connections to the international financial system and even Friends of Sudan member-states, allowing stakeholders to skirt the (full) impact of economic penalties. Plugging these loopholes is therefore imperative. The entire breadth of complicity from the aleutaawa (pro-RSF communities from Darfur and Kordofan) must also be mapped out, exposing the middlemen responsible for translating Hemedti’s policies into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, concerted pressure should be piled onto regional enablers sustaining the RSF’s military capabilities. Although Abu Dhabi denies the claims, a UN assessment cites “credible” allegations of weapons shipments – multiple-rocket launchers, howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles – being smuggled over the Chadian border, with wounded fighters medevac-ed the other way. Accounts similarly describe a web of brokers and local proxies stretching across the Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan and Uganda, disguising munition flows as humanitarian aid. Quadcopter drones have dropped 120mm mortar rounds purportedly tracing back to UAE stockpiles, and Emirati passports were recovered from RSF-occupied Omdurman, feeding claims of covert deployments. At the same time, Sudanese gold is reportedly still finding its way to Dubai’s souks, supplementing erstwhile shipments of RSF bullion – packaged as “cookies” – to Russian bases in Syria (liquidity that previously kept a cash-strapped Kremlin afloat in exchange for armaments and tech).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been movement in recent months – US legislation threatened to suspend arms sales to the UAE over its support for Hemedti; the Treasury Department blacklisted “seven Emirati-based companies” for sanctions violations; and diplomatic pressure did appear to delay the assault on El-Fashar – this is far from sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-changes-and-long-term-problems&quot;&gt;Structural Changes and Long-Term Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving these efforts is not only urgent but entirely feasible. However, a genuine resolution to the conflict goes far beyond negotiation strategies or immediate crisis management. Successful humanitarian and peace-making processes must also account for the contested realities of the “new” Sudan, a very different political, societal and normative landscape to that of April 2023. There is little space to provide a full exposition of such dynamics, but as the first round of talks in Geneva conclude, it is worth exploring a few structural issues that will inevitably condition the efficacy and longevity of any intended outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, violence is inherently transformative, reshaping both the conflict parties themselves and the ecosystems they inhabit. In this context, the distortion of Sudan’s political economy is already immense. Khartoum and the wider “Hamdi Triangle” – a middle-income enclave of industry, investment and trade – is beset by power outages and daily shelling. Labour displacement, infrastructural damage, and severed supply lines continue to cripple productivity, with the IMF predicting an 18.3% contraction in GDP by late 2024 (following a 12% decline the previous year). Crucially, this has been accompanied by a wave of primitive accumulation, with the ransacking of Sudanese cities upending much of the post-colonial dispensation. Whereas in the past, a riverain elite – the Jellaba – ran a predatory system of resource extraction, “reap[ing] profits in the provinces and plough[ing] them into Khartoum”, the inverse is becoming readily apparent, as vehicles, household goods, and heavy machinery are funnelled to Darfur. Makeshift entrepôts – “Dagalo markets” – have quickly sprouted up, brokering everything from stolen cars and mobile-phones to oil, gold and electronics. While the mechanics of this “destructive economy” are not necessarily new, the scale of wealth redistribution from core to periphery may be unprecedented. These shifts have also been accompanied by rapid demographic changes, with affluent neighbourhoods now reportedly occupied by 80,000 “RSF families” and rural tribesmen. Across Darfur, the transformation is even more acute after the expulsion of non-Arab residents from towns and villages. Amid virulent strains of ethno-populism, Sudanese society – with all its attendant norms, hierarchies and assumptions – is therefore being reconfigured, introducing a new set of power dynamics that will define the scope, resonance and durability of any political settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogous – albeit less radical – changes are evident in SAF territory, with most of the country’s institutional, military and industrial architecture being transposed to Port Sudan. This raises its own problems, not least by disturbing local political arrangements that tie back to the Juba Peace Agreement (2021) and Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (2006). A rapid injection of international assistance and financing, for example, has already provoked disputes around land and compensation rights, compounding divisions within the Beja Nazir Council. Of course, the implicit creation of a new capital could be beneficial over time, diffusing commercial monopolies previously confined to Khartoum and fostering growth in otherwise neglected regions. But given the city’s limited capacity, and ethnic and class-based cleavages, this shift may, in the short term, not only be detrimental for the efficiency of Sudan’s post-war economy but also drive further instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the securitisation of the country’s agro-industry poses massive complications for tackling food scarcity. Unsurprisingly, war has proved deleterious for producers, processors and exporters alike. The cumulative impact of untilled farmland, lost harvests, and seed shortages is devastating, with cultivated acreage across Darfur and Kordofan dropping by over 65%. At the same time, damage to El-Obeid and Khartoum – vital markets for livestock and crops, with the latter home to most large-scale factories – has effectively paralysed the sector. The issue is not only material but structural, with violence precipitating shifts in agency and power. While SAF and the RSF have always been prominent in the country’s food system, the fighting has consolidated and expanded their duopoly, squeezing out independent smallholders and rival businesses. This raises serious problems, particularly if domestic supply chains become wholly dependent on two ever more unstable cartels. Starvation tactics applied liberally across southern Sudan in the 1990s are evident again today, used to compel local recruitment and to depopulate towns. Both sides are likewise prioritising conflict over commerce, with knock-on effects for agricultural output. Operations are either suspended – as is the case with SAF’s Military Economic Corporation – or placed on a war footing, impacting the long-term capacity (and inclination) to feed civilians, and hampering the sustainability of humanitarian outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the conflict’s regionalisation has important implications for peace-making. Amid porous boundaries, weak institutions and patrimonial politics, cross-border clientelism is not new to Sudan, with experts describing a well-established “rentier system” of extraversion and graft. Accordingly, the role of transnational sponsors and spoilers – the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Russia and, recently, Iran – has received significant coverage, and is rightly viewed as a determining factor for any resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Refugee flows are already placing a massive strain on under-resourced borderlands, and the circulation of small arms, drones and heavy weaponry poses a direct threat to regional stability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But violence has also assumed its own momentum, diffusing along the kinship, patronage and political networks that enmesh Sahelian states together. Over 18,000 “ethno-mercenaries” have supposedly joined the RSF alone, drawn from across the “Baggara Belt” – a confederacy of nomadic tribes spanning from Darfur to Niger. Additionally, the fighting is starting to intersect with neighbouring disputes. Reports suggest Tigrayan militants could be collaborating with SAF in Sennar, raising concerns of possible “tit-for-tat” cooperation between the RSF and “Fano”, a loose assortment of ethno-nationalist militias in Amhara waging a “low intensity insurgency” against federal authorities. Eritrea is purportedly training “popular resistance” groups from Eastern Sudan, further militarising local social dynamics and creating a “time-bomb” for renewed inter-communal hostilities. In Chad, freshly “elected” President Mahamat Déby has received Emirati loans amounting to $1.5 billion (equivalent to 83% of his annual budget) – a deal coinciding with alleged UAE weapons shipments starting to reach Hemedti via Amdjarass. Yet he also faces growing pressure from local Zaghawa communities – the powerbase of his regime – demanding material support for co-ethnic, anti-RSF paramilitaries in Darfur. With further massacres threatening El-Fashar, these competing priorities may not only upend Déby’s ruling coalition but inflame ethno-regional tensions across Chadian society more widely. Elsewhere, unrest in White Nile State led to a provincial pump station running out of diesel, a seemingly banal hiccup that eventually precipitated “gelling” issues along South Sudan’s Petrodar pipeline. With the route previously channelling 100,000 barrels of crude per day – 60% of Juba’s oil production – to Sudan’s Bashayer terminal on the Red Sea, the blockage effectively cuts off an “insolvent kleptocracy” from its main financial lifeline (roughly 90% of foreign exchange earnings). Without the cash to keep “factious security elites in check”, the payroll peace underpinning President Salva Kiir’s government looks increasingly untenable, risking yet another humanitarian catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These externalities are not unique. War tends to be contagious, spilling over national borders and metastasising into complex, highly inter-dependent systems of insecurity. Libya is indicative, with state collapse facilitating the transnational “proliferation of [guns], jihadists, traffickers, and gangsters”. Analysts fear Sudan may prove even worse. Refugee flows are already placing a massive strain on under-resourced borderlands, and the circulation of small arms, drones and heavy weaponry – especially man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) – poses a direct threat to regional stability. In this context, civil wars often start as endogenous processes, but they rarely stay that way, evolving into “wicked problems” of global proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fraught-realities-of-now&quot;&gt;The Fraught Realities of Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the limitations of what former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok calls the “Sudanese model” of peace-making – namely elite bargains between military and civilians – are well documented. As Payton Knopf argues, diplomatic efforts like Jeddah and Geneva fail on several counts: mistakenly assuming that securocrat power-sharing offers a basis for stability; that ceasefires end violence or are a “prerequisite for doing so”; and that “political legitimacy is less important than coercive force”. This flawed logic is not a recent aberration, but has marred international engagement for decades, rewarding militancy while undervaluing (or undermining) civic agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these interventions can quickly be improved: they will not resolve the war in its entirety, but they may help temper its worst excesses and better address immediate humanitarian needs. However, any sustainable solution must also confront the realities of Sudan today. The warring parties have fragmented and multiplied: SAF is a bricolage of competing interests and ideologies, while the RSF appears bound together by little more than spoliation. Amid massive structural problems, any deal between Hemedti and al-Burhan is subsequently unlikely to trickle down or resonate in a meaningful way. With the country now at a “cataclysmic breaking point”, mediators can no longer afford to “shelve” the broader political issues feeding the conflict. They should be embedded into discussions from the outset, otherwise the same mistakes (and shortcomings) will be continually repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of forces are promoting reindustrialization of the United States. Concerned about the fragility of long supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in U.S. production. They are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the United States at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding manufacturing in the United States inevitably raises questions for energy policy. Energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. Companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. Gas supplied 43 percent of U.S. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. As policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing from a carbon-intensity perspective. This paper presents the key findings from CSIS’s research — including from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviews — and policy recommendations on how the United States can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshoring-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Reshoring Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the United States, driven by two key sectors: semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs). Remarkably, real spending on construction of computer and electrical manufacturing facilities, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturing, has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2022. By April 2024, project announcements reached $367.9 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and $84.4 billion for EV manufacturing. These industries now account for nearly 60 percent of all manufacturing investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both market and strategic imperatives are driving these investments. Chipmakers aim to diversify supply chains beyond East Asia and move closer to the U.S. market, while automakers and their suppliers are investing to meet growing demand. Federal government support, driven by the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, is accelerating these trends. Supply chain vulnerabilities for semiconductors increase national security and economic risks, while reshoring and rerouting the EV battery supply chain helps advance the nation’s decarbonization efforts and supports the tactical and operational demands of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration aims for the United States to produce 20 percent of global leading-edge logic chips and for EVs to comprise 50 percent of new vehicle sales by 2030. Taking into account uncertainties in future sales and value chains, forecasts of battery manufacturing capacity vary widely. The Rhodium Group estimates that if all investments announced since 2018 are realized, they would create 1,062–1,288 gigawatt hours (GWh) of domestic cell and module production capacity in 2030. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts a more modest 588 GWh of domestic battery production capacity in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Energy and Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors in the United States is a small fraction of the total energy consumption by U.S. manufacturing. According to 2018 U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, energy consumption in the semiconductor and EV sectors is far lower than in sectors such as chemicals and petroleum refining (Table 1). However, such comparisons predate the active U.S. policy for reshoring and could change as these sectors grow in significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pCemZas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: U.S. Manufacturing Energy Consumption by Sector, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public data on energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors is scarce because new facilities are only being announced and built now and anticipated energy use is commercially sensitive. The data average derived from multiple papers surveyed by CSIS suggests the need for 44 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of average energy consumption to produce 1 kWh of EV battery capacity. At that intensity, the 1,000 GWh of potential battery manufacturing capacity forecasted for 2030 would require 44,000 GWh of energy consumption, or approximately 150 trillion British thermal units (Btu). However, energy usage estimates vary across studies due to different methods and data sources. Many rely on data that is over a decade old and that likely differs from current usage, given industry growth and efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to a 2021 regulatory document, a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fabrication site in Arizona is estimated to use 1,200 megawatts (MW), which at 99 percent capacity would be equivalent to about 30 trillion Btu. That is roughly equivalent to the peak power output of a Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor or one-tenth of the installed capacity of natural gas combined-cycle plants in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the dearth of authoritative energy use estimates, both the administration’s goals and the $452.3 billion (actual and planned) invested in the semiconductor and EV manufacturing sectors combined through April 2024 suggest significant energy demand growth. Moreover, the expansion of strategic manufacturing will expectedly induce additional energy demand in other sectors, such as steel and aluminum production. Even with efficiency advancement in manufacturing processes, increased demand from reshoring will be happening at the same time as pronounced load growth nationally, creating supply risks for energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, projections over the next 10 years are already pointing to a higher electricity growth forecast than at any point in the past decade, including summer peak demand growth of 79 gigawatts (GW) and winter peak demand growth of 91 GW, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natural-gas-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Natural Gas and Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, the role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has risen dramatically. Enabled by shale production, U.S. dry gas production has grown from 18 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2005 to 38 Tcf in 2023, with consumption increasing from 22 Tcf to 33 Tcf over the same period. For most of that period, the Henry Hub natural gas price has been below $5 per million Btu (MMBtu), easing the cost of higher consumption throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pl6ECoC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Major Role of Natural Gas in Electricity Generation and the Industrial Sector, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low energy prices are associated with manufacturing competitiveness. In general, economic studies find a small positive effect on manufacturing output and employment from lower gas prices enabled by U.S. production. A working paper for the Federal Reserve first released in 2014 found that the decrease in natural gas prices between 2006 and 2013 contributed to an increase in manufacturing output by 2 to 3 percent across the whole manufacturing sector. The increase appears to be higher in more energy-intensive sectors, such as fertilizer production. A similar study published in 2021 found roughly similar effects, verifying a larger body of literature produced in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry players expect that natural gas will continue to play a key role in meeting growing energy demands. In the most recent long-term reliability assessment, published in 2023, NERC sees natural gas remaining a “critical resource” for the U.S. electric power supply in many areas. Particularly in winter, natural gas power plants will provide “necessary reliability attributes . . . as traditional generators retire and inverter-based renewable resources take their place in the resource mix.” Goldman Sachs expects natural gas to meet about 60 percent of additional load growth from expanding data centers and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilities in states attracting manufacturing investment are re-elevating natural gas in resource planning. Arizona is one of the major destination states for actual and planned investments in both EV batteries ($3.7 billion) and semiconductor manufacturing ($100.7 billion). One of the leading utilities in the state, Arizona Public Service (APS), projects the energy needs through 2038 in its service territory to increase at 3.7 percent annually to 23,700 GWh — about 55 percent from data center expansions and 24 percent from large industrial activities (inclusive of demand-side management and efficiency gains). This projected growth translates into about 3,400 MW of capacity needs in the next 15 years. Particularly in light of its planned exit from coal-fired generation in 2031, APS views natural gas — including hydrogen-capable natural gas combustion turbines — as a means to ensure reliability while expanding renewables and energy storage resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story in Georgia is similar. A massive economic expansion since January 2022 led Georgia Power to file an update to its 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) in October 2023. The utility projects electricity load growth of 6,600 MW through 2030–31, which is about 17 times larger than what it anticipated in its 2022 IRP. During the first half of 2023, the manufacturing sector — including solar, EVs, and aerospace — was leading the state’s economic growth, representing 67 percent of job creation and 81 percent of the capital investment. Georgia Power views natural gas as crucial for a cost-effective and reliable low-carbon transition, complementing energy storage resources that have limited time duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prices&quot;&gt;Prices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present forecasts for U.S. gas production show that rising consumption will be accompanied by rising prices. The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 forecasts a 0.5 percent growth in the domestic supply of dry gas and a price level increase of 0.4 percent through 2050. While the trajectory for production growth is relatively linear, the forecasted price increase of 0.4 percent, from $6.52 per MMBtu in 2022 to $7.23 in 2050, is accompanied by a notable dip to below $3.50 in the late 2020s (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ofhSsKQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Outlooks for U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Henry Hub Prices through 2050&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, natural gas consultancy Wood Mackenzie’s forecasts show that large increases in gas consumption — from data center operation, chip manufacturing, and liquefied natural gas exports — will not lead to a significant price increase. Corresponding to its upward revision in the U.S. gas demand projection for the early 2040s from 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) under the 2022 version to 30 Bcf/d, Wood Mackenzie’s latest forecasts are for Henry Hub to reach $4 per MMcf by the mid-to-late 2030s, and closer to $6 per MMcf through the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emissions&quot;&gt;Emissions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural gas plays a significant role in the energy system, and expanding gas consumption raises potential challenges for meeting ambitious zero-carbon targets for the power sector. The continued use of coal-fired generation and changes in the dispatch order for generations make evaluating the emissions impact of additional capacity challenging to estimate outside of a modeling framework. In the meantime, about two-thirds of the states where strategic manufacturing is on rise are below the national average in terms of the carbon intensity of their electric power supply. The map below shows the top 10 recipient states of actual and planned investments in semiconductors and EV manufacturing, as well as the carbon intensity of associated power generation and the percentage contribution from natural gas in each state (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w4mBwTj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Natural Gas Reliance and Electric Power Supply Carbon Intensity in the Top 10 U.S. States for Semiconductor and EV Manufacturing Investments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carbon-competitiveness&quot;&gt;Carbon Competitiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world moves toward net-zero emissions, how much CO2 emissions companies and industries produce will affect their competitiveness. More firms must now report direct and indirect emissions as part of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounting. As carbon pricing or similar regulations spread, lower-emissions production will be more profitable, as prices will reflect emissions intensity. Even if the United States delays implementing national climate regulations, markets will value lower-emissions production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) now exposes U.S. exporters to climate-related trade rules for certain goods. While these measures will not immediately affect semiconductors or EV batteries, they will apply to commodities such as steel, aluminum, and chemicals. In these areas, U.S. producers have some carbon advantage over international competitors such as China but may trail producers in Europe. For products crucial for decarbonization, such as EV batteries, the carbon output of manufacturing will remain important in life-cycle analysis and could soon affect commercial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, both Democratic and Republican leaders see benefits in highlighting how efficient the U.S. economy and manufacturing specifically are with respect to emissions. In April 2024, the Biden administration formed a climate and trade task force to address the neglect of emissions from imported goods in current trade policies. Announcing the task force, U.S. climate envoy John Podesta cautioned that ignoring these emissions unfairly advantages countries with high-carbon manufacturing, such as China. This echoes a frequent Republican claim that lax regulations overseas award foreign manufacturers an unfair advantage. Legislators are drafting proposals to study the relative carbon intensity of production and install carbon border adjustments across different product categories. At their most expansive, these proposals would apply beyond the small set of commodities covered by the European Union’s CBAM and include battery materials and other goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where carbon emissions matter in competition, U.S. manufacturing has a mixed advantage. U.S. industry produces semiconductors and EV batteries with less carbon than China thanks to cleaner energy generation, but it still trails Europe (Table 2). Although both the U.S. and Chinese power grids rely on fossil fuels, China’s higher use of coal power — 63 percent of its power generation compared to 23 percent in the United States as of 2021 — makes its manufacturing more carbon intensive, particularly as coal is more than twice as carbon intensive as natural gas. The European Union uses more emissions-free sources (deriving 37 percent of its power generation from renewable energy and 25 percent from nuclear energy) than the United States, reducing its emissions output. The degree of reliance on natural gas within power systems varies notably across the three economies: 38.4 percent in the United States, 19.9 percent in the European Union, and 3.3 percent in China as of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qaq8AW4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Emission Intensity of U.S. Semiconductor and EV Battery Manufacturing Compared to Europe and China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of strategic manufacturing demands construction, which requires raw materials such as iron ore and aluminum. In supplying these resources, the United States has a relative advantage over major competitors such as China. A 2019 report comparing steel industry emissions across the 15 top steel-producing countries found that U.S. production is one of the least carbon intensive, while China ranked last. Similarly, North American aluminum production emits about half the global average rate, according to industry data. An industry report found that “the current emission intensity of aluminum products produced in China is 2.5 times [that] of [North American] domestic products, and the global aluminum product carbon intensity is 1.9 times [that] of [North American] domestic products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;abatement-opportunities&quot;&gt;Abatement Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the expansion of gas in the power sector has reduced emissions as it has displaced coal. Using gas in the power and industrial sectors contributes to the relative emissions advantage of U.S. manufacturing. However, a path to net zero will require emissions abatement for all use cases of natural gas, as other emissions abatement opportunities will be exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three general options for reducing emissions from natural gas consumption. The first is reducing the emissions intensity of natural gas by producing renewable natural gas (or biomethane) or synthetic methane via clean hydrogen production. These methods are presently limited in potential scale and cost, respectively. The second option is using carbon capture and storage (CCS) on point sources where gas is combusted for power or heat, which can be costly but is scalable. The last option is reducing gas use to the point where remnant emissions can be offset using carbon removals. Of these three, the deployment of CCS on existing or new facilities is most likely to help square near-term energy demand growth and long-term climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy modeling indicates that deploying CCS can achieve rapid emissions reductions and the continued utilization of natural gas. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2023 Standard Scenarios Report found that gas capacity continues to expand across different scenarios, adding 200 GW through 2050 under current policy and 130 GW in the case that achieves a 95 percent emissions reduction in 2050. But in scenarios with strong and immediate emissions policies (net-zero electricity by 2035), natural gas with CCS can grow significantly — even after the emissions standards are in place — and provide as much generation in 2050 as it does today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of capture and a lack of pipeline infrastructure for CO2 are commonly cited reasons for not deploying CCS today. Even with subsidies, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) assesses combined-cycle natural gas generators to be a longer-term opportunity for deployment of CCS, meaning that it will be commercially viable after 2030. In the meantime, deployment of capture technologies in other sectors will help reduce costs and support infrastructure. The post-2030 timeline makes CCS a relevant consideration for utilities, power plant operators, and regulators today. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has already identified CCS as the best means of emissions reduction for natural gas generators in its rule for new emissions sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accelerate progress toward commercial deployment, the DOE has sponsored front-end engineering and design studies for retrofitting natural-gas-fired power plants with CCS technologies. Capital and finance costs dominate the total cost of retrofitting natural gas generation for carbon capture. In a DOE-sponsored study of the retrofit costs for a 750 MW gas plant in Texas, capital costs accounted for 70 percent of the cost of the retrofit, which totaled $477 million, or about $115 per ton of CO2 captured over 15 years. At present, there are reportedly eight planned or in process deployments of CCS on gas plants in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stakeholder-considerations&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong outlook for energy demand growth introduces a range of qualitative considerations and concerns for energy planners and firms. Reliability, affordability, accessibility, and carbon intensity are some of the key considerations that shape stakeholder approaches to energy requirements from the strategic manufacturing sectors. What stakeholders value in addressing energy requirements may not vary significantly, but there is some diversity in how different stakeholders prioritize key attributes of energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturers:&lt;/strong&gt; Along with factors such as the availability of a skilled labor force, logistical infrastructure, and local political support, local energy resources shape manufacturers’ siting decisions. Energy considerations extend beyond securing large, low-cost supplies, though this remains crucial for manufacturers’ profitability. Energy reliability is a key priority for semiconductor manufacturers, as a “stoppage at any of its manufacturing stages can result in wasted batches.” The cost of a supply disruption can be significant. For example, Samsung reportedly incurred a $43.3 million loss in 2018 when a regional transmission cable failed, leaving its chip plant without power for 30 minutes. The need for an uninterrupted supply of electricity could accelerate interest from manufacturers in these sectors to seek on-site power generation assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon intensity is another major interest of manufacturers. Leading companies in EV battery and semiconductor manufacturing, as well as data center operators, have corporate sustainability commitments that include greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments and energy conservation targets. EV battery manufacturers seem eager to procure clean power to produce the goods whose primary objective is to decarbonize the transportation sector. For example, Panasonic, LG Energy Solution, and SK hynix have pledged to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2030 or 2040. These commitments may amount to a future where half of batteries would be made at factories that source at least 50 percent of their power demand from renewable energy sources by 2030. Battery manufacturers’ interest in a low-carbon supply chain has also manifested in exploration of the option of leveraging investment interests to facilitate a regional power supply mix, including coal plant closures. Also, leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer Intel has pledged net-zero emissions by 2040 for both direct emissions from chip fabrication and purchased electricity, steam, and heating/cooling equipment, while semiconductor end users such as Microsoft and Amazon are committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2030 and 2040, respectively. However, a recent media report highlights the difficulty in accelerating, let alone maintaining, the pace of emissions reduction as AI business expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Electric and gas utilities need to ensure the provision of energy to various customers — ranging from households to large-scale industrial users, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturers — while sustaining a profitable business. The economics of various energy resources are important factors that utilities watch in planning what generation and transmission infrastructure is needed where and at what increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities. They make plans for resource procurement (including by trade with neighboring states) and new infrastructure based on the best available energy data. Some view energy data availability as a primary challenge, whereas others find data analysis a bigger challenge. Some factors necessary for sound modeling are dynamic and difficult to analyze. Consumer preference in the case of modeling the growth of EV battery manufacturing capacity may be one such example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking among different stakeholders. For example, investment decisionmaking by manufacturers is generally much faster than the pace of planning by utilities, whether they operate in regulated or unregulated markets. Even when utilities recognize the demand growth, they often face delays in obtaining the permits required to build the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Utility Regulators:&lt;/strong&gt; The principal mission of state utility regulators (e.g., public utility commissions, or PUCs) includes ensuring that energy supply is reliable, affordable, and accessible. Another key concern of state regulators is who pays for infrastructure that will be required to meet energy demand from expanding manufacturing. Conveying the net economic benefit for the state could be a challenge, as ratepayer interests can be more geographically segmented even within a state or such benefits may not be immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean energy use, including measures such as renewable portfolio standards, can also be part of oversight and regulatory consideration where the state legislature so mandates a state regulatory body. The impact of rapid growth in energy demand on clean energy mandates warrants close regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the level of concern regulators have regarding the risk of stranded assets seems to vary depending on whether utilities in each state operate as vertically integrated monopolies under PUC oversights or in unregulated markets. Regulators in regulated markets are likely more concerned with an overbuild of generation and transmission assets by utilities, as the economic loss from a stranded asset can be passed on to ratepayers. At the same time, a state PUC could be less concerned with a utility’s ability to build generation to meet the state’s energy demand, as investment decisions are made in close consultation with utilities, including through the IRP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-observations-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Observations and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining economic competitiveness over higher-carbon manufacturers such as China and narrowing the intensity gap with Europe will require emissions reduction efforts throughout supply chains. The United States needs policies that help unlock the strategic value of natural gas to reestablish its industrial competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, neither the CHIPS Act nor the IRA impose energy use or emissions-intensity requirements for tax credit eligibility on strategic manufacturing sectors, such as the semiconductor and EV battery sectors. An approach that imposes firm guidance on power procurement similar to the one proposed for hydrogen under the IRA (i.e., hourly matching, incrementality, and deliverability under the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit) is likely unfeasible in many strategic manufacturing cases. At the same time, it would incur significant costs and thus undermine project economics in most cases. The policy needs to be designed to foster the commercial feasibility of emerging strategic manufacturing while making material progress in emissions reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several areas are ripe for action by industry and government stakeholders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage strategic manufacturing sectors to collect and share energy usage data with a federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Energy usage data for emerging strategic sectors is currently scarce, largely due to the sectors’ nascence in the United States. Also, manufacturers may be concerned that energy usage data could reveal certain proprietary manufacturing processes. Such data is essential for a multitude of stakeholders, however. It would help utilities and energy regulators improve their ability to identify future energy requirements and infrastructure needs, especially as the regulators strive to ensure the reliability, affordability, and accessibility of energy against the fast-evolving investment and manufacturing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In particular, a greater amount of quality data could help reduce the risk of overbuilding or underbuilding. The risk of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities and regulators, as it could incur significant costs to ratepayers. Yet, the risk of underbuilding energy infrastructure has a consequence, too. Failing to meet the energy demand could stymie industrial redevelopment of a state or the country. Ultimately, collecting and sharing more energy data — qualitatively and quantitatively — is also in the interest of strategic manufacturers as a better understanding of energy usage and estimating future needs can help regulators and utilities plan better, thereby cultivating a policy environment that enables such manufacturing activities. Industry associations in leading strategic manufacturing sectors are well positioned to take the lead in collecting and sharing energy usage data with the public, potentially through a federal agency such as the U.S. Department of Commerce or the EIA, as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accelerate the reduction of emissions intensity from manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Manufacturing is intensive in both energy usage and GHG emissions. Electrifying as much of the manufacturing processes as possible while facilitating low-carbon fuel use could help reduce manufacturing emissions. For example, in EV battery cell manufacturing, the process of drying electrodes is a leading source of non-electricity-related emissions. Several technologies, including near-infrared drying and laser drying, are under development to help reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Emissions reductions in manufacturing associated materials, such as steel and aluminum, are also crucial. Areas for proactive consideration include greater use of lower-emitting electric arc furnaces over blast furnaces and complementing natural gas use with hydrogen use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage CCS readiness at new gas power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CCS is likely the best path for emissions reductions from new gas plants, but it is not ready to meet growing demand today. Utilities and developers could prepare for the deployment of CCS in the future to create option value for all stakeholders and opportunities for natural gas to continue to provide baseload power at decreasing emissions intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Active planning and forward engineering studies at the project development stage can encourage CCS readiness, even when CCS will not be immediately deployed. By considering future retrofit, developers could assess the costs of facilities and site design for accommodating flue gas treatment, solvent regeneration, CO2 compression, and additional power and water requirements. Avoiding designs and facility layouts that would make future retrofit prohibitively expensive should become an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage infrastructure permitting reform.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The importance of enabling infrastructure is one of the key considerations that was underscored throughout the stakeholder interviews. Infrastructure under consideration ranges from natural gas pipelines to electric power grids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The federal processes for infrastructure permitting merit modernization that will enhance efficiency and reduce uncertainty while protecting the environment and local communities. Permitting reform could help alleviate the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking that confronts manufacturers, utilities, and regulators. Having infrastructure in place where and when needed is crucial if government support and business investments are to catalyze reindustrialization that strengthens U.S. leadership in strategic industries and manufacturing competitiveness in the global market, where carbon-intensity is under increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. What most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from Mainland China or were considering doing so. A smaller, yet surprising number also reported either already moving or considering moving some of their business from Taiwan. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, in part due to two summit meetings between the leaders of the United States and China and the launching of over a dozen dialogues, geostrategic tensions have modestly tempered. In that context the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. The new survey was slightly modified to take into consideration changing circumstances, and the sample size was increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China remain high, Taiwanese companies are engaging in a variety of diversification strategies rather than decoupling from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies’ worries about the geostrategic environment have receded somewhat, but they still favor a variety of coping strategies, including expanding involvement in regional trade arrangements, broadening commercial ties with the United States, expanding research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and nurturing a talented workforce to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage, and shifting some of their operations from China and Taiwan. Although the total proportion of firms considering or actually moving some of their business from China and Taiwan fell slightly, the proportion reporting they have already moved some operations rose significantly (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent from China, and from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent from Taiwan). Companies report that Southeast Asia is still their number one destination, but interest in South Asia has risen dramatically. Companies are motivated to move from China for a variety of reasons, including high labor costs, fears of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and worries about the possibility of war. Industries vary significantly in their interest in moving, which may be affected by the extent of their investment and the purpose of their existing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of firms moving remains high, they are moving as part of a variety of diversification strategies, not outright abandoning China altogether. China is still seen as an important trading partner; Taiwanese businesses are still not convinced India and Southeast Asia are sufficient substitutes; and companies are only moving a portion of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei and elsewhere. In the face of similar risks faced by Taiwanese industry, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan, it has simultaneously increased military pressure against Taiwan, carried out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA, and imposed a variety of tailored restrictions. At a minimum, these steps send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties. For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions against Mainland China would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. The continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening business confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwanese-industry&quot;&gt;Taiwanese Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potential-canary-in-the-mine&quot;&gt;A Potential Canary in the Mine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views and actions of Taiwanese companies provide invaluable insights into both cross-strait relations and trends in the geoeconomic environment. Firms from Taiwan are deeply embedded in supply chains that traverse the West, the People’s Republic of China, and the Global South, operating along the most complex geostrategic fault lines in the world. Moreover, Taiwanese industry may be the “canary in the mine,” with its views and conduct providing a preview of how global industry may behave when faced with competing forces to either shift business away from China or stay put. On one hand, the growth of restrictive trade and investment policies, the rising possibility of military conflict, climate change, increasing labor costs, pandemic restrictions, and other risks have created pressures for firms to move from China to other locales. On the other hand, China’s large domestic market, its sophisticated infrastructure and manufacturing value chain, and its growing innovation ecosystem act as incentives for firms to remain there or even expand their footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies and financial institutions trying to assess their options, as well as policymakers attempting to evaluate the efficacy of their economic policies, will gain a deeper understanding of this landscape by examining the views and behavior of Taiwanese industry. Although trade and investment data and individual case studies are useful gauges, surveys provide an intermediate bridging tool, as they allow for the assessment of a large number of firms’ subjective evaluations of their circumstances, their actual behavior, and the factors shaping their future choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. As a group, the polled companies believed that Taiwan was overdependent on China, and they were worried about a possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the consequences of China’s zero-Covid policies, and other risks. Many of those polled advocated for expanding Taiwan’s economic ties with the United States, becoming more involved in regional arrangements, and strengthening the island’s technological edge through greater research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and investments in human talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from China (25.7 percent) or were considering doing so (33.2 percent). A smaller, yet surprising number also reported already moving some of their business from Taiwan (13.0 percent) or were considering doing so (20.8 percent). At the time, roughly two-thirds of those moving from either locale were shifting some of their operations to Southeast Asia. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the geostrategic environment has continued to evolve. In early 2023, China ended its zero-Covid policies and reopened to international travel. Around the same time, the United States and China took a range of steps to stabilize their relationship, including leadership summits in October 2022 and November 2023 and the launch of over a dozen bilateral dialogue mechanisms. In the process, the sense of imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait receded, as the United States and China sought to reassure the other about their motivations and to clarify their red lines. It is in this somewhat less tense geostrategic context that the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. In addition to remeasuring their assessment of risks and coping strategies, a second survey could also evaluate whether steps by China to normalize inward and outward international travel and by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties had any effect on firms’ intentions to move business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new survey was slightly modified from the original. There were fewer questions about the Covid-19 pandemic. In their place, new questions were added to more directly understand why companies would potentially move from Mainland China and Taiwan, and if so, how much of their operations they were moving. The survey also placed greater attention on the relevance of companies’ industries to more fully capture variation in patterns of views and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1.1 shows, the average size and overall profitability levels of companies in the latest survey sample are similar to 2022, but firms in the new survey skew substantially younger. The proportion of firms with investment in China is slightly higher (61.6 percent compared to 60.8 percent), and the companies in the new survey depend somewhat more on the Mainland for their revenue than those polled in 2022. The 2023 survey has a somewhat higher percentage of firms in agriculture and industry but still has roughly 25 percent of firms in manufacturing, which is very similar to the island’s overall average. The size of the sample was increased intentionally (to 610 firms from 525) so that it would be more feasible to analyze how firms’ sectoral identity shapes their responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference in this year’s sample is that the proportion of respondents in favor of Taiwan’s independence was much lower, 13.9 percent compared to 23.2 percent. The general population’s support for independence did drop over the same period, with 3.8 percent in favor of immediate independence and 21.5 percent in favor of maintaining the status quo for the moment but eventually moving toward independence, but was still higher than this sample. In the 2022 survey, pro-independence respondents were more likely to favor moving their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the timing of this new survey — coming after a general stabilization in U.S.-China ties — and the skewing of the sample in a pro-unification direction would, all else being equal, suggest a lower proportion of companies would be moving their operations, whether from Mainland China or Taiwan. As will be explained below, the actual results indicate that a high proportion of Taiwanese companies are still moving. That said, it appears that the vast majority are engaged in one form or another of diversifying rather than fully decoupling their business from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chapter of this report presents the key findings of the survey with regard to how Taiwanese companies evaluate the various geostrategic risks they face and how best to respond, both in terms of government policies as well as their own behavior. The third chapter delves further into Taiwanese firms’ decision to move operations from the Mainland and explores why they are more prone to move than their counterparts from elsewhere. The final chapter evaluates the policy implications for the various actors with a stake in these geopolitical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;evolving-risks-and-responses&quot;&gt;Evolving Risks and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China have modestly receded — in part due to the thaw in U.S.-China relations and the end of zero-Covid — anxieties remain high. As a result, companies still favor a variety of coping strategies, with an even higher proportion than in 2022 having already started to move some of their business out of Mainland China and Taiwan. As in the 2022 edition, the full survey and results are included in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anxieties about China and international affairs remain high but have attenuated in a few ways, reflecting slightly less alarmist expectations about the likelihood of a U.S.-China military confrontation and a subtle shift in views regarding China’s Covid-19 policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable change is a drop in the proportion of those expecting a U.S.-China military conflict in the next five years, falling over 10 percentage points, from 38.7 percent to 28.2 percent (see Figure 2.1). At the same time, the proportion believing Taiwan’s semiconductor industry serves as a disincentive to Beijing to attack or as an incentive to the United States to come to Taiwan’s aid both fell somewhat, to slightly under half of those polled. Those who believe China’s zero-Covid policies had a negative impact on their business did not change — 45.7 percent in 2022 and 45.5 percent in 2023 — but the proportion who said zero-Covid had either a somewhat positive or very positive effect on their business rose from 15.0 percent to 24.3 percent, perhaps reflecting a reevaluation once the tensions of the moment had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Taiwanese companies seek to reduce dependence on China and expand cooperation with others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these continuing worries, the proportion of polled companies that believe Taiwan should reduce its dependence on China is still high. But the overall proportion that agree with this statement — either strongly or somewhat — fell almost 10 percentage points, from 76.3 percent to 66.9 percent (see Figure 2.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GKliDmE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.2: Taiwan Should Reduce Its Dependence on China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach to reducing dependence is to expand involvement in regional trade arrangements. As Figure 2.3 shows, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which regulates cross-strait commercial relations, is still regarded as the most important regional agreement for Taiwan; however, support for this view dropped substantially, to just over 21 percent. Evaluations of other major East Asia arrangements — the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) — are also still among the top tier but fell as well. Rising in the assessment are new arrangements such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), Taiwan’s own New Southbound Policy, and the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). DEPA was launched in 2020 and as of May 2024 had four members: Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Taiwan’s interest ostensibly originates from the arrangement’s focus on issues central to the island’s economy and from the fact that efforts by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reach a new pact on digital trade have faltered. Interest in the New Southbound Policy, geared toward expanding ties with Southeast Asia, India, Australia, and New Zealand, also modestly rose. Finally, recognition of IPEF rose even though the prospects for Taiwan to formally join have been very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWyrRc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.3: Preferred Regional Arrangements.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component is to expand commercial ties with the United States. Although the United States and Taiwan recently successfully negotiated the first part of the Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, whose components mirror those in IPEF, Figure 2.4 shows that Taiwanese firms’ primary interest is still in three other arrangements. Leading the way is a formal bilateral trade agreement, but interest in that dropped somewhat (especially when ranked among the top three), likely because prospects for such a deal have remained low. Similarly strong support exists for two arrangements that have been in operation for some time, the Technology Trade and Investment Collaborative Framework and the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for a bilateral double-taxation agreement with the United States still does not rank as highly as other arrangements but did rise from 7.8 percent to 14.3 percent as the top option of respondents and increased to be among the top three, from 26.1 percent to 35.4 percent of respondents. Moreover, when specifically queried about a double-taxation agreement, a full 70 percent consider it important, with almost a quarter describing it as “extremely important” (23.0 percent), “fairly important” (24.9 percent), or “important” (22.1 percent). Only 7.4 percent said the agreement is “completely unimportant.” The Biden administration, Congress, and Taipei have made progress on creating parallel double-taxation measures, but final adoption, as of September 2024, is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XMtUBz2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Consensus solidified over the importance of offensive technology policies to maintain the island’s technological advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original 2022 survey, Taiwanese companies reported that the most important steps needed to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage were expanding R&amp;amp;D and nurturing a talented workforce. These “offensive” steps drew more support than “defensive” ones such as rigid export controls and investment restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new survey, these views were further strengthened. When asked how Taiwan should maintain its technological edge on China, 37.9 percent of respondents said that R&amp;amp;D in Taiwan should be expanded, compared to 35.4 percent in 2022 (see Figure 2.5). Jumping up to second, with 14.9 percent support, is expanding the number of university undergraduate and graduate students in science and technology (S&amp;amp;T). By contrast, support dropped for every kind of “defensive” policy meant to limit China’s access to technology — such as export controls on dual-use technology, inward investment restrictions, outward investment restrictions, and limits on Taiwanese working in Mainland Chinese high-tech companies — with each attracting just above 10 percent support. This sentiment is consistent with the respondents’ analysis, discussed further below, that one of the main constraints on their firms’ competitiveness is insufficient talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tum4OZE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.5: How Should Taiwan Keep Its Technological Edge?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. More Taiwanese companies are following through on their plans to move some operations from Mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most surprising finding from the 2022 survey was the high percentage of companies that were considering moving or were actually starting to move some of their business from both Mainland China (58.9 percent) and Taiwan (33.8 percent). Despite the tempering of U.S.-China tensions and less alarmist worries about war, companies in the latest survey still report that they are considering or already moving, from both China (57.4 percent) and Taiwan (37.6 percent), as Figure 2.6 shows. The biggest shift is from thought to action, with a jump in actual moving from China (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent) and Taiwan (from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent), indicating that the original consideration of moving was more than baseless speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a jump in those already moving, there was also a change in the pattern of destinations. In the original survey, over 63 percent of companies moving from China and 67.8 percent of companies moving from Taiwan were going to Southeast Asia, far more than any other location (see Figure 2.7). By contrast, by late 2023, companies reported that Southeast Asia was still their number one destination from China (50.9 percent) and Taiwan (48.9 percent), but by a smaller margin than before. For those moving from China, the second most common destination was, as in 2022, Taiwan. However, the third most common destination, and biggest change from 2022, was South and Central Asia, by which respondents most likely meant India. There was still interest in moving to Northeast Asia (South Korea and Japan), while North America, and Australia and New Zealand, still garnered low levels of interest. For those moving from Taiwan, there was a substantial jump in those moving to the Mainland, while South and Central Asia moved up to attract as much interest as Northeast Asia. And like those moving from Mainland China, there was still only limited interest in North America and in Australia and New Zealand. This suggests that large individual investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) fab in Phoenix, Arizona, are not being followed by a wave of other Taiwanese companies. By contrast, momentum to move to India has gained substantial steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.7: A Shifting Pattern of Destinations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide greater insight, the new edition of the survey also asked companies to indicate the proportion of their operations that they are considering or actually moving from the Mainland and Taiwan. As Figure 2.8 shows, the plurality (39.4 percent) of those in Mainland China are moving 26–50 percent of their business, and just over 30 percent of companies are moving 11–25 percent. Only 7.9 percent are moving the vast majority of their business (over 75 percent) out of China. For those leaving Taiwan, the data skews somewhat lower, with the plurality (36.7 percent) moving 11–25 percent, and 31 percent moving 26–50 percent. These are not insignificant portions of their business, but very few are leaving either locale outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BCz2YO1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.8: Shifting, Not Leaving: Proportion of Investment Being Moved from Mainland China and Taiwan to Elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some important insights to be gained by looking at the responses of different industries (see Figure 2.9). First, industries vary substantially in the share of firms with investment in China that are considering or actually moving. In five sectors (public administration, real estate, finance and insurance, human health and social work, and manufacturing), over two-thirds of firms are moving or considering doing so. In another 10 sectors, it is 50–60 percent of firms, and in four sectors it is less than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complete explanation for the variation across sectors awaits more refined statistical analysis, but there are a couple of findings that stand out at first glance. Sectors with firms that report China’s market is a relatively higher share of their overall revenue appear to move somewhat more of their operations than those less dependent on China. Additionally, in sectors where a higher proportion of firms report moving, they tend to be moving a slightly lower proportion of their business compared to sectors where a lower share of firms are moving. Put another way, in some sectors a high share of firms are moving, but they are moving less of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an important contrast in terms of destinations. Over half (52.8 percent) of firms in manufacturing are moving to Southeast Asia, whereas only 22.6 percent in that sector were returning to Taiwan. Other likely movers to Southeast Asia were in health and social work and hotel and food services, all services that could support the people who are in manufacturing firms. The most likely sectors to return to Taiwan were public administration, finance and insurance, and hotel and food services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in around 40 percent of sectors, firms most commonly were moving a moderate proportion of their operations (26–50 percent). In five sectors, firms were mainly moving 11–25 percent of their operations. And in another five industries, the proportion of operations that firms reported moving was widely distributed, with no one dominant pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these broader patterns of shifting investment decisions, there are some distinctive regional patterns that suggest Taiwanese companies are pursuing a diversity of approaches. The largest plurality of companies are not moving at all, either from the Mainland or Taiwan. Of those that are moving, three groups are significant. The first is the group of 22 companies that are moving from China and Taiwan and going only to Southeast Asia. The second group is composed of 25 firms that are moving from both China and Taiwan to at least three other destinations. The final group is made up of 30 firms reporting that they are simultaneously moving only from Mainland China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to Mainland China. The “Southeast Asia movers” are focused on shifting production to a single locale; the “diversifiers” appear to be spreading risk across a range of regions; and the “cross-strait movers” appear to be reorganizing their production within the company, with a clearer delineation of their “China for China” activities in the PRC and their other activities directed for Taiwan and the rest of the world back on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader point is that although most companies are moving or planning to move their business, there is substantial variation in where they are moving to and how much of their operations they are moving. Understanding these patterns is aided by analyzing the reasons why companies are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-taiwanese-companies-are-moving&quot;&gt;Why Taiwanese Companies Are Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only surprising that such a high percentage of Taiwanese firms are moving from Mainland China and Taiwan despite the stabilization of U.S.-China relations, but that the inclination for Taiwanese firms to move is so much higher than for their counterparts from the United States, Europe, and Japan (see Figure 3.1). Whereas over 57 percent of Taiwanese companies are considering or already moving, just under a quarter of U.S. firms in China are, and only around 10 percent of European and Japanese firms report that they are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no direct evidence to explain why Taiwanese companies have a stronger propensity to move than their American, European, and Japanese counterparts. But we can evaluate what differentiates the Taiwanese firms that choose to move from those that do not, and then more closely analyze the various reasons for moving. This may then help provide insights across different investors in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to distinguish movers and non-movers is to compare their answers to other questions in the survey. These patterns are not necessarily statistically significant, because the potential effect of other factors is not simultaneously accounted for, but such “crosstabs” are nevertheless suggestive. The first survey from 2022 found that several factors — companies’ backgrounds, the Covid-19 pandemic, firms’ evaluation of the international economic situation, the respondents’ political leanings, and their views about security — were related to how likely they were to have considered or actually begun to move some of their business from China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the 2022 results, companies in manufacturing are more likely to have already moved than to either be just considering moving or have no plans to move (see Figure 3.2). A company’s current profitability does not appear to shape their relocation decisions. Unlike in 2022, however, older companies are now more likely to leave rather than younger firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at economic ties, while revenue reliance on China did not seem to matter in 2022, it does in the latest survey. Companies that depend more on China for their profits are less likely to move than those that are less dependent. A total of 69.2 percent of those who did not move generated more than 25 percent of their profits from China, while only 51.7 percent of those considering moving and 36.4 percent of those who have not moved depend on China for a quarter or more of their profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those who already started moving strongly believe that the island should reduce its dependence on Mainland China. In short, while exposure to China may be synonymous with higher opportunity costs, fears of overdependence still shape relocation decisions. Finally, those who believe that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for China were, as in 2022, more likely to have already started moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of political and security views did not change much between the two surveys. In 2023, 21.3 percent of those who moved away supported Taiwan’s independence, compared to 9.5 percent who were considering moving and 2.8 percent who were not moving at all. Moreover, companies that left were less concerned about China’s military action given Taiwan’s strength in semiconductors and were most likely to believe that the United States and others would provide military support in the event of a contingency for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the focus turns to reasons for moving from or staying in Taiwan, because the pandemic subsided in 2022, the 2023 survey did not ask how Covid-19 cases affected business or whether respondents were satisfied with Taiwan’s Covid-19 policies. Instead, as Figure 3.3 shows, basic company characteristics and views about the semiconductor industry mattered. Companies that are older, larger, and in manufacturing showed a greater propensity for moving. Unlike in the 2022 survey, the belief that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for both Taiwan exports and investments with Mainland China now appears positively correlated with the decision to move from Taiwan. In addition, companies that believe Beijing is less likely to take military action because of Taiwan’s strong semiconductor industry were also more inclined to move. Respondents’ views about Taiwan independence, their companies’ relative dependence on China for revenue, and the likelihood of war in the next five years did not seem to differentiate movers and non-movers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent survey, from late 2023, went one step further and directly asked only those companies that are moving or considering moving to choose the top three reasons from a long list of reasons why. Although not posed to those who did not move at all, this approach lets firms themselves clearly explain their decision to move as opposed to looking for patterns between separate questions. As Figure 3.4 shows, this approach yields some similarities but also reveals some differences from the crosstabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jMbUqgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.4: Why Companies Are Moving from China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the top five reasons concern China’s business environment, including high labor costs, the possibility of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and lack of policy transparency. Although Taiwanese firms are worried about the possibility of war, that ranked fourth among the various factors affecting their decision. At the other end of the spectrum, issues that were much less important included a general desire to diversify production or reduce ties with China, the need to follow others in the same supply chain, China’s Covid-19 policies, and reputational risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons firms gave for moving some business from Taiwan shared similarities with those moving from China but also revealed some differences. As with China, the top issue is the rising cost of labor. Other issues related to Taiwan’s business environment were also cited, such as the investment environment and the possibility of supply chain disruptions. By contrast, the fear of war vaulted to second place, cited by 37.1 percent of respondents as a reason to move from the island. At the other end of the spectrum, general reasons to diversify or follow other firms in one’s supply chain were cited much less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Taiwanese firms seriously consider moving from either China or Taiwan when they believe it will make a tangible difference to their business and substantially reduce their risks, and not because of vague worries and fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diversifying-not-decoupling&quot;&gt;Diversifying, Not Decoupling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reflect a high degree of anxiety among Taiwanese firms, and a substantial proportion are moving some of their operations from China and Taiwan as a result. That said, it does not appear that these adjustments add up to a plan to decouple from China by entirely rerouting their supply chains, or a complete loss of interest in the Mainland Chinese market. Instead, several signs point to these changes adding up to an effort to diversify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked how important various countries and regions are as economic partners for Taiwan, although the United States was most often identified as “extremely important” in both the 2022 and 2023 surveys, China’s position rose significantly in 2023. The proportion of those identifying China as an extremely important trading partner for Taiwan rose from 28.4 percent to 35.6 percent, placing it ahead of Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Europe (see Figure 4.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as noted earlier in Figure 2.3, Taiwanese businesses still see the ECFA deal with China as the single most important agreement for expanding their international business opportunities. And in 2023, the ECFA received almost as many mentions among the top three as the CPTPP and the RCEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a belief that India and Southeast Asia could collectively be sufficient substitutes for trade and investment ties with China is still high, but has fallen, with those answering “strongly agree” falling from 20.8 percent to 17.4 percent and those answering “somewhat agree” dropping from 44.0 percent to 39.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UteTeHS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.1: Who Are Taiwan’s Important Trading Partners?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the ways in which the firms are moving also do not point to decoupling as the primary motivation. As noted above, Taiwanese companies that are moving or considering moving are only shifting a portion of their operations from China, most often somewhere between a quarter and a half, with very few moving more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as previously mentioned, those moving display a range of regional patterns, each shaped by a distinctive rationale. Some firms are simultaneously moving some operations from China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to China, what the authors call “cross-strait reorganizers.” These firms appear to be relocating their business for China’s market entirely in China and their business for the rest of the world in Taiwan. Every company in this group believes that U.S.-China cooperation is in their interests. This group also appears more confident that Taiwan’s semiconductor industry would act as a “silicon shield” to deter Beijing from an attack but should there be a conflict, the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense. Those moving to multiple locations (“diversifiers”) also seem to be reshuffling their operations into a “China for China” strategy and “elsewhere for the world.” It is the “Southeast Asia movers” (those moving from China and Taiwan only to Southeast Asia) who are most concerned about the business environment on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and are adjusting accordingly, with companies in this group moving a higher proportion of their operations in China and Taiwan than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, actual cross-strait trade and investment is still quite high. There’s been a reduction in China’s dominance as a destination for outbound investment but very little change in the direction of trade, with China still being the destination for a quarter of Taiwan’s exports (see Figure 4.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these various pieces of evidence point to diversification but not abandonment of China as a location for production or as a market. Even with all of these changes, China is still an extremely important economic counterpart for Taiwan, substantially higher than the United States and far higher than Europe. There is little indication this reality will fundamentally change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese industry’s anxieties about the geostrategic environment tempered slightly between mid-2022 and late 2023, yet there are still concerns about U.S.-China tensions, the possibility of war, and China’s business environment. As a result, Taiwanese companies advocate reducing dependence on China and expanding business ties with others in the region and beyond. As in 2022, Taiwanese companies are still moving some of their operations out of China and Taiwan, and they are doing so at a greater level than their counterparts from other countries. That said, they appear to be motivated by a desire to hedge their risks and diversify their regional and global production footprint, not outright decouple from China. Firms from the island still see China as a key economic partner and generally favor advancing their own capabilities instead of restricting ties as a method to handle the various security and competitive risks from across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of similar risks, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. At the same time, U.S. industry has slowed new investment into China, while adding incremental capacity in other locales. The data from these surveys suggest that although Taiwanese firms are moving at a higher rate, they broadly recognize that interdependence with China is impossible to fully eliminate, and that while “defensive” measures are necessary, so too are “offensive” steps to advance their own competitiveness. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications for Beijing are even more challenging. Although the Mainland’s zero-Covid policies are no longer a concern, Taiwanese firms still lack sufficient confidence in China’s business environment and are nervous about geostrategic tensions. Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan. As a result of cross-strait political tensions, however, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan, while also carrying out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA and imposing a variety of tailored restrictions. These steps at a minimum send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. Although the New Southbound Policy has borne some fruit in encouraging diversification of investment to Southeast Asia and India, further steps are needed to make these destinations more credible as long-term options for global business operations. Finally, the continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening their confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan encountered problems with overreliance on Chinese mineral supply chains over a decade ago, long before it became a critical issue for other countries. Following a territorial dispute in 2010, China implemented an export ban on rare earth elements (REEs) that specifically targeted Japan. This ban only lasted two months, but encouraged Japan to change its approach for key mineral-dependent industries and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s export controls on minerals needed for the green energy transition become more indiscriminate – exemplified by last year’s graphite restrictions – other countries can learn from Japan’s experience. Groups like the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) have prioritised alternative producers and processors, but there is also value in stockpiling. This approach could be particularly effective because China’s relative economic weakness means that it is unlikely to be willing or able to sustain onerous or lengthy export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, despite all its efforts, Japan still gets more than half its REEs from China and remains heavily reliant on Chinese processing for other raw materials. Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future. It should also be underlined that China is set to play a leading role in attempts to push forward recycling and technologies that reduce material reliance. Ongoing engagement with China is therefore imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-lessons&quot;&gt;Key Lessons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article sets out to profile four of Japan’s high-level responses to the REE export ban in 2010. Some of these responses, particularly stockpiling and diversification, could be mimicked easily by other countries. Importantly, these strategies are even more effective when adopted by alliances like the MSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Investing in alternative producers and processors:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese companies and investors have been instrumental in the emergence of Lynas, an Australia-based REE producer and processor. Similarly, they have supported the emergence of Malaysia as a major processor of REEs. They have also encouraged allies like the US to promote domestic REE production, such as at the Mount Pass facility. This initiative has enjoyed government-level support, but at a local level met opposition to mining operations that are seen as dirty and destructive in the US and developed democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan empowered the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security to act as a one-stop shop that coordinates the country’s minerals strategy. This has been instrumental in its diversification success, which has helped to reduce the proportion of the world’s REE mining that takes place in China from 95% to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China still accounts for nearly 90% of REE processing, underlining the limitations of the strategy and the importance of a holistic approach to supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Stockpiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan immediately started to stockpile REEs in 2010/11, and its experience underlines the need for consideration and coordination: Japanese companies were in such a rush to stockpile REEs both during and after China’s embargo that they exacerbated a price bubble that lasted for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, stockpiling can offer a good way to manage price spikes and resource scarcity (e.g. in the oil and gas markets). China has demonstrated its own capacity to stockpile critical minerals while prices are low. More recently, several countries have started to stockpile graphite and other critical minerals following China’s controls. Examples include the US’s National Defense Stockpile of various metals and South Korea’s expanded critical mineral stockpile. The UK is considering a strategic stockpile, and France is set to conduct a stockpile of mineral resources located domestically and in its overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling is most effective as a response to relatively short or limited trade disputes or supply chain disruptions. This is important because China’s economic fragility suggests that it may be unable to sustain trade disputes that have significant impacts on its core industries, including minerals and electric vehicles (EVs). So far, China’s controls on gallium and graphite have been closer to a skirmish than committed economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling would be more powerful still if groups like the MSP could work on shared stockpiles. This approach would also help to mitigate the risks to transition mineral supply chains outside China and/or those driven by external forces (such as climate impacts). It is therefore unfortunate that the EU appears to be walking back its plans to establish such stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Promoting technology alternatives that reduce material reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has attempted to develop technologies that use fewer REEs or alternative materials. It has also been more hesitant than the EU and US to increase reliance on Chinese supply chains for products like EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part for this reason, Japanese automakers have shown greater support than their counterparts for technologies like hydrogen. This has put them in a weak competitive position given the growing dominance of EVs and has left a gap for Chinese automakers to fill, particularly in servicing regional demand. Japan’s approach has therefore increased China’s control over EV supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this strategy would be more successful in collaboration with other countries. For example, replacing graphite with other anode materials (such as silicon, tin and lithium) or developing new battery technologies (such as solid state) will take time but is achievable in the next few years, particularly with concerted effort. But material substitution would take place faster if this concerted effort included China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Supporting recycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has accelerated the development of technologies for recycling REEs and other key materials, but reuse is still very limited outside base metals like copper, nickel and steel. Recycling of REEs, for example, is unlikely to be commercialised until the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Engaging with China is just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other transition materials like lithium, cobalt and manganese face several significant barriers to recycling at scale, including technology shifts (such as in battery chemistry), price uncertainty for virgin material, lack of standardisation in battery design/construction processes, and lack of available feedstock at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, recycling can reduce reliance on China in the medium term (that is, post-2030) but not the short term. Again, China is currently leading the way with much of this technological development. Expanding recycling at the rate needed by global markets and standards will likely mean learning from China. This argues for greater engagement as well as concentration risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of transition mineral supply chains in China creates substantial risks for other economies and their green transitions. China can weaponise its control of these supply chains, but is unlikely to do so unprovoked. Engaging with China is therefore just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s experience can help other countries to get the balance right, but as ever, the devil is in the detail. Stockpiling is a particularly effective response given the nature of the risk posed by China’s dominance and in the context of its weak economy. As with other approaches, stockpiling is more effective when countries collaborate. But this should be framed to manage supply chain risks in general, rather than as a way of combatting Chinese control of transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of yet another strategic review – the third in just four years – presents an opportunity for the new government to outline a roadmap for securing the UK’s innovation ecosystem, a crucial backbone of its economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous strategic reviews outlined the UK government’s goal of becoming a technology superpower. Any advances in key areas of emerging and deep technology will undoubtedly require cultivating a thriving innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entails promoting research in a higher education sector that is experiencing profound financial challenges, supporting the commercialisation of research, and developing a more informed approach to industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already easier said than done. However, in addition to these policy challenges, the UK also faces determined adversaries that are seeking to steal its intellectual property and otherwise disrupt its innovation ecosystem. Ensuring the security of the ecosystem and its resilience against these threats without stifling innovation is an epochal challenge for the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-of-innovation-under-threat&quot;&gt;Security of Innovation Under Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation is a key strategic battleground between great powers. Accordingly, organisations that are engaged in technological innovation will be targeted by well-resourced, persistent threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic espionage is not a novel phenomenon. However, Western governments are increasingly open in their assessment of the scale and breadth of China’s theft of innovative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research institutions, university spinouts, startups and larger enterprises are all at risk. Greater public awareness of this issue has also increased the pressure on companies to address the threat. However, efforts to strengthen the security of some organisations have run into practical and cultural challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of technologies and companies considered relevant to national security, and therefore falling under the scope of UK government efforts to counter threats, is expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organisations innovating in emerging technologies, which are often small startups and spinouts, are unfamiliar with security and do not have well-established connections with the security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat extends beyond the comparatively familiar domain of cyber security. Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also cultural challenges in introducing security controls in some institutions, not to mention opposition to working with government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-government-response&quot;&gt;The UK Government Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) was enacted in the UK in 2021. The act provides the UK government with enhanced powers to scrutinise and intervene in business transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, over 17 sensitive areas of the economy that are relevant to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSIA is notable for the breadth of its coverage, permitting scrutiny of transactions in catch-all categories such as communications, defence and transport. Other categories cover entire fields of research and development, such as AI, quantum technologies and synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests that the startup ecosystem has not always appreciated the NSIA. There remains uncertainty among businesses over the scope and applicability of the act, likely leading to unnecessary delay in mergers and acquisitions. The impression that emerges is that both government and the private sector are finding their way at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the NSIA approval process is set out in a legally binding decision called a final order. In addition to prohibiting a proposed deal, or unwinding one that has taken place, these final orders can also impose conditions on the parties involved, pending the acceptance of which the deal can go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing these final orders shows that, rather than blocking deals entirely, the government is increasingly using final orders to mandate changes in companies’ approach to security. These changes emphasise a holistic approach to protective security, with a focus on security governance, personnel security and vetting, and assurance functions. This suggests a direction of travel in terms of broader requirements for protective security for companies working in sensitive areas of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TYYcmwW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ NSIA Final Order Actions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government offers some support to industry through the National Protective Security Authority (NPSA), which focuses on economic security and the protection of science, technology and research. The NPSA runs a campaign called “Secure Innovation” that offers guidance to organisations operating in this space. An online survey allows organisations to assess their need for protective security, and the NPSA has also launched a pilot programme with UK Research and Innovation which covers some of the costs for companies seeking protective security assessments from a list of approved providers. This is a positive move towards a more collaborative approach to mitigating risks in this area, but still leaves the onus on companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-innovation-security&quot;&gt;The Future of Innovation Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more – and more diverse – organisations are asked to introduce security controls to protect their work, the ability of the UK government to provide guidance and support will be increasingly strained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pockets of expertise and capability across the private sector and within public institutions such as universities, think tanks and research institutes. Nonetheless, given the UK government’s limited capacity to directly support companies at risk, there is a pressing need for the development of collective responses within industry. This will involve bringing together companies that address different aspects of security, such as cyber security and physical security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges around security awareness and culture, and around the incentives of different actors. Companies operating in this highly competitive space are unlikely to spend on security measures unless the costs of not doing so are immediate and unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad statements from government about the criticality of science and technology to national security may resonate with some individuals, but are unlikely to drive organisational behaviour in companies that do not already have a more mature security function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing organisational behaviour around security will likely involve the promotion of forums for sharing information and best practices. It will also involve recognising that this is a diverse and heterogeneous space with existing pockets of expertise and collaboration. The government should focus on building and supporting a system of systems, rather than attempting to impose a single body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies. As with the security of academic research, such efforts also need to find a balance between the necessity of international collaboration and the need to protect sovereign capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it may take more high-profile company failures resulting from adversary actions before this issue gains significant attention, prompting companies to seek best practices and benchmarks to justify security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, it triggered an influx of material to Ukraine from Kyiv’s Western partners. This assistance enabled Ukraine to prevent Russia from toppling its government, but it also depleted Western stockpiles and pulled equipment out of service to be shipped to Ukraine. Replenishing these stockpiles with technologically updated material is not an easy task. Since the end of the Cold War, responding to governments’ demand levels, Western defence industries have shifted to just-in-time production models, reducing their output capacity. Meanwhile, many of the systems sent to Ukraine are legacy designs from the last century. Replacing them like-for-like would delay the necessary modernisation of Western forces and in many cases would not be feasible. As a result, industry and military planners face a dual challenge: they must decide how to meet immediate needs for restocking, while also enabling industry to develop new platforms that meet future battlefield requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine also rekindled the value of defence industrial independence in defence procurement policy circles. For instance, Germany was unable to supply ammunition for the Gepard tank as Swiss neutrality laws prevented Rheinmetall’s factory in Switzerland from exporting arms to Ukraine. This situation drew further attention to the need for indigenous supplies of critical products that the Covid-19 pandemic had already emphasised. Geopolitical factors have also heightened this concern. Donald Trump made US support within NATO conditional on increased European defence spending. This made European leaders wary of relying on US supply chains and encouraged them to prioritise spending on their domestic defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-risks-being-the-odd-one-out-in-the-long-term&quot;&gt;UK Risks being the “Odd One Out” in the Long Term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has been pushing structured integration of its defence industrial base. The European Defence Fund (EDF) launched in 2021, and the European Defence Industrial Programme (EDIP) is under consultation in Brussels. The EDF endows research grants to consortiums of companies from at least three different EU member states, especially incentivising the inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Non-EU-based companies are excluded from the funding. Meanwhile, the annual work programmes are agreed across member states, necessitating requirement harmonisation that could make national European programmes more accessible to cross-EU industry. The EDIP will enact the EU’s defence industrial strategy that seeks to pool defence procurement with the aim that, by 2030, 40% of national defence procurement budgets go towards pan-European programmes. It also envisages that EU members will spend 50% of national procurement budgets within the EU. Thus, the two programmes aim to future-proof European industry by investing billions in research and development. This enables them to satisfy their European market through indigenous development and creates a level playing field with less national favouritism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a strategic challenge to the UK defence industrial base, which is at risk of becoming the “odd one out” between the biggest Western defence markets – Europe and the US. The EDF and EDIP and their likely successors will develop a more consolidated industrial base exclusive of UK industry and a more coherent domestic market landscape. Meanwhile, the UK defence industry is deeply intertwined with the continent. Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, MBDA and RBSL are examples. Sharing intellectual property from EDF initiatives will be complicated and so will the UK side’s access to European tendering. This presents a challenge for the highly integrated UK-European defence industrial landscape. Earlier negotiations on access to the EDF and PESCO led to no conclusions other than on PESCO’s Military Mobility project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UK experience of cooperating with US programmes to keep and develop industry skills has been lukewarm. It managed to maintain key aerospace competence in the country through its cooperation with the US on the F35 striker as a junior partner, but it received less attractive workshares in the programme. Indeed, its relatively competitive effectors industry faces the challenge of being excluded from the programme, as the closed software architecture of the platform prevents effective integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bi--and-minilateral-cooperation-should-complement-structured-cooperation&quot;&gt;Bi- and Minilateral Cooperation Should Complement Structured Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government hopes to overcome this challenge through a series of “minilateral” collaborations on major projects, such as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the US-Australian cooperation on nuclear submarines. The GCAP programme with Japan and Italy retains competency in airframe design and production and includes a dual software architecture allowing effector integration. This makes it more attractive for export markets with an existing effectors industry while boosting the participants’ own effectors industries’ exports to markets without one. Yet, the question remains to what extent these programmes can provide the UK defence industrial base with the necessary resources to not only maintain its current competencies but also develop its competitiveness. As the F35 has shown, the established links with the US bear the danger of being overpowered by the significant advantages of extensive resources and market potential that US industry enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank. Yet, these links are at risk of being decoupled as the EU extensively funds research and, in the future, procurement from EU-based industry. Thus far, bilateral cooperation has been the UK’s preferred approach to remain connected with the continent. An example of this is the Lancaster House treaty with France, which served as a platform for deepening defence relations. The new Labour government seems eager to expand this approach, signing a joint declaration on “Enhanced Defence Cooperation” with Germany and envisioning a revised relationship with the EU. So, what opportunities lie ahead for the UK defence industrial base in such an expansion of ties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “low-hanging fruits” for UK-German cooperation are in the land domain sector. There is already an established legacy of successful cooperation with the M3 bridging capability, the modernisation of the Challenger 3 tanks as well as the UK’s embrace of Rheinmetall’s Boxer programme, encompassing various mechanised infantry variants and a 155mm howitzer on a Boxer basis. Thus, industry has already been intertwined in this sector, with the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) being the most visible example of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Franco-German ambition of a joint future tracked main ground combat system (MGCS) has seemed beset by handwringing. Industry and politicians had been upset about the workshare on the combat air equivalent, FCAS. Yet, this spring, MGCS regained momentum as both countries agreed on an equal distribution of work across eight capability pillars and set up a joint venture to manage the project. The bad news is that the programme is currently closed for potential partners. However, this will likely be reconsidered at some point during the conceptual stage: Italy has expressed interest in the project, while pressing ahead with Leonardo and Rheinmetall’s strategic partnership to develop a main battle tank. To reduce European platform diversity, this project will eventually have to be merged with MGCS, and it could provide Italy with the necessary arguments to gain a satisfactory workshare for Leonardo. It also seems unlikely – especially in the crowded tracked armour market of the 2040s (when these concepts are planned to be introduced), with likely new competition from India and South Korea – that the Franco-German project can afford to ignore important Northeast European markets for much longer. Thus, the established UK-German cooperation in the land sector may provide a longer-term entry route into the MGCS and set the stage for a strategic partnership on land systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aerospace sector, meanwhile, the fruits hang a little higher. Here, the continental FCAS and GCAP are fully established, and a reconsideration of the programmes’ compositions other than to include major exporting partners, such as Saudi Arabia, seems unlikely. This is because of the implied costs of including further requirements, language barriers and the diplomatic costs implied in any structural shake-up of either programme. Future related programmes concerning effectors and uncrewed wingmen concepts may be an area for cooperation, especially considering the high levels of cross-border industry integration in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, bi- and minilateral defence cooperation initiatives lack the strategic security that UK industry needs to maintain and develop its design and manufacturing capabilities. The uncertainty caused by the Strategic Defence Review over some key programmes underlines this point. Broader research and development investments ensure this competitiveness. National research programmes are fiscally limited and may struggle to access the continental expertise they have previously enjoyed. Labour’s more relaxed stance on the UK’s relationship with the EU might be an opportunity: over the next five years, the European Commission will be looking to reconsidering its current defence procurement policy instruments, as the EDF’s funding and the EDIP end in 2027. The UK government should re-explore the benefits of having a Norway-like role as a non-EU participant, not only to secure funding for innovation but also to enable industry to build on its extensive relationships with continental partners and, therefore, maintain access to that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical arguments for such a setup are strong. The European component of NATO must become less dependent on US capabilities as the long-term US commitment to the continent seems destined to fade independent of the short-term political outlook. UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area. A UK attempt at access to EU structures may find some supporters within the Union: research on the priorities in the European programmes has shown a split between member states that prioritise NATO capability planning and those that prioritise national industrial concerns. With its thorough commitment to NATO and highly capable and Europe-oriented industry, a UK attempt at accessing European programmes may find partners in those European states that seek to adapt and augment NATO capabilities, rather than replicating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑，指呂在案中角色次要，從無意圖推翻政權、只是企圖阻礙運作，屬「其他參加者」。陳又呈上呂親撰的求情信，呂從小志向成為社工，但因本案而失去社工資格。求情信亦提到，呂參加初選為由人民授權行使否決權，以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，望當權者回應民意；他當時無知相信議員行使否決權是合法，現已明白想法錯誤，深感後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，接受違反《國安法》須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，眾被告心靈受創，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，令被告和社會可從創傷中復原。罪成45名被告全部求情完畢，法官表示會另行通知判刑日期。原獲保釋的呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，還柙候判，他今早並在 Facebook 發布與養母 Elsa 的合照，表示：「期待在遙遠的那天重聚，大家珍重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋陳志全及范國威無到庭&quot;&gt;楊岳橋、陳志全及范國威無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的楊岳橋、陳志全及范國威今無到庭，其餘6人分成三排就坐，由7名懲教人員看管。呂智恆穿米白色長袖裇衫，林景楠穿白裇衫、白口罩、深藍西裝外套。穿粉紅色裇衫、黑色西裝外套的林卓廷微笑向旁聽席揮手，穿軍綠色上衣的鄒家成，與女友以手勢交流。劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝和打深藍領帶，何桂藍綁短馬尾、穿白背心，坐下後與劉及鄒談天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呂角色次要因對法律無知犯案-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：呂角色次要、因對法律無知犯案 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑認為，呂屬刑期3年以下的「其他參加者」，指他在案中沒有主要角色，只是支援性質、頗為次要，對整個謀劃沒有任何重要或實質的貢獻。陳接納，呂競選時曾批評制度，但那是他為爭取選民支持而說的話。若法庭拒納，辯方亦望考慮呂為「積極參加者」較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又接納，呂同意無差別否決預算案的協議，但強調他只是企圖「阻撓」議會運作，從未企圖「推翻」政權；而否決預算案本身沒有違法，呂因對法律無知、真誠誤信合法而犯案，加上涉案謀劃不可能實現，望法庭給予及時認罪的呂，全數三分一刑期扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&quot;&gt;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格、明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續呈上呂親撰的7頁求情信，呂提及成為社工是他從小志向，但因本案令他失去註冊社工的資格。呂來自破碎家庭，童年悲慘、受貧苦和孤獨所困，其父母離婚後撫養權歸父親，其後寄居不同人家中生活，直至被領養才頭一次獲得關心和愛護，生活慢慢改善。呂其後努力向上考入大學，成為全職社工貢獻社區，亦是一名虔誠的基督徒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續引述呂指，案發時受誤導，參與否決預算案的謀劃，以向政府施壓回應訴求，但現時已知道是錯誤，他深感後悔，承諾不會再犯。陳又指，呂在首次提堂後獲得保釋，自保釋以來，他珍惜其自由並更盡力幫助有需要的人，強調呂來自這樣的背景，能努力向上，有所作為，是值得讚揚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意無知相信行使否決權合法&quot;&gt;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意、無知相信行使否決權合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》取得呂智恆求情信（全文見文末），呂提到成年後幾經挫折實現夢想成為社工，但終成為被告，永遠失去社工資格。他童年在不同人家寄居、曾被迫做童工和失學，至中四被領養，獲養母無私的愛和包容，終獲城大社工系取錄，老師莫慶聯激勵他立志「以生命影響生命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，2008年畢業後成為社工，服務邊青，至2014年逐漸不覺可幫到街頭青少年，因學生時代察覺和倡議過的社福界制度問題在入職多年後全無改善。呂2018年入讀中大修讀基督教研究文學碩士，望尋找改變社會的答案，至2019年發生反修例引起的民主運動，心痛多人輕生、失蹤，深感這代青年絕望感遠超他童年所受痛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂續指，2020年疫情初期派防疫物資，深感市民無力，望當權者可回應民意，並形容他參加初選為了由人民授權行使否決權，「以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，希望當權者回應民意」，沒有從政經驗和法律專業知識的他，當時無知地相信議員行使否決權是合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，自保釋後數年經常失眠和感到巨大壓力，他現已明白否決預算案對政權帶來衝擊和影響運作是錯誤想法，感到後悔抱歉。呂指保釋期間小心遵守保釋條件，珍惜平凡生活的時光，想到即將入獄增家人負擔，萬分痛苦和歉疚，日後定會想起曾服務的小學生、露宿者等，亦相信常與養母唱詩歌是日後最珍貴和暖心的回憶。呂最後指，最喜歡電視劇《秘密森林》的對白「請堅信一絲希望，勝過無數絕望」，他深知罪名嚴重，不敢低估刑期，但會心存盼望，望未來報答親恩和服務弱勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方本案阻嚇效果眾所周知-法庭現需判處療癒式刑罰&quot;&gt;辯方：本案阻嚇效果眾所周知 法庭現需判處「療癒式刑罰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑指，呂十分善良，是一個好人，他是具天真理念的政治新人，對社區有深厚貢獻，望法庭判刑時能展示「憐憫」，令呂可盡快重投社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後指，接受任何違反《國安法》的行為須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案的阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，因所有被告心靈飽受創傷（spiritually broken），是時候療癒。陳重申，望法庭判處「療癒式刑罰」，讓被告可以從此創傷中復原（healed from this trauma），社會亦同樣需要復原。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。林景楠一方望法庭考慮他遲參選、無簽「墨落無悔」等，參與程度低而視為「其他參加者」，又指林錄取口供和成為控方證人，其證供有用，可獲50%減刑，並望為林索取社會服務令報告。法官庭上多次質疑，指林僅在證供提及出席沈旭暉主持的協調會議，但沈並非本案共謀者、亦無因此被捕；法庭在裁決時也完全無依賴林的證供。對於辯方望索社服令報告，法官亦指是不現實、不合理，拒絕辯方要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出林景楠親撰的求情信節錄，林提到候審時通過接觸不同觀點的資訊，明白當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢」的行為，「中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，又引述國家主席習近平七一講話，指深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，一直受到海外勢力或網絡傳媒渲染，間接成為反中亂港一分子。林主動聯絡警方認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，讓他可把所知所聞一一供出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後真誠向中央、特區政府及所有受影響市民真誠道歉，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，陪伴三個子女成長，及予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地，用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。罪成45名被告求情完畢，法官押後通知判刑日期。呂智恆撤銷保釋還柙，林景楠則准續保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林景楠遲參選無簽墨落屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：林景楠遲參選、無簽「墨落」屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林景楠的大律師范凱傑認為，林屬於刑期分級制最低程度的「其他參加者」，指他並非組織者，不曾出席協調會議和初選記者會，也沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，是初選的「遲到者（latecomer）」，與大部分其他被告不同，他於6月尾才參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑-官屢質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑 官屢質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，林對警方的協助，可根據《國安法》33條獲得減刑，並呈上林於2023年錄取的兩份無損權益口供，指林以控方證人身分作供，指證其他串謀者，其證供有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指兩份證供主要談及林本人對初選的參與，問哪部分談及其他人參與。劉頴匡一度望向鄒家成點頭發笑。范指提到沈旭暉，惟李運騰指，沈並非本案共謀者，林景楠雖稱曾參與沈舉行的協調會議，但「那不是串謀的一部分，不是『35+計劃』的一部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nR2tBXb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 沈旭暉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范再指，林的證供亦指證其他串謀者，包括區諾軒和趙家賢。法官李運騰反問，有任何爭議區是組織者之一嗎？法官陳仲衡亦問，辯方是否說區諾軒和趙家賢認罪是因為林的證供？范否認。李運騰續指，林證供唯一提到區諾軒的地方，是林發現已錯過初選的報名日期，並因知道區和趙是組織者，故聯絡區望讓他可參與，獲區回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林指證沈旭暉-惟認資料無致沈被捕&quot;&gt;辯方指林指證沈旭暉 惟認資料無致沈被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范同意，指林證供的有用性，在於談及參加者如何參與串謀和初選，並在法官追問下，再指林為警方提供情報（intelligence），提及沈旭暉的參與。惟法官李運騰再指，沈無被指控為本案共謀者，問此資料有否導致警方拘捕或任何事情發生，范答沒有，被告欄的林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後說，「你看，你要求50%減刑，50%是很多」，法官李運騰亦指，困難是沈旭暉並非本案共謀者，辯方基本上是叫法庭就有關一宗懷疑的事件（suspected event）、而非林認罪的案件的資料而減刑。范指沒有補充，強調林庭上是就他真實所知而作供。林景楠聽到相關對答時，數度搖頭，又低頭望地下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林求情信受渲染成反中亂港一分子-參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&quot;&gt;林求情信：受渲染成反中亂港一分子 參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後讀出林求情信「由不認罪到認罪的轉變」下的內容（求情信節錄全文見文末），提到被捕後他一直未認清真相、不明白初選對社會的負面影響，但候審期間「通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論」，明白到當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為」，只是令社會更撕裂和混亂，甚至造成危害國安的後果。林又指，認識到參選令特首可能下台，「其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，他作為「黃色經濟圈領頭者」亦深深悔疚和反省，認為自己要為社會撕裂負上責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林又引述國家主席習近平2022年七一講話，指「香港不能亂也亂不起」，林自言聽到此「呼喚」，深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，「一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。」林指因此他主動聯絡國安處認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，「讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出」，展現真誠認罪。辯方讀出求情信時，劉頴匡一直點頭，林景楠則一度低頭俯身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&quot;&gt;辯方：林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，林景楠引述習近平2022年7月1日的講話，但在數個月後，於2023年1月才表示願成為控方證人。辯方同意，指求情信提及林為何如此遲認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范又指，在公眾知道林或會成為控方證人後，對其生意和家人構成巨大壓力，並呈上阿布泰被公眾破壞等新聞片段。李運騰追問有無證據林作供令他或家人面對風險，范指有，重申有公眾破壞其店舖，部分被捕及被控；林亦因安全考慮，安排家人搬到泰國居住，望法庭考慮林成為控方證人有重大的負面影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林曾參與課程認識國安疫情進行慈善工作&quot;&gt;辯方：林曾參與課程認識國安、疫情進行慈善工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，在林改變主意成為控方證人後，曾參與課程認識國安，希望知道中國公民在港的義務，以及他作為公民維護國安的責任。而在疫情期間，林景楠的公司阿布泰曾為港人和海外人士提供大量醫療物品和資源，望法庭考慮其良好品格、慈善工作而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林望陪伴三子女成長向中央特區政府道歉&quot;&gt;林望陪伴三子女成長、向中央特區政府道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續讀出求情信最後，提到林知道罪行非常嚴重，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。他也望法庭予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。他最後向中央和特區政府，尤其海關、警方和所有被他影響的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，求情信顯示林對所有受他錯誤行為影響的人的真誠道歉，顯示他真誠的後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望索社服令報告-官明言拒絕&quot;&gt;辯方望索社服令報告 官明言拒絕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，不論現實與否，望法庭能考慮在判刑前，為林景楠索取社會服務令報告。法官陳仲衡即指，認為辯方應向法庭就判刑量，而非判刑的方式陳詞（“I think you should address us on the quantum of sentence, not the form of sentence.”）。范回應，明白或要向法庭就判刑量陳詞，但仍希望在法律的界線內，判刑越寬大越好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，認為辯方要求「有點不現實（a bit unrealistic）」，亦不是妥善運用公眾資源，又認為辯方有很大的難處說服法庭，索取社服令報告是妥當。法官陳慶偉也向范說：「要求一個過於寬鬆的刑罰，是對你當事人的損害。（“Asking for a too lenient sentence, is doing a disservice to your client.”）」林卓廷聞言再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范指，望法庭考慮《國安法》22條，法官陳慶偉指他讀過很多次，知道「其他參加者」可拘役或者管制。法官陳仲衡問，辯方是否仍要求索社服令報告，范回應他的指示是，法官陳慶偉即身體傾前，手指着范大聲說：「讓我告訴你，Mr. Fan，那已被拒絕。（“Let me say to you, Mr. Fan, that is refused.”）」法官陳仲衡也說：「你在三位法官前作出一個如此不合理的要求，是三重不合理。（“An unreasonable request like the one you are making before a bench of 3 judges, triples the unreasonableness.”）」林卓廷聞言呵呵發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范欲繼續陳詞，法官李運騰表明，本案太嚴重，已清楚表明法庭不會傾向索取社服令報告。法官陳慶偉笑說：「他（李）很有禮貌，他說『傾向』」，並指自己剛處理入屋犯法（burglary）案，案例中只有最特殊的情況才會可判社服令，而「那是一個入屋犯法案，這不是一個入屋犯法案」，「不要要求不可能的事，拜託。（“Don’t ask for the impossible, please.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指林開審始認罪僅減20判詞無依賴林證供&quot;&gt;官指林開審始認罪僅減20%、判詞無依賴林證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范最後指，認為林屬「其他參加者」的最低程度。法官陳慶偉指，林只是於開審當天才認罪，根據案例只能減刑20%。法官李運騰亦指，即使考慮林的證供有用，法庭仍有酌情權考慮是否降低其刑罰等級；但辯方會留意到，法庭在裁決理由完全沒有依賴林景楠的證供，辯方同意。雙方對答期間，林景楠一度低頭俯身良久。散庭後，他走到庭外角落，背對在場人士以手揹拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。得悉呂的決定後，林景楠一度向呂微笑點頭。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄：&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年1月，因本案被捕後，我一直未認清真相，沒有意識到參加初選的嚴重性，不明白初選的舉行對社會帶來的嚴重負面影響。我在等候審訊期間，通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論，透過反覆論證，明白到自己當初參加初選是非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為，其效果不會令香港這個社會變得更好，而只是會令到社會更加撕裂和混亂，甚至乎會造成危國家安全的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認識到我參與初選而最終可能會令到行政長官下台，其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀，我更加認識到作為一名商人，應該努力透過國家的支持和經濟聯繫，使香港的經濟更加繁榮和社會更加發展，而不是參與政治裡面，企圖令香港成為反中分子的基地。透過深切的自我反省，我意識到自2019年起，社會上的撕裂我確實要負上不少責任，因為我是黃色經濟圈的領頭者，我深深悔疚和反省。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2022年7月1日，國家主席習近平在七一講話中提到，「香港不能亂也亂不起，更深感香港發展不能再耽擱，要排除一切干擾聚精會神謀發展。香港居民，不管從事什麼職業、信奉什麼理念，只要真心擁護「一國兩制」方針，只要熱愛香港這個家園，只要遵守基本法和特別行政區法律，都是建設香港的積極力量，都可以出一分力、作一份貢獻。」簡單來說，就是團結一切可以團結的人，我正如聽到這個呼喚，深切反思過去所做的一切，發現很多香港人包括我自己，一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為以上的反省，所以我主動聯絡警方國安處希望認罪，因為認罪才是最真誠的認錯，讓我可以在日後繼續為社會、為國家作貢獻。我亦感謝控方讓我成為證人，讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出。雖然因為我在比較後期才參加此初選，參與程度較低，但我仍選擇把所知所聞一一說出，希望展現我真誠的認罪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我知道顛覆國家政權是非常嚴重的罪行，但我希望法庭能寬大考慮，讓我履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。我希望法庭考慮我是初犯，我坦白承認罪行，及我在案中參與程度較低給予機會，讓我重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興、疫情與世界接軌的機會，說好香港故事，說好國家故事，繼續促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。最後我希望在此求情信的結尾，向中央政府、特區政府，尤其是香港海關和香港警隊以及所有被我影響到的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in the fall of 2022 is an important reminder about the threat of nuclear escalation in regional conflicts involving U.S. partners or allies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The scare also highlights an enduring feature of nuclear crises: uncertainty about adversary intentions. To prepare for the next nuclear crisis and the uncertainty that it will entail, the United States should develop detailed plans for a wide range of nuclear contingences, including those short of nuclear use. A close examination of Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in October 2022 offers three principles for doing so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fall 2022, the United States faced what may have been its most dangerous nuclear crisis in decades. Confronted by intensifying Russian nuclear rhetoric and intercepted conversations about nuclear use in the Russian military, Western leaders were deeply worried about escalation risks. President Biden warned that Putin was “not joking . . . about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,” and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan asserted that the United States took the threat of nuclear use “deadly seriously.” Behind closed doors, the United States and its allies urgently planned for a Russian nuclear strike. Of particular concern were Russia’s dirty bomb claims. At the end of October, amid a string of battlefield setbacks, senior Russian military and political leaders began a coordinated messaging effort claiming that Ukraine planned to use a dirty bomb. U.S. officials worried that this narrative was an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information. Even today, the true purpose of Russia’s dirty bomb claims remains unclear. While Russian signaling may have been related to planned nuclear use, there are a variety of other plausible explanations, including that the narrative aimed to sway domestic audiences or reflected genuine Russian concerns. U.S. policymakers have faced uncertainty in past crises, but the ambiguity that they faced in October 2022 was fundamentally different. Whereas U.S. leaders have often broadly understood the adversary’s objectives and the connection between the adversary’s signaling and those objectives, in October 2022, U.S. leaders were unsure how the dirty bomb narrative connected to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or whether it was even intended as a nuclear signal. As tensions with nuclear rivals persist, the United States may face similarly ambiguous signaling in future crises over areas such as the Taiwan Strait, Korean Peninsula, or Eastern Europe. This uncertainty is increasingly likely due to U.S. adversaries’ growing reliance on nuclear threats, the sometimes confusing nature of their signaling, and the challenges that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking. The United States should therefore prepare for future crises by developing plans for a wide range of nuclear contingencies, including those short of nuclear use. An analysis of the October 2022 crisis offers three guiding principles for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuclear-signaling-in-the-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;Nuclear Signaling in the Ukraine War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues recently published a study cataloguing and analyzing Russian and NATO statements about nuclear weapons during the first 18 months of the war in Ukraine. The study found that Russia’s nuclear signaling initially focused on deterring direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Putin issued the first threat against Western intervention in his February 24 announcement of the “special military operation in Ukraine,” and he and other Kremlin officials echoed the threat in the following weeks. Russian officials often warned broadly against “interference” in the war and made repeated, ambiguous references to Russia’s nuclear doctrine writ large but were generally clear that direct Western intervention in Ukraine would likely prompt a nuclear response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling changed in two important ways in the early fall of 2022. Beginning in September, Russian officials warned that Russia could use nuclear weapons to defend annexed Ukrainian territory. The motivation for these threats was unclear. Some analysts assessed that the Kremlin sought to deter Ukrainian counteroffensives, but this rhetoric instead may have been related to efforts to legitimize the annexation referendums that Putin announced on September 21. Also in September, Russian officials began warning about nuclear risks created by Western aid to Ukraine. Russian officials specifically targeted the U.S. supplying of long-range missiles to Ukraine, warning that the delivery of those weapons would cross a “red line” and make the United States a party to the conflict. Other officials cautioned more broadly against continued military aid for Ukraine and the risk such aid carried, namely direct conflict between the two nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;six-days-in-october&quot;&gt;Six Days in October&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling took a dramatic shift in late October 2022. Russian state media reported that Ukraine was close to completing work on a dirty bomb, whose use would enable Ukraine to accuse Russia of using a nuclear weapon and thereby “trigger a powerful anti-Russian movement in the world aimed at undermining trust in Moscow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations followed a series of Russian battlefield setbacks over the preceding two months. In late August, Ukraine launched an offensive to liberate Kherson Oblast, including Kherson City — the most populous and economically significant prize that Putin had captured in his invasion. This push made slow progress but put Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River in an increasingly precarious position as the fall progressed. In early September, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in Kharkiv Oblast that made rapid gains, having caught Russian forces off guard. Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By October 22, Ukrainian gains in Kharkiv had slowed and Russian forces had begun to withdraw across the Dnipro, though it remained unclear whether they would be able to complete the evacuation in good order. It was in this context that Kremlin officials began to warn about a Ukrainian dirty bomb. What follows is a brief chronology of these warnings from their introduction on October 23 to their conclusion on October 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-23&quot;&gt;October 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 23, the same day that Russian state media first reported Ukraine’s dirty bomb plans, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu called his U.S., UK, French, and Turkish counterparts to discuss the alleged threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly following Shoigu’s calls, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France rejected Russia’s claims in a P3 foreign ministers statement: “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-24&quot;&gt;October 24&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, October 24, Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov called his U.S. and UK counterparts to discuss the alleged threat. Separately, the chairman of the lower house of the Duma posted on Telegram that Ukraine’s supporters were sponsors of nuclear terrorism. Russia’s UN ambassador wrote a letter to the UN secretary general warning that Russia would view Ukraine’s use of a dirty bomb as an act of “nuclear terrorism.” The head of Russia’s radiological, biological, and chemical defense forces, meanwhile, delivered a briefing in which he stated that Russian forces were preparing to operate in a radioactive environment. In response to the P3 statement the day prior, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted that the dirty bomb threat was real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western officials continued to reject Russian officials’ claims. State Department spokesperson Ned Price described the claims as a pretext for escalation, and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned that Russian claims could signal preparations for a false flag attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-25&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Western officials’ continued rejection of the dirty bomb narrative, Peskov and Russia’s ambassador to the United States reiterated Russia’s claims and criticized the West’s response to Russian warnings as “far from serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to a reporter’s question about whether Putin was preparing to use a dirty bomb, Biden warned that it would be an “incredibly serious mistake” to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-26&quot;&gt;October 26&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin echoed the dirty bomb claims during an October 26 meeting of security and intelligence heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Earlier in the day, he had overseen Russia’s annual Grom nuclear drill, which simulated the delivery of a “massive” nuclear strike and involved the launch of an SLBM and an ICBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day, Shoigu called his Indian and Chinese counterparts to discuss the alleged dirty bomb threat. India’s defense minister, Rajnath Singh, warned Shoigu that neither side should resort to using nuclear or radiological weapons, since their use would violate “the basic tenets of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking with reporters, Stoltenberg asserted that Russian leaders understood there would be “severe consequences” for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-27&quot;&gt;October 27&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin reiterated his claims that Ukraine would use a bomb to accuse Russia of detonating a nuclear weapon at an October 27 meeting of the Valdai Club. At the same time, he asserted that Russia did not need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying “there is no sense in it for us, neither political nor military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, speaking at a press conference, explained that the United States was concerned about escalation in Ukraine and warned that nuclear use would be met with a “very significant response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-28&quot;&gt;October 28&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations — Dmitry Polyansky — issued the last explicit warning about a Ukrainian dirty bomb on October 28, asserting that Ukraine sought to use the bomb to trigger direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Russia’s warnings about an imminent Ukrainian dirty bomb attack then abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;denouement&quot;&gt;Denouement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next statement by a senior Russian official about nuclear risks came on November 1, when Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Ukraine’s declared aim of liberating all of its occupied territory posed a threat to the existence of the Russian state. The following day the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on preventing nuclear war, which reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to avoiding nuclear war and called on the five permanent members of the UN Security council to cease “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces successfully completed their withdrawal from Kherson City on November 9. While Russian officials have occasionally referenced the possibility of Ukraine building a dirty bomb since October 28, these statements have lacked the urgency and coordination that characterized Russia’s October warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nuclear-close-call&quot;&gt;A Nuclear Close Call?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. officials dismissed Russia’s dirty bomb claims as an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use, they appeared uncertain of the narrative’s true purpose. Biden, for example, admitted on October 25 that he did not know the purpose of the narrative, saying “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet. I don’t know.” Subsequent reporting about the crisis also pointed to confusion about the rationale for the narrative. The New York Times and CNN’s Jim Sciutto both wrote that some officials were concerned that the narrative could have been a pretext for nuclear use or as preparation for a false flag, suggesting that there was no consensus on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one can identify at least five plausible explanations for Russia’s dirty bomb signaling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation for nuclear use:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin was considering or had already decided to use nuclear weapons in October 2022 and sought to use dirty bomb claims to establish a pretext.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coercive threat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin intended the dirty bomb narrative as a veiled nuclear threat to influence the behavior of Ukraine and its Western backers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincere belief:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin and Russian national security officials genuinely believed that Ukraine might use a dirty bomb and sought to deny Ukraine a pretext, generate international pressure against the threat, and turn global opinion against Ukraine and its Western supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use the threat of a dirty bomb to instill fear in the Russian population and thereby boost support for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use dirty bomb claims to distract from other military or political activity in which Russia was concurrently engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these explanations are mutually compatible and it is impossible to definitively determine which are relevant from open sources. Nonetheless, some explanations are stronger than others. The “preparation for nuclear use” and “sincere belief” explanations, for example, both align with much of the available evidence, including public statements and international outreach about a dirty bomb and Russia’s announcement of preparations to operate on a radioactive battlefield. The “coercive threat” explanation, on the other hand, is comparatively weaker; the dirty bomb narrative did not feature clear threats or demands and U.S. officials did not observe any unusual movements of Russia’s nuclear forces — behavior that one might expect if the Kremlin sought to credibly threaten nuclear escalation. While it is more difficult to assess the “distraction” and “domestic signaling” explanations from open sources, the latter has historical precedent. Putin has fabricated foreign threats to rally support for his wars in the past and had planned to do so to justify his invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crisis-management-under-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Crisis Management under Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 2022 crisis underscores an enduring dilemma the United States is likely to face in future nuclear crises: how to make decisions about escalation and de-escalation based on ambiguous signals from adversaries. While uncertainty is not new for U.S. policymakers, in October 2022, the Biden administration fundamentally did not understand if or how the dirty bomb narrative related to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or if it was intended as a nuclear signal. The causes for this unusual degree of ambiguity are not fully clear, but heightened nuclear tensions and sustained Russian nuclear signaling in the weeks and months prior were important pieces of context that muddied the waters and raised questions about the purpose of subsequent Russian narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years. Given the growing frequency with which key U.S. adversaries rattle the nuclear saber, the sometimes ambiguous nature of their signaling, and the difficulties that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking, U.S. leaders should prepare to navigate future nuclear crises with limited understandings of adversary intentions and objectives. The context and specifics of future crises will differ but, as in October 2022, there will be a range of plausible explanations for adversary signaling. Given this, three principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beware-inadvertent-escalation&quot;&gt;Beware Inadvertent Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When facing uncertainty about the motivations for adversary nuclear rhetoric or posturing, U.S. leaders should refrain from actions that the adversary may misinterpret and respond to with escalation. Measures that the United States has taken to demonstrate resolve in past crises, such as bomber patrols, alerts, and missile tests, can carry unseen risks when the adversary’s motivations are unknown. If, for example, an adversary’s nuclear signaling is driven by concerns about U.S. or allied intentions, they may interpret U.S. nuclear posturing as confirmation that that an attack is imminent. The United States’ response to Russia’s dirty bomb allegations consisted almost entirely of verbal statements and back-channel diplomacy, thus avoiding actions that could have provoked inadvertent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-adversary-can-be-wrong&quot;&gt;The Adversary Can Be Wrong&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to assume the worst when faced with deep uncertainty about adversaries’ intentions. U.S. leaders should keep in mind that U.S. adversaries are fallible, and that their confusing behavior might be the product of faulty assumptions or poor information. The dirty bomb scare may have reflected sincere concern on the part of Russia’s leaders resulting from flawed intelligence; it is impossible to be sure. U.S. policymakers should resist the urge to interpret adversary rhetoric and posturing through the lens of worst-case thinking and should consider all possible explanations when weighing how to respond to ambiguous signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-is-cheap&quot;&gt;Diplomacy Is Cheap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building international pressure against nuclear use is a relatively cheap, risk-free tool to pressure adversaries to either de-escalate or clarify their signaling. The United States made good use of this tool during the October 2022 crisis, when it encouraged India and China to publicly oppose nuclear use in Ukraine. U.S. officials later asserted that Indian and Chinese pressure helped to deter Putin from using nuclear weapons. Going forward, diplomatic outreach to influential third parties should be a tool of first resort during periods of heightened nuclear risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-for-the-next-nuclear-crisis&quot;&gt;Preparing for the Next Nuclear Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To crystallize the lessons of the October 2022 crisis, the incoming administration should establish an interagency planning group — modeled after the Ukraine Tiger Team created in 2021 — to game out whole-of-government responses to a wide range of nuclear contingencies. The group should consider potential crises in both the Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe, and should plan for scenarios short of nuclear use, including periods of acute nuclear tension and ambiguous adversary signaling. Further, the group should consider the challenges posed by opportunistic aggression and plan out responses to scenarios involving multiple simultaneous or successive nuclear crises across different theaters. Given that future nuclear crises will almost certainly involve allied forces, territory, or interests, it will be crucial to involve allies in the planning process. While the circumstances of future crises will vary and contingency plans developed today will inevitably lose relevance over time, a rigorous planning process may yield durable crisis management insights that can help future administrations avoid the planning crunch that the Biden administration faced in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

The shock represented a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of the resilience of Europe’s democratic political system and market economies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Europe’s strong response has demonstrated that an accelerated energy transition is possible amid strong political and economic headwinds when backed by a broad popular consensus for ambitious action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reckoned with the false promise of its long-standing energy interdependence with Russia, as the energy sector has been central to Putin’s consolidation of power inside of Russia and has been weaponized in the Kremlin’s engagement with neighboring countries. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As imports of Russian fossil fuels fell precipitously after Russia’s invasion, EU members took ambitious steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and develop alternatives to Russian imports. Coal-fired power plants were temporarily revived, policies to phase out nuclear power were revisited, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased significantly, transatlantic coordination redirected liquified natural gas volumes toward Europe, and renewables were dramatically expanded. EU institutions were instrumental in overseeing a unified response and set the direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy over time to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe emerged from the crisis as a stronger energy actor, challenges remain in areas spanning electricity market reform to hydrogen diplomacy to protecting critical undersea infrastructure. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But this energy is largely coming from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources will be higher and therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness. Furthermore, as Europe accelerates its green transition, it must address the risk posed by increasing import dependencies in clean tech supply chains, particularly from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe’s democracies and markets proved resilient to shocks, Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states into ceding support for Ukraine, and the European Union proved its geopolitical mettle amid a potentially devastating crisis. However, the crisis also left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more anti-establishment parties, many of which may seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered an energy crisis in Europe unmatched in severity since the oil shock of the 1970s. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. How Europe responded to this crisis explains much about the European project, the energy transition, and the nature of energy security in a new era of profound geopolitical competition and upheaval. Europe has demonstrated that a rapid energy transition is possible in the face of an urgent need and when backed by strong political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more than two years since the start of the war, Europe’s energy mix and energy map have changed dramatically. Europe today appears not only more energy resilient than before the crisis, but also just as intent on achieving an energy transition that will be responsive to climate change and that will reduce its external dependencies and improve competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reduced Russian fossil fuel imports from $16 billion per month in early 2022 to around $1 billion per month by the end of 2023, with cuts to oil imports representing the main driver of the decline. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Russia has decisively proven itself to be an unreliable supplier of energy, that will choose to weaponize its energy resources as a tool of political coercion. . . . Today we’re in an environment where Russia is never again going to be seen as a reliable supplier of energy. And where Europe’s transition away from Russian energy has progressed much faster than predicted and marks a really permanent shift in the international energy map.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-geoffrey-r-pyatt-us-assistant-secretary-for-energy-resources&quot;&gt;— Geoffrey R. Pyatt, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that European leaders did everything right or that this transition was inexpensive. The loss of Russian supplies amid the war disproved decades of belief that interdependence would secure peace. Disbelief in Europe’s capacity to manage the crisis may also have prevented even bolder action against the Russian energy sector in the early stages of the war, blunting the effects on the Russian economy. Even today, Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) and piped gas are still part of Europe’s energy mix, and Europe remains dependent on Russia for nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. According to Bruegel estimates, from the beginning of the crisis in September 2021 until June 2023, €651 billion was allocated and earmarked across European countries to shield consumers from rising energy costs. The loss of a relatively cheap and seemingly stable supply of Russian natural gas has significant implications for industrial competitiveness, and for the German economy in particular. Longer-term issues related to persistently elevated prices and the implications for the European Union’s competitiveness will still have to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no doubt that geopolitics and political stability is a prerequisite for energy security, and vice versa. This was a hard lesson we learned in Europe from the recent geopolitical and energy crises and came at high cost. It pushed us to reconsider the definition of security of supply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine; however, these were unfounded. As European households turned down their thermostats in the winter of 2022–23 and paid, on average, 14 percent more for electricity and 114 percent more for gas to heat their homes from the first half of 2021 to October 2022, they knew Russia was to blame for the crisis, and support for Ukraine remained high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European project has advanced in this crisis. European governments worked together through the European Union to adopt sanctions and construct a crisis energy plan. The European Union leveraged the resources it borrowed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic to help countries cope and established an effort to procure LNG on behalf of the bloc. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis. The situation demonstrates not only that the European Union is forged in crisis but also that the union enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic relations also strengthened as U.S.-EU cooperation on energy and sanctions significantly increased. U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship — a relationship that historically has been strained or limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviews Europe’s response to the energy shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chapter 1 sets the stage by examining the European energy system and approach to energy security prior to the invasion. Chapter 2 outlines how Russia weaponized energy and details the challenges posed to Europe’s energy supply in 2022. Chapter 3 outlines Europe’s response to the crisis, including the steps it and its partners have taken, and its effort to decouple from Russian energy. Chapter 4 examines the postcrisis policy landscape and identifies current and future challenges for Europe. Chapter 5 offers some thoughts on lessons learned from the crisis. Chapter 6 provides some concluding thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-perspective-on-european-energy-strategy&quot;&gt;Historical Perspective on European Energy Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link between energy and security has been at the heart of the European project since its inception after World War II. The creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 — involving France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — marked the first attempt at integrating European markets after the war. Coal and steel were the focus because these sectors were critical to waging war. Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister and the ECSC’s principal architect, noted that “the solidarity in production” from pooling coal and steel production would make “any war between France and Germany . . . not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.” As a catalyst of European integration, energy is core to the conception of the European Union as a project that brought peace to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while energy was an initial focus for European integration, it was largely pushed to the side as European integration marched forward through the decades. Although energy market integration was continuously discussed over the following decades, the focus for policymakers was squarely on the security of supply. That meant European energy integration made limited advances relative to the extensive economic and political integration Europe would experience; energy policy would remain the domain of Europe’s national governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until the 1980s, when policymakers shifted their focus to forging a single European market, that European energy integration was considered. A 1988 European Commission working paper conceptualized the idea of a functioning internal energy market, recognizing the need to harmonize rules and technical norms, liberalize public procurement, and remove fiscal barriers such as diverging tax laws. However, the recommendations set forth in the working paper were met with widespread opposition, as they sought to uproot markets with entrenched incumbents enjoying both national and natural monopolies. Although the commission continued developing plans for greater energy integration and liberalization in the 1990s, once again no energy chapter was included in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which formed the European Union. Member states vetoed efforts to include energy in the treaty, wishing to retain control over their national energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, the European Union took incremental steps to create an internal energy market. Between 1996 and 1998, the European Parliament passed its First Energy Package directives on the electricity and gas markets, which were weaker versions of the commission proposals that member states in the European Council had rejected. However, according to Joseph Dutton, “Nevertheless they substantially bolstered the moves towards an internal marketplace and attempted to remove ‘legal monopolies’ and obliged vertically integrated companies to grant third party access to networks.” Yet the range of transmission systems and lack of cross-border infrastructure linkages hindered formation of an internal European market. In the 2000s, environmental policy became much more of a focus, and the European Union continued to pass regulations to address friction in the internal market. In 2019, the European Union adopted its Fourth Energy Package, which strengthened the role of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators in facilitating cross-border cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress, Europe entered the 2022 energy crisis, 50 years after the Middle East oil embargoes of the 1970s, far from achieving a true energy union. From a regulatory point of view, the energy sector had been liberalized by eliminating monopolies, implementing unbundling rules, and opening access to infrastructure to competitors. However, implementation of these rules often had limited success due to strong resistance. Legacy monopoly companies still had a dominant market position, and the development of interconnections, both gas and electricity, was in many cases insufficient to guarantee an integrated and functional cross-border market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-false-promise-of-energy-interdependence-with-russia&quot;&gt;The False Promise of Energy Interdependence with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the main threat to European security was seemingly gone. Not only could Europeans enjoy a peace dividend and shrink their defense budgets, but engagement with Russia could seemingly strengthen Europe’s energy security as well. There was vast potential in the Russian energy sector, not only to strengthen links with Europe’s advanced economies but also to invest and modernize these Russian industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from Europe’s postwar experience, the hypothesis of change through trade (Wandel durch Handel) — mostly associated with German foreign policy — gave a strategic rationale for deepening European energy integration with Russia. EU leaders believed interdependence would bring trading partners closer to European values and practices. Thus, buying Russian energy and investing in the Russian energy sector not only were good for Europe economically but also would serve to keep Russia on the democratic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaws in the “change through trade” strategy became apparent well before Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The energy sector has been central to Putin’s Russia since he came to office in 2000; it was essential to his consolidation of power inside Russia and a key part of Russian foreign policy. Upon becoming president in 2000, Putin sought to exert control over the energy sector, leading to confrontations with Russian oligarchs such as the head of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested after questioning the illiberalism of the Putin regime. Putin has personally selected the heads of Russian energy companies, such as Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. There are numerous accounts of Putin demonstrating to Western officials and businesspeople his in-depth understanding of energy markets. For example, Daniel Yergin writes in The New Map that Putin “understood the power that came from Russia’s oil and gas. Western interlocutors would be consistently surprised by his detailed knowledge of the energy industry and energy markets and the fluency with which he discussed the intricacies — as much like a CEO, they would say, as a head of state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia repeatedly weaponized energy resources in its engagement with neighboring countries. Gazprom threatened to cut the supply of gas to Ukraine in 2005 when Ukraine refused to accept a fivefold price increase. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Georgia, disruptions in gas flows forced the Georgian government to ration supplies. In the week following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, Gazprom hiked the price of gas exports to Ukraine from $268.50 per thousand cubic meters (mcm) to $385.50 per mcm, and ultimately to $485.00 per mcm. Russia has also provided gas cost-free to the breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s energy blackmail of former Soviet countries failed to induce a serious reassessment of European energy security. On the one hand, Russia’s tactics were not seen as applicable to Europe given its market size. On the other hand, many European leaders and businesses struggled to see an alternative, especially since U.S. LNG exports to Europe were insignificant in volume, renewables were still largely aspirational, nuclear power suffered from deep negative connotations, and coal had stark climate ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s faith in mutual interdependence, however, failed to recognize that Putin’s Russia had consistently prioritized geopolitical advancement over the health of its economy. Yet Russia believed Europe’s priorities were the opposite: European leaders and societies would put their economic well-being ahead of geopolitics. The long-held Soviet-era perception of the decadent, capitalist West caring only about profit remains deeply rooted in the Kremlin today. As such, as Russian forces amassed on Ukraine’s borders, Putin likely believed he had leverage. Russia could absorb the economic and political hit caused by an energy shock, whereas European leaders could not; therefore, Europe’s response to the invasion would be performative and limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-european-gas-markets-and-integration-with-russia&quot;&gt;Development of European Gas Markets and Integration with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has consistently been dependent on energy imports, particularly oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. The data shows that energy import dependency has grown since 1990 (see Figure 1). In 2021, 91.7 percent of EU energy demand for oil and petroleum products and 83.4 percent of demand for natural gas were covered by extra-EU imports. By 2021, a significant share of EU imports came from Russia, including 45 percent of total gas imports and nearly half of total coal imports. At that time, more than half of Russia’s oil exports were also directed to Europe, which accounted for about one-third of Europe’s total oil imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the gas infrastructure connecting Russia to Europe has been the clearest symbol of Russia’s status as a fossil fuel superpower and its influence over Europe. The geopolitics of these gas pipelines has historically been complex for the European Union and its member states, given their diverging interests and outlooks as well as historical ties to Russia (the first pipelines date to the 1960s). After the Cold War, and thanks to an effective commercial diplomacy campaign, Gazprom established new infrastructure projects (TurkStream and Nord Stream), which made it possible to circumvent transit countries identified as problematic — mostly Ukraine and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No energy infrastructure project reflected this development better than the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting western Russia with Germany via the Baltic Sea. Established by a consortium led by Gazprom and operational since 2011, Nord Stream 1 had a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm), equivalent to roughly a third of EU gas imports from Russia in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine occurred in March 2014 when it annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Despite these evolving security and geopolitical realities, Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie reached a commercial agreement roughly a year later over Nord Stream 2, a second gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany. However, extensive legal battles and U.S. sanctions beginning in 2019 significantly delayed construction of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backers of the pipeline projects, which included the Russian government and high-profile German politicians from the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party argued that they would ensure stability of supply by connecting Europe with the world’s largest gas reserves in Russia while supporting the continent’s sustainability goals as a less carbon-intensive complement than coal to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opponents, which included the United States, various environmental groups, several other German politicians, and many of the Eastern European countries most exposed to Russian aggression, claimed that the projects would lock in dependence on Russia, enable Russia to extort Ukraine, be harmful to marine ecosystems, and undermine Europe’s green transition. Despite attempts by supporters to frame the projects as a strictly commercial undertaking, opponents argued that an overreliance on Russian gas would leave Europe at the Kremlin’s mercy and susceptible to energy blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“You should probably underscore that Europe is not as uniform as we might often think. . . . There’s the UK versus EU, but there’s also the Western versus Eastern Europe, or the post-Soviet Europe, which in my view has seen energy security, from the perspective of dependence on Russia, very differently than the West.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nord Stream pipelines were thus largely a German story. Germany is the largest EU country in terms of the size of its population and economy. Its economic weight is disproportionate, representing a quarter of overall EU gross domestic product (GDP). While efforts were made (and sometimes are still made) to portray Nord Stream 2 as a European project, it was driven by German commercial, economic, and political interests. During a visit to St. Petersburg in November 2017, German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel affirmed German support for the project. He stated, “Now is a good time for us to intensify our economic cooperation. We’ve always known Russia as an especially reliable gas supplier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the interconnected European gas network and markets meant that Russian natural gas could also make its way to France, the Netherlands, and other European states and influence their energy systems. The availability of low-priced supply made it easier for the Netherlands to close its Groningen gas field given local earthquake concerns. While the United States undertook a shale gas revolution, European gas production declined dramatically in the last decade, in large part due to the perceived stability and low cost of Russian supply. Private investment in European gas production made little sense given the economic headwinds of Russian gas and the political headwinds of climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Germany’s broader energy policies compounded the energy security risks of a strategic bet on Russian piped gas. Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power stands out. While nuclear power supplied a quarter of Germany’s electricity demand a decade ago, today no nuclear power plants remain operational. Availability of cheap Russian gas enabled the economic feasibility of this nuclear phaseout as gas generation and renewables replaced lost nuclear generation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large contribution by nuclear power was controversial, as public support for it has eroded since the 1980s. By 2002, public pressure brought forth a law mandating the closure of Germany’s entire fleet of nuclear power plants. The 2011 Fukushima accident unleashed significant blowback on German chancellor Angela Merkel, until then a staunch supporter of nuclear power, and catalyzed previously stalled implementation of the 2002 law. For example, Merkel ally and long-time defender of atomic energy Stefan Mappus lost the state premier position as an incumbent in Baden-Württemberg, an otherwise conservative state, to a challenger from the Green Party. Three months later, the Bundestag agreed to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Although the shutdown was delayed in October 2022 for several months due to energy security concerns related to the war in Ukraine, Germany’s last nuclear power plant disconnected from the electricity grid in April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, Russian gas pipelines supplied 41.5 percent of total EU gas imports, with a dominant position in many captive markets through long-term contracts and situations of quasi-monopoly (see Figure 2). Gazprom’s influence also extended to the commercialization and storage of its gas on European soil. Through its subsidiaries (Gazprom Germania and Gazprom Marketing and Trading), it managed a dense network of underground gas storage facilities, distribution networks, and trading companies. In 2020, Gazprom Germania had total assets of €8.4 billion and equity of €2.2 billion. In particular, Gazprom Germania had the largest gas storage capacity in the European Union, with infrastructure in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands, which gave the company a dominant position in the EU gas market. Gazprom’s influence was not limited to energy. The company’s clout extended from politics to sports through funding and sponsorship, making it a recognizable brand to many European citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has exerted significant diplomatic pressure on Germany and consistently framed the Nord Stream projects in geopolitical terms. In December 2019, U.S. president Donald Trump signed a law that would impose sanctions on any firm involved with helping Gazprom finish the pipeline into the European Union, describing the project as a “tool of coercion.” Even then, the U.S. Department of State highlighted the adverse implications for Ukraine, noting that Nord Stream 2 “would enable Russia to bypass Ukraine for gas transit to Europe, which would deprive Ukraine of substantial transit revenues and increase its vulnerability to Russian aggression.” However, critics of Washington’s approach often interpreted U.S. geopolitical pressure as partly a cynical effort to advance the U.S. LNG industry. The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden continued opposition to Russian gas. In March 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the pipeline as “a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nord Stream 2 was one of the most prominent issues in Chancellor Merkel’s final visit to Washington in July 2021. On that visit, President Biden agreed not to sanction German companies participating in the project, stating, “Good friends can disagree . . . but by the time I became President, it was 90 percent completed. And imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense.” This was seen as a major concession to the chancellor and drew significant political blowback from both sides of the aisle in Washington. By September 2021, the construction of Nord Stream 2 had been completed, awaiting only certification from German regulators to begin operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was not simply a case of the dependence of Germany, Europe’s largest economy. Given its position in Europe, Germany was effectively imposing dependence on the rest of Europe. Eastern European countries, whose energy systems were built to integrate with Russia’s, were also heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies. Poland, one of the most vocal countries about the threat posed by Russia, received 46 percent of its natural gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia in 2022, according to the think tank Forum Energii. Latvia was 100 percent dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. Changing course in Europe’s broader energy strategy would become too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as more than 100,000 Russian forces surrounded Ukraine in the autumn of 2021, Europe found itself utterly dependent on Russia for its energy security. For example, at the time Germany lacked any LNG import capacity. In 2022, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and with Nord Stream 2 set to open, that dependence was likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precrisis-energy-transition-plans&quot;&gt;Precrisis Energy Transition Plans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decade before Russia’s invasion, European energy policy prioritized the energy transition over energy security considerations. In 2019, the European Commission unveiled the European Green Deal, organized around the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The new climate strategy sought to transform the European Union into a “modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the Green Deal’s ambitious climate objectives in the energy sector took the form of the Fit for 55 package presented by the European Commission in July 2021. The package translated into law the Green Deal’s goal of reducing EU-wide emissions by 55 percent by 2030. This package increased renewable energy targets, approved the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and expanded the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously missing were provisions advancing energy security. Arriving just prior to the start of the crisis, these policies effectively demonstrated the EU policymaking community’s underweighting of energy security in favor of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBATES OVER NUCLEAR, GAS, AND COAL: PHASEOUTS AND GREEN TAXONOMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity-generation resource mix naturally impacts policy considerations in both climate and energy security. However, precrisis European policy debates on the subject primarily revolved around climate. Policymakers generally favored renewable energy expansion in the form of wind and solar as the primary locus for energy investment and as the primary vehicle for Europe’s green transition. Implicit in this model was a large, albeit eventually declining, role for natural gas as a balancing resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first half of 2021, as Russia was laying the groundwork for its invasion, European energy policymakers were engaged in a fierce political debate over the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This labeling system, commonly referred to as the “green taxonomy,” guides investors toward economic activities that are compatible with EU climate goals. Such labels are significant given that the European Union intends to mobilize at least €1 trillion in public and private sustainable investments over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many member states were staunchly opposed to nuclear power’s inclusion in the green taxonomy despite its zero-emissions profile. Austria and Luxembourg threatened legal action to block the commission’s proposal to include nuclear power. The German governing coalition was fractured on the issue: the Greens pushed heavily to reject nuclear power and sought to follow Austria’s example by also filing suit. The antinuclear position was opposed by France and other states heavily reliant on nuclear power. Meanwhile, Germany was keen to include natural gas in the taxonomy given the heavy role it plays in its energy system at present and over the long term as a balancing resource in a renewables-heavy grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debate revealed that much of Europe, with German policymakers at the head of this coalition, did not value the ability of nuclear power to provide firm (nonintermittent) carbon-free electricity in place of natural gas–fired generation. It was believed that a renewables-heavy mix paired with natural gas was the optimal system design for Europe and did not consider the security and economic risks of reliance on Russia to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, well into the energy crisis, the European Parliament backed the inclusion of investments in gas and nuclear power plants in the green taxonomy. In the case of gas, this inclusion was predicated on quite strict emissions intensity standards and low- or no-carbon fuel (e.g., hydrogen) readiness. The move was widely seen as an attempt to placate both Germany’s attachment to natural gas as a transition technology and France’s view that nuclear should be classified as a green technology. In the end, no legal moves were taken to block this settlement; only a minority of countries, including Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and Spain, voiced criticism at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green taxonomy debate highlights the deep division in Europe over the role of nuclear power despite its emissions-free profile. In the years preceding the energy crisis, many member states laid out plans to phase out or reduce the share of nuclear energy in their electricity mix, with some even imposing bans on new nuclear generation. Broadly, precrisis Europe saw a limited role for nuclear power in the energy transition. Most notable, of course, was Germany’s long-running commitment to eliminate all nuclear power. Even France, the continent’s leader on nuclear energy, had been considering a cap on the contribution of nuclear energy to its electricity supply, a policy that would lead to early plant retirements and effectively stunt the build-out of new reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal-fired power, once the starting point for European integration, was broadly expected to be phased out of the European energy system. The Green Deal’s renewables deployment targets, coupled with the bloc’s price on carbon and tightening pollution regulations, have exerted economic pressure on coal power plants, forcing many to shut down. At the EU level, there are no direct mandates to phase out coal consumption, although many member states have established their own timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 2024, a total of 23 countries had announced their intent to phase out coal — with four of them (Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden) achieving the phaseout. France expected to see all of its coal plants close by the end of 2022, barring a loophole that would have allowed coal plants to burn a mix of coal and biomass to stay online. While 12 countries aimed to be coal-free before 2030, another seven countries had set their goals to phase out coal after 2030. The least ambitious targets were set by Bulgaria, which aimed to exit coal between 2038 and 2040, and Germany. Berlin’s goal of a coal exit by 2038 has been heavily criticized as “too weak” and deemed incompatible with the Paris Agreement by German civil society groups. In July 2021, Germany’s supreme court ruled that the government would have to strengthen its 2030 climate targets — including its coal exit — by the end of 2022. A few months after the ruling, the ascendant ruling coalition released a proposal to bring forward Germany’s coal exit to 2030. At the other end of the spectrum, some European countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Poland, Serbia, and Turkey) have not entertained a coal phaseout target at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preinvasion-gas-market-disruptions&quot;&gt;Preinvasion Gas Market Disruptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European energy crisis began in August 2021 with the first signs of Russian manipulation of natural gas. In August, Gazprom dramatically cut gas flows through the Yamal pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Poland, ostensibly due to a fire at a gas processing facility in western Siberia. Through 2021, Gazprom’s deliveries of natural gas remained at minimum levels despite the recovery of both gas demand and prices in the European Union following the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In another example of targeted supply restrictions, Gazprom booked only 4 percent of the additional guaranteed transit capacity Ukraine offered for September. With a return of healthy demand for gas, these supply limitations sent prices surging across European gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of its long-term contracts and its traditional role as a low-cost swing supplier allowed Gazprom to effectively manipulate the European gas market. Gazprom contracts were usually governed by a take-or-pay clause, which ensured very high compensation to the seller from the buyer if gas deliveries were not accepted as set out in the long-term agreement. These contracts offered both buyer and supplier a degree of discretion in the total volumes to be delivered, allowing a percentage of gas supplies to be adjusted according to circumstances, mainly demand and price outlooks. As the Covid-19 crisis faded in 2021, Russia consistently delivered the minimum volumes allowed in the long-term contracts, a legal maneuver that reduced supplies throughout the European Union and forced procurement from higher-priced import sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throttling of gas flows into Europe through 2021 left analysts perplexed. A CNBC story from August 2021 ran with the headline “Russia Is Pumping A Lot Less Natural Gas to Europe All of Sudden — and It Is Not Clear Why.” Tom Marzec-Manser, the lead European gas analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, hypothesized that Russia was applying pressure on Europe to certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: “Gazprom is readying itself for starting Nord Stream 2 and it is hoping to exert an element of leverage in terms of trying to make sure that when all the regulatory t’s get crossed and i’s get dotted, that that process is as swift as possible. . . . If there is less gas around than normal and the price is high then it may streamline that process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government also saw little reason for concern. A now declassified October 2021 top-secret security assessment of Nord Stream 2 by the German government found little risk of certifying the pipeline: “Overall, the assessment comes to the conclusion that the granting of certification [for Nord Stream 2] does not jeopardize the security of gas supply in Germany and the European Union.” It added that “for both the German and neighboring markets, the risk of serious impairments to supply security due to the failure of individual import supply infrastructures is very limited.” When assessing the chance that flows from the pipeline could give Russia leverage, it found that “gas deliveries from the Soviet Union and later from Russia to Germany have been reliable and contractual for decades, even in times of political tension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WLOJPdE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Natural Gas Prices across U.S., EU, and Asian Reference Indexes, 2016–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Research/commodity-prices&quot;&gt;“IMF Primary Commodity Prices,” International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazprom initially claimed that the reduction in deliveries was due to technical reasons associated with drilling well closures sourced from the period of lower demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the systematic emptying of Gazprom-controlled gas storage facilities in Europe was, in retrospect, likely part of a geo-economic coercion strategy to prepare for the invasion of Ukraine. By exporting the minimum quantity of gas permitted by long-term contracts and suspending sales on the spot market, Russia placed the European market under significant duress, resulting in record-high pricing in August 2021. Furthermore, the natural gas price differential between the U.S. Henry Hub index and the European TTF index had already reached record highs (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, U.S. intelligence agencies sounded the alarm that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent. Russia had moved significant forces and sophisticated weaponry near its border with Ukraine. American analysts cited by the New York Times suggested that Putin saw the coming months as a unique window of opportunity, with rising gas prices making Europe more dependent on cheap Russian supplies and Merkel’s imminent departure from the chancellorship limiting the future pressure on Ukraine to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-invades&quot;&gt;Russia Invades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 initiated the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II and indicated that the unusual gas market developments of 2021 were not merely due to commercial or engineering causes. The invasion caused a major economic and political upheaval in European capitals and elevated the security of Europe’s energy supply to the top of the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the invasion, German chancellor Olaf Scholz gave his now famous Zeitenwende speech, which not only called for a massive increase in German military spending but also suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Additionally, the United States and European Union responded quickly with surprisingly robust sanctions, which included the dramatic step of freezing Russian assets in the global financial system. In June 2022, the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs Task Force, comprising top finance and justice officials from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Commission, announced it had blocked $30 billion in assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and officials and immobilized $300 billion owned by the Russian central bank. Notably, no sanctions on Russian energy imports were included. Furthermore, Russian gas continued to flow into Europe via Nord Stream 1 and other pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of energy market sanctions, the market feared that sanctions would come, and forward gas and power prices soared on March 7. Seeking to ease market impacts, European leaders quickly downplayed the likelihood of such a sanctions package. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte noted that cutting off Russian oil and gas supplies would be unsustainable for EU member states “because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth.” Chancellor Scholz also vigorously pushed back on calls to ban imports of Russian gas and oil. While Berlin agreed to halt the Nord Stream 2 project following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Scholz emphasized that importing energy from Russia was an economic necessity. In a statement, the German leader noted, “At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Democratic Party’s junior coalition partner, the Green Party, supported Scholz’s position. In other words, fears of widespread economic calamity among many of Europe’s most powerful countries resulted in a cautious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quickly emergent issue for European policymakers was the difficulty in correctly assessing the impact of the crisis due to a lack of Europe-wide data. As Bruegel found, “Technical questions on the EU’s ability to survive without Russian natural gas and oil were clouded by an absence of data on the volumes and routes through which Russian fossil fuels were entering the EU.” European businesses were also sounding the alarm. A report from the Kiel Institute predicted a “sharp recession” if Germany were to cut itself off from Russian gas. German businesses reacted with horror at the prospect of a potential European embargo on Russian fossil fuels. At the end of March 2022, the head of German chemicals giant BASF asked rhetorically, “Do we knowingly want to destroy our entire economy?” There was a prevailing sense that the German economy might suffer a dramatic economic contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several economists disputed these concerns in a prominent paper produced in the weeks after the invasion. They concluded that ending European purchases of Russian energy would entail “substantial but manageable” economic cost for the German economy. This assessment was prescient, as Russian pipeline gas flows would dramatically decline that summer due to sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. In a retrospective analysis, two of the original authors, Benjamin Moll and Moritz Schularick, and Bruegel senior fellow Georg Zachmann concluded, “The German economy successfully adapted to the cut-off of natural gas from Russia last year, suggesting that Germany could have moved more swiftly to sanction Russia after it invaded Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was also wary of energy sanctions. A total embargo on Russian oil exports would likely lead to a surge in global oil prices, drive U.S. domestic gasoline prices up, and accelerate the inflationary pressure hampering the global economy. There was also clear concern among certain Central and Eastern European states, whose energy infrastructure was less integrated with their European neighbors and therefore more dependent on Russian energy. For example, when EU import bans on Russian coal, seaborne crude oil shipments, and refined oil products eventually went into effect in August 2022, December 2022, and February 2023, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia secured exemptions to certain oil products. Without these exemptions, reaching consensus at the European Union, which is required for sanctions, would have been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the European Union ended up passing two sanctions packages on February 23 and February 25, 2022, which focused on limiting technology transfers and disrupting the Russian financial system but did not directly target imports of Russian fossil fuels. The rationale behind these sanctions was to limit Russia’s access to funds derived from hydrocarbon sales while maintaining its supply to the European Union in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin announced in March 2022 that hostile countries would have to pay for gas in rubles in a two-phase payment system (euros and rubles) using Gazprombank. The European Commission opted for flexibility, allowing European companies to choose between continuing with their long-term contracts using this new mechanism or unilaterally rescinding them. As a result, many European utilities suspended their contracts, provoking a decrease in gas flows from Russia. In particular, Poland and Bulgaria refused to pay for imports in rubles, leading to the closure of the Yamal gas pipeline running through Poland to Germany and ceasing Russian exports of gas to Bulgaria, which was particularly dependent on Russian supplies. The Bulgarian economy was especially exposed to the energy shock given its heavy reliance on fossil fuels — specifically, coal for electricity generation and crude oil products for transportation. After the state-owned domestic gas supplier Bulgargaz refused to accept a rubles-based payment scheme, Gazprom unilaterally suspended deliveries in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the summer of 2022, Gazprom increased its pressure on the EU gas market, intermittently reducing flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Again, Gazprom gave cover explanations, this time stating that technical disruptions to key equipment repairs were due to Western sanctions. By June, surging energy prices (Figure 4) were beginning to cause a cost-of-living crisis affecting people and businesses across the European Union. The economic impacts placed political pressure on European leaders. In a televised interview marking Bastille Day, French president Emmanuel Macron warned his constituents to prepare for a complete cutoff of Russian natural gas, advanced initiatives to diversify the French energy mix, and spoke of a national “sobriety plan” to conserve energy. German economy and climate minister Robert Habeck said in June 2022, “It’s a tense, serious situation. . . . It must be acknowledged that Putin is reducing the gas supply to Europe bit by bit, also to drive up the price, and we must respond with our measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORD STREAM SABOTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 26, 2022, two underwater explosions damaged three of the four pipelines that constituted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines off the Danish island of Bornholm (the latter was completed in 2021 but was not in operation). The sabotage, whose perpetrators have not yet been identified, left the infrastructure inoperable, closing the main gas supply line between Russia and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence warranting conclusive attribution, two schools of thought have emerged pointing to either Russian- or Ukrainian-backed groups as the perpetrators. The circumstantial evidence in the immediate aftermath pointed toward the Kremlin. Russia’s Baltic fleet, capable of deploying divers and miniature submarines, is based in Kaliningrad, just 300 kilometers from the sabotaged pipelines. The incident occurred a day before a new pipeline was completed to connect Poland with Norwegian gas via Denmark in an effort to reduce Warsaw’s reliance on Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another narrative that subsequently gained traction centers on Ukrainian involvement. Ukraine has carried out a number of dramatic intelligence operations since the war began, some of which have roiled Ukraine’s backers, such as the assassination of Russian television commentator Daria Dugina. Kyiv, which long opposed the pipelines, may have feared Russia could successfully blackmail Germany and others to reduce their support for Ukraine. In March 2023, German media carried a report that German police had traced a yacht thought to have been used to transport explosives to the sabotage site to two Ukrainian nationals. These reports aligned with New York Times reporting that U.S. intelligence officials suspected involvement by renegade pro-Ukrainian groups. Although German authorities are still investigating the explosions, Denmark’s and Sweden’s public prosecutors closed their inquiries into the explosions in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever was responsible, the attack eliminated Russian gas flows to Germany, led to sharp increases in energy prices, and firmly demonstrated that Europe’s energy links to Russia could not be isolated from the broader geopolitical conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-perfect-storm-overlapping-crises-in-electricity-markets&quot;&gt;The Perfect Storm: Overlapping Crises in Electricity Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis in the European natural gas sector intersected with two incidental factors — a severe continental drought and the poor performance of the French nuclear fleet — to cause a matching crisis in the European electricity sector. Electricity markets saw prices reach historic levels, which devastated consumers, destabilized energy companies, and raised serious resource adequacy concerns. Heading into the winter of 2022–23, system planners and political leadership publicly warned of the risk of load shedding, a process by which consumers are intermittently disconnected to preserve overall system stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DROUGHT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, severe drought, characterized as the worst in 500 years, simultaneously affected the Mediterranean basin, Central Europe, and the Nordic countries. Lack of rainfall severely reduced the generation output of many hydroelectric dams, which represent roughly 16 percent of total European generation capacity. In 2021, these generation assets produced 805 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, representing 17 percent of all production; only gas-fired generation (26 percent) and nuclear-fired generation (23 percent) contributed a larger share. Drought conditions in 2022 caused hydroelectric generation to fall 15 percent year over year to only 687 TWh, the lowest level since 2011, despite the very strong financial incentive of record-breaking spot prices to produce at maximum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drought further affected the electricity sector by reducing water levels in European rivers. The conditions restricted navigability by barge and, in some cases, interrupted delivery of fuel to coal-fired power plants on the Rhine, taking additional generation capacity out of the system. In France, low water levels caused restrictions on the discharge of cooling water by nuclear power plants, causing Électricité de France (EDF), the French nuclear operator, to take plants offline or reduce output. Eventually, this problem was partially mitigated when the relevant environmental agency granted waivers at the government’s behest on the basis of public necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FRENCH NUCLEAR OUTAGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France possesses the largest nuclear power fleet in Europe by a wide margin: 61 gigawatts (GW) of production capacity spread out over 56 reactors, dwarfing the next-largest fleets in Ukraine (14 GW) and the United Kingdom (8 GW). This fleet typically supplies over 70 percent of France’s electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As gas and electric prices surged through early 2022, the French nuclear fleet was rocked by the discovery of widespread stress corrosion cracking. Problems similar to those initially identified at a single plant were soon discovered at numerous others, forcing EDF to take several plants offline. These events coincided with prescheduled and unavoidable 10-year maintenance outages. In total, an unprecedented number of nuclear reactors were taken offline just when the French and broader European electric grid needed them most. The nadir of French nuclear output occurred in July–August 2022, when only 18 TWh was generated out of a possible 45 TWh, a 40 percent capacity utilization rate. On an annual basis, 2022 was the worst performance in decades, with output falling over 22 percent versus 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although France typically exported electricity to its neighbors, the combination of drought and nuclear outages made it a net importer of electricity for the first time in 42 years. Rather than support supply deficits in neighboring nations such as Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, it drew on power from these nations, exacerbating supply shortages and high prices in those countries. However, this result demonstrated the value of an integrated electricity system linked both physically with transmission capacity and commercially with liquid and dynamic market mechanisms. Such integration allows the sharing of generation resources, which improves overall system reliability and brings down the cost of achieving that reliability. Without this integration, France would likely have been forced into economically and socially painful cuts to electricity in the summer of 2022 and winter of 2022–23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HISTORIC PRICE VOLATILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices in the European electricity market reached record highs through 2022. Drought and nuclear outages knocked low-priced baseload capacity out of the supply stack. The crisis in the gas market meant gas-fired generation capacity struggled to secure fuel. Plants that could secure fuel did so at exorbitant prices, which meant that the electricity they produced was offered on electricity markets at a steep premium. Additionally, carbon dioxide prices in the EU Emissions Trading System market traded to historic highs, reaching a peak of €100 per ton equivalent in February 2023. Higher carbon dioxide costs borne by fossil-fired generation (i.e., coal and gas) likewise translated into higher prices offered in electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of electricity markets is crucial for understanding how these factors translate into higher electricity prices. Electricity markets are settled on the margin: Generators offer their electricity into the market and are dispatched to meet demand in order of lowest to highest offer price, a process called merit order dispatch. The offer price of the last unit dispatched, the marginal unit, is the price received by all generators (supply) and the price paid by all buyers (demand). This price formation model is used in all restructured electricity markets around the world, most notably in U.S. electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has made substantial progress on deploying renewables that produce electricity at zero marginal cost and are therefore first in merit order dispatch. However, demand levels almost always reach beyond the generation output of renewables, causing merit order dispatch to move deeper into the supply stack and dispatch fossil-fired generation to balance supply with demand. Renewables are therefore rarely the marginal unit and therefore rarely set the market-clearing spot price. Nonetheless, they play a key role in reducing overall system costs by reducing how often and deep the market must go into the supply of high-priced fossil-fired generation to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With large volumes of low-cost hydropower (first to be dispatched in the supply stack) and nuclear power out of the supply mix, gas-fired generation units priced at steep premiums set the margin in almost every country. Through this mechanism, the historically high price of natural gas translated directly into historically high prices for electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years before the crisis, average annual wholesale prices for most European countries were generally €30–€50 per megawatt-hour (MWh). By early 2022, electricity prices, tracking the movement in gas prices, had reached monthly averages of over €200 per MWh in most countries. Pricing surged higher through the summer as the combined effect of nuclear and hydroelectric underperformance drove increasing reliance on extremely high-priced gas generation. Increased power burn — or gas consumed by power plants to produce electricity — intensified pricing pressure in the gas market as buyers sought to fill gas storage facilities for the upcoming winter. This drove gas prices, and by extension electricity prices, ever higher through the summer. Peak pricing occurred in August, with most countries averaging well over €400 per MWh. Italy fared the worst, with a monthly average of €543 per MWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yearly averages for 2022 for most countries settled at triple the typical annual average of the recent past or more. The impact of such pricing on households, businesses, and the overall economy is enormous. A rough estimate serves to demonstrate the scale: In 2022, Germany consumed 540 TWh of electricity priced at an annual average price of €237 per MWh, representing an annual spend of €128 billion. Priced against the preceding five-year average of €35 per MWh, the same demand results in an annual spend of only €19 billion. Despite the introduction of various subsidy mechanisms, Greece’s electricity prices also spiked by 40 percent for industries and 24 percent for households in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gaj7JME.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of extreme pricing was not uniform. Nordic countries fared better because their power mixes relied less heavily on natural gas in favor of hydro and nuclear generation. Poland likewise has relatively low reliance on natural gas in favor of heavy reliance on coal-fired power. Portugal and Spain were notable exceptions because they introduced a gas price-capping mechanism, known as the Iberian exception, which the European Commission approved after tough discussions. This gas price cap limited the price of natural gas used for electricity generation to €40 per MWh, with the government compensating gas-fired power plants for the difference, thus successfully lowering overall electricity prices for consumers during 2022, despite indirectly increasing Spain’s gas consumption for power generation and, especially, electricity exports to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European electricity demand historically peaks through the winter months. The winter of 2022–23 posed a worrisome risk for the overall reliability of the electric power system, and officials within the European Union, national governments, and grid operators all issued warnings on the risk of load shedding or, far worse, uncontrolled blackouts. One area where Europe was fortunate is that both the winters of 2022–23 and 2023–24 were relatively mild, enabling lower energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-market-interventions&quot;&gt;Energy Market Interventions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports of Russian gas into the European Union fell precipitously from 150 bcm in 2021 to 78 bcm in 2022 and then again to 42 bcm in 2023. To enable and respond to these changes in fuel imports, EU member states took a wide range of steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and seek alternatives to Russian imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS BRIEFLY TURN TO OLD COAL POWER PLANTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis led to a temporary reactivation of coal-fired power plants to provide resource diversity and additional capacity given that gas combined-cycle plants were heavily fuel constrained. According to a report by Ember, an estimated 13.5 GW of coal-fired plants were reactivated from recent retirement or otherwise placed on standby in supply reserve facilities, increasing the EU coal fleet by 12 percent. These units contributed to increased coal burning through the crisis. For the first time since 2015, coal-fired generation output increased year over year in 2021 and again in 2022, reaching 448 TWh compared to 352 TWh of output in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, due to fortuitous winter weather outcomes and effective policy intervention at the EU and national levels in other areas, these reactivated plants saw relatively marginal utilization. By the spring of 2023, the European Union had experienced an overstock of coal in its ports, which was resold to Asia and other emerging markets. In 2023, coal-fired power generation fell relative to 2022 and returned to its long-term pattern of decline and a new EU-era low of 335 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS SEEK TO PRESERVE THEIR NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with coal generation, the energy crisis forced policymakers to revisit nuclear power policy. In the short term, postponing imminent reactor shutdowns was an option for policymakers. In January 2023, Belgium opted to extend the life of two nuclear reactors slated to close in 2025 by 10 years, until 2035. In Germany, considerable debate over the status of three recently shuttered nuclear reactors and three others in operation but scheduled for closure did not ultimately lead to policy changes. In April 2023, Germany took its last three remaining nuclear power plants offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis impacts on the nuclear power sector will likely play out over the long term as countries plan investments that shape the overall direction of their generation resource mix. French nuclear policy is demonstrative. Precrisis plans proposed phasing down nuclear power’s contribution to the overall electricity mix from over 70 percent to below 50 percent — a policy that effectively eliminates new plant builds. Postcrisis French policy has inverted the 50 percent target from an upward limit to a minimum threshold, and the government has announced plans for a new reactor-building campaign. France has also organized a coalition of European countries interested in pursuing expanded nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, nuclear power accounts for about a quarter of European energy, with about half of that coming from France. At present, France and Slovakia are the only European countries with nuclear reactors currently under construction. In March, Belgium hosted a Nuclear Energy Summit with 30 countries, a sign of the newfound political interest in nuclear power. Poland signed a $40 billion agreement with U.S. companies to construct two nuclear power plants, with three reactors each, the first opening in 2033. Polish and South Korean companies have also agreed to build additional nuclear plants in Poland. The Czech Republic is advancing plans to construct multiple new reactors for delivery in the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORWEGIAN GAS STEPS UP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased about 8 percent year over year. In 2023, Norway provided 109 bcm of natural gas from the Norwegian continental shelf to Europe. In December 2023, Norwegian gas deliveries provided 11.1 bcm (121.7 TWh) in one month, the largest amount ever provided to Europe in a single month. Norway now provides approximately 30 percent of EU natural gas and has become the largest EU gas supplier, with the United States second at approximately 19 percent. Norway has also replaced Russia’s leading role in providing gas to Germany. In 2021, Norway provided under 20 percent of Germany’s natural gas; in 2023, that figure stood at 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the European Union, Norway is a far more secure partner. Although Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is part of the European single market. Further, Norway is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and is deeply embedded in the transatlantic efforts to counter Russian aggression. Substituting Russia for Norway as Europe’s dominant supplier indicates a significant improvement in European energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precrisis preference for Russian gas was based on price. Thus, the improvement in energy security comes at a cost, as Norwegian gas is structurally more expensive. The new equilibrium is therefore not without its detractors. Some European commentators have accused Norway of profiting off of the war and Europe’s economic pain. Europe’s newfound dependence on Norway and the Norwegian energy giant Equinor has created some market concern that any disruption, such as from maintenance needs, would lead to price spikes. As a Bloomberg report surmises, “So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.” Other suppliers of piped gas, such as Algeria and Azerbaijan, have not seen a comparably significant increase in supply to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vi9tHk5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most surprising is a lack of concerted effort to increase Europe’s domestic gas production. Despite the ongoing crisis of gas supply and price, domestic gas production within the European Union has continued its downward trajectory. Between 2016 and 2023, EU gas production more than halved, primarily due to the natural depletion of fields and challenges related to political and social acceptance. Since the invasion of Ukraine, natural gas production in the European Union has experienced a significant decline of approximately 13 percent due to the May 2024 closure of the Dutch gas field in Groningen, the bloc’s major gas source. One positive indicator for supply is in Romania, which foresees a rise in gas production thanks to upcoming projects in the Black Sea. Denmark’s gas output is also expected to receive a boost with the delayed return of the Tyra field in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE TURNS TO LNG, PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNITED STATES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of transatlantic cooperation has been securing LNG volumes for Europe. A March 2022 U.S.-EU announcement featured prominent commitments by the United States to expand LNG exports to Europe to at least 50 bcm per year by 2030. The agreement started with a goal of achieving 15 bcm of increased exports in 2022, a target that was swiftly met and surpassed by September of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bBCpSXi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in U.S. LNG exports to Europe is stunning. In 2021, total U.S. LNG exports to Europe stood at 29 bcm; 2022 saw exports more than double to 70 bcm. These flows played a critical role for Europe as it sought to replace lost Russian pipeline volumes. In total, U.S. LNG grew to 15 percent of all EU gas imports in 2022. Policymakers and officials on both sides of the Atlantic have touted this result as a demonstration of the ongoing strategic partnership between Europe and the United States. In June 2022, in a joint statement on European energy security, President Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “While Russia has cut supplies of natural gas to several EU Member States, the United States and other producers have stepped up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks at the North American Gas Forum in October 2023, U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I travel around the world, especially in Europe, the message I always hear is hurray for American LNG producers. There is great appreciation for the role that American producers have played, especially in this period of Russia-caused disruption. From a strategic and foreign policy standpoint it’s a good thing that our export capacity, our liquefaction capacity is going to grow as much as it is over the next couple of years as we look out towards 2025, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines of communication and coordination afforded by the task force were crucial in enabling ad hoc diplomatic efforts on energy matters. A notable example of this occurred in February 2022 when Japan agreed to divert LNG cargoes to Europe following determined diplomatic engagement with U.S. and EU officials. However, much of the result was independent of direct government action. The United States has no institutional mechanisms by which to direct LNG exports to specific markets, countries, or customers. Instead, decisions on long-term investment, production, and export destinations are market-informed and taken by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction and then abrupt cutoff in Russian pipeline volumes were, in effect, an exogenous, outward shift in the LNG demand curve and have resulted in a new, far higher equilibrium point for European LNG prices. This created the price signal, as reflected by the historic highs of the TTF European gas price index, for firms to redirect LNG shipments to the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. LNG export industry possesses unique flexibility to respond to price relative to the rest of the global LNG market. Most U.S. export volumes are sold through a free-on-board contract model that gives buyers ownership of cargoes at the export terminal and offers destination flexibility. This leaves buyers free to send cargo wherever they wish based on commercial considerations — typically the market that can command the highest price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contracting structures have facilitated a shift from long-term point-to-point contracts toward a “portfolio player” model in which firms buy up a large pool of contracts for their own procurement needs and resell to whatever market commands the highest premiums. Portfolio players make up a growing share of U.S. supply deals and have played a key role in shifting LNG volumes to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortuitous market conditions have also created spare capacity and have made redirection of LNG volumes to Europe feasible. In China, slowed economic growth and Covid-19-related restrictions reduced energy demand, driving LNG imports 20 percent lower year over year and thereby freeing up over 20 bcm of LNG for other destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K08sxto.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: U.S. Export Destinations by Region, 2018–23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_expc_s1_a.htm&quot;&gt;“U.S. Natural Gas Exports and Re-Exports by Country,” U.S. Energy Information Administration, June 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dramatic shift of volumes away from Asia to Europe highlights how the European energy crisis cascaded effects globally. From the global perspective, successful transatlantic partnerships to redirect LNG volumes are viewed less positively. The primary Asian gas price index, JKM, effectively traded at parity with the TTF European gas price index throughout the energy crisis (see Figure 4). Many Asian buyers of LNG, both private and government buyers, were exposed to price volatility and energy insecurity sourced ultimately from the European crisis. Lower-income countries such as Pakistan suffered from energy shortages even as Europe largely succeeded in averting such shortages. These outcomes undoubtedly have consequences for future energy strategy and wider geopolitical developments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LNG Infrastructure Construction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most relevant measures to substitute Russian gas is the construction of new LNG terminals. The majority of these projects have involved the rapid and cost-effective construction of new floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), totaling 16 projects, in addition to the expansions of 11 existing LNG terminals. Germany did not have any LNG terminals when the war erupted; it pushed through FSRU permitting and “onshore connections in record time,” with the first FSRU coming online in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NIlLxAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: Existing and Planned EU LNG Infrastructure, 2021–27.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker&quot;&gt;“European LNG Tracker,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, February 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in LNG imports positioned the European Union as the world’s largest LNG importer in 2023, ahead of other traditionally bigger importers such as China and Japan. One of the fears of this rapid development of LNG terminals is the risk of building overcapacity that is eventually not used, as happened on the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades. The disparity between Europe’s LNG capacity and demand is widening in a context of significant infrastructure expansions and LNG imports plateauing since late 2022. The utilization rate of Europe’s LNG terminals averaged 58 percent in early 2023, prompting questions about the necessity of further infrastructure expansion, projected until 2027. However, as noted by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, around 80 percent of capacity additions between 2022 and 2024 were FSRUs, which allow for the repurposing or relocation of floating infrastructure at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are plans to establish four onshore conventional plants, with construction timelines scheduled between 2023 and 2027. Germany has been the main player in this expansion following the approval in record time of the LNG Acceleration Act, which involves the federal government in infrastructure development. This approach has marked a significant departure from prior policies, with the state actively engaging in project implementation, including direct involvement in financing and operational oversight. Most operators of the new Germany LNG plants are expected to switch to climate-neutral hydrogen by 2044 at the latest. But the exact timing, techno-economic feasibility, and adherence to these timetables remain to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qcy9fd0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, Greece, and Italy have also been very active in the construction and expansion of new LNG terminals and hope to serve as a gateway for gas to neighboring landlocked countries such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Two infrastructure initiatives stand out. First, the Vertical Corridor, presented in January 2024, will make it possible to transport natural gas from Greece and Bulgaria to Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The pipeline is expected to extend to Moldova and underground storage facilities in Ukraine, increasing natural gas import and storage options for one of Gazprom’s remaining export markets in Europe. Both Greek and EU subsidies have enabled the construction of pipelines that span the country and connect to a new import terminal that will provide Central and Eastern Europe with gas for decades to come. Greece’s ambition to become a key European LNG import hub has been aided by forceful lobbying efforts from U.S. officials for European nations to use Greece’s new terminal and pipelines. Second, the Adriatica pipeline will allow Italy to reconfigure its gas flows, traditionally designed to go in a north-south direction. With this improved transmission network, Italy will be able to export gas entering from the south (i.e., from Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Libya), in addition to exporting LNG to northern neighbors, especially Austria and, subsequently, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE DRAMATICALLY CURTAILS DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the significant supply-side shocks, natural gas demand in the European Union declined by 55 bcm, or 13 percent, in 2022 — the steepest year-over-year fall in history. By March 2024, gas consumption in the European Union had decreased by 24 percent compared to March 2021. There was a robust public campaign to save electricity, encouraging Europeans to turn down thermostats, take shorter showers, and turn off nonessential lighting. The lights on the Eiffel Tower, for instance, were turned off at night. These efforts had considerable impact, as EU-wide electricity demand declined by 3.4 percent in 2023 compared to 2022 and was 6.4 percent lower than its pre-crisis level in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest decline in natural gas use was among the three main consumers: EU households to generate heat, the energy sector to generate electricity, and the industrial sector to manufacture final products such as ammonia, fuels, ceramics, and paper. Although gas demand in the electricity sector temporarily increased during 2022 due to the decline in nuclear and hydroelectric power, this trend reversed in 2023 thanks to a significant increase in renewables, lower electricity consumption, and improved nuclear and hydro output. The buildings sector experienced a reduction of almost 20 percent in the winters of 2022 and 2023, attributed to milder weather, behavioral changes in response to high prices, increased fuel poverty, efficiency improvements, and record heat pump installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the industrial sector, gas consumption has fallen by around 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, mainly due to reduced production and, to a lesser extent, fuel switching. Some factors, such as price-sensitive fuel switching in the refining sector or weather effects, are expected to be temporary. Others, such as increased renewable capacity, improved efficiency, the adoption of heat pumps, and permanent industrial plant closures, are structural and lead to lasting, sometimes undesired reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RENEWABLES DRAMATICALLY EXPAND AND INCREASE EUROPE’S RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s expansion of renewables prior to the crisis helped reduce the impact of the crisis and gave Europe greater energy resilience. Renewable energy played a considerable role in meeting shortfalls in the electricity sector from lower hydroelectric and nuclear output. Renewables output increased by 80 TWh year over year in 2022 and another 87 TWh in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, wind and solar represented 22 percent of EU electricity generation, overtaking natural gas for the first time. Solar capacity was rapidly deployed during the crisis, pushing installed capacity to 256 GW in 2023, a 56 percent increase versus 2021. Wind capacity also grew, albeit far slower than solar, even as the sector struggled with considerable supply chain and financial difficulties (Figure 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n7LH8fw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 16: Rapid Renewables Deployment in the EU, 2018–23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/data-explorer/&quot;&gt;“Electricity Data Explorer,” Ember Climate, June 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid deployment of renewables, primarily solar, has been fueled by record-high wholesale prices improving the financial attractiveness of renewables, by member state and commission efforts to ease permitting processes, and by the continuing fall in solar costs due to expanding Chinese solar manufacturing capacity. The development of distributed solar, especially rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems in households and businesses, has been one of the great social responses to the energy crisis, becoming a widespread phenomenon in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside trade challenges, the massive expansion of solar has created new internal challenges for electricity markets. In Germany, the expansion of solar has created price cannibalization “leading to destruction of solar hour prices and solar profitability,” a result that should lead to slower expansion, according to an SEB Research report. With installed solar capacity in Germany now over 82 GW, output on a typical sunny day far exceeds the average demand of roughly 52 GW. Spain is having a similar situation, where power is at times “almost free” due to solar production. For countries with deep solar penetration, the only conceivable path for continued expansion in the solar segment is matching investment in energy storage and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biogas is a small, easily overlooked but significant area of renewable energy expansion. The anticipated increase in domestic biogas and biomethane production is projected to partially offset the decline in conventional gas production. Over the past decade and supported by generous subsidy packages, the European Union has witnessed a doubling in its production of biogas and biomethane, reaching approximately 19 bcm in 2022, which equates to around 6 percent of final EU gas consumption. The REPowerEU plan aims to achieve a combined volume of 35 bcm by 2030, nearly doubling current production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET INTEGRATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, European resilience has been greatly boosted by existing cross-border infrastructure networks and markets. Gaps in supply or infrastructure in one country can be offset by the capabilities of another — a result physically enabled by pipeline and electric transmission networks and commercially enabled by common market systems. For example, Germany did not possess any LNG import terminals until its first FSRU came online in December 2022. Before this, Germany was nonetheless able to access LNG supplies through shipments arriving at EU ports in countries such as the Netherlands. Europe benefited from the continued operation of infrastructure and markets because, on the whole, European countries refrained from hoarding energy, nationalizing energy supplies, or restricting outbound sales. This unity was matched on the demand side as Europeans collectively cut demand for gas and electricity in more or less similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We had some strong reserves in the form of gas which we could capitalize on. . . . We looked at how we could, first of all, handle our own needs and then how we could play a significant role in enabling neighboring countries to get out of this situation. . . . At the same time, renewables was where we doubled down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was rapid movement to complete new interconnection projects, where possible, to create greater resilience. By May 2022, the Baltic states had enabled new interconnections with Poland. By September 2023, the Baltic Pipe was completed, connecting Poland to Norwegian gas supplies through Denmark, which was crucial for improving the energy security situation of the most exposed eastern EU members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;country-level-fiscal-and-regulatory-response&quot;&gt;Country-Level Fiscal and Regulatory Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis and the increase in wholesale energy prices in Europe prompted governments to put in place measures to shield consumers from the direct impact of rising prices, protect strategic assets, and secure the energy supply. There were fears of a deep European recession as well as concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many European governments relied on fiscal spending to keep industries afloat and alleviate the costs to the public. According to a Bruegel report, the national fiscal policy responses to the energy crisis in the European Union reached €540 billion, of which €158 billion was earmarked by Germany alone. Separately, the United Kingdom provided €103 billion in fiscal support. The different fiscal capacities of member states within the European Union, both in terms of revenue levels and indebtedness, resulted in an overall unbalanced response that created tensions among member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank also found that the crisis contributed “to a deterioration in the current account balance of the euro area, from 2.2% of GDP in 2019 to –1.0% of GDP in 2022. Both deficit and surplus countries were affected.” This has limited Europe’s fiscal capacity to invest in defense, support Ukraine, and further fund the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these financial outlays demonstrate that European states had the fiscal and policymaking capacity to shield their economies from the worst effects of the crisis. As noted, both before the crisis and in the early stages, there was a widespread assumption that the loss of access to Russian natural gas would plunge the European Union into a deep recession. Some economists predicted a 10 percent decline in German output and the loss of 2–3 million jobs. Fiscal outlays, effective substitution to other energy suppliers, and demand reduction measures prevented a deep economic recession. Instead, as Moll, Schularick, and Zachmann concluded in a Brookings study in September 2023, “Overall, while the German economy is stagnating and faces substantial long-run headwinds, the direct economic costs of the end of Russian energy imports proved moderate and manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight other EU countries were more dependent on Russian energy than Germany in 2022, including Finland, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia Greece, for instance, spent about 5 percent of GDP, or about €10 billion, on energy support measures, with most of the funding directed at subsidizing household energy bills. Yet despite the price shock, Greece reduced its energy imports from Russia by more than 70 percent, much more than the EU average of 37 percent. Despite the costs and the price shock, industrial production grew by 2.3 percent in 2022, with the economy growing overall by nearly 6 percent. In the Netherlands, consumption of natural gas dropped by roughly 30 percent, but overall industrial output increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2021, European governments have implemented various policies aimed at alleviating the impact of rising prices on consumers and businesses, including temporary reductions in energy taxes for transport fuels, natural gas, and electricity; retail energy price caps; energy tariff regulations; and support programs for energy-intensive industries. Europe also experienced a wave of energy utility nationalization, including Russian-controlled companies such as Gazprom Germania (now SEFE) and those overly exposed to Russian energy supplies and market volatility and in need of a bailout, such as Uniper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Germany’s €200 billion aid package allowed large-scale consumers to apply for a gas block tariff and pay 70 percent of their gas use, calculated over the previous year’s consumption, at a subsidized cost of €0.70 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Additionally, governments made efforts to stabilize wholesale prices and ensure energy security by promoting energy savings and capping energy costs, particularly for wholesale electricity and gas. Some countries also attempted to reform energy markets, while windfall taxes targeted inframarginal power generators, crude refiners, and upstream producers in a temporary and exceptional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries also implemented direct transfers, such as discounts at gas stations or vouchers — frequently for vulnerable households — often at high cost for a dubious return. One widespread practice, often by regional or local authorities, was to reduce public transport fares, encouraging the use of public transport instead of private vehicles as a fuel-saving measure. However, criticism arose due to the failure of many measures to specifically target vulnerable groups, instead focusing on mitigating social and political unrest. The prevalence of untargeted price-distorting measures contradicted the need to incentivize energy conservation and honor existing commitments to the energy transition and to curve fossil fuel subsidies. However, despite some of these measures, demand declined significantly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fiscal costs, the energy crisis further fueled inflation in Europe. The European Central Bank found that “high energy and commodity prices and supply bottlenecks have driven strong inflation in the euro area and higher inflation differentials between euro area countries.” Countries with greater dependence on Russian energy, such as Latvia, suffered inflation rates above 10 percent. Unlike the United States, where inflation was mainly demand driven, the supply shock in the European Union generated by the higher energy prices and the significant import dependency was responsible for the lion’s share of inflation in 2022–23. For example, headline inflation averaged 9.3 percent in Greece in 2022, driven largely by surging energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-policy-response&quot;&gt;EU Policy Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine caught the European Union off guard. The EU institutions had largely focused on the climate dimensions of energy policy and not on the security of supply, which was seen as the responsibility of member states. Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demanded a collective EU response. The European Union helped ensure a unified response and set direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe demonstrated its unity in the Versailles declaration of March 11, 2022. Although the declaration was an informal and nonbinding document, it demonstrated the political will of European leaders to take a step forward and reinforce the bloc’s strategic autonomy, especially in three directions: bolstering defense capabilities, reducing energy dependencies, and building a more robust economic base. On the energy front, the declaration called on the European Commission to present REPowerEU, a plan to address the energy shock and ensure that the need to decouple from Russian energy would not undermine the climate ambitions embodied by the EU Green Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU, primarily a declaratory document of the European Commission, provides the states with the tools (e.g., budget and legislative mechanisms) to implement the proposals it contains. While some of the measures and targets set out in REPowerEU have subsequently been incorporated into the EU acquis (EU law), such as the 2030 renewable energy targets, others have been ignored or rendered obsolete, such as those related to imported renewable hydrogen. The REPowerEU budget was set at approximately €300 billion, with around 75 percent funded through loans from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (NextGenerationEU funds) and the remaining 25 percent coming from grants funded by the auctioning of additional Emissions Trading System allowances and other EU sources. Member states could access this funding by including REPowerEU measures in their national recovery and resilience plans, which the European Commission then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU outlined an ambitious strategy aimed at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across power generation, industry, buildings, and transport sectors, and proposed raising the 2030 renewable energy target set under the Fit for 55 packages from 40 percent to 45 percent. These included a dedicated EU solar strategy to double solar PV capacity by 2025 and reach 600 GW by 2030, alongside the Solar Rooftops Initiative mandating installation of solar panels on new public, commercial, and residential buildings. REPowerEU also highlighted efforts to double the deployment rate of heat pumps, integrate geothermal and solar thermal energy into modernized heating systems, and streamline the permitting process for major renewable projects. Additionally, the commission aimed to establish a target of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, half of it to be imported, and launched a Biomethane Action Plan to boost production to 35 bcm by the same date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU also catalyzed a legislative proposal to establish the minimum gas storage mandate. This storage mandate set the target for 80 percent filling by November 1, 2022, and 90 percent filling by subsequent winters. In addition, gas storage infrastructure is now considered critical infrastructure and is under scrutiny from EU authorities to avoid external interferences. The new gas storage regulation establishes coordinated gas refueling operations, including joint procurement, aggregation of orders and supplies, and optimization and improved transparency of gas infrastructure. REPowerEU proposed coordinated demand reduction strategies and a solidarity mechanism in the European Union in case of gas supply disruptions. It was accompanied by a recommendation for member states to take voluntary measures to maintain a collective reduction in gas demand of 15 percent, compared to average demand between April 2017 and March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the natural gas side, REPowerEU established a framework for collective procurement of non-Russian LNG, extending participation to all interested member states, as well as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and the Western Balkans. The idea behind this platform, which is already functioning, is to increase transparency in the EU gas market, complementing the existing hubs to bring as many gas consumers as possible closer to the wholesale market and attract new operators to the growing European LNG market. In particular, the platform hopes to increase the bargaining power of landlocked European countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, in their process of energy diversification and access to import terminals in other member states. The European Union’s joint gas purchasing platform, AggregateEU, has shown some initial success in matching gas supply with demand, attracting significant participation from companies and suppliers in its first rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain due to limited transparency on the contractual outcomes and prices achieved through the platform. While the initiative has facilitated connections between buyers and sellers, the added value over existing market mechanisms is questionable, as the current EU gas market already supports effective demand aggregation and access to LNG supplies for landlocked countries thanks to EU rules on third-party access to pipelines. Despite this, AggregateEU, originally designed as a temporary mechanism, is now a permanent facility incorporated into the EU gas and hydrogen package. Similar schemes are expected in the future to aggregate purchases of hydrogen and critical minerals at the EU level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transatlantic-cooperation&quot;&gt;Transatlantic Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the magnitude of the security and energy crisis Europe faced dawned on leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, they quickly initiated effective transatlantic cooperation on energy matters. Yet the energy dimension of the crisis meant that the United States needed to engage with the European Union as opposed to NATO. Relations between the United States and EU institutions have occasionally been fraught, and the United States has rarely prioritized them. Yet the crisis changed the dynamic, with the United States and European Union engaging extensively, especially on energy and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A March 2022 joint U.S.-EU announcement established a new Task Force on European Energy Security. This grouping has since met 11 times and has been an effective vehicle for transatlantic communication and coordination on energy issues, enabled by high-level leadership and participation on both sides. Task force members include Björn Seibert, head of cabinet for the European Commission president; Amos Hochstein, U.S. senior adviser for energy security; Ditte Juul Jørgensen, European Commission director general for energy; and Sarah Ladislaw, special assistant to the president and senior director for climate and energy at the White House National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force has enabled much more robust U.S.-EU engagement in relation to the energy dimension of this crisis. U.S. LNG has been a major topic of the task force, including discussing “global LNG markets and market projections, the regulatory environment and permitting outlook in the United States and the EU, the development of U.S. LNG export capacities, the reinforcement of EU LNG infrastructure, and the EU Energy Platform and Joint Purchasing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-sanctions-on-the-russian-energy-sector&quot;&gt;EU Sanctions on the Russian Energy Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has phased in sanctions on the Russian energy sector (Figure 17), seeking to minimize the negative impact on EU member states while still affecting Russian finances. EU law mandates that member states in the Council of the European Union unanimously approve sanctions, requiring the acquiescence of all EU states in order to come into force. The mandate has substantially limited the ambition of this instrument, holding back sanctions on Russian gas or nuclear fuel and requiring several country-specific exceptions when sanctioning crude oil or oil products. Sanctions have sought to reconcile national interests within the European Union and have run parallel to the unfolding war and the energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u91j3Fo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17: EU Sanctions on Russian Imports Evolution, 2022–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of sanctions focused on limiting the access of Russian banks to the international financial system and the transfer of technology to the Russian energy sector. Coal was the first Russian energy source that the European Union sanctioned. The ban on imports of all Russian coal was agreed to in April 2022 as part of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia, granting a four-month grace period for existing contracts. Coal sanctions were relatively easy to agree upon thanks to a high level of self-sufficiency in Europe (75 percent in 2021), the short-term nature of coal contracts (around 90 days), and the relative availability of alternative suppliers in the Atlantic basin (e.g., Colombia, South Africa, and the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for EU sanctions on Russian oil was more complicated. Sanctions on seaborne oil imports were agreed to in June 2022, with a six-month grace period and an opt-out provided for Bulgaria, exemplifying the complexities of negotiations in the Council of the European Union. At the time of the negotiations, Russian state-owned Lukoil’s refinery in Burgas, Bulgaria, was the largest industrial complex in the country, originally designed to process exclusively Ural-grade crude oil. Following sustained negotiations, Bulgaria obtained a “‘special derogation’ from the measure until the end of 2024 due to its ‘geographical exposure’” as a means to achieve unanimity in the council. The exception subsequently proved a loophole for sanctions evasion, and Bulgaria voluntarily withdrew from the exemption. Bulgaria is now seeking options to sell the Lukoil refinery to new owners willing to inject the investment necessary to allow the facility to process non-Russian crude varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian oil pipeline imports have also been temporarily exempted from EU sanctions. Central European countries, especially the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, citing their landlocked geography and the difficulties of switching their refineries to different crudes, obtained a temporary allowance for imports from the Druzhba pipeline. These countries, which continue to import Russian crude oil through this infrastructure, state that they will continue to do so in the medium term while building new import pipelines and upgrading their refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany and Poland agreed to eliminate their temporary exception and cease imports of Russian crude oil by pipeline on January 1, 2023. In exchange, the commission allowed Kazakhstan to export oil to Germany through Russian pipelines. Although this technically is a move to eliminate Russian crude imports, Kazakhstan’s oil, which must be supplied through the Russian transmission system, inevitably mixes with Russian oil, and Moscow receives oil transit fees. The temporary measure allows inland German refineries to operate at full capacity and avoid bottlenecks in the pipeline transportation system from the seaports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An embargo on Russian-refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) came into force in February 2023 and curbed EU imports of most Russian petroleum products. However, non-EU countries can import Russian oil, refine products, and export these to the European Union, in effect creating a loophole for indirect imports of Russian oil. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air has called China, India, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates “laundromats” for Russian oil, importing larger quantities of crude oil since the EU embargo while also growing export volumes of diesel and jet fuel to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to banning seaborne crude oil imports, the European Union has imposed several prohibitions regarding maritime services and access to its ports in relation to the oil trade between Russia and third countries. EU operators are barred from providing maritime services and insurance unless the trade adheres to the Group of Seven (G7) oil price cap. Vessels engaging in ship-to-ship transfers suspected of violating the Russian oil import ban or the G7 price cap are denied access to EU ports, as are vessels that manipulate or deactivate their navigation tracking systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These restrictions have not been applied to LNG shipping services and transport. European terminals are offering transshipment services to Russian gas tankers. From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, most Russian LNG coming from the Yamal region needs icebreakers to access international markets. To optimize the routes of these specialized vessels, the natural gas they transport is transferred to conventional LNG vessels, principally at the terminals of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, for subsequent export to non-European markets. The eleventh round of European sanctions on Russia included transshipments of petroleum and derivatives that did not comply with the maximum price stipulated by the G7, but it deliberately omitted transshipment of LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF NUCLEAR SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the drop in oil and gas trade between the European Union and Russia, imports of nuclear fuel products have steadily increased since February 2022. The absence of sanctions may be explained by the European Union’s unique dependence on Russian nuclear fuel products and, secondly, by the limited impact that sanctions have had on Russia’s trade balance and the Kremlin’s budget. According to Eurostat, the European Union imported only €572 million of Russian nuclear-related products in 2022. The European Union has continued purchasing nuclear technology and fuel from Russia for the 19 Soviet-designed water-water energetic reactors (VVERs) operating in five member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Replacing Russian fuel is not a simple task: it is not an easily substituted commodity, and it requires adapting capacities in nuclear power plants and obtaining alternative suppliers in a very tight market. EU countries have increased Russian nuclear fuel deliveries from 314 tons of nuclear fuel in 2022 to 573 tons in 2023, a result that may be due to stockpiling in case of expanded conflict or supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungary is the only member state without explicit plans to transition to alternative fuel suppliers. The rest are pursuing alternate suppliers. The Czech Republic is poised to begin receiving Western-manufactured nuclear fuel from Westinghouse and, potentially, Framatome starting in late 2024. Slovakia, through its nuclear plant operator Slovenské Elektrárne, aims to introduce Westinghouse fuel by 2027 following a licensing agreement, although a newly elected Russia-friendly government may negatively affect the implementation of these plans. Finland is preparing to shift its Loviisa reactor units to non-Russian fuel between 2027 and 2030, having engaged in discussions with Westinghouse about fuel supply even before the onset of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF GAS SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of May 2024, the European Union has not imposed specific sanctions on Russian natural gas. While pipeline gas imports have fallen by four-fifths from 2019 levels following Russia’s weaponization of gas supplies, LNG imports from Russia remain above prewar levels. Sanctions on Russian gas have been a politically sensitive issue in Brussels. The unanimity required to impose sanctions is difficult to achieve due to the threat of further disruption of supplies disproportionately affecting countries most dependent on pipeline imports. Hungary’s opposition is an example of a significant obstacle to agreement in the Council of the European Union. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has sought to engage and work with the Kremlin even after the invasion, reaching an agreement for the purchase of additional volumes of gas and the diversion of its Russian gas imports away from Ukrainian pipelines to the TurkStream pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its recent Regulation on Gas and Hydrogen Networks, the European Union has implemented a mechanism which allows member states to temporarily block Russian and Belarusian exporters from reserving infrastructural capacity for natural gas shipments via pipeline and LNG. This mechanism, which has to be implemented voluntarily at the state level, would allow European companies to terminate their contracts by invoking force majeure clauses and protect themselves against possible arbitration. Because this mechanism does not constitute an EU-wide ban or sanction, it circumvents the unanimity standard. While European commissioner for energy Kadri Simson has urged member states to use this mechanism, it is uncertain whether the mechanism will be implemented in a coordinated and effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe actively sought to decouple from Russian coal and oil, it did not collectively seek to decouple from Russian gas. Instead, Europe has been forced to scramble due to the collapse in supply. Europe has not sanctioned Russian gas, though it is now considering sanctioning LNG. The reduction in purchases of Russian natural gas has been mainly due to lower volumes shipped through Nord Stream (out of operation) and Yamal (closed due to the Kremlin’s requirement to make payments in rubles). The transit contract through Ukraine for Russian gas expires on December 31, 2024. Its future is unknown. Although Ukraine has announced its refusal to negotiate bilaterally with Gazprom, it has opened the door to possible contracted volumes on the spot market for interested European countries — mainly Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia. This uncertainty about the future of Ukrainian pipelines and the creation of a possible European mechanism to block Russian LNG imports should help to further reduce Russian gas imports in 2025 and 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-european-energy-security-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New European Energy Security Strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe came through the crisis, but challenges remain. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But these are largely from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources are higher and will therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electricity-market-reform&quot;&gt;Electricity Market Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity sector emerged from the 2022 energy crisis as a major locus of energy security considerations for policymakers. The surges in electricity pricing devastated consumers, both households and businesses, and cascaded shocks from the natural gas sector throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of marginal pricing sits at the center of the debate. During the crisis, numerous ad hoc interventions into the electricity market were proposed; some were implemented to reduce consumer exposure to spot prices set by marginal pricing. After the crisis, the sector emerged with newfound political relevance, which catalyzed widespread interest in reforming markets based on the lessons of 2022. Nonetheless, widespread consensus on the need for review and reform in the sector does not imply widespread agreement on the substance of that reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key objectives appear in conflict. On one hand, reform seeks to limit the exposure of electricity consumers to volatile pricing sourced from gas-fired generation and their ability to benefit from the low prices of new renewable generation. This implies limiting consumer exposure to prices set via marginal pricing in the market. On the other hand, massive volumes of investment must be attracted to the sector to make continued progress on decarbonization. This includes investment in wind and solar generation, but expanded investment is of increasing importance in technologies such as battery storage and hydrogen-fired generation, which can help balance the intermittency of renewables. Broadly stated, price signals, free of regulatory risk and reflective of overall system scarcity, are the best way to attract private capital at scale. Furthermore, price signals are the crucial incentive for demand response programs, the expansion of which is a crucial objective for overall sectoral efficiency and managing the intermittency of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are moving from a fuel-based system to a technology based one, but this change is not happening overnight in the sense that you need to manage the risks and the complexities. . . . And as we are planning our transition to a technology-based system where materials, equipment, manufacturing capacity, critical raw materials are key in this sense, we . . . are trying both in terms of technologies and in terms of geographies (to find) complementarity that we can leverage if we operate in different systems. And of course, this has a big impact on the energy security of a . . . region like Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial package of reforms was proposed in March 2023, and following a sustained period of negotiations, the Council of the European Union approved a final package in March 2024. Overall, this package yielded considerable incremental reform while resisting more radical changes that sought to move away from a single marginal market clearing price determined by merit order dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package empowers EU member states to deploy fixed-price and fixed-term contracts, which can come in the form of power purchase agreements or contracts for differences (CFDs). Both contracts are already in use across EU member states to varying extents, but the new rules direct member states to make these contract arrangements available to consumers and project developers and, in particular, allow for contracts that cross national borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule also creates room for member states to deploy new capacity support mechanisms. In U.S. electricity markets such as PJM, capacity markets are a well-established mechanism to manage long-term resource adequacy. They create a second vector, independent of spot marginal pricing, by which funds can flow from consumers to generators organized around the principle of availability at periods of peak demand. Germany has proposed exactly such a mechanism to attract investment into the hydrogen-fired thermal power plants it needs to build to balance out renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains over how member states will interpret and implement the EU reform package. The proposal invokes various design principles, with which both capacity mechanisms and CFDs should comply. The exact technical limits of these principles and the enforcement of these limits remain to be seen and will determine the overall impact of the reform package. Overall, the package seeks a tenuous balance between further integration of a competitive European electricity market to the benefit of efficient decarbonization and the need to preserve member states’ ability to procure generation resources in line with their specific national strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banking-on-hydrogen-the-eu-hydrogen-strategy-and-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Banking on Hydrogen: The EU Hydrogen Strategy and Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to Europe’s energy security and climate ambitions are the development and deployment of green hydrogen. Hydrogen was already an essential component of the EU decarbonization strategy before Russia invaded Ukraine. However, it took on a renewed and more prominent role in EU energy plans as the bloc sought to diversify away from Russian fossil fuel resources after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in previous chapters, REPowerEU was conceived at the height of the energy crisis to diversify the European Union away from Russian fossil fuels. By updating the Fit for 55 targets published only a year before, the initiative further galvanized the bloc’s clean energy ambitions. For hydrogen, it brought about two landmark changes. First, the European Union began targeting a market of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, doubling its initial commitment of 10 million tons produced by member states by importing 10 million tons from reliable suppliers across the globe. Second, support for low-carbon hydrogen derived from natural gas was tacitly phased out, and plans for government funding were scratched. This lack of support was a ramification of natural gas supply disruptions during the energy crisis jeopardizing hydrogen-dependent industries, such as ammonia producers and refining operations, as well as the premise that high gas prices made low-carbon hydrogen obsolete as a transitional stand-in for renewable hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match the doubling of supply targets, demand targets for end-use sectors received a commensurate boost (Figure 18). Industry saw an increase in the share of renewable hydrogen consumption in the sector from 35 percent to 75 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, the transport sector nearly doubled its 2030 target for consumption of renewable fuels of nonbiological origin. The Hydrogen Valleys initiative also had its funds topped up in hopes of doubling the number of hydrogen valleys in the European Union by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these objectives have faced substantial criticism due to the unrealistic targets on both the supply and demand sides. A recent report warns that the European Union is not on track to deploy enough renewables or electrolyzers to meet its production targets by 2030, while the outlook on imports is still uncertain. Meanwhile, consumption targets rely on unconsolidated end uses and lagging adoption in existing demand sectors. Industry executives have pointed out that the high cost of renewable hydrogen proves a major barrier to wider adoption, warranting a reassessment of initial targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SECURING SUPPLIES THROUGH HYDROGEN DIPLOMACY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a core component in the EU hydrogen strategy, the international dimension has become central to achieving REPowerEU’s goal of importing up to 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen. Through so-called “green hydrogen partnerships,” the European Union will not only seek to meet its import quota while supporting clean energy project development in partner countries but also unlock the generational opportunity to rewire its energy partnerships and diversify its resource dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU envisions the development of three hydrogen corridors via the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, and through Ukraine, once conditions allow. This ambition has led the European Union through the development of strategic partnerships with Azerbaijan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Namibia, Norway, and Oman, among others. The European Commission has also held talks with Saudi Arabia to increase energy cooperation, with hydrogen as a central pillar. On the transatlantic front, the European Union has already developed a hydrogen partnership with Canada and is looking to expand those partnerships into Latin America. Lastly, the United States is poised to become one of the leading renewable hydrogen markets, thanks to the incentives and tax credits contained within the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In a bid to share this cornucopia, the Mission Possible Partnership is looking to spur U.S.-EU hydrogen trade opportunities by enabling Europe’s first shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States in 2026. All of these partnerships offer the European Union plenty of avenues for renewable hydrogen import supply diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-dependencies-risks-posed-by-clean-tech-supply-chains&quot;&gt;New Dependencies? Risks Posed by Clean Tech Supply Chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Europe seeks to further accelerate a clean transition that improves its overall energy security position, it faces new dilemmas in the domains of trade and economic security. The rapid expansion in renewable energy development has been characterized as merely shifting dependencies from Russia to China. As described by U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt at the 2024 CSIS Energy Security and Geopolitics Conference, “We need to make sure that we don’t replace an era of dependence on Russian fossil fuels with dependence on critical minerals and critical mineral processing in the People’s Republic of China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new dependencies are real. Europe is 95 percent import dependent on China for solar PV panels. The European wind sector, which has for a long time been self-supplied, is coming under intense competitive pressure from Chinese firms and could be competed out of existence in the way German solar manufacturing was by Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actual and potential import dependencies pose challenges for policymakers. However, analytical clarity demands they be classified as trade or economic risks rather than energy security risks. Unlike gas or other fuel imports, there is very little risk to the short-term stability of the European energy system from a hypothetical interruption in access to Chinese solar panels. In short, Europe is currently trading reduced energy security risk for increased trade and economic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of trade and the economic risks are complicated. The availability of ultra-low-cost (and increasingly cheaper) Chinese solar panels and wind turbines lowers the overall investment cost of Europe’s climate ambitions. The value here should not be overlooked given the massive fiscal outlays the energy crisis imposes; for the European Union, the efficient use of public funds and subsidy capacity are ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversely, allowing Chinese imports to overwhelm and destroy the viability of European clean manufacturing companies has economic, social, and political costs. Expanding the manufacturing employment base associated with climate technologies to improve the overall standing of climate politics is the central political-economic thesis of the IRA and is a model with considerable support in Europe (especially in the European Commission). Allowing Chinese imports to displace extant industries and jobs is likely to cause political backlash that undermines EU climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Trying to define an industrial strategy in Europe of what we want to produce and how we want to produce it in this global competition between America and China . . . is a really hard thing to do [when you need] unanimous agreement among 27 EU member states. And in my mind, that’s the kind of shaping energy and climate question of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ben-mcwilliams-affiliate-fellow-bruegel&quot;&gt;— Ben McWilliams, Affiliate Fellow, Bruegel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and economic competition concerns extend beyond China. The IRA implemented subsidies for clean energy manufacturing and successfully attracted large volumes of private capital investment. These subsidies apply to countries that hold a free trade agreement with the United States (e.g., Canada and Mexico). Notably, the European Union lacks any such free trade agreements. Thus, European-based manufacturing cannot participate in these subsidies — most notably, the electric vehicle tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade and economic risks of clean energy supply chains extend past technology and into the domain of raw materials. Europe is structurally short of the minerals critical to most modern clean technology. For example, the European Union is solely dependent on one country for heavy rare-earth elements (100 percent supplied by China), boron (98 percent supplied by Turkey), and platinum (71 percent supplied by South Africa). Recognizing that the bloc will never be self-sufficient but should diversify its supply of critical raw materials, the European Council adopted the European Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2024. Again, the direct comparison to fuel dependencies is inappropriate and represents a trade and economic risk rather than an energy security risk. Although Europe has some domestic mining and processing capacity — notably in the Nordic states — it is heavily dependent on raw materials and, more extensively, on processed materials used as inputs in higher-value manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vector of risk arrives through expanded Chinese clean energy investments in Europe. On a recent trip to Europe, Chinese president Xi Jinping traveled to Hungary, where it was recently announced that China would be opening new battery factories. China appears to be cultivating Hungary as a bastion of support in the European Union in the hopes that it will shield China from potential joint EU measures, akin to the role Hungary has played vis-à-vis Russian sanctions. Hungary has frequently blocked EU statements condemning or opposing Chinese action. In this respect, although clean energy supply chains can help reduce European energy security risks, they invite considerable risks in the domain of trade policy and, perhaps more troubling, undermine Europe’s ability to form coherent foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-and-different-gas-risks&quot;&gt;New and Different Gas Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Russian gas “weapon” is unlikely to ever pose the energy security risk to Europe that it posed before the crisis. This holds true even though Russian gas continues to flow into the European market, albeit at greatly reduced volumes, through both pipelines and LNG imports. Commercial developments, infrastructure investments, and political commitments have structurally reduced European reliance on Russian gas, and volumes are unlikely to ever return to precrisis levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many businesses may be open to a return to Russian gas, political endorsement or support for this strategy by European policymakers today appears unlikely so long as Putin remains in the Kremlin. For Europe to reengage Russia as an energy supplier, major political change in Moscow or a favorable end to the war that preserves Ukraine’s path to Europe is likely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversification is the most reliable principle by which to measure energy security, as established most famously by British statesman Winston Churchill in 1920: “Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone.” Today, the diversification of suppliers, import vectors, and regional exposure of natural gas imports has to some extent structurally improved European energy security. However, it would be naive and simplistic to think Europe is free of gas-derived energy security risks. Today, European exposure has shifted elsewhere. Norway’s leading role in European gas markets makes sabotage against Norwegian undersea infrastructure a risk; such an event, timed with winter or storage-filling season, could drive gas shortages and price spikes in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Europe continues to rely on imports from states in North Africa and the Middle East, which could easily present diplomatic complications and provide leverage against European objectives. While recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of sea lanes and LNG supply from the Persian Gulf, pipeline supply remains the most complex to manage. Gas from Algeria and Libya, accounting for more than 10 percent of EU imports, faces problems of flat or declining production, rapid growth in domestic consumption, and geopolitical risks. At least since the Arab Spring, the European Union has demonstrated profound limitations in influencing the Maghreb and building an attractive neighborhood narrative. In the case of the Southern Gas Corridor, Azerbaijan’s bellicose attitude in its conflict with Armenia presents a risk to EU interests and the defense of its principles in the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Europe now relies heavily on energy imports from the United States. Although the recent approval pause of a U.S. LNG export terminal does very little to affect current LNG flows and may very well do little to affect future flows, the development highlights how LNG exports have become a pawn in domestic politics. A hypothetical future with a climate-ambitious president in the White House with control of Congress could easily see scaled-back U.S. LNG exports, a result European climate advocates likely will applaud even as it may hurt European energy security. The nature of shale gas, based on short-cycle projects, means that without constant upstream investment, production may plateau or decline, jeopardizing the viability of continued expansion of LNG exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Europe is structurally exposed to global LNG markets in a way it never was before the crisis. Developments anywhere in the world that affect global LNG markets will affect the price and availability of LNG for Europe. This new exposure demands new, sustained, and serious attention from European policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-new-connective-midstream-and-integrating-europes-energy-market&quot;&gt;Building New Connective Midstream and Integrating Europe’s Energy Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the considerable reliability and efficiency value of integrated infrastructure and market networks. It also demonstrates how much further integration is possible and needed. The combined pressure of an ongoing energy decoupling from Russia and an accelerating energy transition requires Europe to invest in physical infrastructure — both electric transmission and pipeline networks — and advance the integrated market systems that extract maximum value out of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSMISSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric transmission played a crucial role in enabling European member states to avoid load-shedding situations through the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2022–23. Variable renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar) allows for reduced reliance on Russian gas in the power sector but requires greatly expanded intra- and intermember state transmission infrastructure to reduce curtailment rates and price cannibalization effects and allow for continued rapid deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We found ourselves in is this situation where suddenly NATO is having to police interconnector wires between different countries in Europe. . . . Managing the geopolitical complications of making a system where everybody has to have a certain amount of backup generation — and we’re going to utilize it strategically as an entity — [entails] data and physical challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-amy-myers-jaffe-research-professor-new-york-university&quot;&gt;— Amy Myers Jaffe, Research Professor, New York University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 REPowerEU plan targets expanded electricity interconnection projects that cross member state boundaries and improve European electric integration. In November 2023, the European Commission proposed an action plan aimed at accelerating transmission project development and announced a list of 166 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), 88 of which involved the electric system. The PCI designation grants projects considerable permitting advantages and makes them eligible for EU funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Notable examples of projects underway include the France-Spain interconnection and the Baltic synchronization project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmission projects, especially large, high-voltage interstate projects that deliver the most system value, are very costly and difficult to plan, permit, and build. Cross-border projects require difficult political coordination among member states and the ever-present challenge of social acceptability. Although planning and policy are improving and overall investment in grids is growing, research by Ember indicates that the grid investment plans of many European utilities fail to match member state renewable energy policy targets. Cost is the primary brake on expanded investment for both utilities and member states because the investment dollars are paid by rate payers who are already reeling from greatly elevated electricity prices. The CEF is funded at €5.84 billion through 2027, but the commission estimates €584 billion in investments are needed in the electric grid by 2030. The French-Spain interconnection project costs €2.8 billion alone, and Europe needs dozens of such projects if targets are to be met. In short, expanded funding at the EU level is likely necessary to achieve the European Commission interconnection target of 15 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIPELINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fuels side, the considerable investment and expansion needed in pipeline networks pose a unique challenge. Many member states continue to rely on Russian piped oil and gas due to infrastructure constraints. Investment in new and expanded pipeline networks will help member states decouple further from Russia and improve overall European energy security and market stability. At the same time, if EU climate ambitions are to be realized, Europe must transition away from these fossil fuel networks. Right-sizing investment to achieve near- and medium-term energy security objectives without jeopardizing long-term climate targets is a difficult needle to thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has compelled the European Union to quickly invest in new gas infrastructure — both import terminals and internal transport capacity. However, these investments come with risk of carbon lock-in, as existing infrastructure tends to be used, thus delaying European energy transition objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generally agreed-upon solution is in dual-use infrastructure: today’s gas infrastructure should be built such that it can be used for the hydrogen networks of tomorrow. Although reasonable in concept, the engineering in practice is more complicated. LNG terminals in particular face challenges related to adaptation to low-carbon gases, such as hydrogen or low-carbon ammonia. The technical and economic feasibility of such conversions is still at an exploratory stage, with significant uncertainties surrounding the costs and efficiency of the conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In delivering a substitute for Russian fossil-gas, the European Union’s strategic bet on decarbonized hydrogen has clear geopolitical and energy security benefits alongside obvious climate benefits. But the development of a functional hydrogen market and industrial ecosystem requires dedicated infrastructure to connect production and consumption centers, similar to the expansive existing gas transportation network. EU transmission system operators have proposed a hydrogen backbone to repurpose existing infrastructure dedicated to natural gas and complement it with new hydrogen-specific pipelines and storage sites. A major challenge is the unknown scale, composition, and geographic distribution of future hydrogen production and consumption centers. Investment of public or private dollars is therefore difficult to justify. Some mega projects, such as H2med, connecting Barcelona to Marseille via an undersea pipeline, have already been criticized for their lack of economic realism, sheer technical difficulty, and weak climate credentials. The sum of technology and market uncertainty and member state policy coordination challenges means that development of a European hydrogen infrastructure network and market will likely take longer and be more costly than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protecting-critical-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Protecting Critical Energy Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Nord Stream sabotage revealed the vulnerability of Europe’s critical energy infrastructure in the undersea domain. In October 2023, a group of undersea pipelines and telecom cables linking Finland to Estonia were also damaged and taken out of operation. In this case, the cause was identified as a Chinese ship dragging an anchor, although explicit motives have not been established. Europe is structurally exposed to hybrid threats such as these against the extensive undersea infrastructure networks in the Baltic and North Seas. Oil and gas pipelines are the traditional class of infrastructure in these waters. With the increased importance of Norwegian gas flows, the energy security imperative to protect these assets has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the big lessons that came out of the energy crisis, and that still is coming, is that we did not have enough resilience in terms of our energy infrastructure. . . . Things could very easily come down. And that’s not energy security. . . . So, we need to build overcapacity. And to do that, we need to convince the private sector and insurers to keep building these assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-emily-holland-assistant-professor-us-naval-war-college&quot;&gt;— Emily Holland, Assistant Professor, U.S. Naval War College&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian ground forces have been depleted in Ukraine and Russia’s military industrial base has been stretched, the country’s capacity to inflict damage on European energy infrastructure remains intact. While Russia’s navy has been underfunded for years and consists largely of Soviet-era platforms, its underwater capacity continues to grow. Russia’s submarine program has been a noteworthy priority, exemplified by the Kremlin authorizing 13 new nuclear and conventional submarines since 2014. A CSIS report from 2023 notes, “Russia’s ability to target critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter external intervention in regional conflicts is an important component to Moscow’s doctrine and thinking on escalation management.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the energy transition implies massive investment in offshore wind and undersea transmission in the Baltic, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Attacks on undersea electric transmission cables have not been observed to date but could create power grid disruptions that cascade failure across the network. Thus, the energy transition toward clean energy assets in many ways expands undersea critical infrastructure exposure. NATO has established a new operational group, the Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, to manage these risks. Appropriate levels of risk management likely require increased funding, as Europe and NATO will need to procure more operational assets to expand coverage, including traditional surface fleet assets alongside new technologies such as sea drones, sensor networks, and the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-transatlantic-energy-cooperation&quot;&gt;Expanding Transatlantic Energy Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the value of sustained transatlantic cooperation and coordination. During the crisis, European access to U.S. LNG was critical. After the crisis, Europe will remain reliant on U.S. LNG volumes over the medium term as it seeks to cement its energy decoupling from Russia. The U.S. LNG permitting pause has further demonstrated the value of established and close working relationships; policy decisions and impacts on both sides of the Atlantic can be accurately communicated and discussed, and diplomatic rifts can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of reliable partnerships in energy trade highlights the need and potential for greater U.S.-EU cooperation when it comes to broader clean technology and climate policy issues. Despite considerable U.S.-EU engagement in this area, there have been few breakthroughs. Sustained efforts to negotiate a green steel agreement have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the IRA in the United States caused considerable diplomatic backlash in Europe, as it was felt that the policy unduly discriminated against European suppliers. The Biden administration has sought to soften the impact of the IRA on European suppliers, but there has been no movement on either side of the Atlantic toward a new U.S.-EU trade agreement despite the extensive engagement established through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are major energy and climate issues that require transatlantic partnership. The implementation of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will put in place tariffs on carbon-intensive imports into the European Union. The European Union and United States should consider this an opportunity to coordinate on carbon-linked trade. They would also benefit from close coordination on climate and trade policies focused on China, such as with regard to electric vehicles, batteries, or critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe has come out of the crisis more energy secure and has demonstrated the resilience and strength of its European project. However, the crisis left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more antiestablishment parties, many of which seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracies and markets are resilient and durable and can survive shocks.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe showed tremendous strength and resilience in response to the energy shock. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but also of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. Europe’s markets responded, creating incentives for action, and Europe’s allies and partners stepped up. In the face of strategic coercion, Europe took drastic action, leveraged its wealth and fiscal capacity, and demonstrated the resilience of its market-based economies. That response depended critically on the creativity of its democratic political system. Instead, a Eurobarometer survey from 2023 showed that 58 percent of EU citizens believed that the bloc should accelerate the green transition in view of the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The strength of the European Union and its ability to act should not be underestimated.&lt;/strong&gt; Heading into the crisis, all major actors underestimated the strength and resilience of the European Union, including Russia, the United States, and Europeans themselves. The bloc’s fiscal firepower could be mounted at scale, with speed, and with great effect. European fiscal capacity was leveraged just as it was during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect European consumers, businesses, and the European way of life. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis, demonstrating that not only is the union forged in crisis, but it enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently. In that sense, the European Union is a source of Europe’s resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, Russia lost the energy war with Europe. Russia now has significant stranded gas assets, leading to significant losses for Gazprom. While Russia has benefited from high energy prices and has found ways to keep its oil on the market, it failed to leverage its dramatic reduction in gas flows into Europe before the Nord Stream explosions. Europe progressively increased its aid to Ukraine and expanded its sanctions efforts against Russia, including placing an embargo on Russian oil, which has had a more significant impact than the oil price cap mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. LNG was critical to mitigating the crisis and can play an important role in U.S. foreign policy.&lt;/strong&gt; The export of U.S. LNG filled the huge gap left by Russian natural gas supplies. In an era of great power competition in which energy can be weaponized, the ability of the United States to supply countries with LNG through market forces can reduce the ability of Russia or other autocratic states to use energy to coerce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market shock served to supercharge renewables deployment, particularly solar energy.&lt;/strong&gt; While the shift to LNG and alternative gas imports was central to maintaining energy security in the wake of the crisis, the expansion of renewables was equally remarkable and demonstrated that the rapid deployment and expansion of renewables is possible. However, there is also a need to simultaneously integrate and modernize grids, as well as expand storage to better cope with the intermittency of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is economic urgency for Europe to accelerate the green transition.&lt;/strong&gt; The loss of access to lower-cost Russian piped natural gas in exchange for imported LNG has affected European economic competitiveness, with significant implications for Germany in particular. Thus, accelerating the energy transition for Europe is essential not just to meet climate goals or enhance Europe’s energy security but also to ensure its economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-EU partnership is vital and must be strengthened.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship. Historically, this relationship has been strained or limited. Different policy approaches to climate action, exemplified by the United States relying heavily on subsidies and the European Union pursuing a more balanced policy mix centered on carbon pricing, complicate the harmonization of transatlantic energy and climate policy. However, the importance of issues at the intersection of energy, climate, and trade will increase in the coming years, as the clean-tech revolution unfolds and becomes critical to the economic model of both blocs as well as to their wider geopolitical positioning vis-à-vis China. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council is a promising forum for closer coordination but has so far failed to resolve tensions stemming from each side’s parochial interests on technology regulation and state aid rules. Finding policy alignment between the two blocs will thus continue to be a challenge but must be prioritized to achieve shared transatlantic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crisis has added to Europe’s fiscal strains.&lt;/strong&gt; Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. The inflationary impacts of higher energy costs had a deeply negative impact on European households and the European economy. The European fiscal response, which came after the massive fiscal outlays in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has created a more difficult fiscal environment for European policymakers that presently limits their freedom of action. For instance, the dramatic policy ambitions of the government under UK prime minister Liz Truss were strongly repudiated by markets, forcing a policy retreat and her eventual resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political backlash came primarily against incumbents rather than Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine. That did not happen, and support for Ukraine remained high. Nevertheless, although European publics were aware of the cause of the energy crisis, political leaders have felt blowback. Discontent with economic conditions had negative repercussions on policymakers across Europe; even if there was only limited initial political blowback, the energy crisis was not politically cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rise of far-right parties ahead of the 2024 European parliamentary election and the surge in farmer protests railing against environmental policies suggest that European leaders have limited latitude for ambitious climate action. However, public polling figures paint a very different picture. A 2023 Eurobarometer survey indicated that 86 percent of respondents found it important to take initiative at the European level to limit the immediate impact of rising energy prices on consumers and companies during the prior year. In terms of future action, 86 percent thought that gas storage within the bloc should be padded to avoid the risk of shortages, 85 percent believed that the manufacturing of clean technologies should be boosted, and 79 percent believed that EU measures should aim at reducing energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy story that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not ended. In the more than two years since the invasion, Europe has demonstrated its strength and resilience by emerging more energy secure, with the green transition relatively on course, and avoiding economic recession. But challenges still loom, as the rise in energy costs has created a systemic challenge for European industry and competitiveness. While European solidarity behind Ukraine has been maintained, and the threat of Russian energy extortion has been largely extinguished, the political fallout from the shock is still being felt. Anti-incumbent political sentiment remains high, leading to a surge in far-right parties. Opposition to Europe’s climate agenda has grown and will likely result in a new European Parliament that is less supportive of strong climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Europe faces cross-cutting pressures. On the one hand, there is a strong economic need to increase Europe’s domestic energy supplies. For most European countries, aggressive deployment of renewables will be the most cost-effective course, balancing cost with climate ambition. But rising pressures could lead to backsliding. If high energy costs are blamed on the transition to low-carbon energy, they could inspire populist opposition to the “green agenda” and stall bolder action in the coming years. And the establishment of secure supply chains for clean energy technology remains a challenge, so that Europe does not swap one form of dependence for another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;唯一罪成被告賴振邦求情：非主腦角色、僅提供協助&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IfSdgGM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團上周四裁定6人罪名不成立，僅「無名小隊」賴振邦的交替罪「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立，他今（2日）於高等法院求情。辯方希望法庭接納賴並非本案主腦，他僅在某些方面提供協助。辯方又指，無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。法官張慧玲根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。張官押後判刑，以待其餘認罪被告完成求情。為「污點證人」的黃振強將於本月26日求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴振邦（案發時29歲，現時33歲）被裁定屬交替罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴已還柙4年，他今身穿黑色西裝，由懲教押解出犯人欄，出庭時一度向旁聽親友揮手。被判無罪的張銘裕亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴由大律師是香媛及余承熹代表。控方讀出其經歷口供，指他於2020年1月17日被捕，19日獲准保釋，同年9月5日再因本案被捕。辯方透露，賴希望能夠在今日判刑，惟法官張慧玲指不會於今天判刑，因要待其餘認罪被告完成求情，預計會在10月判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴無參與小隊會議試爆亦非他負責操作&quot;&gt;辯方：賴無參與小隊會議、試爆亦非他負責操作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，罪成的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，與「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪絕對不相同，兩者在最高判刑上有分別。辯方指，希望法庭接納賴並非主腦，他只是在某些方面提供協助。他亦沒有參與小隊的會議，即使是在其工作室後樓梯進行的試爆，均是由策劃者吳智鴻負責攜帶炸藥以及操作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&quot;&gt;辯方：未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。張官表示，根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應該未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。陪審團只能肯定賴有份參與試槍，以及他是 Telegram 帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」的使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴為人孝順還柙期間進修增值&quot;&gt;辯方：賴為人孝順、還柙期間進修增值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴在獄中有寫求情信予法官，而賴的胞姊及家人亦有撰寫求情信。辯方表示，家人認為賴是一名孝順的兒子，他待人接物真誠友善，並樂於助人。賴在還柙期間並無放棄自己，更進修增值，希望出獄後成為有用的人。辯方亦指，稍後會補交與本案相關的案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪亦不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（2日）處理最後一批被告、9名新界東初選參與者的求情，包括何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。庭外續現排隊旁聽人龍，有市民稱因721事件認識何桂藍，因此通宵排隊支持她，並稱讚何「硬淨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，何桂藍的偶像黃耀明（明哥）今日亦有到庭旁聽，曾與她一同看達明一派演唱會、在何入獄後代她送花予明哥的友人Louis說：「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽-望港人續關心法庭案&quot;&gt;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽 望港人續關心法庭案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獲裁定罪脫、曾參與超區初選的李予信，今早再席排隊入席旁聽。他指關心法庭正審訊的案件已成其日常，望港人能繼續關心各法庭案件，並照顧好自己的心情，「我都係做緊呢樣嘢，係我嘅日常」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZnYkcO3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥-友人等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&quot;&gt;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥 友人：等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis今早約七時半前來排隊旁聽。Louis早在數年前的學運已認識何桂藍，難忘2020年亦曾與其看達明一派演唱會，並一起送花；惟後來何因47人案被捕，到了2021年只有他獨自送足六場花。他說，「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。另外，「慢必」陳志全為Louis相識超過十年的同志平權朋友，近年亦會與在獄中的劉頴匡交流流行曲歌詞心得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis說，今次並非首次前來旁聽，而前來旨在聽審，不一定是要與被告們見面，「心態反而係想聽返成個過程」，指雖然會有熱心人在網上作文字直播，但始終認為「自己聽到先係最真」。他留意到「長毛」梁國雄等人陳情時，也帶出不少訊息，他鼓勵香港人將訊息消化，再加以實踐，「去消化返啲message，喺今時今日、咁嘅環境下，仲有咩好做，多過係覺得佢好慘，或者好勁」，寄語香港人反思當下自己仍然可以做的事，「去諗返我哋嘅身位可以做到啲咩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;因721認識何桂藍-市民讚硬淨&quot;&gt;因721認識何桂藍 市民讚「硬淨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70後市民蘇太昨晚凌晨約12時到達法院外，希望能進入正庭聽審。她向《獨媒》表示，今日前來主要為支持何桂藍和鄒家成。她在721事件認識何桂藍，其後曾聽聞何在獄中過得很辛苦而感到心痛，欣賞她即使身陷牢獄，仍能在艱難時期堅持發聲，認為何是個很「硬淨」的女生。蘇太亦稱欣賞鄒家成敢於追求公義，慨嘆自己這代人享受了由年輕人背負重擔所得來的成果，故此希望「幫佢哋行未行完嘅路」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂智恆養母不在港-朋友代撐場&quot;&gt;呂智恆養母不在港 朋友代「撐場」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiffany約7時半來到，她是呂智恆養母Elsa的朋友，因Elsa目前不在港，她希望到場支持呂。她說自己一向有關心在囚人士，並有做一些支援工作，因此認識呂。她形容，呂是個執着公義的人，「這是優點也是缺點」，又指今次案件是對他的人生課題，希望他能應付這課題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;旁聽市民respect何桂藍仲可以咁講&quot;&gt;旁聽市民：respect何桂藍「仲可以咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李先生則表示，特別記掛何桂藍，對她很「respect」，形容她早前在庭上作供是「難得囉，仲可以咁講」、在被告中很優秀（outstanding）。他認為被告「只係講返個truth（真相）咋嘛，truth is out there」，「雖然都知個outcome（結果）係咩，都要做」，至於如何詮釋則是法官的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在大學從事研究的李，曾與郭家麒共事，他上周來旁聽新西被告求情時，也在延伸庭看到何桂藍，認為她比想像中活躍、精神不錯。被問想對被告說什麼，李指「冇乜特別嘢，辛苦晒佢哋」。李今亦帶同「想和你到水塔上看星星」的黑色環保袋，他說平日也有用，非今天特別攜帶，但也覺得「幾有意思」：「就算你唔係咩，我都覺得你都想同你someone去水塔睇星星。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上近8時，現場有旁聽人士起衝突，有市民指戴口罩的女士是「排隊黨」，高呼：「惠州新動力！逢一三五喺度排隊！」、「收錢知唔知可恥、有冇良心呀」，「排隊攞錢，食咗腸穿肚爛」，警員一度上前了解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】新界東初選參加者今日求情，歌手黃耀明今早現身法庭旁聽。其中一名被告、前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍是他的粉絲，何在早休散庭時向旁聽席雙手擺頭做「大心心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃今日身穿黑色上衣，上面印有荷蘭阿姆斯特丹大學的字樣，何曾在該大學讀碩士課程。黃稱今日前來不止是支持何桂藍，亦是來支持「慢必」陳志全等人，「畀佢哋知道我哋仲喺度支持緊佢哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於何桂藍沒有求情，黃耀明說：「佢一路都係好堅持佢自己嘅立場，我希望佢可以繼續stay strong……（有無咩想同佢哋講？）我真係唔知點講，因為其實真係好艱難，我希望佢哋無論作出決定，佢哋都堅強地繼續落去。同埋希望佢哋平安。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】9名新界東初選參與者今日求情，其中包括前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍。她在獄中還柙三年半，今早表明不作求情，不過她仍有多名好友特意到法庭旁聽。前西貢區議員陳嘉琳說，想讓何知道「佢仲有好多朋友，佢啲朋友都會認真生活」，又相信她「直到呢一刻都冇後悔及願意為自己所做的事承擔」；前民陣召集人楊政賢則說，因從前接受何訪問而認識她，希望何知道自己很掛念她，亦「持續被佢inspire」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳今早9時左右到法院，特意穿上粉紅色衫，「Anson Lo（何的偶像）代表色嘛」。她說早前在何接受審訊期間亦有到場，當時沒有「排隊黨」，因此順利進入正庭，今日則可能要在延伸庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳與何桂藍因初選認識，當時何參選新界東，而陳是時任西貢區議員，在何擺街站時會「幫吓手」。陳嘉琳說，過去都有定時探監，每月見何一次，指她每次上庭前都會「備戰狀態」，上個月見她時已經「好認真、有準備」：「有啲人可能覺得，呢啲程序嘢走完就算，但對阿藍嚟講，每一庭都好重要，因為一日個trial（審訊）未完，呢個運動未完。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她又說，何的意志很強，相信她「直到呢一刻都冇後悔及願意為自己所做的事承擔」，「很值得appreciate」。至於今日到庭，陳說最主要是想她知道「佢仲有好多朋友（笑），佢啲朋友都會認真生活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊政賢則曾接受何桂藍訪問，認識約十年：「可能再之前係網友，以前鍾意上網鬧交（笑）」。他對上一次見到何是她接受審訊時，形容她sharp（醒目）、很有原則和有強烈的人本精神：「對於佢寫嘅人同事都有好多關懷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成友人盼讓被告知我哋一路冇遺忘&quot;&gt;鄒家成友人：盼讓被告知「我哋一路冇遺忘」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成友人、作家「薯伯伯」與鄒相識近三年多，過去亦有採望和寫信給他，交流佛學想法。他形容鄒為人真誠，清晰知道自己的理念，並會用實踐方式進行修為：「而唔係得口講，而係有積極態度面對佢身處嘅環境。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒早前因七一案判刑，薯伯伯對上一次見他已是他判刑前。他覺得，初選案是香港歷史上關鍵的事，今日前來是想讓被告和大家都知道「有香港人在見證，我哋一路冇遺忘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsXtdYk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中代表何桂藍的大律師Trevor Beel表示確認何的定罪紀錄，並指除此以外沒有求情。沒有律師代表的劉頴匡則自行陳詞，指他參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決預算案並非重點，亦認為35+並不可能，望法庭考慮他為「積極參與者」的低至中程度。劉現正就七一立會暴動案服刑，他指該案與初選案時間、背景和目標相近，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉在庭上又讀出女友黃于喬撰寫的求情信，黃指以劉的天資和才能，本能走一條「正常」的路，但他選擇從政，是出於對社會關懷、對民主化追求、望為港貢獻，不料因本案身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金時期」於獄中渡過。黃指劉還柙3年多每日風雨不改探望，正因不認為他是「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」的罪犯，而是值得她繼續關心和付出的人。黃又指，劉過去未曾妄想顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不再妄想能投身政治改變社會，只盼盡快重獲自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦呈上親撰的求情信，提及真誠相信初選不違法，如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。劉又指服刑是懲罰他所愛的人，對女友感到愧疚，明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9被告今求情-歌手黃耀明等旁聽&quot;&gt;9被告今求情 歌手黃耀明等旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的被告，包括經審訊後罪成的何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷，以及認罪的劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。至於同參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄及柯耀林，則已於上周完成求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。何桂藍由大律師Trevor Beel代表，楊岳橋由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，陳志全由大律師馬維騉代表，鄒家成由大律師陳世傑代表，林卓廷和呂智恆由大律師沈士文代表，范國威由大律師吳靄儀代表，林景楠由大律師范凱傑代表。劉頴匡則沒有律師代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K8lCKYN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，分成三排，由6名懲教看管。獲保釋的林景楠穿黑色西裝、戴黑色格仔領帶和深藍口罩，呂智恆穿淺藍色長袖裇衫。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的陳志全戴眼鏡，穿黑色上衣。鄒家成則穿白色上衣、卡其色短袖外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘被告還柙逾3年半，劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝、打深藍色領帶，慢必陳志全穿深藍Polo上衣、黑西裝外套。林卓廷穿粉紅色裇衫、深藍色西裝外套，楊岳橋穿白裇衫、深藍色外套，不時翹手。范國威穿白裇衫、灰色西裝外套。何桂藍則穿白色背心，戴高的短馬尾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉親自求情-稱屬積極參與者中低程度&quot;&gt;劉親自求情 稱屬「積極參與者」中低程度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後沒有律師代表的劉頴匡親自以英文求情。他表示，採納法律代表早前呈交的書面陳詞，包括因及時認罪減刑三分一，今再就其參與程度等作補充。劉指，判詞清楚指出參與初選並非違法，違法的是無差別否決預算案的協議，認為法庭判刑時應集中於他推動否決預算案的參與，而非論壇發言等。劉並認為自己屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但並非最積極，而是屬中至低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無轉發墨落抗爭派記者會無發言&quot;&gt;劉稱無轉發「墨落」、抗爭派記者會無發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉解釋，其名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明，但與其他被告不同，他沒有在個人社交平台再轉發，亦無在選舉論壇提及。他指該聲明對其他候選人來說，是很好的機會強調否決財案的決心，如果他更加積極參與，應會在庭上質問其他人為何不簽署、以及轉發帖文，但他沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，即使他參與7月15日的抗爭派記者會，而會上有人提及對否決預算案的想法，他也沒有提出反對，但他在會上沒有說過任何一句話、沒有回答記者問題或就否決發言，大部分時間如背景般站在後面，唯一做的只是與其他人「攬頭攬頸」拍照。劉指，他當然同意否決預算案，亦曾簽署組織者準備的文件，因此屬積極參與者，但並非最積極。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲否決財案非重點&quot;&gt;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決財案非重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述在新東初選論壇的發言，提及自己因七一立會案身負暴動罪，但無怨無悔，望能用選票授權最有堅定意志的抗爭隊伍，向世界宣告「沒有暴動，只有暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，由此可見他參選的目的，是望進入立法會，為像他一樣被以暴動罪拘捕的示威者發聲，對他來說，否決預算案並非重點、也不重要。法官陳慶偉指，但特赦示威者是五大訴求之一，而要令政府回應的唯一方法，就是要以無差別否決預算案威脅政府。劉表示，認為五大訴求並不可能。法官李運騰總結，即劉同意參與無差別否決的協議，但否決並非他主要關注，劉確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後再問，如政府回應五大訴求，劉作為暴動案被告也會得益。劉指有可能會、也有可能不會，指不知道政府如何回應五大訴求；而且作為合理的人，他不期望政府會回應全部訴求，即使非常努力，可能最多只回應三數個，甚或一個也不回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱政府能dq不信35是可能&quot;&gt;劉稱政府能DQ、不信35+是可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續提到論壇被問及，為何選民要投票予可能坐監的他，他回答「完全唔覺得35+係一個切實嘅目標嚟」，相信是「天空樓閣」。劉指，其意思是如選民希望有人在議會否決預算案，就不要投選他，因他很有機會入獄，強調他在案發時，已明確表示自己不相信35+是可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指劉於今年就暴動案判刑，關注他何時認罪。劉指他現時沒有資料，但是在2020年初選論壇之後，他亦無預計會隔這麼久才判刑。法官李運騰追問他何時認罪、能否舉出年份，劉此時轉身望向同涉立會暴動案認罪的鄒家成，鄒發笑，其後笑着指向劉：「我2023，你唔知。」控方其後確認，劉是於2021年9月表示擬認罪，並於2023年5月認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，否決計劃不可能實現，政府只需DQ一至兩個人，計劃便不可能。法官陳慶偉問為什麼，劉指因最樂觀的情況，也只能拿到35或36席。陳慶偉說，「戴耀廷不是這樣想（not according to D1）」，劉同意，但指他不同意戴，並說「戴耀廷是一個有趣的人，他總是能將客觀不可能的事，變成看起來有威脅性的事」，林卓廷、楊岳橋等被告發笑。陳慶偉說，但被告決定跟隨戴耀廷行事，劉回應，因他有自己的議程，認為參與計劃能幫助他實現。劉又說，本案涉及所有市民、特區甚至中央政府，當局有很多方法能阻礙他們成功，望法庭考慮情況特別，給予額外折扣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉指計劃公開-望給予額外扣減&quot;&gt;劉指計劃公開 望給予額外扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，除非其案情很特別（extraordinary），否則不會額外扣減，舉例額運大量危險藥物，即使被攔截、計劃不能實現，但主腦被捕時，也不會因其計劃不可能而給予扣減。劉表示明白，但強調「從未聽過任何一個串謀是如此公開」，沒有毒販會舉行記者會說自己販毒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉另涉立會暴動案-望考慮整體量刑減刑&quot;&gt;劉另涉立會暴動案 望考慮整體量刑減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續確認，預計今年12月11日就暴動案服刑完畢。他承認在暴動案保釋期間干犯初選案，但指他是因涉暴動案，才選擇參與初選。劉解釋，涉暴動案保釋期間，他盡力信守對法庭的承諾，不去參與非法集會和暴力活動。但他當時仍想找方法追尋其信念如「五大訴求」，故考慮了最安全、合法的選擇，即戴耀廷提倡的35+計劃，指戴作為法律學者，表示這是最安全的計劃。劉說，他最終因對法律的無知而參選，望法庭即使因他保釋期間犯案而加刑，也不會加刑太多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，他所涉的兩宗案件，案發時間和背景相近，均源自2019年反修例運動，目標同樣是「五大訴求」；兩案亦同樣涉干預立法會的運作，只是方式不同，暴動案涉武力、本案則涉憲制手段，但如法官所指，手段暴力與否或非最重要。劉指，若非身負暴動案，「我可能根本不會站在這裡」，而他就暴動罪已被重判7年（認罪扣減後判監54個月20天），是同類最嚴重，望法庭能考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，因其暴動案刑期於12月會服畢，提議法庭可直接在現有刑期減刑。法官李運騰指，現時未知劉的刑期，但可能比他暴動的刑期更長，又指不是說能在劉另案服刑完畢前判刑，但法庭會有方法考慮該原則減刑。李又指，不會承諾考慮該原則，又指劉在保釋期間犯案，或抵銷因整體量刑原則而減去的刑期。劉表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀黃求情信從政非為私利非作奸犯科偷呃拐騙罪犯&quot;&gt;庭上讀黃求情信：從政非為私利、非「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」罪犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後表示，呈交了來自他本人、朋友、女友、傳道人、前僱主的求情信，同意以其過往紀錄，他或不被視為良好品格。劉續指，「有時最親近我們的人，可能比我們更了解我們自己、比我們更好觀察我們自己」，故他選擇讀出女友的求情信節錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉引述求情信，黃指她是一名性別議題倡議者，也是劉的女朋友，「2024年是我與劉相識的第10年」。黃指，在她眼中，劉是一個「聰明、能言善辯、具領導天賦、不斷渴求知識、思維敏銳、語言能力強、充滿好奇心嘅人」，在他以前，黃交往的男生「出身傳統名校、中產、規規矩矩」，但劉卻不一樣，他出身基層、其中學黃無聽過、「都唔係好靚仔」，「但他身上卻有一種不一樣嘅光芒」。說到「唔係好靚仔」時，劉表示他不同意（which I do not agree），庭上多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述求情信，指以劉頴匡的天資和才能，他本來絕對有能力走一條「正常」的路，成為律師或教師等專業人士，過安穩舒適的中產生活。但他有志從政非為一己私利，完全是出於對社會人⺠的關懷、對香港⺠主化的追求、望能為港貢獻其才能，卻不料因此捲入此案、身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金嘅時期都喺牢獄中渡過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續說，認識劉頴匡時19歲，現在已29歲，十年的關係中，有三年多隔著監獄高牆，要透過限時電話筒、隔着探訪室玻璃見面對話。「還押三年多，我每日風雨不改到收押所探佢，正正因為我認為佢唔係作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙嘅罪犯，係個值得我繼續關心同付出嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指三年多來，香港改變很多，亦知道一直被收押的劉已得到莫大懲罰。他過去固然未曾妄想要顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不會再妄想能夠投身政治改變社會、不會再沾邊任何有可能被定性為危害國安的行為。黃指，只望劉能盡快重獲自由，透露劉獄中攻讀學位，也自學多種語言、運動強身健體，望離開監獄時「他已是更好、更強、更成熟的人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後說，認為無人能比女友更好地見證他的成長。黃聞言眼眶泛紅，並用手拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&quot;&gt;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦向法庭呈上親撰的求情信，但無在庭上讀出。據《獨媒》記者取得的信件（英文全文如下），劉在信中提到很清楚因嚴重罪行面臨長期監禁，但對他來說仍然有點不真實，他一直被教導成為一個關心和參與社會的好公民，盡力做好自己的角色，但最後卻入獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，他並非在2019年社會不穩後才從政的機會主義者，自2013年已參與社區事務，他承認知悉並同意戴耀廷提出的計劃，但從非其競選活動重點，他真誠相信初選不違法，而且如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，他現時30歲，應是建立家庭和事業的黃金時代，但他在獄中3年，可能要服刑更多年。劉指這並非對他的懲罰，也是懲罰他所愛的人。他特別對一直照顧她的女友感到愧疚，又指獄中裝備自己，他明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。大律師陳世傑庭上讀出鄒家成的求情信節錄。鄒的社交媒體發布信件全文，當中提到他在15歲時首次參與七一遊行，令他明白社會不公，他參政望為民發聲，實現真正民主化，雖從未信35+可能，但始終深信民主的價值，即使今天為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍相信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，他由始至終無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身已構成危害國安，《國安法》生效後他一度想退選，但自覺身為政治人物肩負對人民的責任而繼續，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去」。鄒指他初心始終不變，依然相信民主與公羲、關懷弱者、望香港變得更好，獄中數年他努力讀書、修身修心，雖不知何時重獲自由，但盼出獄時能自豪說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑陳詞指，鄒屬於「積極參加者」，但他基於錯誤法律意見犯案；而鄒現正就立會暴動案服刑，望法庭避免判處壓毀性刑罰。陳最後又特別提到，本案被告是好人，只是不幸在錯誤的地點和時間出現，當中包括醫生、律師等，懷着良好意願參選、非為私利，並非真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「在這宗案，寬容是有必要的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;七一遊行雨傘運動為關心社會契機-盼建更公義社會&quot;&gt;七一遊行、雨傘運動為關心社會契機 盼建更公義社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑讀出鄒求情信部分內容。據《獨媒》取得的求情信（全文見文末），鄒家成指自己出身基層、一家七口靠綜緩渡日，15歲時照顧患病的父親，令他培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。父親病逝後，他奮發圖強讀書，最終如願入讀大學修讀護理，準備日後成為護士，幫助社會上像其父親那樣無法自理的病者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同是15歲那年，鄒跟隨師兄首次參加七一遊行，自言「我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震撼」，也覺醒到其家庭的困境是數十萬家庭共同面對的問題，現象背後是社會結構性不公。鄒形容，那次遊行成為他關心社會、積極參與公民事務的契機，「只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會」，他之後每年也會參與遊行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，因着對社會的關懷，2014年雨傘運動亦不時抽空到場支持。有段時間，他每天放學便到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書、與其他人談及對香港未來的想像。鄒說，運動雖然失敗，未有爭取到港人渴求的民主政制，但卻更堅定他參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言真正「為人民服務的民選政府（government of the people, by the people, for the people）」，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫、為社會帶來公義。而雨傘運動也令他相信透過公民參與，「我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力」。鄒直言：「這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無意違反國安法基於對人民責任繼續參選&quot;&gt;無意違反《國安法》、基於對人民責任繼續參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續表示，他參政「就是希望為民發聲」，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。他從未相信35+的可能性，但始終深信民主的價值，即使為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，「由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。」《國安法》生效後他一度萌生退選念頭，驅使他繼續參選的，「是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任」，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。」因此在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後繼續「與民同行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指今天的他與15歲相比，起了不少變化，但自言初心始終不變，「我依然相信民主與公羲，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。」鄒指在獄中的幾年，「努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心」，學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習何為無條件的愛，「這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心」。鄒最後說，不知道距離重獲人身自由還有多久，「我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：『這些年我都沒有枉過』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案-屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案 屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑陳詞指，鄒家成被錯誤的法律意見所誤導、基於對法律的無知犯案，有人甚至說，戴耀廷作為一個法律學者，可能比律師有更好的法律意見，但《國安法》後對初選是否合法存有不確定性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳接納，法庭判刑時可參考刑期分級制，並可視鄒家成為刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。陳指，鄒在案中非關鍵人物、可有可無，對計劃無真正幫助；他不迴避鄒發起「墨落無悔」聲明，但強調文件屬多餘（superfluous）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕不成熟&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕、不成熟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續提到鄒的背景，指形容他為激進是太過嚴苛和錯誤，認為鄒提倡香港民族理念，不應被視為加刑因素。陳又指，鄒並非提倡暴力對抗中國，只是對抗因殖民時代遺留下來的不公制度，望法庭考慮犯案時他只是20多歲，在2019年社會不穩下，作為「熱血青年」，不知道世界現實上如何運作，只以他所知的對錯向前衝如蠻牛（mad bull），但他並非為個人私利，而是為香港人的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，考慮到鄒的愚蠢、不成熟、沒有足夠資訊（ill-informed），社會當時又經歷多人參與的示威，鄒很容易被社會的高漲情緒所蒙蔽，但他已得到了教訓。陳又指，鄒之所以在協調會議和社交平台大聲疾呼（vociferous），均顯示他對他所相信是對的事的決心和渴望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒另涉立會案-辯方指同出於對基本法不滿-望考慮整體情況減刑&quot;&gt;鄒另涉立會案 辯方指同出於對《基本法》不滿 望考慮整體情況減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，鄒雖因七一立會暴動案被捕，但於本案提控後，才於2021年3月就立會案提堂，並於2023年8月去信表示認罪。陳指，兩案性質均是政治，表達出鄒家成對《基本法》的不滿，鄒在立會案的行為包括撕毀《基本法》，因認為沒有妥當落實，以此表達他的沮喪，這亦是他參選的原因。陳又指，鄒於該案刑期逾5年，已服出代價，並預計於一年半內服刑完畢，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑，避免判處壓毀性（crushing effect）的刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指本案被告是好人-寬容是有必要&quot;&gt;辯方指本案被告是好人 寬容是有必要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後指，經歷近120審訊、及過去一個月的求情，他希望說，「在正常情況下，本案被告是好人，只是不幸地在錯誤的地點和時間出現（In normal circumstances, these are good people, unfortunately, they found themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time.）」。陳指，本案被告來自社會不同界別，具有重要和成功的地位，像是醫生、律師、航空業、衞生界、立法會議員、社工和有抱負的學生，他們懷着良好意願參與運動，非為私利，但突然全變成非法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳比喻，《國安法》生效時，被告就像在一架失控的車上，以其自身動力高速前進，所有人都需要面對很長的刑期，也對個人生活有很毀滅性的後果，不僅影響他們自己，也影響他們身邊的人。陳續說，這是他個人的看法，並望法庭考慮，「35+計劃」是由一班業餘人士（amateur）聚起來，嘗試如專業人士般行事，計劃若不是注定失敗、也只有很少機會實現，甚至可說是「蠢得可笑（farcical）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又說，除了首5名被告，沒有任何其他被告有資格停止「35+計劃」，只有組織者有資格和責任這樣做，但最後沒有這樣做。法官李運騰說，他們選擇「跳船（jump）」，陳同意，指他們只是自己跳船。陳又說，法官對處理嚴重罪犯有經驗，但本案被告不是真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「寬容是本案的關鍵，尤其在這宗案，寬容是有必要的（mercy is warrant）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒女友鄒正直善良身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&quot;&gt;鄒女友：鄒正直善良、身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦呈上鄒家成女友求情信（全文見文末）。據《獨媒》取得的信件，女友指與鄒相識三年多，鄒是她遇過「最正直善良、堅韌和有承擔的人」，她過去一年抑鬱症病發，鄒在探訪和書信靜心聆聽她的經歷，分擔其苦痛，即使被高牆阻隔，「我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，即使鄒身陷囹圄，但從不鬆懈，仍努力學習、保持思考，每天看書、讀報、唸經、打坐等，讀過的每本書都有筆跡和讀後感，信件很多關於對生命和學習的反思，亦依舊關心社會和世界，近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，都看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女友鄒投身政治非為私利學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&quot;&gt;女友：鄒投身政治非為私利、學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒2020年末起篤信佛教，在牆內一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨，鄒指當下最希望可以實踐「無條件的愛」，由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人、身邊的朋友，乃至理念不同的人。而鄒因無法從護理系學士畢業，望出獄後赴外國進修取得學位，彌補遺憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅是因為他無法離群眾而去、無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠盼着她終有一天變好。女友表示，感激這個美好的相遇，會繼續堅定地在路上陪鄒面對每個難關、互相扶持，一起成為更好的人，善良如初。她由衷希望鄒和他所愛的人能早日重聚，懇請法官能予他及早重啟人生的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成求情信全文&quot;&gt;鄒家成求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日我希望向閣下分享我在15歲那年發生的兩件事情。它們對我的生命有著深刻的影響，能協助閣下更透徹地理解今日站在你們面前的第37被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先是我父親的病逝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我出生自基層家庭。自我有記憶以來，父親一直惡病纏身。失去經濟支柱，我們一家七口很長一段時間只能依靠綜援度日。然而，由於他早年經常對其他家庭成員暴力相向，弄得家中永無寧日，即使後來他病情惡化要人院，家中除了母親之外也沒若麼人會去探望他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在我15歲那年的某一日，醫生批准他出院。踏進家門的一刻，看到昔日那個動不動就大發雷霆的家暴者，如今卻成了一個駝著背、瘦骨嶙峋、每走一步都相當吃力的老病人，我曾經內心對他的恨意頓時全消，只想讓眼前的人在生命最後的時光能過上更有尊嚴的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一方面是為了父親，另一方面也是為了分擔母親的辛勞，自那一天起，我每日放學便會幫忙照顧他，砌病床，分配菓物、餵食飯、幫忙洗澡…..大概就是這段日子，我漸漸培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。只要尚有一絲餘力，我都希望盡我所能使他們少一點痛苦，過上更好一點的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不久，他就病逝了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不再需要回家照顧父親，每日放學後我改到自修室讀書。發奮圖強，只為成為一個更有能力的人，幫助更多弱者。最終，我如願入讀大學，修讀護理，準備日後成為一名護士，幫助社會上無數像我父親當年那樣無法自理的病者。我還記得收到大學錄取通知的那一天，母親笑得特別燦爛。我知這，我正走在上對的這路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一件對我影響深遠的事情是我首次的公民參與。15歲那年，在忙於照顧父親的期間，機緣巧合之下我跟隨一位中學師兄第一次參加「七一遊行」。在遊行隊伍中，縱使天氣炎熱、人群擠擁，我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震憾。我覺醒到我家庭所面對的困境絕非我們一家七口獨有，而是數以十萬計家庭所共同面對的問題。現象背後，更是有著社會的結構性不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時我年紀尚小，未懂得有條理地分析社會問題，更遑論是提出具建設性的解決方案。但那一次遊行卻成為了我關心社會，積極參與公民事務的契機。亦是在那一天開始，我對弱者的關懷更進一步拓展為對香港弱勢社群及被壓迫者的責任感。只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會。自那天以後，每一年我都會參與遊行，風雨不改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;亦因這份對社會的關懷，當香港在2014年爆發雨傘運動，即使忙於準備翌年的公開試，我也不時抽空到現場支持運動。有段時間，每天放學就身穿校服背著書包，走到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書，再與其他示威者聊天談著對香港未來的想像，就成了我每天的日常。就結果而言，運動是失敗的，我們未有爭取到香港人渴求的民主政制。但對我而言，這場運動卻是更加堅定了我參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言的一個真正「為人民服務的民選政府」(government of the people, by the people, for the people)，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫，為社會帶來公義。更重要的是，這場運動使我相信透過公民參與，我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如我作供時所說，我參政，就是希望為民發聲，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。或許與其他人不同的是，我從未相信35+的可能性，但與不少香港人一樣，我始終深信民主的價值。即使今日我為爭取民主而身陷囹圄，但我仍然相信，這個「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。《國安法》生效之後，我一度萌生退選念頭，驅使我繼續競選的，是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任。我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。於是，在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後，我決定重新上路，與民同行，走完最後一段初選之路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日的我跟15歲時相比，歷練固然多了，對自身及世界的理解也因此有了不少變化。但我的初心始終不變。我依然相信民主與公義，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。在獄中的這幾年，我努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心。我學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習安忍，學習懺侮，學習和諧與平靜，學習慷慨，學習何為無條件的愛。這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我不知這自己距離重獲人身自由還有多久，我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本人與鄒家成相識三年多，並發展成情侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成是我的伴侶，是我最好的朋友，也是我遇過最正直善良、堅韌、謙卑和有承擔的人。他富有同理心，善於感受他人之苦，也從不吝嗇對受苦的人的關懷，眼裡皆是眾生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為伴侶，他尊重我的每一個選擇，鼓勵並支持我出國進修、增值自己，期許我們再遇之時皆能成為更強大的人。他曾對我說：「我想和你一起面對內心和世界的挑戰。」而他說到做到。他在我人生最壞的日子穩穩地接住我一去年我的抑鬱症復發，他在探訪和書信中靜心聆聽我的經歷，分擔我的苦痛。他更鼓勵我偕他一起研讀佛教思想，學習修行。他願意包容我的不足，也時常提醒我要多作反思一一學習慈悲、安住正念、觀照內心、心存規律、活在當下，這都是我從他身上學會的事情。這段日子，儘管被高牆阻隔，但我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為兒子，他為人顧家、孝順。他就讀中四那年，父親因病離世。而在其父患病臥床的那段日子，他為母親分擔作為照顧者的重擔一一洗澡、餵食飯、分配藥的份量，從而建立對護理的興趣。後來，他入讀香港都會大學護理系，立志成為一名護士。2021年還押期間，他申請保釋就是為了圓滿母親的心願—重尸難日卜在她面前戴著四方帽接過證書，走完一場畢業禮。保釋那段時間，他為家裡添置新傢俬，為自己安排好入獄的事宜，免讓家人操心。作為朋友，他博愛、慷慨、真誠待人。他時常關心朋友近況，善於將佛學思想套入生活，以自身經歷為朋友紓憂解困。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成身處牢獄已經三年。即使身陷囹圄，但他從不鬆懈，依然努力學習、保持思考，在泥濘中一步步前行。在獄中的日子，他堅持生活規律：每日看書、讀報紙、唸經、打坐、懺悔；每周做反思，總結學習目標、檢視進度。他著重自身改進，同時積極汲取及鑽研知識一一佛學、政治哲學、經濟、歷史、英語、寫作。他在監倉讀過的每本書，每頁都有筆跡，還有用間尺劃下重點的橫線；之後他會寫低十多頁筆記，再寫讀後感；有不理解的地方，他會把握每次探訪時間虛心向前輩請教。我們的信件中，很多也是關於他對生命和學習的反思，有時他更會向我分享閲讀感想，並邀請我給他反饋，不會放過每一個進步的機會。他依舊關心社會、關心世界：近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，他都能看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;三年前他因為官司纏身，最終無法以護理系學士身分畢業。他希望在出獄後能赴外國升學進修，取得一個自己心儀的學位，彌補當日的遺憾。而他在獄中勤於自學多種知識、專注鑽硏佛學，就是為離開監獄這一天做好準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成由2020年末起篤信佛教，至今三年多。對他來說，佛是智慧、慈悲和力量。佛教中有一句話：「菩薩不住相布施，其福德不可思量」，他矢志以「無分別心」幫助別人，不計較付出和回報。身處牆內三年，他一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨。他告訴我，當下最希望的是可以實踐「無條件的愛」一一由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人，愛身邊的朋友，乃至愛理念不同的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;生於斯，長於斯。家成和很多年輕人一樣，於香港土生土長27年，與這片土地一起歷盡高低跌宕，也會關心社會時政。不同的是，他將自我實踐扣連社會公義，奮不顧身地站到浪尖上。他投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅僅是因為他無法離群眾而去，無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠地盼著終有一天她能變得更好，這點並無因為時間流轉而改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我和鄒家成由相識到相戀，大部分相處時間都是隔著高牆、探訪室的玻璃，對話只能透過會計時倒數的電話筒，或需要等候多時的書信一一思念變得具體而殘酷。儘管如此，我依然感激這個美好的相遇。我會繼續堅定地在路上陪伴他面對每個難關、互相扶持彼此，在他出獄之時一起成為更好的人，善良如初。而我深信這天到來時，他擁有的會比失去的多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;愛別離苦，我由衷希望家成和他所愛的人能早日重聚，亦懇請法官能夠給予他及早重啟人生的機會，不要讓他失去希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024年7月9日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表求情，指楊在90年代舉家移民加拿大，在當地大學畢業之後，便前往北京修讀法學碩士，因為熱愛中國文化和歷史。蔡指從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist），並提到楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，其後在警方的邀請下提供證人口供，顯示楊完全的悔意。蔡庭上讀出楊親筆撰寫的求情信，稱作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪，犯案是完全錯誤和不理智；他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。至於陳志全，其代表大律師馬維騉指他在本案參與程度低，過往是一名勤奮和盡責的立法會議員，在任期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨立法會議員楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表作求情。蔡指楊出生於1981年，現年43歲，他在90年代跟隨家人移民到加拿大，並於2002年在當地的大學畢業，之後赴北京大學升學，修讀法學碩士。就當時而言，相比起到西方國家如美國和英國，前往中國內地讀書並非20年前人們的優先選項，惟楊願意踏出安舒區，在北京研習憲法及行政法學，不是為了建立有價值的事業，而是因為對中國文化和歷史的熱愛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，事實上楊十分欣賞中國文化和藝術，每逢農曆新年都會替人寫揮春，而且品質不錯。楊回到香港後，繼續修畢法律專業證書（P.C.LL.）課程，其後於2009年成為大律師。他最終於2016年的立法會補選中當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist）。在2018年8月，他與時任立法會（資訊科技界）議員莫乃光到訪美國矽谷灣區考察，事後收到感謝信。蔡指楊相信香港政府具透明度和有效率，會使香港成為一個合適外國投資的城市，楊亦向國際宣傳香港，鼓勵美國機構駐守香港及投資，指香港有法治制度、實行普通法，香港會在數碼時代裡擔任電子產業的軸心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，雖然楊作為政治人物，屬於泛民主派，但是他並非主張阻撓議會或激進派別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&quot;&gt;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，楊於2021年2月因本案還柙，他隨即在同年3月退出公民黨，並與黨友溝通指公民黨應該解散。楊日後不希望再涉足政治，只想做一個平凡公民，顯示他的重犯機會是零。在他過往擔任議員期間，他致力服務不同市民，即使在工餘時間也會協助不同社群解決法律疑難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡強調，楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，是最大求情因素。其法律代表早於2021年9月去信律政司表達認罪意向，之後於同年11月向法庭表示會認罪。在2022年6月，楊在交付高院的聆訊中承認控罪，乃表示悔意的典型表現。蔡並提到，楊在警方的邀請下提供口供，雖然最終控方未有傳召他為證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，楊協助警方這項因素會被納入在認罪扣減之中。蔡則回應指，這顯示楊完全的悔意，並會用盡一切方法去協助警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋親撰求情信對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&quot;&gt;楊岳橋親撰求情信：對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡呈上由楊岳橋於今年8月16日親筆撰寫的求情信，他在信中表示，作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪。他有機會在還柙期間回望自己的從政生涯，當初從政是為了使香港變得更好，惟盲目的反政府心態，導致當時的政治境況惡化。他又表示，很後悔未有及時從否決財政預算案的計劃抽身，而且自己的錯誤行為亦導致公民黨黨友加入這個錯誤和無望的計劃，相信案件為黨友的家人帶來焦慮和壓力，他為此感到抱歉，並強調自己犯案是完全錯誤和不理智。他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於蔡強調被告的參與程度應取決於他們在2020年7月1日之後的行為，法官李運騰則表示，雖然控罪時期乃由7月1日開始，但是楊在7月1日之前頗為積極參與「35+」計劃，這點辯方不能否認，而法庭可由此考慮楊意志堅決。辯方則指，在7月1日，即國安法生效之後，楊的參與行為就只有3項，包括在初選中投票、擺街站及提交立法會參選提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡又指，雖然楊岳橋在2020年3月已擔任公民黨黨魁，但是他在黨內仍然是年資較淺的立法會議員，所以崗位上只屬政黨的發言人，而不是黨內的主要推手。法官陳慶偉則明言，不會接受這方面的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡總結指楊屬「積極參與者」，量刑起點應介乎3至10年的幅度，並且應該採用該幅度的中間點，冀法庭給予認罪的全數三分一扣減，亦希望能基於楊長期服務社群而給予進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全參與程度低任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全參與程度低、任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，陳不是組織者或策劃者，僅屬於「積極參與者」，而且在國安法生效之前，陳在本案的參與程度已是相對低，他並沒有出席任何「35+」記者會，也沒有參與協調會議，在 WhatsApp 群組中，除了曾經回覆「thank you」之外，其餘時間都是「已讀不回」。在國安法生效之後，陳的參與程度更加低，他並沒有出席7月6日的民間論壇或7月15日的抗爭派記者會，僅進行自己的競選活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，在案發期間，陳志全任職立法會議員，並且以勤奮和盡責的態度履行職責，冀法庭基於此接受陳有良好品格。馬指，陳的妹妹和配偶均替他撰寫求情信，形容陳為孝子、關愛的兄長和有愛的伴侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，從大量朋友的求情信可見，陳是一名勤奮的立法會議員，過往積極地替性小眾利益發聲，亦有前政府官員替他撰寫求情信，綜合以上，冀法庭酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他被告分別被安排在第一庭和第二庭觀看直播，在第一庭的被告包括：王百羽、伍健偉、岑子杰、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、梁晃維、吳政亨和馮達浚。在第二庭旁聽的被告包括余慧明、黃子悅、袁嘉蔚、黃碧雲和吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。林卓廷一方指，林的參與程度屬最低，他無出席協調會議、其代表亦在會上反對否決，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明、無提過否決預算案，一直是傳統民主派，支持一國兩制、香港回歸中國，望法庭考慮他為判監3年以下的「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀則強調，否決程序為《基本法》所容許，又指本案謀劃非常公開，加上政府有「大殺傷力武器」可DQ參選人，謀劃不可能實現，望法庭考慮情況特殊而減刑。吳又指，范獲西貢區議會前主席吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，讚揚他務實無私及對地區民生的貢獻，庭上並呈上范3年前為街坊所畫牛年年畫；范的女兒亦形容他是「最好的爸爸」。辯方指范望將一切抛諸腦後，專注家庭，望法庭視范為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件揭發圍標事件&quot;&gt;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件、揭發圍標事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的沈士文指，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從其往績和控方證人區諾軒的證供可印證。林任職立法會議員期間，曾揭發私人屋苑工程圍標情況，推動「反圍標」運動，涉事沙田屋苑居民亦撰寫求情信，講述林引起公眾關注圍標的非法行為。後來《競爭法》立法，林在立法會也是推手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林作為民主黨長期黨員，受到何俊仁邀請下擔任黨內秘書處職務，何亦有替林撰寫求情信。此外，民主黨前立法會議員張文光和劉慧卿，以及現正在海外留學的兒子，均有替林撰寫求情信。林的母親則讚揚林是孝子，經常到赤柱探訪兒子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林卓廷不主張否決預算案-亦無簽署墨落無悔聲明&quot;&gt;辯方：林卓廷不主張否決預算案 亦無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林的參與程度可說是眾被告中最低，他對於達成協議無差別否決預算案沒有任何興趣，亦無親自出席任何新東協調會議，對於涉案計劃全程不熱衷，代表他出席會議的黨友亦在會上表明不認同否決預算案，導致新東在會議結束後並未就否決達成共識，是在首被告戴耀廷推動下才最終達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，也不曾於選舉單張和社交平台提及否決預算案，他亦不認同「攬炒」或解散立法會等主張。林在初選論壇受到激進派候選人的施壓時，更反問若政府在預算案中承諾向每名香港市民派3萬元，如何投反對票，可見他並非積極參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林定罪是因搜出論壇筆記，以及時任民主黨主席胡志偉言論，以「共謀者原則」入罪，辯方尊重法庭的裁決，但必須強調林在本案的「串謀」中，角色非常輕微，認為林應屬「其他參加者」，即監禁3年以下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員-支持香港回歸中國和一國兩制&quot;&gt;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員 支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈強調，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從不激進，他跟從傳統民主派的立場，包括支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」的《基本法》概念，民主黨亦常與政府合作。而林自2016年起任立法會議員，紀錄顯示他非常勤奮，贊成的議案多於反對議案，指林無差別否決是與多年往績完全不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈另交代林的定罪紀錄，林就2018年「一地兩檢」會議衝突案，承認一項妨礙正在執行職責的立法會人員罪，在2022年12月被判囚3周，已服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀涉案謀劃公開政府可dq-不可能實現&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：涉案謀劃公開、政府可DQ 不可能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀，採納其他大狀的法律陳詞，認為本案並非顛覆國家政權罪最嚴重。吳又指，本案非常特殊，整個計劃非常公開、有大量文件記載（well-documented），令計劃埋下自我毀滅的種子。而被告雖稱否決權為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，但要達成的前提是有「35+」，然而行政機關也有「大殺傷力武器」去抗衡，選舉主任可以DQ參選人，本案31名參選被告中便有9人被DQ，計劃無可能實現。吳又指，即使有Plan B，該些參選人同樣會因其主張而被DQ；而政府最後也宣布押後選舉，被告根本無機會當選；即使立法會解散，特首也能批出短期撥款，法庭判詞提到的後果很難會出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ic1t1m0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
▲ 范國威&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，假若吳靄儀是正確，為何協調會議要討論替補機制、甚至有「Plan C」，吳重申，即使有Plan B、Plan C，政府也能DQ，或者他們根本無機會勝出；又指以否決預算案爭取五大訴求，政府拒絕回應，終致特首下台，是《基本法》允許的情況，「我們的憲制沒有那麼脆弱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指，根據《基本法》，即使立法會因否決預算案而解散，仍須經歷另一次選舉，否決同一份預算案，特首才須辭職，並指政府若選擇將同一份預算案呈上立法會、而不作任何改動是很奇怪，舉例若政府選擇派錢，新選出的立會有可能通過，相關程序的結果無法預視。吳重申，根據客觀事實，能否肯定同一班人會再當選、政府會提出原案、民主派會再否決該份預算案，均未可知，如法庭不能肯定謀劃會成功便應減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉主動提到，初選有逾61萬人投票，若謀劃不會成功，選民是否被騙：「你看，他們被承諾，投票可為香港政局帶來改變」，質疑被告若認為計劃不可能實現，是無向選民說出真相。吳指，難以知道所有選民投票的原因，並強調政府有責任維持穩定，對於謀劃公開、但政府容許投票發生而沒採取行動感到非常驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀量刑時不應考慮國安法前行為-官明言拒納&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：量刑時不應考慮《國安法》前行為 官明言拒納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續指，被告於《國安法》生效前行為並不構成罪行，認為判刑時不能就《國安法》前的行為懲罰他們。法官李運騰指，人的思想不會一夜改變，除非有證據顯示被告的改變，否則被告《國安法》前的行為，可用作推論他《國安法》後的心態和參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，《國安法》無追溯力，認為此前行為只可用來證明串謀存在、及被告是謀劃的參與者，但不能用來衡量其罪責，並因此而加刑。法官陳慶偉指，他不能接納這一點，早前求情亦已向代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明表達；又問吳是望法庭不考慮范國威《國安法》前哪一些行為。吳坦言，此爭論與范關係不太大，是原則的爭議，並指范在初選並非組織者或發起人，只是出席協調會議和參加初選，參與較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;范獲民建聯吳仕福前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&quot;&gt;范獲民建聯吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續談及范的個人背景，指他在美國修讀藝術，對政治感興趣，自2000年起擔任21年西貢區議員，並曾任立法會議員6年，指范非常務實，專注改善地區民生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又呈上民建聯西貢區議會前主席吳仕福的求情信，指范會議出席率顯示他的勤奮，他曾在區議會就區內事務推動超過300項議案。范又獲前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，指范十分務實、無私，為將軍澳區發展有很大貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另呈上多封街坊和同事撰寫的求情信，形容范是很受歡迎的議員，為居民改善生活。吳又呈上一幅范於3年前牛年為街坊所畫的畫，街坊憶述當時天氣寒冷，范手指僵硬仍作畫，不想令街坊失望，辯方指顯示范希望為街坊帶來快樂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方范望將一切抛諸腦後&quot;&gt;辯方：范望將一切抛諸腦後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又呈上范的母親、姐姐和女兒的求情信，范的女兒今年畢業，形容他為「每個女生所能渴求的最好的父親（the best father any girl can ask for）」，其母親亦讚他為好兒子，悉心照顧病重父親。吳指，范是「顧家的好男人（good family man）」、勤奮務實，望將本案一切抛諸腦後，與家人相處（keep himself to family），沒有重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，范無意違法，他受誤導而犯案，已感到非常後悔，望法庭考慮他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度，因及時認罪、有悔意、良好品格和公共服務而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7名被告今求情完畢，餘下呂智恆和林景楠明天求情。散庭時，范國威向旁聽席以手指做心，又向律師雙手合十致謝。何桂藍則做出OK手勢，林卓廷則微笑舉起手掌。范國威、楊岳橋、陳志全申請明天不出庭獲批。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾雪瑩認藏槍囚7年4個月 官：接納為維繫與男友蘇緯軒關係而犯案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZIy1Vlc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團昨裁定6人罪脫，1人交替罪成。至於早前認罪的吳智鴻及鍾雪瑩，今（30日）於高等法院進行求情。吳押後再進一步求情，鍾則涉與在計劃中任槍手的男友蘇緯軒同住並藏有槍械，她承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，被判囚7年4個月。法官張慧玲接納辯方指，鍾犯案是為了維繫與男友的情侶關係，而「今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」。張官考慮到無證據證明鍾使用槍械作非法用途，但肯定她必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，故決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。無罪釋放的男被告張俊富及李家田今亦有到場旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳智鴻認串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸罪&quot;&gt;吳智鴻認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為12.8行動策劃者的吳智鴻（案發時24歲），承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪；至於「串謀謀殺」罪則獲存檔法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優-官質疑小學幾優異都係假&quot;&gt;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優 官質疑「小學幾優異都係假」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳身穿黑色西裝、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄，一度向旁聽親友點頭。吳由資深大律師謝志浩及大律師陳韋君代表。法官張慧玲表示，辯方沒有呈交「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的案例，雖然大部分案例是英國，但原則上亦相同。張官要求辯方作出書面補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方呈上了吳的父母及未婚妻所撰寫的求情信。但張官不解為何辯方呈上一些與現時無關、遠至小學階段的信件，包括吳希望入讀香港華仁書院，並自行寫信予校長的文件。辯方解釋，希望反映吳是一名資優生，小學時品學兼優，父母對他有很大期望。張官指：「小學幾優異都係假」、「二十幾歲人，已經做緊嘢，講返小學做咩？」張官又批評辯方沒有篩選過文件便呈交予法庭。張官指將會押後再求情，以待辯方準備案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾雪瑩認無牌管有槍械及彈藥罪&quot;&gt;鍾雪瑩認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一被告鍾雪瑩（案發時29歲）承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，案發時她為認罪被告兼污點證人蘇緯軒的女友。鍾身穿白色恤衫及灰色外套、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄。她自2020年10月被捕後還柙至今近4年。鍾由大律師陳永豪及陳濟洲代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住-單位內有兩支槍&quot;&gt;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住 單位內有兩支槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案情指，蘇被指派在12.8行動之中擔任槍手，射擊警務人員，他管有一支手槍、一支 AR15 長槍及大量彈藥。但最後串謀者被捕故行動夭折。蘇與鍾為情侶關係，他們於2019年12月16日帶同槍械遷入翠屏花園躲藏。直至20日，警方尾隨兩人離開翠屏花園，並將他們截停。當警長捉住蘇的右臂時，他突然轉身逃跑，同時在腰間拔出手槍上膛，向警長開一槍。警長及時按下蘇的右臂，子彈沒有打中。於21日，警方在搜屋時發現一支長槍裝上瞄準裝置、8個裝有逾200發彈藥的彈匣，以及防彈背心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員其後亦拘捕鍾雪瑩，她在警誡下表示，自己任職設計師，陳玉龍於2019年8月介紹蘇予她認識。蘇因為與家人吵架而遷至藏身處，並叫鍾同住。蘇被捕後，鍾因驚慌故收拾東西離開，前往朋友「阿龍」的住所。她又指槍械屬於蘇，自己並不知道用途。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情可行使酌情權&quot;&gt;辯方求情：若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情，可行使酌情權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方求情指，涉案槍械及彈藥並非由鍾購買，她只是跟隨男友，其角色被動，並非始作俑者。辯方又呈上案例指，若法庭接納犯罪是因維繫家人及愛侶的感情，或被他們利用，則可行使酌情權。辯方又指，沒有證據證明鍾直接接觸或使用涉案槍械作非法用途，亦未能證明她知道12.8行動，以及男友管有槍械的意圖。辯方又提及，雖然鍾在2018年因非法集結罪被判囚4星期，但希望法庭不要因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鍾還柙期間改過已經向善&quot;&gt;辯方：鍾還柙期間改過、已經向善&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指在獄中傳道的牧師對鍾的嘉許正面，鍾母則讚女兒孝順、有愛心及樂於助人。辯方總結指，鍾面對案件期間多次流淚並掙扎，更改過並進修充實自己，現時是「已經向善嘅鍾雪瑩」。張官卻認為，即使鍾在羈留期間向善，但判刑時仍然應該以控罪性質為重，並需要向社會大眾發出需要嚴懲的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，鍾被捕後被控「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，於2021年一度被改控更嚴重的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪，當時她不認罪。最後與律政司認罪協商後，改為承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪。辯方希望法庭採納10年或以下的量刑起點，並給予25%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症-需到精神科覆診&quot;&gt;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症 需到精神科覆診&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮約一小時後判刑，並讀出鍾的背景。鍾現時33歲，童年時期被欺負導致有抑鬱症狀，她於19歲時被戀人欺騙後，一度打算自殘。直至2014年她到屯門醫院精神科求醫，被診斷患適應障礙症。其後曾向私家醫生求醫，但經濟上未能負擔而放棄。鍾在羈留期間情緒低落，於2021年5月被診斷患混合焦慮抑鬱症，因此被安排繼續到精神科覆診，惟過往數月焦慮情況加劇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接納為維繫關係而犯案-基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒&quot;&gt;官接納為維繫關係而犯案 「基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官判刑時表示，「明顯睇到你細個嘅經歷波動，唔係平穩。今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒。」張官接納辯方指，鍾犯案為維繫與蘇緯軒的情侶關係，而鍾在羈留期間已嚐失去自由的滋味。張官指，欣賞鍾在求情信中沒有要求輕判，反而要求法庭判處她應得的懲罰。張官表示，控罪最高刑罰為14年監禁，犯案明顯對公眾及社會帶來很大危險，因此阻嚇性刑罰是無可避免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官槍械非隨身攜帶無證據證明作非法用途&quot;&gt;官：槍械非隨身攜帶、無證據證明作非法用途&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮案情時指，雖然涉案槍械彈藥並非隨身攜帶，但卻放在床下，沒有覆蓋和收好，有機會讓歹徒取得並使用。本案中沒有證據證明槍械已裝上子彈，亦無證據顯示鍾用作非法用途。但張官肯定鍾必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，亦曾目睹他開槍射向警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官考慮鍾真心悔改-減刑兩個月&quot;&gt;官考慮鍾真心悔改 減刑兩個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。她指不會因鍾過往的非法集結案底而加刑，至於減刑方面則給予25%扣減，即判囚7年半。張官另考慮到鍾真心悔改、羈留期間有正面改變，以及重犯機會微，因此減刑兩個月，共判囚7年4個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference report is based on the discussions which occurred during a one-day workshop held in September 2023 at RUSI’s headquarters in London, attended by a range of representatives from defence companies and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). The purpose of the workshop was to identify early opportunities to set the conditions for integration across the joint force. The workshop examined where and how the MoD, the armed services and, especially, UK Strategic Command (StratCom) and its new Integration Design Authority (IDA) can achieve immediate results to galvanise the broader effort to deliver the stated aspiration of providing “integration as a service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop focused on the questions of how different actors, both past and present, have approached the challenge of data integration, and sought to examine which transferable lessons might be drawn from precedents from both the world of defence and beyond it, in areas such as the financial sector. This report, based on the workshop and subsequent secondary literature review, examines the immediate steps that the MoD can take to set the conditions for a broader effort to achieve multi-domain integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key deduction from the day’s discussions was that if, as is likely to be the case, software-driven evolution will play an important role in determining how the joint force fights, perhaps to an even greater degree than hardware adaptation, then it will be of considerable importance that frontline commands (FLCs) are able to cohere capability at all stages, even as the software is continually adapted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noted that traces of this change are already visible in operational theatres such as Ukraine, where software can and must be adapted on a six-weekly basis to stay ahead of adversary cyber- and electronic-warfare capabilities; this rate far exceeds that of hardware replacement or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the joint force is to operate across domains, FLCs must pursue iterative change in a coordinated manner. Consequently, the specific focus of the workshop was on achieving common data standards within defence. The workshop and subsequent research relied on historical case studies from both the UK and other nations to identify the drivers of success and failure in integration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day’s discussions also examined the development of civilian networks, which have succeeded through the existence of standards sufficiently broad to enable change but well defined enough to allow for interoperability. The lessons derived are applicable to other areas where integration and standardisation of capabilities across all services is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings surfaced from the day’s discussions, and reinforced by a review of secondary literature, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is limited precedent for successful integration on a top-down basis. Moreover, success has often involved procedures which – by virtue of their secrecy – existed outside normal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In several areas there are strong service- and defence-level incentives to collaborate, but no individual service owns responsibility for an outcome. This separates operational from financial risk. Helping resolve these “tragedy of the commons” areas would allow the IDA to work with, rather than against, the grain of service imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common set of foundational standards which FLCs can use to drive the process of integration could serve as a starting point. Data standards are a key part of the foundations. Achieving standards in one area can create functional spill-overs (where integration in one area makes it difficult to function without integration in other areas, leading to a cascading process that eventually requires no top-down supervision).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-integration&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, a number of factors can pose challenges to the effective integration of capabilities across the joint force. Among them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tendency towards feature creep – the expansion of an integration effort to include more tasks than can reasonably be accomplished, thereby increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An over-emphasis on technical capabilities, as opposed to specifying the operational requirements that justify the costs and complexities inherent to integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-adoption or partial adoption of standards once they are created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standards that act as barriers to entry for new capabilities because of their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that these challenges have been prominent features of previous UK efforts at joint force integration, particularly the Network Enabled Capability (NEC) programme, which began in the 2000s. The challenges that the UK has faced with the adoption of the NEC are in certain respects emblematic of the issues one may expect to encounter. As pointed out by one of the participants, the NEC was a victim of the fact that FLCs were not involved in articulating operational use cases. Moreover, the programme was not closely aligned at the enterprise level. Ideally, it would have encompassed both the relationships between different acquisition lines and areas such as operator education. It was noted that because NEC-related programmes were not situated within an operational use case, the costs were harder to justify within individual services where the benefit was not as great as for others. As a result, when services had to make trade-offs between individual NEC capabilities (such as a cooperative engagement) and other lines of effort, NEC capabilities were often sacrificed, scaled back or only partially adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies discussed at the workshop, such as the US Air Force’s Airborne Battle Management System (ABMS) programme, illustrate another major risk that integration efforts face: feature creep. The programme, which began as a replacement for the E-8 JSTARS, morphed into a wider effort to deliver an internet of things. While this development was not problematic in itself, the fact that use cases were driven by programme executive offices led to uncoordinated feature creep and cost increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those instances where effective top-down integration was achieved, notably the US Navy’s NIFC-CA programme, it was enabled by two things. First, a clear single service chain of command within a well-defined mission set allowed the US Navy to control requirements and enforce them. Second, as observed by a workshop participant who was involved in the rollout of the programme, the heavy classification of the programme meant that decision-making was restricted to a small number of individuals who had the authority to make and enforce systems engineering trade-offs (even though, in many cases, the reasons for specific requirements were not communicated to those charged with implementing them). Narrowing the group responsible for making decisions made it possible to avoid feature creep. Once established, requirements were imposed on engineers with little room for consultation, given the classifications involved, while the decision-makers’ authority could not be challenged. It was noted at the workshop that the ability to develop stringent requirements and ensure their adoption without pushback was only possible because many existing procedures for procuring and integrating capability were circumvented in a programme which was subject to highly centralised (and specific) processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed the fact that that these criteria will be difficult to achieve outside very specific contexts. So instead of integrating specific platforms, a different approach to integration might be taken – one that uses the authorities of bodies such as StratCom to solve emerging tragedies of the commons, over which no individual service has effective control or responsibility. Participants agreed that where StratCom can add value as the “strategic integrator” is not by solving specific integration challenges as an external part of the programme, but rather by creating toolkits that allow integration to be driven by MoD Finance and Military Capability (FMC) using existing management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections describe working use cases which might become a basis for focused support to cross-service integration by StratCom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-to-enable-cross-service-integration&quot;&gt;Opportunities to Enable Cross-Service Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions emerged from the day’s discussions. First, the IDA could provide a mechanism to cohere capability if it more systematically informed the Defence Capability Risk Assessment Register (DCAR) process. Although the IDA does not have budgetary authority, it can provide FMC with information about which capability gaps can be closed through integrating existing or likely capabilities and which require additional capacity rather than integration. Through the IDA and leveraging its responsibilities for Defence Digital, StratCom can generate an information base regarding data standards, which FMC can then use to insert requirements into specific programmes. This might be analogised to the way in which consultancy firms are used by governments to fill gaps in both expertise and capacity. With a staff drawn from across the services and the capacity (through the Permanent Joint Headquarters) to assess the operational use cases for individual service capabilities, StratCom can provide FMC with the information needed to inform decisions regarding data standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, the importance of a feedback loop between StratCom and FMC will become greater in the medium term, as the demands of integration will increasingly affect hardware. Most concepts for distributed operations, such as DARPA’s “STITCHES” Initiative, introduce considerable requirements for processing power to enable network integration and the translation of data at the tactical edge. This will in turn introduce size and cost requirements on platforms which StratCom and FMC can only drive in tandem. A model which is initially applied to data- and software-led development can then serve as a microcosm for a more ambitious system which will be needed in a 10-year timeframe. The model can enable StratCom and FMC to develop the procedures needed to coordinate with each other and the FLCs, and can introduce the services to new practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-market-of-standards&quot;&gt;Creating a Market of Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that delivering the integration identified above could be facilitated immediately by creating a market of common standards which services can opt into for specific functions. In this way, StratCom could set the stage for future integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, if software-led integration is a priority, flexible standards will be essential. This has been observed in civilian networks, which are able to maximize their effectiveness through a combination of relatively specific bearer standards and much more flexible standards for transport and middleware layers of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also observed that there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that backwards integration with open source software is possible, with examples from the world of integrated air and missile defence particularly prominent. It is possible to define broad parameters within which messages must fit and to then rely on middleware to translate data across the different formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that not all tasks will require comparable levels of data standardisation. For tasks such as electronic warfare, for example, the requirements for rapid updating and the stringency of security requirements impose a need for well-defined standards, which limit the amount of time needed to translate data across formats. Similarly, a particularly stringent set of standards could be adopted by the FLCs to share F-35 data while they might select different standards for other functions. Conversely, in other cases, such as joint logistics, a more flexible set of standards might be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key determinant of the degree to which standards are necessarily stringent will likely be the degree to which network compromise can be expected, as pointed out during discussions regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine. Where network compromise is highly likely (for example, because platforms will operate within reach of adversary electronic warfare capabilities), it will probably be the case that data will need to be packaged in ways that enable encryption while balancing the trade-offs involved between encryption and latency. As was discussed at the workshop, this will be of particular importance when a decision is made to exploit civilian bandwidth for certain functions – the relative lack of security of the network layer makes the security of the messaging layer all the more important. In other instances, compromise may be likely but accepted as the cost of scalability – for example, when commercial off-the-shelf UAVs are being incorporated into force structures. Finally, there are some instances where the security of a network against different modes of compromise is sufficiently robust that risk can be accepted at the level of data. One example is communications using millimetric wave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both discussions during the workshop and existing research suggest that the experience of organisations such as the International Organization for Standardization lends itself to the argument that a diverse set of voluntary standards can be effective in allowing agents to select standards that are best suited to enabling their operations. Rather than driving the process, StratCom and the IDA could generate multiple options which can be relevant to specific multi-domain tasks, from which FLCs can jointly select based on cross-service consultation. By resolving the informational challenge of generating options, Stratcom can narrow the set of options from which services can choose and provide them with an incentive to choose from the options it provides by removing the requirement to generate standards by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conclusion reached by participants was that where StratCom might add value is through the provision of a typology of trade-offs. Data standards could be categorised on whether they are designed to allow access to multiple network types, reduce latency or increase security – mindful of the fact that one can typically only achieve at most two of these three ideals. FLCs could then justify trading off one priority against others based on the demands of a specific operational requirement. For example, if forward reconnaissance elements of the force are expected to operate in communications-denied or -disrupted environments, they might opt to trade latency for the ability to securely use multiple modes of communication. Levels of encryption sufficient to pass data along multiple types of networks with different levels of vulnerability to compromise necessarily impose demands in terms of the TTPs and the size of data packages, meaning a cost in latency which precludes certain things such as the frequent use of full video links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-distributed-tactical-ledgers&quot;&gt;Case Study: Distributed Tactical Ledgers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the workshop was based on group discussions of potential use cases. One area where participants identified the potential to achieve “quick wins” was the development of a system comparable to those based around distributed ledgers that have emerged in the world of finance. The key points that emerged from discussions around this use case are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any system that requires coordinated collective action requires agents to have information about each other’s whereabouts, capabilities and obligations. For example, if an air defence interception is to be performed on a collaborative basis that might involve an Army-operated GBAD system, an RAF combat aircraft and a ship, it will be necessary to know what capabilities are held on each platform, how well suited they are to the task of an interception and how valuable it would be for each platform to perform the interception as opposed to another function. In other words, ledgers of both capabilities and the value of using a given capability in a specific way would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed in the breakout sessions, awareness currently existing at the theatre level includes the Recognised Air Picture (RAP) at a Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC). However, if envisioned concepts of distributed operations are to be achieved, this awareness and capacity for collaboration must be pushed to the edge. One prerequisite for this is a shared set of standards by which information about available cross-domain blue forces and tasking orders can be shared locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the breakout sessions agreed that the ability to task capabilities in a decentralised manner would require, at a minimum, both the ability of units to communicate their availability to nearby units from across the force, and a basis on which tasking requests might be either accepted or rejected. In the civilian world, applications such as Uber accomplish this through the broadcasting of data by taxis and the use of a price mechanism. However, this model is not directly transferrable to a military context. The constant broadcasting of data represents a security risk, while decisions about what a platform is tasked to do typically reflect the allocation of resources to a task by a higher authority through, for example, an air tasking order. However, many emerging concepts of operations, such as Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and Mosaic Warfare, presume a comparable dynamic recombination of assets, with systems sometimes being tasked to a zone rather than a specific function. In a military context, communications would likely need to be local rather than broadcasted, because broadcasting availability creates risk and would rely on directional transmissions which, in turn, create a requirement for blue force tracking which would be difficult to assure in GPS denied environments. The requirement for accurate blue force tracking stems from the fact that to share data safely, as F-35s have done with US Marine Corps HIMARS batteries in tests, systems need to use Link 16 on directional antennae rather than relying on omni-directional broadcasts, which would reveal their positions. Directional transmissions require an accurate understanding of the location of a receiving antenna, which has been achieved in tests but which would be difficult to deliver in conflict. The need for blue force tracking incentivises an effort to leverage multiple networks, but this must be balanced against the requirement for security. In effect, there is something of a trade-off between the flexibility of a system in terms of the network it uses and the data used. The more flexible a system is at the network level, the more stringent data standards must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system would necessitate a shift from mission command to mission definition at the edge, as operators would exercise control over not only how they executed preset missions but also which tasks they opted to support. For example, an aircraft over a part of the battlefield for the purpose of SEAD may face a choice between engaging a SAM or broadcasting data to enable another system such as a GMLRS to engage another target. This requires the pilot to know how valuable the alternative target is regarding the ground forces mission set as opposed to the SAM, which could be otherwise engaged as part of the SEAD mission. In effect, a military analogue to a pricing mechanism is necessary for multi-domain operations, but it must be secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of capabilities will require network standards that are sufficiently flexible to enable the use of multiple pathways, as well as data standards that are stringent enough to allow for tasking requests to be communicated securely, since multiple networks of varying reliability are being used in the face of adversary compromise. Also, a mechanism for assessing whether the application of a system to a task is appropriate given the system’s availability would be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this task is both complex and a multi-level system engineering task, the full extent of which should be the basis for subsequent discussions a first step towards such a system might involve delivering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed cross-domain system for tracking blue forces and delivering tasking orders without communications to higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed system for assigning value to tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system of distributed ledgers would at a minimum require shared standards for indexing data about locations, capabilities and values, as well as voting protocols to enable changes to locations and target values without systemic risk. There are multiple network types which can support such a system. Area-wide communications networks, including civilian systems such as Starlink, might represent one mode. Alternatively, each platform in an area can communicate locally to update peers on its position, enabling them to pass this data further on to platforms adjacent to them. This could enable data to be “daisy chained” between adjacent systems to allow for broad situational awareness to be achieved without the constant broadcasting of data. Local communication with adjacent nodes can be achieved with low wavelength communications frequencies that are less susceptible to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain instances and use cases, particularly where situational awareness is desirable over a broad area (for example, in the context of distributed operations in the maritime domain), it may be desirable to accept stringent standards of encryption as a means of utilising multiple network types. In other instances, for example within the land operating environment, the relative proximity of multiple units may allow for the use of mobile ad-hoc networks to enable the daisy chaining of data using less easily compromised modes of communication such as millimetre wave radios or tropospheric scatter – in turn allowing for more flexible data standards that allow lower latency and a lower requirement for operators to generate encryption keys. Security in this context is delivered by the network and not the data, and the relative simplicity of the data being transmitted (which allows for low latency) does not need to be lost due to a requirement for padding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as such a system does not exist, it can be directly shaped by central bodies in a way that creates a common good around which service-level lines of effort would adapt. Generating a set of differentiated data standards that might underpin such a system would be likely to secure service-level buy-in for several reasons. First, it simplifies the task of selecting standards for individual services. Second, such a system would not necessarily require services to immediately grapple with the intricacies of networking platforms to generate complete situational awareness. Rather, it would require the ability to receive and transmit simple data regarding the presence of friendly platforms and the value of any given adversary target across a shared indexing system. Third, a broad market of standards could allow different trade-offs to be weighed by services based on the tactical imperatives of one or more services in a specific context. Generally, the acceptance of standards tends to depend on the number of impositions that standards create. The more intricate a set of standards, the less likely it is that buy-in will be achieved. A flexible set of standards which is only restrictive on issues that directly pertain to security can circumvent this issue and, importantly, allow tasks to determine approaches. Because services can agree standards based on their appropriateness to a shared cross-service task, this can secure support, because the need for a given standard is rooted in an operational requirement rather than a top-down diktat. This bottom-up approach has characterised previous successful efforts at cross-service coordination, such as the 31 initiatives between the US Army and US Air Force which led to the emergence of AirLand Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several deductions emerged from the discussions held as part of the workshop. Of greatest salience was the suggestion made throughout the day that, as it approaches the task of integrating the force, StratCom will benefit from an approach that builds from relatively modest goals, but with a clear sense of where it is heading. It must eventually achieve the following aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish organisational procedures which allow it to determine integration requirements in light of operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a shared set of routines for coordinating with FMC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effort to establish shared data standards could serve as a starting point. Standards need not immediately impinge on service-level prerogatives regarding platform-level decisions and can be approached in a flexible way, as illustrated by voluntary standards markets. The tasks for which standards are sought might initially involve less stringent capabilities, such as a shared indexing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a range of options can be of greater utility than the imposition of standards, not least because standards imposed by fiat are often opposed, and moreover tend to create perverse incentive structures. By contrast, the creation of an option set allows one or more services to explicitly weigh trade-offs and justify choices made in light of the trade-offs acceptable in the specific operational contexts in which the assets of more than one FLC interact. On the basis of the system and precedents set, StratCom and FMC could begin to articulate a more coherent system and division of labour, which could then be applied to more complex systems engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling the relatively modest task of creating a flexible set of data standards and solving broad tragedies of the commons could, then, create the conditions for a more ambitious future approach to integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，今（29日）下午於區域法院裁決，3名被告全部被判罪成。從早上起陸續有市民到法院地下排隊，當中有正在就讀新聞系的學生，她表示佩服鍾沛權在庭上「喺咁大壓力嘅情況下，都可以咁準確地講到覺得做新聞應該有的準則」，形容這些準則「好正常⋯⋯係學校學嘅嘢。」她表示至今仍會想入行，因學校的教育好像營造了一種希望，「覺得可能仲有啲空間可以做」，「未去到最壞吖，都仲有朋友一齊。」Annie認為，兩名被告是行內前輩，想跟他們說：「呢行仲會有人想做，唔係佢哋想像中咁灰。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立場博客薯伯伯亦有到場旁聽，他憶述自《立場》成立不久便任博客，編輯「冇任何篩選」，「你講得有紋有路，就寫成點都得」，嘆《立場》停運後，失去了渠道將大家相信的事情說出來。雖然有憂慮，但他不想完全不寫：「要諗點樣可以對得住自己、對得住自己嘅良心、對得住自己嘅讀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民早上起到場排隊&quot;&gt;市民早上起到場排隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;從早上起陸續有市民到法院地下排隊，約10時起已有40多人，當中大部份人為中年人士，在場記者向他們提問，惟他們均不願發言。期間有市民當眾指稱其中一名中年女士為「排隊黨蛇頭」，該中年女士隨即激動說：「你唔好喺度搞事呀！」、「2019年仲搞唔掂呀？」、「成個法院都俾你搞亂」、「搞屎棍！」經在場保安調停後才平息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等亦有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞系學生稱尊重鍾沛權在壓力下仍在庭上準確說出新聞準則&quot;&gt;新聞系學生稱尊重鍾沛權在壓力下仍在庭上準確說出新聞準則&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就讀中大新聞系三年級的Annie和就讀法律系的Jamila一同到場排隊。其中Annie表示早上10時15分已開始排隊，她稱來旁聽是想「睇吓有冇排隊黨」，對於裁決結果，她笑稱：「唔係好敢諗，所以就索性唔諗。」她指以前認為《立場新聞》與其他媒體分別不大，「因為間間都係咁樣run」，而且「應該係咁樣run」，即是報導事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3年前得悉《立場》編輯被捕時，Annie坦言「冇諗過咁樣都係一條罪名」，她感到早前的審訊「好似一場戲」，認為專訪政治人物、海外人士和評論文章都是「無錯」，對於鍾沛權在庭上的辯護，「我覺得，好respect佢（鍾沛權）就算喺庭上，喺咁大壓力嘅情況下，都可以咁準確地講到覺得做新聞應該有的準則。」她形容這些準則「好正常⋯⋯係學校學嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞系學生想跟鍾沛權說呢行仲會有人想做非想像中灰&quot;&gt;新聞系學生想跟鍾沛權說「呢行仲會有人想做」、非想像中灰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;兩名被告於2021年12月被捕及起訴，Annie被問到為何於2022年仍然會選擇入讀新聞系，她解釋「新聞都有好多種」，除了政治外，亦有好多題材可以寫。她又指，學校的教育好像營造了一種希望，「啫係覺得可能仲有啲空間可以做」，加上有不少朋友，讓她感到「啫係都未去到最壞吖，都仲有朋友一齊。」她表示畢業後「應該會」入行，又指兩名被告算是行內的前輩，可能想多些後輩繼續入行，想跟他們說：「呢行仲會有人想做，唔係佢哋想像中咁灰⋯⋯可能佢都唔灰⋯⋯總之仲會有人做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前博客薯伯伯到場旁聽-憶立場無篩選&quot;&gt;前博客薯伯伯到場旁聽 憶《立場》無篩選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;立場前博客作者薯伯伯今也有到庭旁聽，他說，案件是首宗被控煽動的傳媒案件，關乎新聞和言論自由，故特別關注。薯伯伯憶述，於《立場新聞》成立不久便獲邀擔任博客，《立場》會轉載其文章，「除咗執錯字之外就冇任何嘅篩選，總之佢覺得你講得有紋有路，就話我哋想寫成點都得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續說，以往以為《立場》有很多博客，總編鍾沛權未必太認識他，但傾談間發覺鍾也有看他的文章，「好意想不到佢會咁認真」，自案件後與鍾交流，亦感覺他為人「好正直、真誠」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;嘆失公共討論空間-惟仍繼續寫作&quot;&gt;嘆失公共討論空間 惟仍繼續寫作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;薯伯伯有旁聽立場案大部分審訊，感覺就像上新聞課堂。庭上得悉鍾曾因營運困難而停薪和減薪，「覺得佢好真誠對待自己嘅工作」，聽到他說言論自由就如「信仰」，亦是印證他過去與立場的交流。薯伯伯很記得，庭上控方曾問《立場》刊物為何有一頁是黃色，他覺得煽動「要搵其實點都可以搵到，一隻顏色都可以係煽動」，但他反問：「當我好真誠咁相信自己所寫嘅嘢，而認為咁樣寫出嚟係對成個社會都有好處嘅時候，咁點可能係煽動呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;薯伯伯說，審訊過程就像「見證住香港好美好嘅年代」，《立場》、《蘋果》等停運後，他有時看新聞，也忍不住想以前的人會怎樣報導。雖然傳媒空間收緊，但薯伯伯覺得仍有人很努力做記者工作，「唔覺得好冇希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;失去了《立場》的平台，薯伯伯坦言覺得失去了公共討論的空間——以往有《立場》，「將你嘅聲音帶比唔同人，令大家相信嘅事情比較有個渠道去講出嚟；而家冇咗《立場》之後，有時都硬係覺得缺失咗呢個渠道」。但薯伯伯仍繼續寫作，他坦言也會有憂慮，寫作時盡量不會太觸碰某些人的神經，但他又不想完全不寫：「要諗點樣可以對得住自己、對得住自己嘅良心、對得住自己嘅讀者」。薯伯伯望告訴二人，對他們「念茲在茲」，正如今天有不少人到場，「心裡面成日都諗住佢兩位」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;自由記者對只係做新聞仍被控感震驚&quot;&gt;自由記者對「只係做新聞」仍被控感震驚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自由身記者Carol說，對《立場》被控煽動感到很震驚，二人「只係做新聞啫」，卻要被捕被控，形容對媒體是很大衝擊，也是對整個行業的審訊。她一直有旁聽案件，認為鍾「好講到新聞專業做咩」，亦有很多啟發——「仲有人為自己嘅理念繼續堅持」，很仔細、不厭其煩地闡述自己想法。她笑言，雖然最後作用或不大，但這份記錄很重要，也是對公眾很好的教育。Carol認識鍾沛權、林紹桐多年，相信二人也已預計會罪成，知道舊煽動罪最高判刑兩年，她只希望二人可以「盡快出返嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，自2022年10月開審，經歷56日審訊、裁決三度押後，今（29日）於區域法院裁決。國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定3名被告均罪名成立，鍾沛權聞判表現平靜。至於林紹桐則缺席聆訊，辯方稱已呈上醫療報告，感謝法官批准他不出庭。辯方其後讀出林紹桐的陳情書，資深大律師余若薇並指，鍾和林已分別還柙349日和313日，如考慮行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，加上二人其後再遵守保釋條件至今逾一年半，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期。案件押後至9月26日判刑，鍾沛權和林紹桐獲准原有條件保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延後逾一小時開庭&quot;&gt;延後逾一小時開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今約12時半到場，於近2時半時步入被告欄內，不時望向旁聽席。林紹桐妻子亦有到場。案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾一小時，於3時38分才開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官郭偉健問林紹桐是否未能到庭，資深大律師余若薇確認，指已呈上醫療報告，感激法官批准林不出庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據記者觀察，正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;三度押後裁決-待快必上訴案結果&quot;&gt;三度押後裁決 待快必上訴案結果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權及林紹桐於2021年12月29日被警方上門以「串謀發布煽動刊物」拘捕，隨即被帶上法庭提堂。二人不認罪，案件於2022年10月31日開審，為1997年後首宗傳媒被控煽動的審訊，原定審期20日，但最終歷時56日，橫跨近8個月，當中有36日為鍾沛權作供及接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件去年6月完成結案陳詞，原定10月4日裁決，其後改至11月15日，並因英國樞密院裁定煽動罪「隱含必要條件」為須有煽動暴力或動亂的意圖，改為當天再陳詞。法官郭偉健決定押後裁決，以待「快必」譚得志煽動案上訴結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭今年3月駁回譚得志的定罪及刑罰上訴，裁定煽動暴力意圖並非煽動罪必要元素，快必遂申請上訴至終院。案件期間再排期至4月29日裁決，再押後至今日，共三度押後，距開審已接近兩年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;終院本月14日批准譚得志就其中兩項法律議題上訴，包括《刑事罪行條例》下的煽動罪是否屬可公訴罪行，以及控方是否需要證明被告有意圖煽動暴力才能入罪。終極上訴聆訊定於明年1月10日進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告依次為Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited、《立場》前總編輯鍾沛權（53歲）及前署任總編輯林紹桐（35歲），他們被控一項串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物罪，指他們於2020年7月7日至2021年12月29日在香港，一同串謀和與其他人串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物，即具以下意圖的刊物：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，自2022年10月開審，經歷56日審訊、裁決三度押後，今（29日）於區域法院裁決，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定3名被告罪名成立。辯方呈上林紹桐和鍾沛權撰寫的陳情書，林提及新聞工作者效忠對象「只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾」，同事最後在巨大壓力下仍堅守崗位，「無愧於時代」，「曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸」，「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道⋯⋯而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權則提到太太陳沛敏在2011年日本大地震採訪，面對危險仍不願提前撤退，「她這份對新聞工作的執着，我銘刻在心」。鍾指，《立場》前同事亦抱持相似信念，更多非新聞工作者的港人亦同樣堅持在各自崗位上實踐信念，「如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師余若薇陳詞指，兩人是新聞工作者，有責任報導社會狀況和不同意見，與其他煽動案宣洩政治言論不同。她又指，二人曾分別還柙349日和313日，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期。余又提到，二人在本案後已失去工作，林紹桐患嚴重疾病需接受化療，如入獄難以接受治療。案件押後至9月26日判刑，鍾沛權和林紹桐獲准以原有條件保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延後逾一小時開庭-林紹桐因健康問題缺席&quot;&gt;延後逾一小時開庭 林紹桐因健康問題缺席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今約12時半到場，於近2時半時步入被告欄內，不時望向旁聽席。林紹桐妻子亦有到場。案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾一小時，於3時38分才開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官郭偉健問林紹桐是否未能到庭，資深大律師余若薇確認，指已呈上醫療報告，感激法官批准林不出庭。法官裁定，3名被告全部罪名成立，鍾沛權聞判表現平靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健問，法庭今天批准林可缺席，但判刑當天，「第三被告一定要嚟法庭喇喎？」余若薇則指，希望林的身體健康可以回復，但是據她所知「目前佢個情況係幾嚴重吓」，而他的假期是直到9月中。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《立場新聞》前署任總編輯 林紹桐（左）、前總編輯 鍾沛權（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另表示，將引用《國安法》實施細則，向《立場》母公司申請充公令，將再排期處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林紹桐陳情新聞工作者效忠對象只是公眾&quot;&gt;林紹桐陳情：新聞工作者效忠對象只是公眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，兩名被告均準備了陳情書，不會庭上讀出鍾沛權的陳情，但會讀出林的陳情（兩人陳情書全文見文末）。其中林紹桐憶述，被捕後有警官探訪，形容「大家各為其主」，但他指，新聞工作者從無要效忠或擁護誰，「如果我們真的有效忠的對象，只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾。因為我們信奉新聞自由、言論自由，而唯有傳播思想的自由，才能保障每個人的自由。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林指自2010年入行，編輯自主空間日益狹窄，《立場》正是嘗試在港經營一個完全編輯自主的傳媒機構，而《立場》能生存七年，「我相信很大原因，是讀者希望看到的新聞，真正不受財團、金主、權力或黨派左右。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林指，即使最後新聞自由在半空墜落、在巨大壓力下，「同事依然堅守崗位，無愧於時代」，發掘差點被掩沒的真相、為無權和弱勢者發聲、盡可能記錄香港，留下歷史初稿，「曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後說，案件關鍵是新聞自由、言論自由，新聞工作者不但要為自己報道負責，「若明知公眾有知情權，但刻意迴避不報道亦是失責」，「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道，正如今天仍然緊守崗位的每一位。而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾沛權港人堅持實踐信念-如實記錄是不可逃避責任&quot;&gt;鍾沛權：港人堅持實踐信念 如實記錄是不可逃避責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾沛權提交的陳情，提到太太陳沛敏在2011年日本大地震時，是其中一名最早赴現場採訪、亦是最後離開日本的其中一名香港記者，陳面對危險仍不願提前撤退，因認為若出現更大災難，記者更應留下採訪：「既然有機會身在現場、靠近現場，能夠見證、記錄、報道一場空前的人類災難，作為一名記者，她怎可以轉身離開？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾形容，陳對新聞工作的執着，令他銘刻在心，而他認識不少新聞工作者，包括《立場》前同事均抱持相似信念，更多並非新聞工作者的港人，同樣堅持在各自崗位上實踐信念，「更有人因為在乎社群裏眾人的自由和尊嚴，不惜付出失去一己自由的代價」。鍾最後說：「如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方與宣洩政治言論不同曾下架多篇文章&quot;&gt;辯方：與宣洩政治言論不同、曾下架多篇文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇其後續陳詞，強調本案是首次有新聞工作者進行報導或刊登評論而被控煽動。她指與以往其他煽動案中，被告明知故犯、表達政治立場、具宣洩性不同，本案兩名被告均為新聞工作者，「佢哋嘅職責就係要報導」，有責任報導社會狀況和不同人士的意見和評論。余又指，雖然兩人知道報導或帶來抨擊、隱憂或批評，「但佢哋覺得有責任，記錄唔同嘅事同人，唔等於係知道佢犯罪、會被拉」，「知道有風險，係咪等於停止報導或自我審查呢？佢哋覺得應該堅持佢嘅理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余望法庭判刑時，考慮二人工作性質，指「當時社會情況的確有呢啲聲音，佢報導呢啲聲音，係咪因為咁而被定罪？」余又指此類案件不多，世上很多新聞工作者很關注，望法庭考慮本案與渲洩政治言論有所不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，《立場》自2014年成立至案發的7年，共發布逾十萬篇文章，其後已下架數萬篇文章；而涉案17篇文章中，警方拘捕時已有12篇下架，只餘5篇，望法庭特別考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方二人曾還柙多時-望判刑少於已還柙日子&quot;&gt;辯方：二人曾還柙多時 望判刑少於已還柙日子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續提到，鍾和林自2021年12月29日被捕，2022年10月開審後多次押後，因控方新呈大量文章，令「成個官司拖咗好多」，審訊歷時逾50日。余指二人已分別還柙349日和313日，原本如考慮行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月。惟因本案「拖好耐」，今年3月通過《維護國家安全條例》（23條）後，涉危害國安被定罪的囚犯，除非獲懲教署長信納減刑「不會不利國家安全」，否則未能獲三分一扣減，並適用於正進行的舊案，余稱以她所知「冇人有呢個三分一扣減」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指，本案最高刑罰兩年，二人如原獲三分一扣減，已服畢大部分刑期，但如再判入獄，料不會獲三分一扣減。余指，二人獲保釋後已遵守保釋條件至今逾一年半，如再入獄，對他們傷害更大，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期，令新法例不會影響兩人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方二人被捕後失工作-林紹桐患病入獄難治療&quot;&gt;辯方：二人被捕後失工作 林紹桐患病入獄難治療&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就二人的個人情況，余若薇指鍾沛權自畢業曾短暫任職非政府組織後，一直從事新聞工作，但他自2021年12月《立場》停刊後，至今近3年均沒有任何工作和入息，對他是很大打擊，亦對其經濟狀況很大影響。而鍾的妻子、前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏至今仍涉《蘋果日報》案還柙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐，余指他患很嚴重罕有的病，腎功能減到很低，正接受化療，需經常入院做很多測試，如判入獄，相信很難接受現在所需的治療。余又指，林有妻子和一名年幼的女兒，本案後失去新聞工作，現時有做少量自由接案（freelance）但入息不多。余又指，林原獲一所外國著名大學取錄，並獲得獎學金，望出國深造，但因本案而失去機會，審訊對他是很大打擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;押926判刑-二人續准保釋&quot;&gt;押9.26判刑 二人續准保釋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健指，就編採方針，「我有我嘅裁決，可能嗰個考慮點，可能有啲唔同嘅睇法」，又指審訊時已有處理關於《立場》公信力和影響力、當時民情等議題，認為亦是令煽動罪嚴重的因素。法官將案件押後至9月26日判刑，期間林紹桐和鍾沛權獲准以原有條件保釋。鍾沛權於下午約5時步出區域法院，有市民高喊：「多謝《立場新聞》！多謝你哋！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;多國領事區家麟等旁聽&quot;&gt;多國領事、區家麟等旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。國安處總警司李桂華亦有到庭，坐在控方代表後方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據記者觀察，正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立場新聞前署任總編輯林紹桐的求情信全文&quot;&gt;《立場新聞》前署任總編輯林紹桐的求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我依然記得，在還押最初幾位警官循例來公務探訪，其中一位形容「大家各為其主」。我後悔沒有把握機會向警官解釋，新聞工作者從沒有要效忠誰、擁護誰，或者與誰為敵。而如果我們真的有效忠的對象，只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾。因為我們信奉新聞自由、言論自由，而唯有傳播思想的自由，才能保障每個人的自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我2010年加入傳媒行業，當時新聞業界已面臨各種隱憂，或明或暗的審查愈見頻密，編採室方針難逃老闆、財團及權力各種干預，編輯自主空間愈來愈狹窄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《立場新聞》是在如此背景下成立，參與《立場》的每一位抱着同一個理想，嘗試在香港經營一個完全編輯自主的傳媒機構。《立場》能夠生存七年，我相信很大原因，是讀者希望看到的新聞，真正不受財團、金主、權力或黨派左右。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;即使在最後的時間，新聞自由在半空墜落，在巨大壓力之下，同事依然堅守崗位，無愧於時代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們發掘差點被掩沒的真相，即使困難重重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們為無權者、弱勢和小眾發聲，即使面臨譴責攻擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們盡可能記錄香港，趁這些人與事消失之前，盡力留下歷史初稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們的自由在倒數，每一位同事都心知肚明；他們選擇留下，加緊步伐，用盡狹縫裡所有空間。由2020年7月（即控方指控煽動的案發開始）一直至今天，《立場》同事的報道先後獲得30多項新聞獎項及嘉許。曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這宗案件的關鍵是新聞自由，是言論自由。新聞工作者不但要為自己的報道負責，若明知公眾有知情權，但刻意迴避不報道亦是失責。亦因如此，新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道，正如今天仍然緊守崗位的每一位。而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林紹桐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立場新聞前總編輯鍾沛權的求情信全文&quot;&gt;《立場新聞》前總編輯鍾沛權的求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，這是我在這次審訊中的最後陳情，僅為自己作為一名香港公民及新聞工作者的「意圖」，再作一些簡短的背景補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011年3月日本發生東北大地震，我太太陳沛敏是其中一名最早飛赴現場採訪的香港記者。面對褔島核電廠意外迅速演變、惡化，加上餘震不斷，不少海外記者都因應風險難測而選擇提早撤離日本。她卻堅持留下，繼續想方設法前赴多個災難現場採訪，盡力做記錄、報道。她是當年最後離開日本的其中一名香港記者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時有大量關於災難發展的壞消息和悲觀預測，甚至乎有說法稱日本部份地區有陸沉危機。她後來跟我談及那時候不願意提前撤退回港的一些想法：假如日本真的出現更大的災難，她不是更應該留下繼續採訪而非放棄報道嗎？既然有機會身在現場、靠近現場，能夠見證、記錄、報道一場空前的人類災難，作為一名記者，她怎可以轉身離開？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她這份對新聞工作的執着，我銘刻在心，而她不是特殊的少數。我認識的不少香港新聞工作者，包括很多《立場新聞》前同事，在過去和現在都抱持相似的信念，決意留守新聞現場，見證和記載真實的故事，聆聽和記述紛紜的思想。我相信這些故事和思想，可以刺激、啟發人們思考，反映時代，塑造歷史。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我知道，有更多並非新聞工作者的香港人，同樣一直堅持在各自的崗位上實踐信念，通過各種形式和體裁，真誠地書寫、表達、創作，呼應時代的挑戰。他們當中更有人因為在乎社群裏眾人的自由和尊嚴，不惜付出失去一己自由的代價。如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hohy7q9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》兩位前總編輯鍾沛權和林紹桐，今日被判串謀發布煽動刊物罪名成立。記協發聲明，指案件明確反映香港新聞自由衰落。在裁決前，立場案亦已對香港新聞業界造成不可逆轉的傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方國安處是於2021年12月29日搜查《立場新聞》，並拘捕八名編採人員、董事及前董事，包括鍾沛權和林紹桐。《立場新聞》的6,100萬資產於搜查當日被警方凍結，《立場新聞》隨後宣布停運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權和林紹桐兩人在被捕翌日提堂，保釋申請被拒，還押近一年至2022年11月及12月才分別獲准保釋至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協在今日立場案判決後發聲明，指案件明確反映香港新聞自由衰落。記協提到，政府今年年初將煽動罪的最高刑罰由兩年增至七年監禁，加劇新聞工作者的擔憂及深化寒蟬效應，對新聞自由構成更嚴重的傷害。加上近日有政府官員指媒體在專欄旁提示文章無煽動意圖並不能免責，而《明報》總編輯隨後致函專欄，呼籲撰文時需「知所分寸免危機降臨」，反映本港傳媒對煽動罪感到憂心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協認為，眾多事件反映本港新聞自由正嚴重倒退，表明強烈反對使用煽動罪、《港區國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使其權利進行新聞工作的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;近日，有政府官員指媒體在專欄旁提示文章無煽動意圖並不能為其免責，《明報》總編輯其後致函專欄作者，呼籲撰寫評論文章時需「知所分寸」，以免危機降臨，顯示香港傳媒對煽動罪感到憂心。港府日前也拒絕向外媒彭博記者發出工作簽證，此等事件足證香港新聞自由現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;連同《立場》一案，記協認為眾多事件均反映新聞自由正嚴重倒退。本會強烈反對使用煽動罪、港區國安法及23條《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使其權利進行新聞工作的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odSssLB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》涉嫌發布煽動性文章，前總編輯鍾沛權及署任總編輯林紹桐今日在區域法院，被裁定串謀發布煽動刊物罪名成立。對於法庭已就涉案文章裁定具煽動意圖，警方會否就撰寫文章的記者、博客作調查及進一步行動。國安處總警司李桂華表示，會視乎文章是否有煽動意圖：「就作者，同埋嗰啲負責寫嘅人士，我哋會睇睇一樣嘢，佢哋有無煽動意圖做呢一樣嘢，如果有嘅話，我哋會同律政處商量，究極適唔適合檢控嘅情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在鍾沛權步出法院後，李桂華就案件裁決見記者，他在開場中稱，控方在57日的審訊中展露不同證據，可見三名被告透過報道、博客及專訪，在2020年7月7曰至2021年12月9日期間，發布帶有煽動性的文章，當中包括污衊國安法及其執法行動、煽動離叛，散布分裂國家的訊息、鼓吹推翻政權、乞求外國向香港及中國政府進行施壓作制裁行動，更透過反政府議題推波助瀾，挑起公眾向中央及特區政府的仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;重申自由非絕對-如涉國家安全可施加規限&quot;&gt;重申自由非絕對 如涉國家安全可施加規限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李桂華特別提到，警方在2021年12月29日執法行動時：「有啲人不分青紅皂白，話我哋打壓新聞自由、言論自由嘅。」他表示，法庭判詞告訴外界，警方執法行動的理據，又引用《公民權利及政治權利國際公約》：「呢一類嘅自由並非絕對性嘅自由，如果遇到一啲國家安全，公共安全、公共安寧、公共秩序嘅情況，係可以施加一啲規限嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李桂華亦不點名提到早前英國的示威，正因為假消息、煽動性消息在網上流傳，影響社會秩序、穩定，甚至影響國家安全：「其實呢啲事喺2019年、2020年，我哋都係歷歷在目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李桂華非首次旁聽國安案有時間便聽審&quot;&gt;李桂華：非首次旁聽國安案、有時間便聽審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《無綫新聞》記者關注，「屠龍案」6名被告經審訊後罪名不成立，及李桂華為何親自到區域法院旁聽：「點解你要親自嚟到區院呢度聽呢？係咪因為涉及一啲指控話，新聞自由你哋唔認同呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李桂華先強調，早前已有7名同案被告認罪，重申十分重視同類案件，呼籲公眾如有相關消息可報警：「呢個案件係一個好嚴重嘅案件嚟，真槍，甚至有長槍，有炸藥，佢嘅炸藥嘅份量可以造成好大嘅死傷，包括警務人員，或者係參與當時遊行嘅人，或者無辜嘅人士，又有一個非常之完整嘅計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於是否因涉及《立場新聞》便首次旁聽，李桂華就稱並非首次聽審：「當然我唔能夠每日都嚟啦，但係如果呢啲咁嘅案件，我除咗我同事向我報告，睇一啲文件向我報告，我係非常之如果有時間嘅話，都會抽嚟聽一聽究竟案情係點。絕對唔係話我第一次聽國家安全有關嘅案件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裁決影響新聞自由-李桂華更好讓外界明白違法界線&quot;&gt;裁決影響新聞自由？ 李桂華：更好讓外界明白違法界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一記者問及，坊間有聲音認為裁決影響新聞自由及言論自由，李桂華就稱「用好快嘅時間」看了裁決，認為可更好讓外界明白違法界線，即只要涉及煽動性物品便有機會干犯相關法律：「我哋唔係話，有咩題目唔報得，有咩案件唔報得，只不過佢選擇用一個煽動意圖去報道嘅做法，即係一個載體用嚟散播煽動意圖嘅訊息，呢個就唔做到，會受到法律制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;日本共同通訊社則問李桂華，今次裁決對外國媒體在香港採訪自由你影響。李桂華回應時稱：「唔應該分外國媒體、本港媒體，其實我哋嗰把呎、個法律都係用嗰一樣嚟。」他重申今次案件涉及煽動意圖，《刑事罪行條例》、《維護國家安全條例》均清楚列明，甚麼情況屬煽動情況：「大家返去睇一睇，一般人係唔會犯呢啲！」他表示，涉案的17篇文章的題目，「其他報章、其他媒體都有買㗎，點解佢偏偏係會被人拘捕呢？因為佢係用咗嚟做煽動意圖嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，今（29日）被國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定罪名成立。審訊期間控方邀請法庭考慮案發時的時代背景，社會氣氛仍然不穩、公眾容易受到煽動，並用了相當時間就此議題盤問鍾沛權。郭官在裁決理由書中處理相關議題，指在反修例示威爆發之前，有66%市民不贊成將香港人引渡到內地受審，顯示已經有約六成的市民對政府持有懷疑、不滿甚至不信任的態度。2019年區議會選舉非建制派取得大勝，惟郭官指此前發生了一連串暴力事件，但抗爭者派別依然大勝，反映市民「一切立場行先，目的至上，手段可以不理」，並肯定：「民粹年代當時已降臨香港。」他又指曾經參與抗議活動的市民都是有可能受到煽動的對象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;反送中初期六成市民不贊成修例-官當時已有對政府抱懷疑不滿和不信任&quot;&gt;反送中初期六成市民不贊成修例 官：當時已有對政府抱懷疑、不滿和不信任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，控方邀請法庭考慮案發期間的社會情況，郭官表示有需要考慮公眾是否容易受到煽動，或當時是否出現了「一點火花就會引爆火藥庫（“a spark will explode a powder magazine”）」的時代背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官引述香港大學民意研究計劃的民意調查結果，顯示2019年5月底至6月初，有66%市民不贊成和強烈不贊成將香港人引渡到內地受審，指：「即使在反修例運動的最初期，已經有約六成的市民對政府持有懷疑、不滿甚至不信任的態度。」郭官又引用中大民意調查結果，指隨著反修例運動的持續發展，示威者的政治取向看來是越來越激進及反政府，本土派亦越來越壯大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區選前發生一連串暴力事件抗爭者派別依然大勝-官民粹年代已降臨香港&quot;&gt;區選前發生一連串暴力事件抗爭者派別依然大勝 官：民粹年代已降臨香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，從辯方呈上的民意調查可見，「示威者的激進行為可以說是不受制約，因為他們的行為得到部份政黨及聲稱奉行『和理非』的大量市民的諒解甚至支持，包括提供精神上和物質上的支持，認為勇武示威者為他們發聲及爭取訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他指2019年區議會選舉中，非建制派取得大勝，在452個民選議席中，他們得到約57%的選票但取得389席，可是在投票前不足兩星期，已經發生示威者將活人縱火及掟磚擊斃人事件，又發生中大和理大的暴亂，堵塞交通大命脈，但抗爭者派別依然大勝。郭官指區選結果可以反映以往不同政見人士均會譴責暴力的情況已經改變，「一切立場行先，目的至上，手段可以不理。本席肯定，民粹年代當時已降臨香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民支持重組警隊爭取民主政制改革-官針對中央及特區憲制秩序和地位&quot;&gt;市民支持重組警隊、爭取民主政制改革 官：針對中央及特區憲制秩序和地位&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，民調顯示隨著運動發展，示威者和市民愈來愈將焦點由個別事件轉移到一些根本和結構性議題，例如支持重組警隊、爭取民主政制改革，而不認為要求特首林鄭下台是很重要的運動目標，顯示示威者乃放眼於爭取政治制度的基本改變，「當示威者不是針對個別官員時，本席認為，他們就是針對著中央政府和香港特區的憲制秩序和地位而來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JWzx2c5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官根據辯方所呈上的學術文章，由Clifford Stott教授聯同其他人撰寫的文章，顯示從2019年6月到2020年5月，在香港發生了1,000多次單獨的抗議活動，涉及超過1,400萬人次。郭官指即使這些人沒有參與任何暴力行動，他們必然是對警隊、特區政府或中央政府有著種種的不滿，即使在國安法實施之後，「他們都是有可能受到煽動的對象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，憑司法認知裁定，當時社會上出現了極為嚴重的撕裂，同一家人會因為政見不同而出現嚴重的分歧，甚至父母與子女分開居住。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年7月11至12日舉行的民主派初選，郭官指雖然政府官員早已提出這種選舉可能犯法，但仍然有約61萬人投票，顯示「仍然有大量不滿意甚至反對特區政府和中央政府的市民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lm6uaLp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官流言被宣傳為事實-沒有人願意協助警方進行調查&quot;&gt;官：流言被宣傳為事實 沒有人願意協助警方進行調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官亦關注案發時屬「謠言或不願尋找真相的時代」，他指在這段政治氣氛極為熾熱的時期，社會上經常流傳一些沒有真憑實據的指控，例如指稱8.31太子站有人被警員打死、新屋嶺有人被性侵、兩名年青人（陳彥霖和周梓樂）的去世亦被扯到警方身上。「在提出和散播指控後，沒有人願意協助警方進行調查，但流言卻被宣傳為事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，「爆眼少女」聲稱被警方的布袋彈打爆護目鏡導致一隻眼睛失明，「但她從來沒有證實是否真的失明，更採取一切法律程序阻止警方取得她的醫療報告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官立場的公信力在網媒中排名第一-必然影響力大&quot;&gt;官：《立場》的公信力在網媒中排名第一 必然影響力大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，從中大民調結果可見，網上新聞媒體是受訪者獲取運動資訊的最重要渠道，在2019年6至7月，超過八成受訪者表示「頗多」或「經常」透過《立場新聞》和《獨立媒體》等網上新聞媒體來接收有關運動的資訊；7月至12月，相關比例高達超過九成。郭官憑司法認知，裁斷現在年青人透過手機接收資訊遠較其他傳播方式為多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，根據中大的媒體公信力調查，在10間網上新聞媒體之中，《立場》的公信力是排名第一，拋離排第二的《獨立媒體》。郭官認為，《立場》傳播的訊息必然影響力大，因為大部份年青人透過網上媒體接收資訊，而《立場》被視為在網媒中最有公信力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，據鍾沛權證供，《立場》結束的時候，臉書有130萬個like，追蹤者有160萬人，雖然鍾其後補充追蹤者可以包括針對《立場》的「網軍」，但毫無疑問《立場》的追蹤者是至少接近160萬人，成功地爭取讀者或聽眾進入它的頻道，「影響力極為龐大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指雖國安法實施示威幾近絕跡-社會不穩定因素未完全消除&quot;&gt;官指雖國安法實施示威幾近絕跡 社會不穩定因素未完全消除&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指稱，在《國安法》生效之後，香港社會秩序已經回復正常，恐怖襲擊威脅亦維持於「中度」，與以往相同。鍾沛權亦在庭上供稱，《國安法》生效後，街頭示威活動幾近絕跡，政府亦擁有強大的資源、技術和意志，恐怖主義沒有機會在社會裡萌芽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過郭官指，雖然如此，中央和特區政府同時指出恢復秩序只是第一步，要維護國家安全和香港的穩定繁榮還有大量工作，「他們從來沒有說社會上的政治或其他不穩定因素已經完全消除。」郭官舉例2021年的七一梁健輝刺警案、「光城者」企圖製造爆炸品案和港大評議會通過致謝動議，可見社會表面回復公共秩序，但是隱藏著不少人反對《國安法》實施、對特區的憲政秩序和政治環境感到不滿，而且部份人選擇使用暴力來爭取他們的政治訴求或表達不滿，社會上亦有不少人贊同或美化使用非法暴力的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於恐怖襲擊威脅維持「中度」，郭官指原因是當時官方的評估是沒有情報顯示特區即將受襲，但受襲的風險一直存在。「本席尤其相信，類似七一刺警案的孤狼式襲擊，在它出現之前，警方難以掌握情報。」郭官最後不接納辯方所指社會經已回復平靜，或恐怖主義不可能在港萌芽或發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指17篇涉案文章發布時-約三至五成市民不信任中央政府&quot;&gt;官指17篇涉案文章發布時 約三至五成市民不信任中央政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方呈上香港大學民意研究計劃就香港市民對中央政府的信任程度的調查結果，力陳社會氣氛並不是如控方所說的非常不穩定，而且中央政府並不是處於弱勢，即使社會出現些少批評，但也不會導致中央政府被人憎恨，更不會引起動亂。惟郭官認為辯方對民調數據分析出錯，指調查結果顯示某些時期，接近六成的香港市民不信任中央政府，「不管原因如何，亦不管原因是否有理，他們必然是對中央政府持有負面的看法。在這種心態下，他們自然容易接受任何針對中央政府的負面資訊和批評。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官認為：「當市民對政府缺乏信任時，他們往往更容易懷有偏見和負面的假設，可能會將不信任的情緒轉化為對政府的猜疑和指責，將政府正常或合理的行為解讀為可疑或有問題的行為，縱使他們沒有任何或任何確鑿的證據來支持他們的指控。」他亦指政府會極容易成為不實信息或謠言攻擊的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官亦根據港大民意調查結果和數據，以及相應的涉案文章發布時間，裁定《立場》發布17篇涉案文章時，約30.8%至57.6%的香港市民不信任中央政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，被裁定罪名成立。國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中，有11篇具有煽動意圖。涉案文章被分成四組，就涉民主派35+初選的文章，法官裁定何桂藍專訪、羅冠聰博客文章具煽動意圖，鄒家成、梁晃維專訪則不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何桂藍清楚知道《立場》專訪可宣揚其政治理念，文中提及「會用一切方式與中共周旋」等，顯示她極度仇恨、厭惡及藐視中央和特區政府，在案發時社會動盪、大量市民不滿政府下，其訪問引發讀者對中央和港府產生強烈敵意，不承認其合法性和權威，並製造恐懼，煽動「攬炒」特區。至於羅冠聰，官指他無提出任何客觀基礎下，指律政司檢控初選案為荒謬及濫權，完全漠視執法需要。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 何桂藍（左）、羅冠聰（中）、張崑陽（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另外兩篇專訪，法官指雖涉表述政治觀點，提及香港民族主義、指《國安法》是打壓工具等，但鄒家成專訪「主旨是批評其他民主派人士」，梁晃維專訪「主旨只在交代梁晃維參政之路」、「沒有特別抹黑或貶低某一方的言詞」，「整體考慮下」裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍專訪裁煽動引發讀者對政府強烈敵意製造恐懼煽動攬炒&quot;&gt;何桂藍專訪裁煽動：引發讀者對政府強烈敵意、製造恐懼煽動「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何桂藍專訪〈【立會選戰】專訪—除下記者證後，還有人與她同行嗎？〉，法官指何在訪問提倡與中央及特區政府在不同領域抗爭，而文章發布時初選即將舉行，何清楚知道透過《立場》替她做專訪，她可以將其政治理念宣揚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，何在文中提及不再視議會為議政場所，而是抗爭陣地，又稱「會用一切方式與中共周旋」，而非尋求拉踞，可見她對中央採取「絕對的對抗性」態度，無任何妥協空間，顯示出她「極度仇恨、厭惡及藐視中央和特區政府或激起對其離叛」；而就何稱要「破中共set畀香港的局」，官指「局」無疑指香港憲制地位和秩序，何明顯不接納一國兩制及中央和港府的合法性和權威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對何提到「中共打大力啲，或者香港變澳門」，官指她試圖利用人們對失去自由的恐懼和情緒化反應，相信和接納其主張；何又鼓吹「攬炒」，即不論付出什麼代價，只求傷害政府來達政治訴求。對何稱「那些覺得攬炒是消極的人，只是未意識到香港已經差到甚麼地步」，官指她製造恐懼，極力說服不同意「攬炒」者，令他們相信香港是完全無自由、不能正常生活的地方，意圖說服讀者唯一出路是「攬炒」、與中央和特區政府對抗。而何稱「香港人的抗爭必須繼續，唔可以停」，亦是煽惑人不合法改變在港制定的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官終指，案發時社會動盪、政治氣氛極熾熱、《國安法》剛頒布實施，大量市民不滿甚至反對政府，何的訪問會引發讀者對中央和特區政府產生強烈敵意，不承認它們的合法性和權威，煽動讀者「攬炒」特區，故裁定具煽動性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰博客裁煽動無客觀基礎指律政司檢控荒謬濫權&quot;&gt;羅冠聰博客裁煽動：無客觀基礎指律政司檢控荒謬濫權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰博客〈香港—美麗島〉，批評35+初選案審訊安排、形容檢控荒謬及濫用權力，官指從初選案判決可見，「該案執法及檢控行動合理合法」，認為文章在無提出任何客觀基礎下，指律政司提出檢控為荒謬及濫用權力，「完全漠視執法需要」，煽動罪的辯護理由不適用，在當時社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩下，文章對國安或公眾秩序安全造成潛在破壞，具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成專訪非煽動主旨批評其他民主派人士&quot;&gt;鄒家成專訪非煽動：主旨批評其他民主派人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒家成專訪〈【專訪】由「無人識你喎」到新東初選出線 鄒家成：證明本土理念係有得贏〉，提及香港民族主義、表示不信任一國兩制及基本法、認為中央政府已「撕破面紗」等，惟官細閱後，認為雖涉鄒表述其政治觀點、提及對中央或特區政府的不滿，但訪問更多篇幅談及鄒對泛民的不滿，「主旨是批評其他民主派人士」，「整體考慮」下認為不足證具煽動意圖。官亦指，文章可見鄒是缺乏政治背景的素人，在不同陣營不是特別受歡迎、無政黨支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維專訪非煽動主旨只在交代參政之路&quot;&gt;梁晃維專訪非煽動：主旨只在交代參政之路&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就梁晃維專訪〈【專訪】高歌《熱愛基本法》仍被DQ 梁晃維：可能連區議員都時日無多〉，批評中共和特區政府極權，並指《國安法》是打壓工具，又指35+目的是讓中央「黐線」，自己參選是為得到港人關注，藉此挑戰政權，撕破假象。官同指，文章涉梁表述其政治觀點，但「整體考慮」下，認為「其主旨只在交代梁晃維參政之路」、「沒有特別抹黑或貶低某一方的言詞」，加上文章發布時政府已宣布押後立法會選舉，梁更已被取消參選資格，無可能參選，裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具煽動意圖。有關海外政治人物的5篇涉案文章，共有2篇被裁定具煽動意圖，郭官指羅冠聰的博客文章「煽動讀者的烈士情緒」，鼓勵讀者不顧後果地挑戰政府及中央；張崑陽的博客文章則形容中共為「邪惡軸心」，指責中央滿口謊言，殘害香港自治，以圖引起讀者對中央的憎恨，又將特區政府及中央的鎮壓行動演繹為中央「外強中乾的事實和狗急跳牆的心態」，以此激勵抗爭者。另外3篇分別專訪羅冠聰、梁頌恆和許智峯的文章，則被裁定不具煽動意圖，郭官指它們只涉及受訪者表述其政治觀點，交代離港後動向，沒有進一步鼓動他人行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰文章裁煽動教讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區對抗&quot;&gt;羅冠聰文章裁煽動：教讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區對抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰的博客文章〈在亂世中堅強：低谷、幽暗與希冀〉，郭官指文章以歷史不同的例子，強調發生在香港的社會運動是為了從政權手上重奪自由，又強調強調社會運動源於當權者的權力過大，以致無權者被剝削至一個不能容忍的程度，才導致人民拼命的反抗，郭官認為：「作者在文章煽動讀者的烈士情緒，強調承受代價是社會運動的本質之一，鼓勵讀者不顧後果地挑戰政府及中央的管治。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，文章以足球比賽來比喻社會運動，「鼓勵讀者一天未完場，勝負也是尚未知曉」，又指民主運動自2019年起已全面進入曠日持久的模式，強調只需要堅持就能讓改變持續發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官認為，文章指抗爭者被無理打壓、被失蹤、侵犯、長年囚禁等，而沒有提任何客觀基礎，目的是以假消息散播憎恨及反政府情緒，並激勵在港抗爭者的士氣，要求他們全面進行曠日持久的抗爭。「整篇文章都是教導讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區政府對抗，煽動讀者採取他建議的行動。」郭官裁定，在案發時期社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩下，文章內容對國家安全或公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威，故具有煽動意圖，即引起市民憎恨中央或香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張崑陽文章裁煽動無提客觀基礎下對中央或特區作謾駡&quot;&gt;張崑陽文章裁煽動：無提客觀基礎下對中央或特區作謾駡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就張崑陽的博客文章〈回應國安法通緝：歷史不留白 真理永世在人間〉，郭官指當中內容形容中共為邪惡軸心，指斥中央政府以物質力量逼迫追求公義的人，亦指責中央滿口謊言，殘害香港自治，以圖引起讀者對中央的憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，張崑陽將特區政府及中央的鎮壓行動演繹為中央「外強中乾的事實和狗急跳牆的心態」，以此激勵抗爭者；張亦相信過去的行動對中央構成了巨大的影響，以圖貶低香港政府及中央的管治威信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指張繼而鼓動香港人作出抗爭，引述文章段落：「相信任政權如何使用骯臟手段去打壓和貶低香港人所信仰的價值，但透過我們自身的行動和信念，我們仍然能夠把香港人追求民主和自由的故事流傳開去。強權壓不倒真理，真理不能夠被磨滅。歷史的意志定必帶領我們衝破極權的枷鎖，我深信人民最終會得勝而歸。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官裁定，案發當時社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩，文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下對中央或特區政府作出謾駡，內容對國家安全或公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威，具有煽動意圖，即引起憎恨中央或香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3海外政治人物專訪裁非煽動僅交代離港後動向沒鼓動他人跟隨&quot;&gt;3海外政治人物專訪裁非煽動：僅交代離港後動向、沒鼓動他人跟隨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰的專訪文章〈【倫敦專訪】一個流亡者，帶著愧疚展開新的戰鬥〉，郭官認為文章雖然涉及羅表述其政治主張，但重點在於交代其在英的生活，例如有愧疚感、擔心人身安全受威脅、生活忙碌，以及在中國外長王毅外訪期間，羅趕赴意大利及德國請願、狙擊王毅。整體考慮下，郭官認為文章集中討論羅冠聰在流亡後的經歷及心路歷程，認為證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就許智峯的專訪文章〈舉家流亡海外 許智峯：最親的人安全在側，就放心向政權全面宣戰〉，內容提及許在保釋期間以公務外訪為由獲准離港，其後在社交媒體宣布流亡及退出民主黨，許表示不會和香港及家人切割，亦希望能在海外以打「國際線」維生。郭官認為文章雖然涉及許智峯表述其政治觀點，但重點在於交代離開香港的過程及之後的動向，整體考慮下，裁定證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就梁頌恆的專訪文章〈逃亡美國 誓爭取金融制裁、救生艇計劃 梁頌恆：盼重返屬於港人的香港〉，他在訪問中質疑香港司法系統、提及爭取外國制裁香港，又對中央對香港的憲法地位表示質疑，提出只有兩國才有兩制等理念，亦表示不相信中共之下的地方會有民主的制度。惟郭官指梁沒有進一步鼓勵他人跟從他的想法，或鼓動他人行動，整體考慮下裁定證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖。就涉中大暴動案及「惡意攻擊中央和政權」的文章，法官裁定中大衝突兩年專訪具煽動意圖。法官認為，「保護中大」絕對是「偽議題」，文章無提出客觀基礎下，指中大學術自由受威脅需保護，提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法，並美化暴動者行為，塑造警方打壓學生的形象。法官又指，文章內片段比較校園2019年及兩年後景象，2019年時多個景象可見「光時」等標語，認為《立場》意圖重新展示抗爭口號標語，重燃已經冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公眾對政府及警方憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒幸彤獲頒發「中國傑出民主人士獎」的報道，法官指「細閱文章後，考慮到文章屬新聞報道」，裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;中大衝突兩年專訪裁屬煽動-官指警方行動非針對中大&quot;&gt;中大衝突兩年專訪裁屬煽動 官指警方行動非針對中大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就〈【專訪】【中大衝突兩年】畢業生憶徒步前往護校 哀山城人文精神消逝〉，文中訪問兩名自稱中大校友H及A，提及2019年11月12日警方於中大執法，學術自由受威脅需保護，有學生及校友守護中大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，2019年11月11日，示威者從中大二號橋擲物到橋下公路和鐵路，罔顧汽車和列車會否受損、亦不埋市民人身安全會否受害，癱瘓主要交通幹道，連同其他地區堵路的示威者進行所謂「黎明行動」和「破曉行動」，製造「三罷」效果，作為逼使政府妥協的手段。官指，無疑警方行動不是針對中大或其師生，而是在二號橋危害公眾的示威者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官受訪者無交代真相無提示威者先進攻&quot;&gt;官：受訪者無交代真相、無提示威者先進攻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提到記者A及教師H，當天返回中大，A稱看到防暴警從二號橋攻入中大，學生以樹木掩護及擲物反擊。法官指，從新聞片段可見，當時眾多示威者躲在大型垃圾車和水馬後，沿環迴東路向警員推進，導致警員發射催淚彈，官指A「沒有交代當時真相」，完全無提是示威者首先進攻，雙方拉鋸約15分鐘後警方才展開追捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章指，夏鼎基運動場燒起烈火，催淚彈降落，學生在硝煙中跑，如上演災難片的「大逃亡」。官指新聞錄像可見警員確實向運動場發射催淚彈，場內也有不少示威者，但他們均戴上頭盔及空氣過濾器，並「見不到A所說的大逃亡景象」。新聞亦指運動場旁有汽車被焚，令警員不能前進，官相信這是警員向運動場發射催淚彈的原因，但A「沒有提及這個事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官看不到大逃亡景象受訪者看來怪罪警員&quot;&gt;官：看不到「大逃亡」景象、受訪者看來怪罪警員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A亦提到，聽到其中一名警員說「燒晒佢啦」，令她情緒崩潰。但官指據新聞片段，警員說此句時運動場仍未着火，而警員是說「燒哂佢啦，地下全部火水呀」，明顯是見到示威者在地上淋火水，故嘲笑他們說「燒晒佢啦」，並非建議警員火燒運動場。官又指，場內一跳高軟墊着火焚燒，但其火勢「看來對場內的人也沒有影響」，據報導亦由學生焚燒，既然警員說「燒晒佢啦」時軟墊仍未着火、又不是警員燒軟墊、運動場又完好無損，A無可能因聽到警員這樣說而情緒崩潰，因「這不可能是事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就A稱有玻璃樽在她面前爆開，行前後發現被腐蝕性液體弄傷，工作突然被中止，官指玻璃樽應是從示威者掟來，因防暴警無可能帶着腐蝕性液體的玻璃樽，「但看來她在怪罪警員令她工作停止。」官又指，二號橋屬於政府土地，警員在駐守時沒有進入中大的任何地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官保護中大是偽議題&quot;&gt;官：保護中大是偽議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;教師H則稱11月12日教書後，傍晚與朋友一起前往中大守護校園。官對其陳述是否真實有疑問，舉例H稱穿恤衫西褲、拿公事包，往中大途中有女士塞錢給他坐的士，質疑他已是教師、穿工作服帶公事包，「有女士會認為他需要錢坐的士嗎？」，又指他稱傍晚從沙田出發，晚上11時抵達中大是不吻合。官認為，H陳述的作用「就是挑動讀者的情緒，相信當晚有保護中大的必要」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，當晚雙方大規模對抗後，警方離開，示威者重佔二橋並向橋下擲物，指這是他們衝擊警方防線的原因，「所謂保護中大，絕對是一個偽議題」；而中大事件於11月15日才完結，無證據警方任何期間干涉中大院校自主及學術自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官校方清除塗鴉-絕不可說成打壓言論自由&quot;&gt;官：校方清除塗鴉 絕不可說成打壓言論自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續指，二人兩年後重返中大，H稱當保安要求他進入校園時登記身分，他對學術淨土的幻想一下子被粉碎。惟官認為，「他的說話有點誇張」，指反修例運動後，因各大學曾涉示威，故2019年年尾已有很多大學包括中大設下登記身分程序，目的就是保護大學，而且「小小登記怎會令大學喪失學術自由開放的環境」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於中大內2019年的塗鴉、標語等全被清走，H指柏林圍牆一日未倒，也不會把他推倒，惟官指該些直幡、塗鴉等包括「五大訴求 缺一不可」、「香港人反抗」、「光復香港 時代革命」，大部分具港獨含義，大學無理由長時間保留，「這不是校方害怕政權，而是大學必須表明不鼓吹及不認同港獨。」官形容，校方是「受害人」，把這些損害清除、將校園回復舊觀，「絕對不可能被說為打壓言論自由或容不下學生的聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法&quot;&gt;官：提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，二人2021年11月於中大的見聞，難以證明中大的措施損害了校園出入和言論自由，及不讓學生發聲，H提到政權侵入校園的指稱亦必然不成立。而H稱教授沒了傳承人文精神的自由，也沒有證據，只是毫無根據的假設猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，文章在無提出任何客觀基礎下，指中大學術自由受到威脅需要保護，是「提供錯誤的事實以攻擊警方執法，並美化暴動者的行為」；文章亦忽略警方當時須處理發生於中大的暴動，「反之，文章塑造警方打壓學生的形象。」官又指，文章嵌入錄影片段，比較校園暴動當時及兩年後的景象，而暴動時多個景象可見「光復香港，時代革命」等抗爭口號標語。官認為，《立場》藉文章「意圖重新展示抗爭口號標語，重燃已經冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公衆對特區政府及警方的憎恨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒幸彤獲獎報道裁非煽動-官文章屬新聞報道&quot;&gt;鄒幸彤獲獎報道裁非煽動 官：文章屬新聞報道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒幸彤獲頒發「中國傑出民主人士獎」的報導，引述其得獎感言，當中隱喻2019年修例事件所引起的執法行動及訂立《國安法》等政策，是中共極權打壓民主社會制度及法律、破壞自由、開放社會的行為。法官指，「細閱文章後，考慮到文章屬新聞報道」，裁定證據不足以證明具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖。就涉《國安法》相關執法行動及司法程序的文章，法官裁定陳沛敏、區家麟、羅冠聰共6篇博客文章均具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，6篇文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》等條文及相關執法檢控程序，引起憎恨政府和司法。其中區家麟〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉提及人大可隨時釋法，「識時務的國安法官」自會明了新時代之「公正」為何物，官批評「是不折不扣的藐視法庭行為」；〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉指法官被測試、訓練及無自主，官批「嚴重破壞司法正當性」。法官又指，〈災難現場〉完全罔顧《蘋果》高層非因傳媒身分被捕，而是涉勾結外國勢力，無基礎下攻擊執法；〈2020香港新詞〉聲稱一國兩制在2020已終結，亦是抹黑《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳沛敏文章，官批評以激烈煽情字眼攻擊政府，並將「快必」譚得志煽動案與另兩宗「不能互相比對」的案件相比，煽動公眾對政府仇恨；羅冠聰文章指導讀者以「非政治」組織聯絡及蔓延開去，煽動市民準備隨時再行動，削弱中央管治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏文章裁煽動以不能互相比對例子煽公眾對政府仇恨&quot;&gt;陳沛敏文章裁煽動：以不能互相比對例子煽公眾對政府仇恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳沛敏博客文章〈這星期給香港人的通識題〉，提及譚得志因發表煽動文字被控、一名12歲女童違反限聚令被警圍捕、一名巴士司機在遊行現場響咹被以危險駕駛等拘捕，問讀者哪件事會引起其憎恨、藐視政府。官認為，文章主旨為攻擊譚得志案的執法及檢控，並利用另外兩案負面描述警方執法以加攻擊效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，陳顯然利用一般人憐愛和同情女童的心態，但譚得志的案件與其餘兩案不同，陳沒有說清楚，譚是多次在街頭散播煽動言論，三度被捕才被起訴。官指，另兩案均涉單一警方執法投訴，但譚得志是針對政權合法性和認受性作攻擊，以此相比「絕不恰當」：「作者顯然以不能互相比對的例子來煽動公眾對政府的仇恨。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，陳無疑明示或暗示支持譚得志，及指拘捕譚構成不合理打壓，導致人們憎恨政府及執法機關，批評陳完全漠視警方須執法，沒有提出任何客觀基礎，便以激烈煽情字眼攻擊政府，如「政權殺快必儆香港人，紅線不斷收龍門不斷搬，反正誰大誰惡誰就可以指鹿為馬」，顯然抹黑政府、執法機關及法庭，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰文章裁煽動煽動市民做好準備隨時行動削中央管治&quot;&gt;羅冠聰文章裁煽動：煽動市民做好準備隨時行動、削中央管治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰博客文章〈在國安法下的新常態，我們應如何反抗和思考〉，提及《國安法》讓與當權者合流的親建制人士「擁有濫用法律的話語，在各個體制中去進行思想以及言論壓制」，並舉例香島中學有學生因使用「光時」相片，遭校方記兩個大過、勒令停課一周，最終退學轉校。官指，該例子「顛倒是非黑白」，指羅抹黑《國安法》為打壓思想及言論自由的工具，完全不理會在學校散播港獨思想，是破壞香港特區在回歸後的憲制地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，《國安法》「將以往法律漏洞堵塞」，令老師可「不怕被人濫用言論自由作為武器，無所畏懼地教導誤入歧途的學生」，羅卻把老師說成與當權者同流合污，更散播恐懼指《國安法》下更多個體之間會互相監察，破壞人與人之間的信任及公民社會關係，並抹黑政府用《國安法》斷裂人與人之間的連結，再提出港人應如何反抗《國安法》管治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官認為，文章對《國安法》的描述，「完全沒有客觀基礎，等同製造恐懼以作攻擊」，文章「更指導讀者低調以『非政治』組織聯絡、隱藏及蔓延開去」，目的「顯然是煽動香港市民做好準備隨時再行動，削弱中央管治以及擴闊對其戰線」，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020香港新詞挑動附和追求港獨者情緒&quot;&gt;〈2020香港新詞〉：挑動、附和追求港獨者情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈2020香港新詞〉，官指區「聲稱一國兩制在2020已經終結」，但《基本法》早訂明香港是中國不可分離的一部分，《國安法》的頒布，只不過是在反修例運動港獨風氣盛行、多人爭取外國協助後，重申中國主權，令中國主權不會受到侵害，加上《國安法》或任何條文也無提及影響兩制，區指2020年「一國兩制」確診是抹黑政府和《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就區提及「一個承諾的破滅」，官指顯然指全面直選特首和立法會承諾無落實，惟官指《基本法》只承諾港人高度自治，「全面直選當然視乎本地的情況」，「當香港有不少人要求中央完全不過問香港的事務時，這就等同獨立，這是不可能容許的」，因此區文章「只是挑動和附和那些仍然追求香港獨立的人的情緒」，而區對每個新詞的解釋「只是他在作出政治表述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區稱「『國安』法律武器橫空出世，示範『要法律有法律』的時代」，官指此前香港完全無法律保障國安，而保護國安「當然是國家的事」，國家可授權特區自行立法、亦可由國家立法，2019年運動衍生的政治問題必須即時解決，《國安法》立法刻不容緩。官又指，區不可能不知，立法會在反修例運動期間「根本完全不能運作」，因泛民選出內會主席也用了半年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官終指，文章提及「一國兩制確診，插喉彌留」、「一個奇跡的崩壞」、「管治瘟疫」、「暴政之下，香港出現第一代政治犯」、「苛政猛於武肺」，是對憲制、中央及特區政府管治形容「極為負面」，又以「猙獰面目」形象化地抺黑中國外交官，並在無提出客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》以至司法系統，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲不折不扣藐視法庭&quot;&gt;〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉：不折不扣藐視法庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉，文章批評《國安法》適用範圍過闊，又批評指定法官制度，質疑法官是否可獨立公正地處理案件，並批評保釋條款和不設陪審團審訊。官逐點反駁，指「區家麟不是律師，當然他可以索取法律意見，更可以做研究」，但他從無指出《國安法》哪些條文與其他國家，包括普通法國家不同；官又指，只要區做研究或索取法律意見，就會了解條文「必須依照法例詮釋原則來訂定它的意思，並不容許執法機構濫權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續引唐英傑案和黎智英案等，指法庭清楚說明保釋不涉有罪假設，外國亦有將可取保釋的舉證責任放在被告而不屬違憲，又指北愛爾蘭和英國也可不設陪審團，被裁不違人權法。官指，文章對《國安法》作出的控訴，「除了投訴外，沒有任何實質的理據」，連最低限度，《國安法》與其他國家法例相比，是否存有不尋常的條例也沒有指出，「本席相信是，他根本未能指出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對文章提「律政司司長追殺政敵，絕不手軟，可以覆核刑期，可以上訴再上訴」，官指這些程序本是香港法律一部份，非由《國安法》提供；就文章提「法律程序可有人大常委守尾門」，官指人大常委功能等同英國國會，當然有權在符合《基本法》情況下解釋法律。至於區稱，因人大常委可隨時說明和釋法，「識時務的國安法官們，自會明了新時代之『公正』為何物」，官指「這是不折不扣的藐視法庭行為」，強調所有法官都要跟着法官誓詞履行職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，指《國安法》令政府權力擴展至沒有邊界，被律政司利用打壓政敵，而法官又不能或不會獨立公正地處理案件。文章亦忽略頒布實施《國安法》的必要（見《5.28決定》），及類似法律及相關制度亦存在於西方民主國家，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;煽動作為一種法律武器無基礎下攻擊煽動罪打壓言論自由&quot;&gt;〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉：無基礎下攻擊煽動罪打壓言論自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉，提到「喊一句『結束一黨專政』，就是指控你煽動的大好良機，寫在綱領上三十載行禮如儀，如今有可能變成顛覆」，「覺得冒犯的言論就視作煽動，再把冒犯言論等同煽動暴力、甚至等同煽動顛覆國家，然後把指控當作罪證，未審先囚」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指區在文中對言論自由作出詮釋，然後根據他的定義批評有關煽動罪的法例和判決，認為文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》及《刑事罪行條例》有關煽動的條文為政權所濫用的法律武器，打壓言論自由。文章又指法官被測試、訓練及沒有自主，嚴重破壞香港司法正當性，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;災難現場無基礎下攻擊蘋果日報案執法檢控&quot;&gt;〈災難現場〉：無基礎下攻擊《蘋果日報》案執法檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈災難現場〉，批評《國安法》下針對《蘋果日報》5名高層的執法及檢控行動。官指，區「完全罔顧陳沛敏及其他蘋果高層不是因為他們傳媒工作者的身份被拘捕，而是因為他們涉干犯危害國家安全罪，並且與外國或境外勢力勾結」，而區沒理由知道控方掌握何證據，亦不可能知《蘋果》高層做過什麼事，但《蘋果》東主黎智英與外國政要有聯絡，是一般大眾都知道的事，是否構成罪行法庭當然無需決定，但區「不可能斷言說警方的拘捕行動是完全沒有根據」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，區在文章只是形容《蘋果》高層是「記者」，留在「災難現場」，「完全是沒有事實根據的比喻，其目的只是抹黑這次執法的行動。」而區稱「國安法下，我們正目睹一場災難，一場人權災難、法治災難」，亦全無根據。官指，區稱《國安法》下未審先囚，但陳沛敏2021年6月被捕後，仍獲准保釋，至正式檢控時控方才申請將她扣留，但區對這些現象「視而不見」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 區家麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》於個別案件執行，包括攻擊律政司與法庭，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，在當時社會動盪、政治氣氛極為熾熱、大量市民不滿甚至反政府下，上述文章內容對國家安全或公眾秩序安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威及香港司法，具有煽動意圖，即引起憎恨中央或香港政府、引起憎恨司法等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K7ZDC3E.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，法官郭偉健裁定涉案17篇文章中11篇具煽動意圖。就被告是否具犯罪意圖，鍾沛權供稱《立場》追求普世價值，但不是政治平台，只是履行傳媒責任。惟法官引述創刊辭提到「堅信我城的未來，應該由香港人自主」、「香港，是香港人的主場」等，批鍾稱《立場》對政治主張無立場「絕對是謊話」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞又引述《立場》就6.12、7.21和《國安法》的社論，認為引起仇警情緒、借題發揮指控或暗喻警黑勾結，官並指白衣人非「無差別襲擊」，社論塑造站內人士為「絕對的無辜者」並不持平。就鍾提「借來的地方」、「借來的時間」等，法官認為顯示他眷戀英國統治時代、不接受香港回歸；提「願我們萬眾一心，冒著炮火前行」亦無疑為示威者打氣，營運《立場》目的是與示威者一起抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，《立場》政治理念是「本土主義」，媒體路線是「支持及促進香港自主」，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具。考慮到上述媒體路線，法官認為兩名被告審批涉案文章，是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，意圖煽動憎恨政府等，「無論如何，至少罔顧煽動後果」。法官亦裁定，蔡東豪提供資金營運《立場》，並邀請鍾沛權加入編輯，顯然是可控制《立場》運作，位置比鍾沛權高的「主腦」，與被告有協議持續發布煽動文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指僅17篇文被指煽動證無意圖-官控方無承認其他非煽動&quot;&gt;辯方指僅17篇文被指煽動、證無意圖 官：控方無承認其他非煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖，繼而考慮被告是否知道文章具煽動意圖，及被告是否具犯罪意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權作供時稱，他們只是履行傳媒責任，記錄時代呼聲，而《立場》不是政治平台，只是提供開放平台讓不同聲音都可以發表。辯方亦指，《立場》運作7年，發布逾十萬篇文章，單控罪期間也有兩萬篇，但受質疑文章只有17篇，控方未能指稱其他超過99.9%文章是煽動刊物。因此較合理推論，是鍾沛權和林紹桐一直無任何煽動意圖，只是做好傳媒角色，發布關乎公眾利益資訊及多元意見，涉案文章是多元意見中的「極少部份」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為陳詞「幫助不大」，指控方從無承認除了涉案文章，《立場》全部其他文章均非煽動刊物；而且控方是在審訊開始後，始知警方曾下載587篇而非30篇文章，但避免擴大檢控基礎對被告不公，才不依賴新披露文章作證據，不可能引伸至17篇以外文章均非煽動刊物的推論。官亦指，沒有證據確立，「《立場》的其他99.9%文章是否沒有包含煽動文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁主場結束因商業決定-非因打壓而非正常死亡&quot;&gt;官裁《主場》結束因商業決定 非因打壓而「非正常死亡」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續據《立場》資金來源、股東政治背景、社論、發布文章、刊物、人事任命等，考慮被告是否具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官先指，鍾沛權供稱從開始營運至結束，《立場》運作都是跟隨創刊辭進行，辯方亦指創刊辭說明創辦和營運《立場》的協議，因此創刊辭為極具關鍵性證據，可顯示《立場》營運方針。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指從創刊辭可見，鍾沛權、余家輝和蔡東豪創辦《立場》，目的是繼承已結束的《主場新聞》。鍾供稱蔡因感到壓力及人身自由的威脅而結束《主場》，3人其後商議作信託安排，放棄股權利益和處置股份權利，將《立場》股權交由信託安排長期持有，望外界知道即使針對任何一名創辦人也無作用，因他們無權力結束此公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟郭官引述蔡東豪2014年結束《主場》時的帖文，提到他恐懼和誤判，每次往返內地也提心吊膽，認為蔡的恐懼「只是源自他的內心敏感，甚至想像」、「沒有事實根據」，「他聲稱的恐懼和擔心除了是他的感覺之外，沒有任何實質的事件發生過」。對創刊辭明言或暗喻，《主場》受打壓而「非正常死亡」，郭官亦指「這不是事實」，認為結束《主場》是蔡自主的商業決定，因《主場》兩年來從未達收支平衡、亦無廣告收入，「《主場》不是『非正常死亡』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，創刊辭明言或暗喻信託安排是為了抗拒外來打壓，法官同認為不是事實，指獲取創始資金和防止蔡東豪單方面結束《立場》才是原因。法官又裁定鍾沛權向法庭隱瞞信託受益人、即贊助人的身分，該部分證供不可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;引創刊辭指立場主張本土主義不只守護普世價值-鍾稱無立場絕對是謊話&quot;&gt;引創刊辭指《立場》主張本土主義、不只守護普世價值 鍾稱無立場「絕對是謊話」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《立場》的立場，鍾沛權供稱，《立場》對最核心的普世價值有追求及堅持，但對政治主張「係冇一個立場嘅」。惟官指與《創刊辭》內容不吻合，引述當中提到「《立場》一如《主場》，以香港為本位，堅信我城的未來，應該由香港人自主」，認為已說明其立場，即「堅持的信念，就是香港未來由香港人自主」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指，《立場》成立於2014年12月，當時本土主義、民族論等與中國分離的理論在香港社會尤其大學界興起，加上雨傘運動剛失敗告終，作為「佔中十死士」之一的蔡東豪「做逃兵」，但又聲稱再做一次與《主場》相同路線的傳媒，《立場》為吸引讀者和支持者，絕對有必要向公眾說明其政治立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指，《立場》的立場「絕對不會只是守護普世價值」，引創刊辭稱「以《立場》為名，我們一如以往，敢於宣示立場、不掩飾、不廻避」，必然指《立場》某些信念非人人都持有，甚至可能引人反感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又形容創刊辭最後一句是「重點中的重點」：「香港，是香港人的主場；守護主場，是我們絕不退讓的立場」，認為明顯指「香港是屬於香港人的地方，香港人擁有控制權和處於主導地位，可對所有事務作出決定，有絕對的權力和影響力，其他人在香港只是客人，對香港事務無權作決定」。而「不退讓」的對立一方，官認為必然是指對香港行使主權的中國，及執行香港特區憲制秩序和地位的中央和特區政府。法官指，此句以強烈語氣表達出《立場》政治主張，「就是排除中國由港人自主香港的本土主義」，認為《立場》在創刊辭將政治主張「闡述得清清楚楚」，鍾沛權證供中說《立場》對政治主張沒有立場，「絕對是謊話」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，從《立場》的成立、創刊辭內容及信託安排中信託受益人資料被刻意移走及隱瞞，肯定鍾沛權和蔡東豪等人，替不願意披露身分的金主營運《立場》，「目的就是支持和促進香港本土自主的本土主義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官612社論塑造警隊濫權引起仇警情緒&quot;&gt;官：6.12社論塑造警隊濫權、引起仇警情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞續引由鍾沛權審批的《立場》多篇社論，證明鍾具煽動意圖。就2019年6月12日兩天後發表的社論〈為何我們「針對」警察〉，法官指《立場》當然可發布社論監察甚至批評警方，但必須考慮和分析所有透過誠實和合理努力可查證到的事實，再基於事實「誠實和道德地」表達意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，社論首段提「我們可以自豪地表明立場：我們『針對』警察」，認為並非純粹指出警隊錯處，而是加入情感、使用挑動情緒的字句，對警察展示敵意。社論續指，並非針對警察個人，而是警察作為全港唯一可合法對公眾使用武力的執法部隊，「他們的行為必須被最嚴格的標準審視，他們的權力必須受到監察」，原因包括警隊武力與示威者不平等、多次濫權濫捕但受懲處追究僅少數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官同意，警隊行使武力須有節制及受監察，但社論提出的理由「似是而非」，指「警隊和示威者不是進行體育競技，裝備差距是必然的」，又指有示威者掟磚，質疑《立場》以雙方武力懸殊替示威者提供開脫藉口，淡化及認可其非法行為。法官又指，警權不是不受制衡及監督，並以朱經緯案和七警案為例，指警員因濫權濫捕而負上刑責的案件「時有發生」；而社論離6.12僅兩天，當時會否有警員被起訴或接受紀律聆訊根本無人可預知，《立場》提出「濫權警員毋須或極少承擔後果」，只是散播沒有基礎的陳述，引起仇警情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，社論將個別警員在示威現場執行職務的犯錯，全部提升為警隊的系統性犯錯，但無提供證據，只是將警隊「塑造為一支濫用權力的執法隊伍」。官並指，6.12若不是有示威者衝擊防線，警方根本不會執法，「警方的人數遠遠不及示威者，沒有理由挑起事端」，批評《立場》將警方行動描述為替行政機關的任意莽為保駕護航，全無事實基礎，亦無基礎行政機關利用警隊推行暴政。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官白衣人非無差別襲擊721社論鼓吹制度更換&quot;&gt;官：白衣人非無差別襲擊、7.21社論鼓吹制度更換&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年7.21事件後兩天、由鍾沛權撰寫的社論〈記者遇襲事大　制度崩壞事更大〉，法官指文章一開始將警方在上環以催淚彈等射擊示威分子的畫面，與在元朗白衣暴徒襲擊市民的畫面放在一起，「容易令人聯想兩件事有關連，即警察和白衣暴徒都是向他人施擊，他們同一陣線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鍾指白衣暴徒「無差別」襲擊市民，法官質疑基於什麼證供作此判斷，並指當時兩批人在站內互相咒罵和擲物，站內人曾向白衣人射水，其後站內人士走上月台，白衣人原本無追上，但因月台上有人向他們擲物，才引發白衣人跑上月台襲擊。法官指，「毫無疑問，白衣人的行為錯誤，犯下嚴重罪行，但他們不是『無差別』襲擊市民，而是與他們發生了一段時間口頭和動作糾紛的人，這些在站內的人因為他們的行為也必須承擔責任」，指社論將他們塑造為「絕對的無辜者」並不持平。法官又指，鍾絕對有權譴責暴徒襲擊記者，但《立場》其他文章從來無譴責示威者使用暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提到「不能忘記、默許、縱容以致促成配合這些暴行的制度崩壞」，鍾沛權作供時稱無提「警黑合謀」，只是想講「制度暴力」。但法官指鍾「不誠實」，指社論大篇幅說警方不行動、警方高層與懷疑行兇者勾肩搭背、「默許縱容以致配合黑勢力，借助他人之手，報復示威者」等，是指控或最低限度暗喻警察和黑社會分子勾結，又對警方用上嚴厲批評字眼「齒冷」、「萬死不足以蔽其辜」。法官認為，鍾將7.21事件「借題發揮」，並提出香港無民主制度致警暴出現、政府亦懶理，香港必須出現一個現時不具備的民主制度才可改變，是在「鼓吹制度的更換」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官使用借來的地方等用語-顯示鍾戀殖&quot;&gt;官：使用「借來的地方」等用語 顯示鍾戀殖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於2020年7月1日社論〈堅守每寸自由土壤　用盡每絲縫隙中的微光〉，法官認為是「散播恐慌」，指發布時《國安法》生效不足12小時，法例實質上如何執行他根本無從得知，當中對《國安法》可制止混亂及保障國安隻字不提，並將香港描繪為極權政府統治的地方、意指香港將完全喪失自由，認為鍾是質疑中央和特區政府合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鍾不接納一國兩制憲制秩序，使用如「借來的地方」、「借來的時間」等英政府管治時形容香港的用語，顯示他「眷戀英國統治的時代」；而鍾提到「一河之隔，香港寶地，源自於大陸的差異，原始難得的自由，成為強國邊陲不滅的榮光」，亦顯示他根本不接受香港回歸中國。至於文末「願我們萬眾一心，冒著炮火前行，毋負此生」，法官指無疑鍾及《立場》替示威者打氣，並說明與他們一起行動，鍾繼續營運《立場》的目的，「就是與示威者一起抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官林紹桐稱望令讀者理解運動參與者-必然支持示威者&quot;&gt;官：林紹桐稱望令讀者理解運動參與者 必然支持示威者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐的意圖，法官引述他2019年12月出席「網絡媒體高峰會」的發言，林提及做直播有很多武力場面，但不能反映背後原因，故會做訪問讓受訪者解釋，並稱無論做直播、即時或專題報導，也希望呈現趨近事實的情況，令讀者更理解運動及參與運動的人，從而有共同基礎去討論、評價、甚至參與運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，「毫無疑問，他（林）是要求觀眾不要因為示威者使用暴力或嚴重暴力而與示威者分割」，又指「明顯地，他是試圖要求觀眾諒解示威者使用武力」，並由此推論，「他本人的態度必然是支持示威者」，肯定林紹桐和《立場》的立場就是支持反修例和示威者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官遊行相片現港獨旗反映立誌主旨-推動本土主義力量&quot;&gt;官：遊行相片現港獨旗反映《立誌》主旨 推動本土主義力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於《立場》出版的實體刊物《立誌》，法官指封面首張相片是2019年6月9日遊行，有示威者舉「奪回香港」橫額及「香港獨立」旗幟，指相片出現在序言前，「位置突出」，可反映《立誌》主旨。官續指，《立誌》刊出2016旺角暴動案判囚7年的盧建民訪問，提及6.12事件是本土派2016旺角暴動的延續，鼓勵讀者長期抗爭，可見《立誌》除了是《立場》史冊，「亦是一本本土派的發展和傳承史冊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，《立誌》內梁繼平訪問談及7.1衝擊立法會，是以抗爭行動是「屬於每一人的共同體」來爭取群眾支持暴力抗爭。法官認為，《立誌》其實是一份「抗爭行動記錄」，「旨在紀錄推動本土派透過反修例運動，發展成爭取香港自主的本土主義力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官立場政治理念為本土主義-反修例期間成抹黑政府工具&quot;&gt;官：《立場》政治理念為「本土主義」 反修例期間成抹黑政府工具&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官終表示，從《立場》成立的背景、其《創刊辭》、三篇社論、實體刊物《立誌》，裁定「《立場》的政治理念是本土主義，其媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，在反修例期間更成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁二人知悉並認同文章煽動意圖-以立場作平台煽動&quot;&gt;官裁二人知悉並認同文章煽動意圖 以《立場》作平台煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於發布文章是否具犯罪意圖，法官指鍾沛權作為《立場》總編輯，承認審批其中10篇被裁煽動文章，考慮到《立場》媒體路線，法官裁定鍾知悉並認同文章煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，煽動憎恨中央或香港政府、激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變依法制定的事項、及憎恨司法，「至少罔顧煽動後果」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於餘下一篇中大衝突兩年專訪發布時，鍾沛權已離職，由林紹桐署任總編輯。法官相信鍾真是辭去總編一職，因他需更多時間探訪被扣留的妻子陳沛敏，但鍾「仍然關注着和對《立場》的運作提供意見」。法官並指，該篇專訪發布時嵌入片段重新展示抗爭口號標語，而警方去信投訴為「誤導偏頗」下林仍然堅持發布，加上《立場》媒體路線，及林曾以副總編輯身分出席網媒論壇高峰會，發言支持反修例運動，裁定林同樣知悉並認同文章煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，煽動憎恨中央或香港政府及憎恨司法，至少罔顧煽動後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於首被告《立場》母公司，即《立場》東主、承印人和出版人，法官指公司聘請鍾沛權及林紹桐為其制作及發布文章，當兩人在受僱工作範圍內發布這些文章，亦等同公司發布，兩人的意圖亦等同公司的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官蔡東豪為位置比鍾沛權高主腦-與被告有協議發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;官：蔡東豪為位置比鍾沛權高主腦 與被告有協議發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於被告間是否有串謀協議，法官指，蔡東豪提供資金營運《立場》、簽署鍾沛權僱傭合約、批准鍾加薪、批准調動資金予英國分社，鍾亦承認《立場》是蔡供他運作的平台，認為蔡東豪顯然是位置在鍾沛權之上，可控制《立場》運作的「另一主腦」。而鍾沛權及林紹桐被捕後，《立場》短時間內停止運作，法官「肯定是蔡東豪的決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，蔡東豪作為位置比鍾沛權高的主腦，唯一合理推論是他必然知道發布的內容；而鍾稱兩人在重要核心價值或大是大非事件上「立場相若」，鍾亦先在蔡營運的《主場新聞》任編輯，並獲蔡邀請擔任《立場》總編，一直任職至妻子被捕，蔡必然認同鍾就發布刊物所作的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，唯一合理推論是蔡東豪代表《立場》母公司，與鍾沛權就《立場》發布刊物有所協議，持續發布煽動文章。法官又指，鍾離任總編後由林紹桐接手，必然得到蔡東豪同意批准，林在接手時加入上述串謀協議，因此裁定全部被告罪名成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不會考慮讀者留言推論煽動性&quot;&gt;官：不會考慮讀者留言推論煽動性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就控方認為，讀者於《立場》社交平台留言反映文章煽動效果，官指《立場》容許留言在其網頁或社交平台展示，令讀者可以閱讀，相信《立場》可被視為「發布」這些留言。但由於本案煽動刊物是《立場》發布的文章，而非文章引發的留言，留言亦相信非被告作出，無證據他們認同、也沒有法例要求將不認同留言刪去，法官應自行決定涉案文章是否具煽動意圖，留言者對文章反應不可用作證明事實的證據，因此法庭不會考慮讀者留言以推論文章是否具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KzsvHIZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定涉案17篇文章中，11篇具煽動意圖。本案為首宗涉傳媒被指煽動的審訊，就控方是否須證明被告具煽動意圖，郭官在2022年的「羊村繪本案」曾裁定被告須「蓄意煽動」才可入罪；惟他在本案推翻兩年前裁決，認為「不能有效維護國家安全」，並將犯罪意圖擴至「罔顧煽動後果」也可入罪，認為準則既可有效維護國安，亦可保障言論及出版自由權利。至於辯方就煽動罪合憲性的爭議，認為須證有實際國安風險等才能入罪，法官引譚得志煽動案上訴庭裁決駁回，指言論被裁定具煽動意圖，必然視為對國安造成潛在破壞而須制止，毋須再考慮實際國安風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方爭議條文字眼含糊-官上訴庭裁合憲&quot;&gt;辯方爭議條文字眼含糊 官：上訴庭裁合憲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，控辯雙方有不同法律爭議，包括控方是否須證明有關刊物構成國家安全實際風險；發布煽動刊物罪所須的犯罪意圖；以及執行相稱性是否適用於本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，煽動罪條文中「憎恨」、「藐視」、「離叛」、「不滿」等字眼，令煽動意圖定義含糊主觀，適用範圍過於廣泛及恣意，認為控方須證發布者及刊物具意圖煽動公眾騷亂或動亂，及犯罪行為對國家安全構成實際風險才能入罪，否則限制言論自由便變成不合理及不必要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官引譚得志煽動案上訴庭判詞，裁定字眼符合法律確定性原則，屬合憲；又指相關字眼不能憑空應用，須整體考慮案中實際情況，尤其顧及防止煽動言論對國安造成潛在破壞的罪行目的。官又引上訴庭指，煽動罪目標禁止的是意圖挑動公眾情緒，致產生「強烈」敵意及不滿等情緒，從而煽惑他人否定或質疑政權合法性，意圖「嚴重」破壞政府權威等言論，認為相關字眼「不是過於廣泛或恣意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官矯正錯誤辯護理由-明顯不適用於無客觀基礎言論&quot;&gt;官：矯正錯誤辯護理由 明顯不適用於無客觀基礎言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《刑事罪行條例》第9（2）條提供的辯護理由，即指出政府措施、憲制、法例或司法上的錯誤，目的在矯正錯誤，並不構成煽動意圖。法官認為，該條明顯不適用於無客觀事實基礎、意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威等的言論。而由於上訴庭在快必案已裁定，普通法煽動罪元素不適用於香港成文法煽動罪，故拒納辯方指，須證明刊物和發布者具意圖煽動公眾騷亂或動亂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官毋須考慮是否有實際風險&quot;&gt;官：毋須考慮是否有實際風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方須否證明涉案行為對國家安全構成「實際風險」，郭官續引上訴庭指，維護國家安全須同時平衡保障言論及出版自由等基本權利，而構成罪行言論必須對國家安全、公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞。法官指，當言論被評定為具煽動意圖，必然已考慮相關實際情況，視為對國安造成潛在破壞，須要制止；加上所指意圖是嚴重破壞政府權威，而上訴庭亦指聽眾是否被挑動也沒有關係，因此只要刊物被裁具煽動意圖，便不須另外再考慮是否構成實際國安風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官推翻羊村裁決-裁發布者僅罔顧煽動後果亦可入罪&quot;&gt;官推翻「羊村」裁決 裁發布者僅「罔顧煽動後果」亦可入罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方是否須證明被告具煽動意圖，法官郭偉健在「羊村繪本案」中，裁定控方須證明發布者本身有煽動意圖，「蓄意煽動」（specific intent）才能入罪。控方不同意，認為發布者知道文章具煽動意圖，甚至不預期文章有煽動效果，亦可罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「本席在過往案件作出的裁決沒有約束力」，他必須根據控辯陳詞和所有新增案例，就這個議題再次裁決。他引快必案的上訴庭裁決，提到煽動性言詞可導致煽動行為或活動，危害國安、公共秩序或安全，而訂立煽動罪目的是避免這種「潛在的不良後果」。在此情況下，郭認為自己早前在「羊村繪本案」的裁決，即發布者須蓄意煽動方可罪成，不能有效維護國家安全，因為即使發布者罔顧煽動後果，只要並非蓄意煽動，罪名便不成立，「有違其預防性質」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「經重新考慮後」，認為適當的平衡，是要求控方證明發布者在發布煽動刊物時蓄意煽動，或明知刊物具煽動意圖但仍罔顧後果將它發布，便可裁罪名成立，意味發布時「蓄意煽動、或罔顧煽動後果而明知犯險」，便需承擔罪責。法官認為，此準則「既可有效維護國家安全，亦同時可適當保障言論及出版自由等基本權利」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官言論評定對國安造成潛在破壞-定罪自然合憲&quot;&gt;官：言論評定對國安造成潛在破壞 定罪自然合憲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「執行相稱性」測試是否適用，法官重申當言論被評定為對國安造成潛在破壞，及意圖嚴重破壞政府權威而須制止，「定罪亦自然符合執行相稱性，不須另作考慮」；又指終院在8.18流水式集會案確認，當法庭應用合憲條文考慮被告是否有罪，不須另外考慮定罪是否符合執行相稱性原則。加上終院上訴委員會在處理譚得志上訴許可申請時，無就煽動罪條文違憲的論點批出上訴許可，因此裁定辯方憲制挑戰失敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官法例無要求傳媒遵專業守則-危國安就會受限&quot;&gt;官：法例無要求傳媒遵專業守則 危國安就會受限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方就新聞界職責及角色，引述英國廣播公司（BBC）、香港記者協會等專業守則，又列出歐洲人權法庭等案例，指傳媒有責任傳遞與公眾利益事項有關的資訊和觀點，否則新聞界便不能擔當監察政府的第四權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，在考慮傳媒發布言論時，唯一限制就是須遵守《香港人權法案》第16（3）條行使意見和發表的自由時，附有「特別責任和義務」，包括「保障國家安全或公共秩序，或公共衛生或風化」。法官指，香港法例無訂下法定要求，指令傳媒遵守哪個專業守則，亦無法例限制傳媒不能成為政治或倡議型平台，「但任何危害國家安全或公共秩序的言論或刊物就會受到限制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;引歐洲人權判例指思想市場能被言論扭曲&quot;&gt;引歐洲人權判例指思想市場能被言論扭曲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又特別提到辯方引用的歐洲人權法院判例，當中提到對新聞工作者的保障，受制於須真誠行事（acting in good faith），又強調驗證事實和保持公正的重要性，即使作出價值判斷也必須有足夠的事實基礎。法官並指，「值得注意的是，現代的宣傳不會倚靠整套謊言而是夾雜事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，就鍾沛權作供提及編採方針和原則，法庭不需裁定是否正確，只有一點要提出，就是鍾強調的「思想市場」理念「有它的限制」。法官續引述2024年一則歐洲人權法院判例Graham William Phillips v The Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs，提到言論自由對民主社會的貢獻，建基於一個有效民主的自由思想市場，而「該市場能被言論本身扭曲（That marketplace can be distorted by speech itself）」。該判詞又指，網絡上假帳戶、網軍、機械人（bots）等，可令真誠的自由言論淹沒，並隨獨裁者或權勢者等所想，由不誠實的論述取代。政治宣傳和假資訊，尤其在戰時，可侵蝕民主和國安，能損害民主社會的基石，亦是現代戰爭武器的重要一部分。法官未有就案例作進一步闡述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張俊富（案發時22歲）早前承認「管有爆炸品」及「無牌管有槍械」罪。案情指，張俊富於12月3日凌晨，曾經與黃振強取得兩箱煙花，並放置在荃灣貨倉。在他被捕後，警方於其住所檢取貨倉鎖匙，並前往搜查。最後發現有防彈板、兩盒煙花爆竹、4罐胡椒噴劑、10支伸縮棍、大量示威裝備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情已還柙3年半望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&quot;&gt;辯方求情：已還柙3年半、望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張俊富的大律師李國輔求情指，張案發時22歲，現在27歲，自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。辯方又指，張乘搭快艇到內地水域被捕後，已服刑一段時間，送返港後再因妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。辯方認為法庭可考慮上述因素，以及張主動帶警察去搜查涉案地點，而給予更多扣減。辯方希望法庭就「管有爆炸品」罪判不多於2年，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以6個月為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官明顯作破壞之用不接納用作自衛&quot;&gt;官：明顯作破壞之用、不接納用作自衛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲判刑時指，涉案的炮仗煙花可以令人燒傷，而且擺放在荃灣貨倉明顯打算作破壞之用，就「管有爆炸品」罪以20個月監禁量刑。至於涉案的胡椒噴劑，張官不接納辯方指作為自衛用途，明顯是與「屠龍」的示威行動有關，唯一合理推論是噴向警方，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以15個月為量刑起點。張官認為，張因乘搭快艇潛逃到內地才會被判監，因此是咎由自取，並非減刑因素。張官給予25%認罪扣減，「管有爆炸品」罪其中3個月分期，合共判囚18個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「管有爆炸品」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月3日至12月8日期間（包括首尾兩日），在荃灣致利工業大廈內一單位，明知而管有、保管或控制兩盒煙花。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「無牌管有槍械」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月8日，在同地無牌管有4個載有諾香草胺的噴罐（即胡椒噴劑）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪則不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張俊富亦涉12港人案，在內地服刑7個月後返港，其後承認妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張俊富的大律師李國輔今午求情指，張案發時22歲，現在27歲，自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。辯方又指，張乘搭快艇到內地水域被捕後，已服刑一段時間，送返港後再因妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。辯方認為法庭可考慮上述因素，以及張主動帶警察去搜查涉案地點，而給予更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Wagner Group ceasing to exist last year after the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, it may seem that the threat from non-state actors on the battlefield in Ukraine has disappeared. However, while the most well-known group might have stopped its activities, Ukraine continues to attract various paramilitary groups, most of which hold far-right views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notorious groups that is known for its involvement in Ukraine is Rusich, which has been actively involved in the conflict in Ukraine since 2014 and holds extreme right-wing, neo-Nazi beliefs. One of its leaders, Alexei Milchakov, became infamous not only for publicly and proudly calling himself a Nazi, but also for his penchant for sadistic violence after he made a video of himself killing and eating a puppy. It must be noted, however, that Rusich does not seem to be particularly popular among the Russian far right. Thus, Sergei Korotkih, one of the creators of the Russian National Socialist movement and an ally of Russia’s most infamous neo-Nazi, Maxim Martsinkevich (nicknamed Tesak), was quoted as saying that people like Milchakov are considered “losers” in the movement and see the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to gain traction on social media. This may be true, as the group’s social channels contain very little ideological content and the small amount that is available is mostly dedicated to the thrill of killing Ukrainian soldiers who, it appears, Rusich considers a second-class race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another far-right group is the Russian Imperial Movement (or specifically its military wing, the Imperial Legion) and its smaller affiliates, which consider themselves “nationalists”. They believe that Ukraine as a state should not exist and it is simply part of Russia; hence, they see their participation in the war as contributing to the unification of Russian territories, with the final goal of creating new Russian Empire with a monarch ruling it. The group’s social media is full of posts dedicated to explaining its views and justifying its involvement in Ukraine. It should be noted that despite its enthusiastic welcome of the war and active involvement, the group presents itself as an opposition to the Russian government. In its rhetoric, it appears to hope that its involvement will eventually help it achieve its strategic goal of changing the regime in Russia and seizing political power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) has also gained a certain amount of fame as a Russian group fighting on Ukraine’s side. This group was founded in August 2022 by Denis Kapustin (now Nikitin), a Russian national from Germany. It is believed that Kapustin holds neo-Nazi views, and he has even been labelled as a “key figure in European extreme far-right circles” and “one of the most dangerous neo-Nazis in the region”. Another member of the movement, Alexei Levkin, used to be the head of neo-Nazi group Wotanjugend, and called Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik a hero. Several other members also have a history of expressing public support for extreme right-wing groups and terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikitin himself, in an interview with PBS, said: “Islamisation, cultural Marxism, multiculturalism, I think all those – all those things are harmful. European culture is definitely endangered. I believe in things like the Great Replacement”. These and other comments made by Nikitin resonate with far-right ideology, which leaves no doubt as to his and his movement’s political views. It appears, however, from interviews with other members that the degree of acceptance of these views varies – some members say that they hold traditionalist views but do not agree with more extreme far-right ideas, and others have even argued that the image of RVC as being an extreme right group was created and promoted by their adversaries in Russia (the group is designated as a terrorist organisation in Russia). While this might be true, Russian neo-Nazis have expressed support for RVC on their social media (such as the Telegram channel “National Socialist”) and have even called for donations to help wounded RVC fighters receive medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, there are also two more groups supporting Ukraine – “Freedom of Russia Legion” and “Sibir Batalion” – however, there is not enough credible information to make firm conclusions about their ideological orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors, many of which hold extreme right-wing beliefs and are active on social media reporting about their activities and recruiting new members, as well as committing acts of violence. Their presence in the region is a reason for concern, as not only does it further aggravate the situation on the battlefield, but it also poses a security threat for Europe as these groups may attempt (as some already have) to move their activities beyond the borders of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（28日）踏入第82日審訊。3男6女陪審團昨（27日）早開始退庭商議8小時，仍未有結果，至今天繼續。陪審團提出3項問題，其中一項是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？法官張慧玲回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別-官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&quot;&gt;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別 官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團提出了3項問題，並由法官張慧玲回答。首項問題為：「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，兩者的分別是否在知識上，對於「訂明標的」是否有認知？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的元素，除了包括將炸彈放置在公用場所外，亦要有意圖導致他人死亡，必須滿足上述所有元素。而「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，則毋須考慮炸彈是否放置在指定地點，只需考慮是否有意圖通過爆炸造成相當可能危害他人生命。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問財產的嚴重損害定義-官指無定義要憑經驗決定&quot;&gt;陪審團問「財產的嚴重損害」定義 官指無定義、要憑經驗決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二項問題是，恐怖主義行為中「財產的嚴重損害」的定義是甚麼？張官表示，法例上沒有實質定義，陪審團需要運用其人生經驗及智慧決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論-官指需忠於自己誓言&quot;&gt;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論 官指需忠於自己誓言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三項問題是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？張官回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。若然最後未能達至最低要求的7比2裁決，陪審團可通知張官。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，陪審團現已商議達14小時，希望他們再用更多時間商議。若他們在法律問題上有疑問，或在證據上需要提醒，張官會盡量幫忙，但如果最後仍未能達致有效裁決，就可以告知張官，表示「唔係監你哋話一定要達到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;相隔約一小時後，陪審團再問，他們對恐怖主義行為中「財產嚴重損害」的定義未能達成共識，各人有不同定義，他們希望法官就財產損害的程度提供具體準則。張官表示，她不能提供指引，因這屬事實裁斷範疇，需要由陪審團自行決定是否屬於嚴重。張官希望他們繼續商議，嘗試達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】「法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，昨天踏入求情第9天。參選新西、獲逾2萬票出線的伍健偉，沒有律師代表，選擇隔着被告欄的玻璃幕牆，向三位法官親自陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大約一個小時的陳情，身穿灰色西裝的伍健偉聲線響亮，不徐不疾地吐出一字一句。右手拿着筆記的他，不時望向旁聽席微笑，說到凝重處會抿嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他說到參選原因——眼看有人犧牲自由甚至生命，他難以忍受自己毫不作為，「我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」；他也相信政府是人民的僕人，港人應該亦值得擁有自由社會和民主制度。他又說，五大訴求合情合理，並非海市蜃樓的願望，他有責任為選民爭取；而當四年前61萬港人冒法律風險投票，作為代議士，「我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他於1995年9月6日出生。假若2020年9月6日的立法會選舉能如期舉行，他說當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在獄中近三年半，伍健偉說他願意為其行為負責，但不會為與選民共享的信念道歉：「我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」作為政治人物，他期許自己有承擔，竭盡所能留守到最後一刻，「我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」法官問他是否沒有悔意，他毫不猶䂊答：「冇錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;展望將來，伍健偉打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望盡力貢獻社會——他覺得只要抱持自救互助的精神，記錄過去真相，活在真實當下，為未來做好真誠準備，「香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以下為伍健偉陳情全文和與法官的對答紀錄，由《獨媒》記者整理及謄寫，部分對答經刪節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陽光底下的計劃&quot;&gt;陽光底下的計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持，最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，（轉身向旁聽席躹躬）我祝福各位平安、健康。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就住控方對《國安法》入面「首要分子」同「罪行重大」嘅解讀，喺法律原則上，我冇咩補充，我相信法官、控方同埋一眾辯方律師喺法律原則上嘅議題處理得比我好好多。所以喺如何定義「首要分子」呢件事上，我冇咩想補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如我喺較早之前6月24日嘅陳詞，我認為喺本案裡面，我係一個「積極參與者」。不過控方指出「罪行重大」嘅係要考慮被告或者本案嘅一啲原則，就住嗰啲原則，我希望向法庭提供幾個觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一點，法官閣下，本案「35+計劃」係一個喺陽光底下進行、眾所周知嘅計劃，我哋計劃裡面進行嘅手段同埋目的都係清晰、明確，而為人熟知嘅。我希望3位法官考慮嘅係，要達致我哋本案最終進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案呢件事，單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成。要進入立法會成為議員，係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而廣大市民對於願唔願意授權畀我哋進入立法會呢件事上，我認為其中一個背景，係7月《港區國安法》實施之後，有超過61萬香港市民喺7月11、12號參與咗我哋「35+計劃」嘅初選。法官閣下，毫無疑問，大家對於係咪違反《港區國安法》，喺當其時，對我而言，唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況。換句話說，參與投票嘅61萬市民，亦都係冒住犯上法律嘅風險，去進行嗰個嘅投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個民意嘅代表，除咗我有責任去遵守法律嘅義務之外，我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民，喺咁嘅情況下，希望法官喺考慮本案嘅罪行性質嘅時候，考慮各位被告佢哋之所以犯下本案嘅原因，並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;合情合理的訴求&quot;&gt;合情合理的訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我想邀請法庭考慮第二點嘅係，法官閣下，我同意本案造成嘅後果可以引致一個憲政嘅危機，但係我唔同意呢個係一個憲政嘅災難。喺《基本法》下，第50、51、52條，本身其實已經有預計過發生相關嘅情況嘅時候，法律授權我哋嘅特區政府點樣去處理呢件事。當然，嚴重干預政府施政嘅效率係無可避免，但係喺《港區國安法》第22條裡面，我認為，各位被告充其量都係干犯咗第三條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，「五大訴求」係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求，但係我想指出嘅係，五大訴求對於特區政府係「是不為也」，而非「不能為也」，至少「五大訴求」嘅第一項，撤回逃犯條訂條例，早在我哋7月之前已經係滿足咗。喺呢個情況下，我邀請法庭考慮嘅係，我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：今日是求情聆訊，不是讓你發表政見的場合⋯⋯如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;和平理性非暴力的初選&quot;&gt;和平、理性、非暴力的初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白法官你嘅立場嘅（微笑）。至於第三點，就住我哋本案個性質係咪「罪行重大」，我希望法庭考慮嘅係，喺當其時嘅時空同背景⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳仲衡：若邀法庭考慮為「積極參加者」，無需就「罪行重大」陳詞。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白嘅法官（微笑），雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫，但係假如三位法官唔同意嘅話，我都希望就住另外嗰兩個 category 作出一啲嘅回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過我第一部分嘅陳詞差唔多㗎喇（微笑）。正如我啱啱所講，我希望法官考慮當其時嘅背景，喺當其時，街頭嘅激烈衝突已經持續咗非常耐嘅時間，正如喺我嘅陳詞裡面所講，我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命。所以，我選擇參與「35+」初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無想過違法&quot;&gt;無想過違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你在哪個階段意識到35+是違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我嘅認知係2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你剛才說當時作為代議士，沒有選擇只能繼續，是否代表「35+計劃」進行時，已知道計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我同意法官所講。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：即控罪期間已知計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如果容讓我準確咁講，我對於參加「35+」初選有可能違法，係7月12號初選投票結束之後，我哋嘅政府官員，以及我唔記得係中聯辦定港澳辦喇 sorry，佢哋發出嘅聲明，大概係嗰啲嘅時段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：如指政府發聲明，時間是早於初選投票日。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺初選之前，我記得官員曾國衞先生有提出嘅，不過佢提出嘅係「可能」違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：他當然要這樣說，因為是否違法，是由法庭而非他來裁定，他最多只能講「可能」違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個市民嘅角度，我有理由相信政府係唔會任由罪案發生。容我舉一個例子，有一個人計劃揸車去打劫，佢有冇真係違法當然係由法庭去處理啦，而就算執法部門都只會通常回覆呢個行為可能係涉及違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但係如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我只想知道你案發時的想法，警方何時拘捕是他們決定，不是我的關注。我的問題是，控罪期間，你是否知涉案協議可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺當其時，我對於喺財政預算案投否決，我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法。就住第一部分我嘅陳詞係咁多喇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（小休）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&quot;&gt;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，咁我就住個人背景開始陳詞。本人現齡28歲，現正喺監獄裡面修讀香港都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，係一個恨嫁嘅男人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（被告及旁聽席發笑）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我喺2021年2月28號被提控本案之前，無任何定罪記錄，喺2020至2021年期間，我透過選舉成為元朗區議會嘅議員，我喺2022年6月24日透過當時嘅代表律師，向法庭表達我嘅認罪意向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人嘅過去一切嘅言行而負責。今日我想喺度向三位法官交代，我喺案發期間嘅想法同埋犯案嘅原因，希望三位法官可以給予我一定嘅耐性同埋包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺1995年出世，自從1997年以來，香港涉及社會運動而被檢控嘅罪名、經審訊而裁定嘅刑罰，拾級而上，越發嚴苛，但係及後嘅社會運動，無論係參與嘅人數、時間、規模以及激烈嘅程度，仍然逐步擴大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認為，每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音，如果我哋香港人民嘅合理訴求持續被漠視，矛盾同衝突必然會接腫而來。高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效，深層次嘅矛盾必需要尋求解決之道，社會先有可能復和、邁進、穩定、繁榮，否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有義務繼承逝者信念&quot;&gt;有義務繼承逝者信念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我參與35+初選嘅原因，既有遠因，亦有近因。先講遠因，我個人嘅信念，相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者。我相信冇人願意被極權統治，我認為每一個人都希望生活喺一個可以追求夢想、免於恐懼嘅社會。作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，2019年係我參選嘅近因，當其時有三個因素促使我作出呢個決定。第一個係我對自由被侵蝕嘅恐懼；第二，係對政府傲慢嘅不滿；第三，亦都係最重要、最令我動容嘅原因，係我對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛，我完全唔希望有人受傷，無論佢哋嘅政治取態，我亦都唔希望有人被捕，更加難以忍受有人犧牲生命，但自己無動於衷、毫不作為。作為一個普通市民，我冇能力起死回生，我甚至冇辦法阻止佢哋付出自由同埋生命嘅代價，我冇完美嘅答案去解決如此巨大嘅問題，但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念。基於上述原因，我認為參與社會運動、地區嘅服務、投身政治，係我可以為呢個社會有所貢獻嘅行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺2019年憑藉住4,371位選民對我嘅信任，而成為元朗區區議員；喺初選之中，憑藉住20,525位香港人，佢哋嘅支持而勝出初選。假若2020年9月6號立法會嘅選舉能夠如期順利舉辦，當日嘅結果，可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;成為一個代議士、一個香港民意嘅代表，我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利，同埋佢哋嘅自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現。即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：是什麼風險？你小休前說，當時不認為是違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我被捕之前，我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄，但係並唔等於我認為成為一個代議士係唔會犯上任何嘅《國安法》，原因可能係因為我嘅政治言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我不明白，你是說你當選後會做違法的事？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. 我嘅意思，係我認為即使我唔係成為一個立法會議員，但係喺《港區國安法》之下，我繼續參與政治活動或者社會運動，有好大嘅風險會觸犯相關嘅法律⋯⋯如果就本案「35+計劃」，成為一個立法會議員，喺議會無差別否決財政預算案，正如啱啱所重複，我冇諗過會因為呢件事而違法。但係另外一方面，我認為，我喺立法會議員以外嘅身分嘅行動，譬如，舉一個例⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：不認為需舉例，只是就協議檢控，而非其他行為，你不用自證其罪。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;不為信念道歉&quot;&gt;不為信念道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;咁我繼續落去。法官閣下，距離我被捕之前，我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：可理解為，你對做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（沉默片刻，神情凝重）正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：那不是我的問題，我問的是，你是不是對你做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（直視法官）無錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長夜終盡黎明將至&quot;&gt;長夜終盡，黎明將至&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，展望將來，我作為民意代表嘅任期已經完結，我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望盡力留喺香港貢獻社會，即使我已經預視到困難係重重嘅，不過首先，一如時任嘅終審法官包致金先生所講：「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reason to stay.」我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神、理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑的心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後，法官閣下，二十世紀嘅完結，我哋向蘇聯同埋納粹作告別。失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗。長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：因為你遲認罪和沒有悔意，認罪扣減會遠少於其他被告，你有沒有話想說？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。代表前職工盟主席吳敏兒的資深大律師李志喜指，涉案串謀不涉武力，性質非顛覆罪最嚴重，而且參選人可被DQ，計劃不可能成功。她又指吳敏兒於初選落敗，屬「陪跑」，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」。辯方又引述吳敏兒親撰的求情信，提及她2016年成為職工盟主席，參選僅望改善勞工法律，沒有意圖顛覆國家。她被捕始知涉違法，對此感到震驚，而職工盟已解散，她已與政治劃清界線，形容犯案是「人生最大的錯誤」，就此真誠致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 吳敏兒（左）庭上肖象&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒梁國雄張可森無到庭&quot;&gt;郭家麒、梁國雄、張可森無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的郭家麒、梁國雄及張可森今無到庭，其餘7人按男女分成上下兩排，由6名懲教人員隔坐。昨天綁馬尾的吳敏兒和黃子悅，今改為紮髻，黃亦改為穿有藍白色蕾絲領的黑色公主袖連衣裙。各被告向旁聽親友揮手、點頭，吳敏兒露齒微笑，黃子悅做心心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員劉慧卿、邵家臻，社民連曾健成等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方謀劃不涉武力法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&quot;&gt;辯方：謀劃不涉武力、法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師李志喜為前職工盟主席吳敏兒求情。李表示，《國安法》第22條的刑期分級制僅針對顛覆的實質罪行，並不適用於本案的串謀控罪；但若法庭認為可作參考，辯方立場是本案的「非法手段」不涉武力或威脅使用武力，不應視為「罪行重大」，而法庭不應採納過高的量刑起點，否則便沒有空間處理其他更嚴重的罪行，例如造成人身傷亡、企圖綁架議員等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指謀劃不可能成功-官質疑是否求情理由&quot;&gt;辯方指謀劃不可能成功 官質疑是否求情理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，本案的串謀特別，她從沒見過有串謀會徹底公開其計劃的內容，讓政府能採取措施將之扼殺於萌芽；而計劃的本質是選出最有機會勝出的參選人，在當時而言屬合法的政治活動。她續指，計劃的公開性已埋下「自我破壞的種子」、令其非常難以成功，參選人承諾否決，令選舉主任可取消其資格。她又指，選舉充滿變數，被告一旦當選可能陷入政治兩難，若預算案回應他們爭取十多年的訴求，他們未必會否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，初選有替補機制，有「Plan B」甚至「Plan C」，但李強調，要迫使特首下台，須經過解散立法會後重選，並否決同一份預算案兩次，涉案計劃在現實中不可能發生。陳慶偉笑說，視乎她問誰，如果是問戴耀廷，「他對計劃能成功頗為樂觀」；又以搶劫案為例，指判刑只考慮犯案手段和案情嚴重性，毋須考慮是否可能實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦舉例，若有人想下毒謀殺他人，但出於化學知識的無知，其毒物不足以致命，「計劃的不可能，是否減輕意圖謀殺罪的嚴重性？」李志喜同意涉搶劫、危險藥物等罪要判處阻嚇性刑罰，法官李運騰反問，若阻嚇販毒等罪行重要，保護國家安全不也是同樣重要嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬陪跑與政治劃清界線&quot;&gt;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬「陪跑」、與政治劃清界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜又指，《國安法》於6月30日才生效，計劃的公開、以及社會上有人說初選不違法，令被告認為並無違法。李又指吳敏兒沒有案底，反問「人們會否明知犯法仍繼續？」李運騰笑說：「對某些被告來說，可能」。李志喜指法庭是就個別被告情況判刑，李運騰回應不認為需談到那麼遠，因吳敏兒在最早階段已認罪，並非最激進的參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜同意，指吳於初選落敗，是新界西其中一個最不成功的候選人，在選舉論壇上也因反應太慢，沒有太多發言機會，同意法官李運騰形容為「陪跑（also-ran）」。李又指，初選落敗後，吳繼續工會工作，協助工人渡過疫情，與政治劃清界線，而職工盟亦已解散，她不會重犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是人生最錯決定&quot;&gt;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是「人生最錯決定」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜續讀出吳敏兒的求情信，吳提到自身經歷，她擔任空中服務員，並成立英航香港機艙服務員工會，關注職業安全和爭取權益，並於2016年當選職工盟主席，夢想有更好的勞工法律保障工人權益。李志喜指，吳或不如其他前立法會議員般直接服務社會，但她的人生也投入服務公眾，任職空中服務員對保障乘客安全很重要。低頭看文件的吳一度拿紙巾拭眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續引述吳指，她參選立法會的願景很簡單，只是希望推動社會進步，令工人能分享經濟成果，她從沒有意圖以任何方式顛覆國家。吳敏兒又指，被捕後才意識到干犯了《國安法》，對此感到震驚，強調自己不會明知而犯法。她承認所犯罪行非常嚴重，對犯案真誠致歉（genuinely sorry），「干犯本案肯定是我人生最大的錯誤」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李重申，吳並非從一開始就刻意犯法，她深感後悔。惟法官陳慶偉指，能接納吳不大可能重犯、並非首要份子、本案不涉武力手段，但不認為能接納辯方稱吳無意違法。李志喜同意吳認罪，意味她承認有意圖犯案，但認為吳當時不知道違法，可構成減刑理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李終指，吳敏兒參與較輕，在初選落敗，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」，並望法庭考慮吳敏兒家庭和個人健康狀況減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DACEXNS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。譚凱邦一方認為譚屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指前天文台台長林超英為譚撰求情信，肯定他對環保的付出；而譚決心不再重返政治，包括不再提倡環保議題。辯方又指，譚還柙期間受感染，手腳皮膚潰爛，望法庭能基於人道原因酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林一方同倡柯為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指柯溫和保守，參與程度較其他被告為低。不過法官質疑，他曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張、聘請選舉經理，難言參與較他人少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第五批被告今完成求情，下周一（9月1日）將處理最後一批被告求情，為餘下9名新界東初選參與者：何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林超英撰求情信-肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&quot;&gt;林超英撰求情信 肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表譚凱邦的大律師馬維騉指，譚熱衷環保議題，他獲前天文台台長林超英撰求情信，指認識譚多年，肯定他對環保議題的付出。譚亦獲妻子、中大退休教授、環保團體、區議會同事、馬灣居民等撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，譚一直視環保議題為首要議程，他參與初選目的並非顛覆政府，而是望進入議會，為環保發聲。馬又指，譚在初選屬「陪跑」，於新西初選得票最低，票數比排尾二的吳敏兒還要少一半，未能出線。翻查資料，吳敏兒獲10,860票，譚凱邦獲4,865票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&quot;&gt;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，辯方是說獲得最少票數的參選人，刑期應最輕？馬指不是，但指譚知名度低，即使初選採用替補機制也對他無影響。馬續指，望法庭考慮譚並非初選組織者或主要推手，參與程度低，屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，加上他認罪獲三分一扣減，相信他很快會獲釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續指，譚曾任兩屆馬灣區議員，具良好品格，而譚在還柙期間修讀建築管理課程，顯示他決心不會重返政治，因他意識到如再向政府提倡環保議題，必然牽涉一定程度的政治。譚凱邦聞言點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，譚還柙期間舌底曾出現腫囊，亦有皮膚問題，還柙期間受感染，望法庭考慮其健康問題增加他服刑苦楚，而額外減刑。法官陳慶偉閱讀譚2021年的醫療報告，指譚的病情不夠嚴重，馬指有今年4月的醫療記錄，但陳指那並非醫療報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，探望譚凱邦時，看到其手腳皮膚潰爛，情況「非常差（very bad）」，譚一度在被告欄內攤開雙手手掌展示，又提起右腳。陳慶偉說：「我們不是醫生，我們只看醫療報告」。馬表示可索取進一步醫療報告，並認為法庭可運用酌情權，基於人道理由作減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅指，柯在串謀的參與非常有限，其初選得票率低，不足1%，認為柯屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度。他又指，相較其他光譜的參選人，有出席記招、定期擺街站、發起「墨落無悔」，柯只是站在一邊，認為要做一些事來取得參選入場券。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉質疑，柯曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張。葉回應，重點是柯的參與程度有多重。陳慶偉即說：「他當然有大力為選舉宣傳（heavily campaigned for the election）！他聘用了選舉經理⋯⋯你怎能說他的參與比其他人少？」法官李運騰亦指，柯或不是最激進的候選人，但不等於他罪責最輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯溫和保守參與公共服務多年&quot;&gt;辯方指柯溫和保守、參與公共服務多年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，柯耀林專注民生議題，而非推翻政府，他具良好品格，參與公共服務多年，自2003年起三度當選區議員，2008年亦獲政府表揚就公共服務的貢獻。辯方強調，柯是非常溫和保守的政治人物，涉案屬「不幸」，他獲不同政治光譜的區議員撰寫求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又引柯的關姓友人求情信，二人相識逾20年，關指柯因想協助更多人而辭職參選區議員，並在他於內地中風時，立即協助安排他到港接受治療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years have now passed since the humiliating retreat from Afghanistan. The UK has been fortunate that the US has borne the brunt of the opprobrium but, in truth, the Whitehall failure was equally shocking. In classic British tradition, the disaster is being rewritten as a Dunkirk-style “backs to the wall” triumph, with claims that the Taliban victory could not have been predicted. In fact, it was both predictable and predicted. There is little danger of lessons being learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 August 2024 the Taliban staged an impressive military parade at the former US air base at Bagram showing off the vast range of Western equipment that was left behind, including Black Hawk helicopters, MRAP mine-resistant vehicles, and Humvees. Far more serious are the thousands of semi-automatic weapons, millions of rounds of ammunition, artillery shells and (particularly) night-vision goggles that are now available to the many terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, some of which intend to destabilise neighbouring countries and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) there is a sense of anticipation that David Lammy, the new foreign secretary, intends to make Afghan relations one of his flagship policies. Position papers are being prepared for meetings in early September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy visited Afghanistan in June 2022 and alleged that “the UK government’s woeful lack of leadership that was so visible last year is continuing as it ignores the humanitarian catastrophe. Ministers must urgently set out a comprehensive strategy for engaging with Afghanistan…” In reality, there is no need for political contact to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, most of which is delivered by the UN and international NGOs. In 2022 the FCDO provided £286 million in aid to Afghanistan and co-hosted an international conference which raised a further $2.5 billion. The British HALO Trust continues to undertake its vital work of removing Improvised Explosive Devices, which killed dozens of civilians – mainly children – last year. Such aid must continue, even increase, because the Afghan people did not want or deserve a Taliban government foisted on them by a craven US negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official-level contact with the Taliban continues, with Robert Dixon – the British charge d’affaires – visiting Kabul regularly from Qatar. In a meeting with a senior Taliban official only two weeks ago, he was quoted as highlighting “London’s commitment to collaborating with [the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] to enhance global relationships”. If correctly reported, this sounds like the first indication of a new policy in the offing. This may be the first real test of Lammy’s progressive realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should the UK engage with the Taliban? There are three reasons: to improve its understanding of the terrorist threat; to stop the harassment (and occasional killing) of those Afghans who served with British forces (such as the Triples); and to address the problem of migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should pause here to consider the Taliban of 2024. The much-trumpeted Taliban 2.0 was always a work of fiction, a press line cobbled together in Pakistan and swallowed whole by Western officials. The British Defence Chief at the time described the new Taliban as “country boys” who needed to be given space to show they were reasonable. However, the Taliban won the war against NATO, brought peace to the country and will likely be in power for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there are two main wings of the Taliban. The most influential group is based in Kandahar under the Supreme Leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada. These Kandaharis espouse a fundamentalist interpretation of their role. “We were created to worship Allah and not to earn money or gain worldly honour” was Akhundzada’s recent riposte to the Taliban government in Kabul, which wants international recognition and economic progress to reduce unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be a mistake to see the Taliban government in Kabul as moderate in any conventional sense – although the Pakistanis refer to them as the “saner Taliban”. Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani is a terrorist of long standing. Only two months after the victory in August 2021, he celebrated suicide bombers and their families at an event in the Intercontinental Hotel. Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub, meanwhile, is the son of the former Taliban Emir (or Amir) who gave Osama bin Laden sanctuary in Afghanistan before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai spoke out in favour of female education in December 2023, and his comments were but one indication of policy tensions within the Taliban. But, as in Iran, it is the word of the Amir (or Supreme Leader) that prevails. Taliban enthusiasm for outreach to the West is largely tactical, to alleviate the financial and economic chaos into which they have plunged their country. In particular, they are seeking the unfreezing of Afghan state assets held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the Kabulis overthrow the Kandaharis? In theory, yes – the blood-soaked Haqqanis alone have the capability. In practice, though, this is implausible. Akhundzada is the “Amir ul-Momineen” or Commander of the Faithful and is imbued with full religious authority. It would be a terrible crime from which the perpetrators would never recover. The best that the Kabulis can do is use the power of argument to secure small adjustments in policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Lammy and his FCDO officials should have no illusions about who they are dealing with. There is no chance that the Taliban will accord women their rightful place in society. At best, Whitehall can hope for small incremental steps on women, human rights and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no country has yet recognised the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan, there is a great deal of guile behind the scenes. Pakistan, Iran, Russia and China were all represented at the Bagram parade. A further 20 diplomatic missions in Kabul are now staffed, including those of Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the five Central Asian Republics (CARs). In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no-one is finding engagement easy. Pakistan, in spite of its decades of ill-considered support for the Afghan Taliban, has failed to obtain any cooperation against the TTP (often known as the Pakistan Taliban), which mounts terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. China has offered to include Afghanistan in its massive but ailing Belt and Road Initiative, but has not found sympathy for its request to hand over Uyghur militants. Even Qatar, which hosted a Taliban diplomatic mission when the group was fighting NATO forces, is finding that the Taliban prefer to deal with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, London would demand full women’s rights and counterterrorist cooperation in return for installing Dixon in the UK’s embassy in Kabul. However, maximalist demands have no chance of being accepted. This is what happens when you lose a war. As a regional Islamist told the author: “Losers can’t be choosers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what realistic measures could the UK require from Afghanistan before reopening its embassy in Kabul? There are four principal areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women:&lt;/strong&gt; A recent survey by the UN found that 64% of Afghan women felt unsafe leaving their homes (compared to 2% of men). Women’s safety is one area where the UK could push for change, as a first step towards other gradual improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrorism:&lt;/strong&gt; There is clear evidence that the Taliban are fighting Islamic State Khorasan Province, and this is an area where the UK could benefit from cooperation. However, the Taliban are also playing host to a vast array of other terrorist groups and individuals – including Al-Qa’ida and the TTP as well as Balochis, Uyghurs, Uzbeks and Chechens – who will remain unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Triples:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still evidence that the Taliban are hunting down members of the British-trained and sponsored Special Forces units, 333 and 444. Any move towards engagement should require a full and monitored amnesty for the Triples, including assisted transfer to the UK if requested. This could lead to further cooperation on migration to the UK, preventing Afghans from having to resort to a perilous 4,000-mile journey followed by a Channel crossing at the mercy of predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroin:&lt;/strong&gt; 90% of heroin on UK streets comes from Afghanistan. The continuing Taliban prohibition on cultivation should be welcomed, although there is now Fentanyl to plug any gap in supply. The UK could work with the Taliban to explore alternative livelihoods for newly impoverished opium farmers, using the extensive work conducted in London during the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this can be done in isolation. Afghanistan would provide an ideal subject for Lammy to collaborate with other countries, not just the G7 and the EU but India, Turkey, the Gulf states, the CARs and even China. There is a great deal of global unanimity on what is required from Afghanistan. The key is to leverage change but to demand conditionality at every stage. This is something that both Trump and Biden failed to do after the Doha Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights. However, there is no point in pretending the Taliban do not exist. So, Lammy should proceed, but with extreme caution. If he gives too much in return for too little, he will become the latest of many generations of UK politicians to underestimate the political dangers of Afghanistan. The probability is that any hopes of genuine change will ultimately perish on the rocks of the Amir’s theocratic obduracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The readiness of the UK’s fleet of nuclear attack submarines (SSNs) has been a source of enduring concern over the previous half decade. With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service (less than half of what the UK had at the end of the Cold War), the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history. Moreover, challenges with respect to maintenance, compounded by the priority accorded to ensuring that the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent remains operational, have resulted in periods during which the UK did not have an attack submarine at sea. In light of the growing threat posed by Russia’s Northern Fleet, ensuring the readiness of a capability which remains a key UK offer to NATO as an alliance member will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-balance-of-forces&quot;&gt;The Balance of Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition to maintain a commanding position in the undersea operating environment played a crucial role in the Cold War. During the early years of the Cold War, tracking Soviet SSNs as they attempted to break through the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap was vital to Allied efforts to ensure that US reinforcements could cross the Atlantic. In the 1980s, NATO’s approach shifted. In the context of a forward maritime strategy, the ability of NATO to menace Soviet ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in their bastions was a key component of deterrence against the USSR, which was presumed to enjoy considerable advantages in Central Europe. The success of this approach was perhaps best illustrated by the fact that by the end of the Cold War, the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet was compelled to request a trebling of his budget if the maritime component of Russia’s nuclear triad was to be adequately protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a rough symmetry in how Allied and Russian forces have evolved, with both sides undergoing quantitative reductions but qualitative improvements. The Russian Northern Fleet fields 13 active SSNs and guided missile submarines (SSGNs), a far cry from its heyday, but vessels such as the Yasen and improved Akula II and III are considerably quieter than their predecessors. Allied submarine fleets including the Royal Navy’s submarine flotilla have endured a comparable drop in capacity, with the Royal Navy fielding fewer than half as many submarines as it did in 1990, although the Astute is also considerably quieter and more capable than the Trafalgar class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major shift, however, is that the US SSN fleet will increasingly be focused on demands in the Indo-Pacific, where robust Chinese anti-access/area denial capabilities will put surface vessels at ever greater risk, but where US submarines still enjoy considerable advantages over the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s noisy SSNs and immature anti-submarine warfare assets. As the size of the US submarine fleet (which is already well short of the 66 boats the US navy requires to meet its commitments) shrinks during the late 2020s and reaches a low of 46 boats by 2030, it is not unlikely that the Pacific, where 60% of US submarines are typically deployed, will receive an ever larger portion of a temporarily smaller SSN fleet. Past 2026, the US navy expects to increase its build rate to three attack submarines per year, which should see it return to and then exceed its current strength by 2035, although the real effects of this regeneration of capability (if achieved) will be somewhat attenuated by the fact that the Chinese threat will not stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, this raises the possibility of short-term capability gaps emerging. In this context, the readiness of the Royal Navy’s submarines – which are, among other things, the only non-US Allied nuclear submarines that regularly perform under-ice operations – is both a national and an Alliance-level concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service, the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to assume that the Russian submarine fleet is ten feet tall. Of the 13 SSNs and SSGNs currently fielded by Russia’s Northern Fleet, only a handful can be described as truly modern. While the Russian Yasen and Yasen-M are competitive against Western submarines, four of the Northern Fleet’s SSNs are aged Sierra II and Victor III-class boats, and the fleet also fields two older (though still credible) Oscar-class SSGNs. The fleet’s Project 971M/I Akula-class submarines are slowly returning to readiness after a trough in capability during the last decade, with SSNs such as the K-328 Leopard and K-154 Tigr completing refits in the early 2020s. Even so, the number of project-improved Akulas at the fleet’s disposal in the next several years should hover around six, meaning that the fleet currently fields eight SSNs/SSGNs (six Akulas and two Yasen/Yasen-M) that are credible in a modern context. Although Russian practice has historically prioritised surge capacity over presence at sea (which is why the Soviet Navy only deployed 25% of its SSNs at any given time during the Cold War as opposed to the 66% which the US navy maintained), a very high readiness rate of 80% would imply six or so modern SSNs being available in Russia’s Northern Fleet in a crisis (though submarines could be moved to the north from the Pacific Fleet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will field more Yasen-class SSGNs by the end of this decade. While the lead boat of the class, the Severodvinsk, took 15 years to build, its successor the Kazan was constructed in eight years and accepted into service after 12, while the third and fourth submarines in the class (both allocated to the Pacific fleet) reached full operational capability in eight and nine years respectively. Two more boats were ordered in the first tranche of Yasen-class submarines to be built, and will likely enter service in 2024–25. In this period, the Northern Fleet’s complement of Yasen-class boats will increase from two to three (with three Yasen-class boats in the Northern and Pacific Fleets respectively). The Russian navy has commissioned a further six boats in the class which will likely enter service in the 2030s, assuming a comparable build rate. At present, there is some indication that the Yasen fleet appears to have been committed to the maintenance of a near year-round presence off the coast of the continental US – something which will likely require all four of the boats currently in service to maintain, and which will leave the fleet with limited surge capacity. One reason for this might be that the Russians are replicating the Soviet policy of delivering an “analogous response” to US missile deployments in Europe (which will occur from 2026 onwards) through the deployment of missile-equipped submarines to the Western Hemisphere. If this is the case, the ability of the Yasen fleet to surge multiple SSNs into the Atlantic will be limited until the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the 2030s, then, will represent a point of particular concern as a nadir in US capability coincides with the growth of the Yasen SSGN fleet as a consequence of investments being made now. Past the mid-2030s, both a recovery in US numbers and progress on SSN (R)/SSN AUKUS will (in the absence of delays) result in the rectification of this imbalance. While the situation in the Atlantic is not presently critical, it is vital that steps are taken to ensure that a window of vulnerability does not open in the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-more-out-of-astute&quot;&gt;Getting More Out of Astute&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be assumed that some of the issues plaguing the Royal Navy’s submarine readiness right now can be resolved at the speed of relevance if the threat is likely to become most acute at the end of the decade. To use one example, the lack of available docks at Devonport (which has forced a prioritisation of SSBN maintenance) should be resolved in the coming years, as 10 Dock at Devonport becomes available and 15 Dock is converted to service the Astute class. Furthermore, the floating docks being procured under the Additional Fleet Time Docking Capability (AFTDC) programme should help with the issue of readiness, although this programme is nascent and no date has been set yet for the tender. Finally, the Astute fleet will grow by two SSNs during the next few years. While still considerably smaller than the Russian Northern Fleet in numerical terms, the Royal Navy can, in conjunction with other European SSN operators such as the Marine Nationale, offset the effects of a relative reduction in US capacity and match a notional Russian force of 10–11 modern attack submarines which may be operated by the Northern Fleet in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a certainty, however, and the fate of programmes such as the AFTDC remains to be seen. Moreover, infrastructure investments will not entirely resolve some of the challenges highlighted by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Lieutenant General Rob Magowan, which include supply chain management and the availability of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the question of availability will only be exacerbated by the rotational deployment of an Astute-class submarine to Perth beginning in 2027. To be sure, AUKUS is not necessarily a drag on capacity – investments in the UK’s submarine industrial base by Australia may be an important part of the solution to certain issues such as supply chain management. However, the timing of the rotational deployment bears considering, since this could coincide with the point at which the Russian submarine threat peaks. There may be competitive advantages to be gained in Europe from the deployment of submarines to the Pacific. To the extent that Russia (incorrectly) assesses AUKUS to be a full-fledged military alliance, it is likely to view any steps to delivering on it as a threat to the Russian Far East where, notably, half of the incoming batch of Yasen-class SSGNs will be based. As such, the strategic ambiguity of a rotational presence could play a role in fixing Russian assets away from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These opportunities notwithstanding, a more salient question for the Royal Navy may be the timing and form that its rotational commitment to Submarine Rotational Force West takes. One approach to how the rotational deployment might be conducted by partner states could conform to the logic of dynamic force employment articulated by former Secretary of Defence James Mattis, in which forces were expected to make short, irregular deployments geared towards an emphasis on readiness and operational uncertainty. If the deployment schedule of British and US SSNs was made shorter and larger in scale (with multiple SSNs on any deployment but for a shorter period), this could impose a degree of operational uncertainty on Russia while maintaining a regular drumbeat of visits to Australia for functions such as training and political signalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a likely multi-year rotational forward presence is deemed politically vital to the success of AUKUS, the UK would do well to deliver its part of the commitment before 2030, which is when the threat in Europe will peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to thinking about how longer-term commitments are managed and sequenced, the tasking of the Astute fleet could become more focused. For example, the role of SSNs as Tomahawk land attack missile (TLAM) launchers in support of expeditionary activity might reasonably be sacrificed given that this entails the use of a highly specialised platform for functions that can eventually be played by surface vessels, and draws on capacity in support of relatively peripheral missions. Until the Type 26 enters service, readiness for the contingent employment of limited stocks of TLAM outside Europe might be treated as a task to be effectively gapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a greater emphasis might be placed on committing more resources to key activities such as ASW and exercises such as Ice Exercise, in which the Royal Navy and US Navy practice under-ice SSN operations (something no European partner other than the UK provide the US), even if this comes at the expense of other standing commitments (beyond nondiscretionary missions like protecting the deterrent). A more narrowly focused pattern of activity could help optimise a limited fleet for its core functions, which during the latter part of this decade and the first part of the next could in turn set the conditions for a more balanced pattern of activity towards the middle of the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the relative balance between the submarines of the Russian Northern Fleet and Allied capabilities can be influenced in certain ways. As mentioned, the rotational deployment of Yasen-class submarines in what appears to be an analogous response posture will rob Russia of surge capacity. Similar long-distance deployments as part of an analogous response approach might be incentivised by forward operations in the Barents Sea (which former commander of the Russian Navy Admiral Yevmenov discussed with some concern in the journal Morskoi Sbornik), or through live exercises simulating the firing of submarine-launched cruise missiles from forward positions (something which is viewed as a matter of concern since British missiles are viewed as a component of a much larger US prompt strike capability). These represent notional examples rather than concrete solutions, but the broader point is that the pattern of activity the submarine service should aim for is one in which short bursts of Allied activity stimulate much longer Russian deployments. While the number of hulls in the Russian Northern Fleet cannot be impacted, the number available to Russia at any time can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are no simple fixes to the challenges that shortfalls in SSN numbers will pose. These shortfalls will not be acute until later in this decade, by which time the UK should have overcome some of its own short-term challenges. The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge. In this window, it will likely be vital to narrow the number of tasks performed by the Astute fleet as much as possible.

  &lt;li&gt;3男6女陪審團今早開始退庭商議&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GIGMWFr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員與另一勇武小隊涉計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（27日）踏入第81日審訊。法官張慧玲已完成引導陪審團，3男6女陪審團今早約11時起退庭商議。張官指，陪審團需達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時她會作進一步指引。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官有人在串謀之後退出亦非答辯理由&quot;&gt;官：有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第七日引導陪審團。她提及本案控罪的罪行元素。就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，「訂明標的」是指公用場所，即開放予公眾人士的地方，而本案目標地點為灣仔軒尼詩道，符合公用場所的定義。她又指，本案控罪屬串謀，控方需要證明兩人或以上達成非法協議，意圖用爆炸性裝置導致他人死亡或遭受身體嚴重傷害。至於串謀者可以用身體語言、手勢、姿勢或行動達成協議，不一定要用書面形式。當協議達成後，串謀就已經完成；若串謀者仍然維持至少兩人，串謀就繼續存在。如有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方需證明有意圖加入協議並打算付諸實行&quot;&gt;官：控方需證明有意圖加入協議、並打算付諸實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，控方需要證明被告有意圖與控罪所指的串謀者加入協議，並打算由被告本人或其他串謀者付諸實行，但毋須最終有實行。張官重申，以下3個情況並不屬串謀一份子，包括：對協議不知情、知情但無意加入、假裝加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，吳智鴻為串謀的策劃者（Mastermind），他有最大的知情度。而根據控方立場，「屠龍」等成員則較遲加入，但張官表示毋須證明各被告在同一時間知道串謀，亦毋須證明各被告均曾接觸過所有串謀者，因此「屠龍」成員可以不認識吳智鴻一方的人，亦可以沒有互相聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於屬交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，張官指如果「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪不成立，陪審團就要考慮此罪是否成立。此罪主要涉及非法及惡意地，串謀藉爆炸品導致爆炸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀謀殺」罪，張官指需要證明串謀者有意圖殺害他人，只是令對象身體受嚴重傷害並不足夠。就李家田被控的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪，張官認為陪審團需考慮李的招認口供，即提及自己曾經管有手槍，是否在警方威逼利誘之下作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&quot;&gt;官：控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就劉佩凝被控的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指需要證明被告提供或籌集財產是作恐怖主義行為，但毋須證明財產是否實際上被如此使用。而控方立場是投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為。控方另指，劉負責在用作眾籌的「育龍」頻道上，發布「屠龍」的示威精華片段，她亦知道部分款項會給予負責用汽油彈的「魔法仔女」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&quot;&gt;官：需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官最後提醒，控方需要證明被告有罪，而被告則毋須證明自己無犯罪。她又指，陪審團需要達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時張官會作進一步指引。張官另指，若陪審團在退庭商議期間有疑問，可以書面形式交給她，她會與律師商討後回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團退庭商議8小時後，仍未有結果，明早9時繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早繼續進行求情，包括新界西、新界東共8名被告。多年戰友「女長毛」雷玉蓮昨晚才知悉，便急忙請假前來西九龍裁判法院：「唔好令佢覺得孤單，等佢知我哋到咗。」蓮姐表示，長毛即使身陷囹圄，仍多次喚她要多探望戰友古思堯：「長毛撐得住！佢喺獄中都尚且記掛戰友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;憶昔日行動-念長毛總為戰友行先&quot;&gt;憶昔日行動 念長毛總為戰友行先&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了一共參選新西的被告，根據司法網頁顯示，參與新東初選的梁國雄、柯耀林亦由今日起一併作求情。雷玉蓮今早便請假到法院支持戰友，她早前曾探望長毛，形容對方「撐得住」，並引用蘇東坡的詩句送予長毛：「稽首天中天，毫光放大千，八風吹不動，端坐紫金蓮，佢就係一個咁樣嘅人，無嘢打動得到佢。」她身穿印有蓮花的外衣，寓意47人出於污泥而不染：「所以我要著呢件衫支持佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YEwEVIo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蓮姐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蓮姐對記者談到一件事，多年前與長毛到位於中環下亞厘畢道的舊政府總部抗議，那年頭衝擊鐵馬「正常不過」：「嗰陣時吳恭劭都仲喺度⋯⋯嗰次好多警察，好危險，我哋最後無衝，我哋同警察鬥企。長毛將示威物品掛咗喺度就算，佢想確保所有人都安心。長毛好多時都諗咗人哋先，先諗自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w7CbBZe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;盼47人大步檻過-嘆舊日較少合照&quot;&gt;盼47人大步檻過 嘆舊日較少合照&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到47人案的求情即將進入尾聲，蓮姐最希望他們能大步檻過：「最緊要佢哋出到嚟，咩是是非非都唔重要。有啲人求情講甚麼東西，其他人講甚麼東西，每個人處境都唔同，我一個人食得幾多？但當你有家庭、有顧慮嘅時候，你諗嘅嘢都會多咗，你唔會自己都要為佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，蓮姐有點感慨地說，過往較少與梁國雄、古思堯合照，才發現「影相係咁重要」：「當長毛同阿古入咗去嘅時候，我睇返我哋好少合照，好似一張合照，因為以前成日見到，但世事無常。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;社民連義工坐頭班車-讚長毛很照顧他人&quot;&gt;社民連義工坐頭班車 讚長毛很照顧他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了多年戰友，亦有社民連義工特地來支持長毛。盧先生今早乘坐頭班車，排隊等候進入法院，前來支持長毛。他表示自2012年接觸長毛，留意到社民連的理念與自己接近，便一直為社民連助選：「左翼、幫弱勢，又係為公義發聲，所以開始幫佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到與長毛相處最深刻的一件事，盧先生稱「好平常㗎咋喎」：「有一次喺中聯辦門口，警察噴胡椒噴霧，有個義工嘅，後生嘅，長毛一手攬佢埋嚟，用件褸遮住個頭。個義工無事，佢自己兜口兜面食影晒。」他形容長毛其實溫柔，並很照顧他人，而且亦講道理：「唔係出邊話佢市井，其實佢好博學，睇好多書。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;行政會議召集人葉劉淑儀早前接受外媒訪問，稱香港民主20年來的實驗失敗，相信在《基本法》第23條立法後，反對派將長時間不會重臨，更點名「長毛」和「癲狗」黃毓民之流不會再回來立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病-盼保重撐住&quot;&gt;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病 盼保重撐住&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧先生笑言政治一日都嫌長：「佢無錯嘅，可以將來見到嘅形勢都係咁，唔知㗎呢啲。黎智英都可能會出返嚟，佢講得太早。我哋梗係希望，你應承我哋嘅雙普選，2008年就應該有，你應該兌現，做到真正港人治港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，盧先生表示知悉長毛在獄中有情緒病，而且頭部生瘡，「佢上庭成日𢲷個頭」：「保重、撐住，平安呀！嗯，入邊嘅人都係講呢啲。但我哋講啲咩說話對佢無作用，係要靠佢自己意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林亦被安排在今日起作求情，去年曾任柯耀林mentee的阿偲，指與柯交流時，感覺他不太開心，嘆很多朋友已不在港，而柯初罪成還柙後仍「有講有笑」、鼓勵她，不過近來情況變差，「多咗亂諗嘢」。阿偲指，到場旁聽望給予柯耀林支持：「畀佢覺得，無論咩時候都有人陪住佢、撐住佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（26日）處理第五批、新界西8名被告及經定罪的梁國雄、柯耀林求情。西九龍裁判法院外再現排隊人龍，獲裁定罪脱、曾參與超區初選的李予信，繼上月旁聽第四批被告求情後，今日凌晨再次排隊入席旁聽，他分享最近正在閱讀心理學、韌性培養的書籍，認為社會需要這樣的質素，學習如何正面處理逆境和創傷的感受，「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」；又指需要正視眼前情況和回應過往經歷，「咁樣我哋先至有更加強韌嘅心態繼續喺未來走落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清晨6時，西九龍裁判法院外已有逾40人排隊輪候旁聽，當中不乏攜折凳、戴口罩列隊的年長者。李予信凌晨5點半已帶備椅子、手提電腦到場，排在隊伍約第30位。與上次約凌晨1時到場相比，依舊戴棒球帽、身穿純白上衣的李予信今次較遲到達，他稱這次有了經驗，「知道排隊黨嘅時間大概係幾多」，便預計時間在排隊黨全部出現前到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與上次凌晨時分專注電腦中足球賽事轉播、偶爾傳出歡呼聲相比，這次李予信自到場後便戴上耳機，神色凝重、沉默不語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信分享最近的消遣讀物，指自己正在閱讀心理學相關、關於韌性培養的書籍，認為社會需要這樣的質素，學習如何正面處理逆境和創傷的感受，「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦形容旁聽原因就像看這些書一樣，「我覺得係一個好重要嘅經歷嚟，好需要去正視我哋眼前現實發生嘅情況，同時間都要好好去回應過往嘅經歷，咁樣我哋先至有更加強韌嘅心態繼續喺未來走落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早繼續作求情，被告之一伍健偉預料將親自求情。前元朗區議員林進今早繼續排隊，希望進入庭內旁聽。談到伍健偉的情況，林進對《獨媒》表示，對方還柙初時的狀態不太好，過去半年則「成功肥到」，心態上已有所調節，現已坦然面對困境：「佢話咪10年囉。我自己評估都係，要發生都發生咗，怨天尤人都改變唔到啲咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在去年10月，伍健偉選擇在案件開審前認罪，並表明會親自求情，他當時表示「希望我自己嘅人生由我自己掌握」。林進亦強調，伍健偉對於案件的裁決、刑期已有準備，沒有任何樂觀的猜想：「反而諗得差啲，個差啲都接受到嘅時候，就無乜嘢接受唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自三年前被捕還押後，伍健偉每次出庭應訊，林進都會到場旁聽，又會到獄中探望對方。林進表示，每次探監都沒有傾談太多日常生活，反而是伍健偉關心朋友的近況：「嗰15分鐘都係講朋友嘅多，內容都係好實在，無咩閒話家常。」不過，林進指伍健偉仍然很關心香港，很關心朋友：「佢仲好有意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林進提到，伍健偉即使面對漫長的審訊，意志仍然非常堅定，稍後寸情的時候出「有說話想對香港人講」：「咁漫長嘅審訊，正常人坐監，意志都好容易磨蝕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前「賢學思政」召集人王逸戰亦有到場，他指自己是新界西選民，初選時曾與張可森、伍健偉、黃子悅擺街站，因較欣賞他們理念、望令更多人認識，王今亦特意到庭支持三人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王逸戰苦笑，2020年與伍健偉擺街站，翌年伍因本案被捕還柙，至2022年自己也因煽動顛覆國家政權案入獄，在獄中與伍「玉帛相見」，至今天自己已出獄，伍「仍然喺入面」還柙候判。認識四年，王形容，伍是「比樂觀仲樂觀」、「真誠地樂觀」的人，每次見面也「笑笑口」，與四年前相比「冇乜改變」，「棱角、樂觀都仲喺度」。他又指，伍會很坦誠表達自己想法，覺得「既然行得呢一步，我有嘢想講就去講」，但王補充，伍不是魯莽，而是勇敢，會「三思而後行」，自己在外要做決定時，也會問伍的意見，認為可從他學習，伍會叫他小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張可森，王形容他幽默、有才華，笑言初次見面邀他拍攝搞笑片段，張也願意配合，比新聞上所見有血有肉、很真誠。張可森太太在他還柙期間誕下兒子，王嘆張無法如普通父親與孩子相處很可惜，亦不懂怎樣安慰，但覺得能到庭與張見面已是最好的表現。王亦很佩服黃子悅，指她「望落嬌滴滴」，但蘊藏的能量比他想像更大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問有什麼想跟三人說，王坦言「依一刻唔知可以講啲咩」，只想說：「仲喺度」。他說，今天到場主要望聽到被告的陳情，「我覺得我聽到已經心滿意足，我見到佢哋、出現喺呢個地方已經夠」。被告求情陳詞或有不同考量，王說作為過來人，明白他們的處境，會尊重他們說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除此之外，吳惠靈曾兩度參選區議會選舉，她指吳敏兒曾攜同子女為其助選，十分熱心。她認為吳敏兒基層出身，為人細心、包容，在職工盟同事出現分歧的時候，亦會耐心地解釋，及與同事商討：「佢做主席係好恰當，有堅強嘅一面，亦都有人對人包容，每個層面都好理解。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生則是工黨兼前職工盟成員，同已認識吳敏兒多年。他今早6時到西九龍法院排隊，希望可以入庭旁聽，為吳敏兒送上支持：「點解嚟？佢正直囉，如果佢唔正直，我今日都唔坐喺度啦，仲坐幾個鐘頭？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出張親撰的求情信，提及在獄中的30歲生日作深刻反省，認為審議預算案是立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具及藉此危害國安。張盼能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼：「當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」至於朱凱廸、梁國雄及黃子悅一方均採納書面陳詞，辯方指黃屬「積極參加者」，正就暴動案服刑，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則，部分刑期分期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的10名被告，包括參選新西的朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、伍健偉；及參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄和柯耀林。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，男女被告分成上下兩排，由6名懲教看管。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的柯耀林，戴眼鏡、穿淺綠色中袖裇衫，口袋服筆；去年主動撤銷保釋、正就理大暴動案服刑的黃子悅，去年剪的短髮已留長並紮成馬尾，她戴黑框眼鏡、穿黃綠色上衣，不時望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘被告均還柙近3年半，吳敏兒戴眼鏡、紮馬尾，穿粉紅色上衣和黑色外套，微笑向旁聽席點頭。一頭灰白頭髮、穿黑色西裝和打呔的郭家麒，精神不俗，頻向旁聽和律師席揮手和飛吻。尹兆堅穿黑色棒球外套，面形比還柙前略瘦，手指向旁聽席點頭、揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森穿灰色間條裇衫、黑色外套，向旁聽席點頭，身型和面型較還柙前胖。梁國雄身穿黑色哲古華拉上衣，一頭灰白短髮，不時低頭摸頭髮。朱凱廸穿藍色裇衫、黑色外套，譚凱邦穿間條白裇衫，沒有律師代表的伍健偉則穿灰色西裝外套、白色上衣，向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪脫的李予信、前荃灣區議員陳劍琴、前「天水連線」成員林進、「女長毛」雷玉蓮、前立法會議員劉慧卿、社民連陳寶瑩及黃浩銘等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄朱凱廸採納書面陳詞&quot;&gt;梁國雄、朱凱廸採納書面陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙指採納書面陳詞，亦相信法庭對梁的背景頗為熟悉，沒有補充。代表朱凱廸的大律師宗銘誠同樣採納書面陳詞。法官陳仲衡關注朱的案底，辯方指他涉2020六四「明知而參與未經批准集結」傳票案，至於2020七一涉煽惑、組織及明知而參與未經批准集結罪，則於2020年12月才被捕，故朱凱廸並非在法庭保釋期間干犯本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張可森屬積極參加者還柙期間父離世&quot;&gt;辯方：張可森屬「積極參加者」、還柙期間父離世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張可森的大律師伍頴珊認為，《國安法》22條下的刑期分級制並不適用於串謀罪，但法庭可作參考，並認為張屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，張還柙期間父親離世，張的兒子亦出生，現時接近3歲。伍指，張小時候父親經常不在，他難以見到父親，現在張自己也成為人父，他對未能與妻子和兒子相處感到悲痛（devastated），很希望能陪伴兒子，對於父親離世亦感到加倍後悔和悲傷。法官陳仲衡指，張父不幸離世在判刑考慮的比重不多，法庭較關注張的悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&quot;&gt;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續讀出張撰寫的求情信，提及：「在獄中的30歲生日，讓我得以冷靜思過，整理過去，理清思緒，如今的我明白到案中計劃一旦實行到底所衍生的嚴重性，並就此深刻反省。審議財政預算案，是基本法賦與立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具，亦不應藉此危害國家安全。我也明白到當下的情況及懲處，是我必須學會承擔的後果，未來我希望能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼，尤其是我妻。當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍又指，張於2024年7月8日已取得博士候選人的資格，將會在還柙期間認真完成畢業論文，取得博士學位。據悉張正修讀香港中文大學文化研究博士學位。張伍又呈上多封求情信，張的大學老師對他有很高評價，其妻子、家人亦望法庭能輕判。伍指張沒有案底，重犯機會為零，望法庭能考慮其良好品格和悔意，減刑三分一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黃子悅屬積極參加-望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指黃子悅屬「積極參加」 望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃子悅的大律師潘志明亦採納書面陳詞，指黃是本案最年輕的被告，屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。潘續指，雖然黃在理大暴動案保釋期間犯案、兩案性質不同，但兩案均在2019至2020年期間發生，望法庭考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」，部分刑期分期執行。潘又指，黃並非刻意干犯本案，她案發時曾稱否決是《基本法》下的合法權利，「35+」計劃亦由法律專業人士提倡，黃當時真誠誤信為合法，望法庭不要因此加刑太多。庭上並透露，黃就暴動案最快於2025年3月服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今早處理新界西、新界東的8名候選人被告的求情。參選新界東、前立法會議員「長毛」梁國雄在陳情書中重申「權力歸於人民」，指這不但是其終生信守的理念，亦是從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。長毛表示，今天雖然成為階下囚，但絕無怨言，重申「堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權」，並希望港人莫失莫忘、爭取民主及守護公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案原定今日起處理第五批，即參選新界西的8名被告求情。司法機構網頁昨日顯示，將一併處理參選新界東梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。梁國雄向法庭呈交陳情書，表示自70年代起參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是源於改變社會不公的願望，而爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，亦從沒放棄。他表示一路走來近50年，從黑髮變成白頭，長毛成為短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，均秉持該理念行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;議會內外均進行抗爭-憾未能爭取全民退休保障&quot;&gt;議會內外均進行抗爭 憾未能爭取「全民退休保障」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自2004年起，梁國雄曾連續四屆當選立法會議員，他表示無論是一介草民仰或議員，都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外進行各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛憶述在任立法會議員期間，已多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，以抗議當局重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾。他亦不忘重提爭取多年的「全民退休保障」，指政府在財政充裕、社會日漸高齡化時，卻拒絕在預算案中撥款設立，對未能推動當局改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書中，長毛稱參與初選是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策；而「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是其多年身體力行的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&quot;&gt;長毛：最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛重申無論是「35+」或「35-」，即議會過半與否，「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，認為最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書尾聲，長毛表示已知悉法庭判其有罪的理由，但再次重申立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革-多名社民連成員旁聽支持&quot;&gt;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革 多名社民連成員旁聽支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛認為，議員兩次行使否決權不但是民意依歸，更只是彰顯200萬遊行市民的民意，順從60萬初選投票者的民願。他認為，行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，而既然否決《財政預算案》具全體人民授意，便反問行政長官：「為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？」他最後強調，權力歸於人民是其終生信守的理念、從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，社民連主席兼長毛妻子陳寶瑩，成員黃浩銘、曾健成及陳皓桓等，今早亦有到庭旁聽支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳情書全文&quot;&gt;陳情書全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　從我在70年代開始參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是一種出於改變社會不公的願望，爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，從沒放棄。一路走來近50年，黑髮變白頭，長毛成短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，我都是秉持這個理念行事。無論是一介草民還是立法會議員，我都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我就任立法會議員時，已經多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，抗議政府重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾，尤其在財政充裕，社會日漸高齡化時，拒絕在《預算案》中撥款設立「全民退休保障制度」。我未能推動政府改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我參與35+初選計劃，就是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策。「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是多年身體力行的目標；正如我所屬的組織社會民主連線在2020年6月的《決議文》所言：「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，無論是「35+」還是「35-」，最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我現在知悉法庭判我有罪的理由，我當初認為立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，缺一不可！既然否決《預算案》有全體人民授意，行政長官為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？若行政長官執迷不悟，仍然需要多一次人民授權，才會面對下台困局。因此，議員兩次行使否決權是民意依歸，只是彰顯200萬遊行市民民意，順從60萬初選投票者民願。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　「權力歸於人民」是我終生信守的理念，從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾！今天我雖然成為階下囚，但我毋怨。我堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權，惟願港人莫失莫忘，爭取民主，守護公義！&lt;/p&gt;

二零二四年七月十五日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ckiuhvB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。其中前元朗區議員伍健偉沒有法律代表，親自陳情。他指暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音，高壓統治和嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效，他參與初選非為私利，而是不希望有人受傷、被捕，甚至犧牲生命。伍又指，初選手段「和平理性非暴力」，「五大訴求」亦合情合理、無被法庭裁定違法，政府是「不為」而非「不能」，惟法官打斷指並非表達政見場合。伍續指，他無打算離開香港，亦願為個人過去一切言行負責，但他不會為與選民所共享的信念和價值道歉，不可辜負人民信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍健偉是否沒有悔意？伍答「無錯」，指作為政治人物，期許自己要有承擔、竭盡所能，留守到最後一刻，「所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落」。伍指未來打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望貢獻香港社會，認為港人只要抱持自救互助精神，活在真實的當下，理想定會實現，「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」法官陳慶偉最後指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，減刑折扣明顯會較他人少，伍表示完全明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍健偉自行陳詞-感激律師社會及愛我嘅人&quot;&gt;伍健偉自行陳詞 感激律師、社會及「愛我嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沒有律師代表的伍健偉自行陳詞，他身穿灰色西裝外套、白色襯衫，捧着文件走到被告欄前方，以咪高峰發言。伍先表示，已向法庭提交兩份手寫陳詞，並指：「喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持。最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人，對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，我祝福各位平安、健康。」說罷轉身向着旁聽席鞠躬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍初選陽光下進行逾61萬人投票-被告非為私利犯案&quot;&gt;伍：初選陽光下進行、逾61萬人投票 被告非為私利犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉先就法律原則陳詞，他認為自己於本案屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但就控方對刑期10年以上的「首要分子或罪行重大」的詮釋，望提出數點讓法庭考慮。伍先指，「35+計劃」是在陽光底下進行、眾所周知的計劃，當中的手段和目的均清晰、明確和為人熟知。伍指，要達致進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案，「單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成」，他們要成為立法會議員，「係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，2020年7月《國安法》實施後，有超過61萬香港市民參與初選投票，他指毫無疑問，當時「唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況」，故61萬市民「係冒住犯上法律嘅風險」進行投票。伍續指，作為民意代表，除了有責任遵守法律義務，「我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」，望法官考慮各被告犯下本案的原因，「並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;同意可引致憲政危機但非憲政災難&quot;&gt;同意可引致憲政危機、但非憲政災難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍表示，他同意本案所造成的後果可引致「憲政危機」，但不同意是「憲政災難」，因《基本法》第50至52條已預計相關情況出現，法律授權政府如何處理。雖然無可避免嚴重干預政府施政效率，但他認為各被告充其量只是干犯《國安法》第22條第3項，即嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱五大訴求合情合理政府不為非不能-官打斷促勿發政見&quot;&gt;伍稱五大訴求合情合理、政府「不為非不能」 官打斷促勿發政見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說，五大訴求「係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求」，「五大訴求對於特區政府係不為也，而非不能為也」，因至少撤回逃犯條訂條例一項早於2020年7月前已滿足。伍望法庭考慮，「我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官陳慶偉打斷，指今天是求情聆訊，「並不是讓你表達政見的場合」，他又指，從伍提交的信可理解其立場，「如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&quot;&gt;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍微笑說「明白法官你嘅立場嘅」，續就性質是否「罪行重大」陳詞。法官陳仲衡指伍自視為「積極參加者」，無需就此陳詞，伍回應「雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫」，但如法庭不同意，仍望作回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，案發時的背景，是街頭激烈衝突已持續非常長時間，「我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命，所以我選擇參與35+初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍何時意識到計劃是違法？伍指是「2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候」。李運騰追問，伍曾稱當時作為代議士只能繼續，是否代表案發時已知道計劃可能違法？伍同意，補充初選投票後，政府官員、中聯辦及港澳辦發聲明指初選可能違法。李運騰指，政府是於初選前已發聲明，又指時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞僅稱「可能」違法，因為是由法庭而非他裁定是否違法，曾最多只能說「可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍回應，作為市民，有理由相信政府不會任由罪案發生，「如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。」李運騰指，警方執法程序非法庭考慮，法庭只關注案發時伍是否得知協議違法。伍再回應，當時對否決預算案「我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法」，法官陳仲衡指控罪非僅否決、而是無差別否決，伍指明白，但「不過都一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&quot;&gt;伍：暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音、嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍於小休後，續就個人背景陳詞。他以右手拿着手寫的求情信，表示現年28歲，正修讀都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，「係一個恨嫁嘅男人」，有被告和旁聽人士發笑。伍指，他被捕前沒有案底，2020年當選為元朗區議員，並於本案承認控罪：「法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人過去一切嘅言行而負責」，而他欲交代犯案原因，望法官給予一定耐性及包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，他於1995年出生，自1997年以來，香港涉社運被檢控的罪名及刑罰「拾級而上、越發嚴苛」，但及後社運的參與人數、時間、規模及激烈程度仍逐步擴大。伍認為，「每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音」，如香港人民訴求持續被漠視，矛盾和衝突必然接腫而來，「高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效」，深層次矛盾必須尋求解決之道，社會才可能復和邁進、穩定繁榮，「否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕對離世生命沉重悲痛&quot;&gt;伍：參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕、對離世生命沉重悲痛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，參與初選有遠因和近因，遠因是源於其個人信念，「相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者」，「作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，參選近因是2019年，當時他恐懼自由被侵蝕，對政府傲慢感不滿，而最令他動容的原因，是他「對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛」。伍指，他完全不希望有人受傷、被捕，更難以忍受有人犧牲生命，自己卻無動於衷、毫不作為。作為普通市民，他無能力起死回生，亦無法阻止他們付出自由和生命的代價，「但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」，他認為參與社會運動、地區服務、投身政治，是可為社會貢獻的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍代議士責任爭取選民訴求願承擔風險尋求破局機會&quot;&gt;伍：代議士責任爭取選民訴求、願承擔風險尋求破局機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉指，他在2019年憑4,371名選民信任成為元朗區議員，初選亦憑20,525位港人支持勝出，如2020年立法會選舉順利舉辦，當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。伍續指，成為一個代議士、一個香港民意的代表，「我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利同埋自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現，即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問是什麼風險，伍指正如信中下一段所說，在被捕前，「我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄」，但不等於他認為成為代議士不會犯《國安法》——即使他無成為立法會議員，但在《國安法》下繼續參與政治或社運，也有很大風險犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍指無一刻打算離港-確認沒有悔意&quot;&gt;伍指無一刻打算離港 確認沒有悔意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍繼續陳詞，表示被捕前，「我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」法官李運騰問，是否可理解伍健偉是對所作的事沒有悔意？伍沉默片刻，凝重說：「正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指那並非他的問題，再問伍對所作的事是否沒有悔意？伍直視法官說：「無錯。」伍續說：「作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分-但仍望貢獻香港社會&quot;&gt;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分 但仍望貢獻香港社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說展望將來，他作為民意代表的任期已完結，「我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望，盡力留喺香港貢獻社會」，即使已預視到困難重重。法官李運騰打斷，指伍的說法可有不同解讀，他關注伍的重犯風險，望伍澄清「貢獻」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指將會講到，並先指一如時任終審法官包致金所言，「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reasons to stay.」，「我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神，理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑嘅心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗-信民主終再得勝&quot;&gt;伍：絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗 信民主終再得勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍最後指，二十世紀完結，人們向蘇聯和納粹作告別，「失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗，長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱因無悔意-認罪扣減會較他人少&quot;&gt;官稱因無悔意 認罪扣減會較他人少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就伍健偉認罪的日期，羅天瑋助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋指，2022年10月伍健偉的律師代表去信表示擬認罪，伍於11月3日案件管理聆訊上再次確認，至2023年2月6日案件開審首天，伍於庭上認罪，並於同年10月5日聽取承認案情，確認伍是於案件交付高院後認罪、審訊訂定之前改認罪。法官李運騰指根據案例，最多只可獲25%減刑，法官陳慶偉並指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，其認罪扣減會明顯比其他人為少（significantly less than other），問他有沒有話想說。伍回應：「冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。尹兆堅一方指他投身公共服務近20年，曾成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠和長者生活津貼等，出獄後打算於國際人權組織「世界中央廚房」任職，亦獲3名前高官蕭偉強、羅致光及張炳良撰求情信，指他和平理性。惟法官關注尹過往有4次定罪紀錄，就其良好品格的求情理由能否「循環再用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方亦指郭和平理性，獲前高官邱誠武及前議員石禮謙和張超雄撰求情信，張提到郭曾阻止示威者七一衝擊立法會大樓。辯方又指，郭在公民黨解散前已退黨，出獄後望繼續行醫，退出政治，沒有重犯機會，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符，採納「積極參加者」的較低量刑起點。法官質疑，本案串謀持續多月，郭必然對參選作詳細考慮，不認同他犯案是與性格不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年-官關注求情理由能否循環再用&quot;&gt;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年 官關注求情理由能否「循環再用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員尹兆堅由大律師莫彥婷代表，莫指尹投身公共服務近20年，他於1994年成為註冊社工，自2004年起四度當選區議員，並於2016年當選立法會議員，服務不同公職。其中尹自2002年起設立殘疾人士爭取交通半費優惠聯席，10年後成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠，亦成功爭取長者生活津貼和拆除臨時房屋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，得悉尹的貢獻，但他曾有4次定罪紀錄，該些案件均已考慮其良好品格；法官李運騰亦關注，若其他案件已因尹的公共服務和良好品格而減刑，法庭是否能將相關理由「循環再用」。莫指，相關案件並未考慮尹的公共服務往績，明日會向法庭補充詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;尹獲3前高官撰求情信-讚和平理性&quot;&gt;尹獲3前高官撰求情信 讚和平理性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;尹兆堅亦獲兩名前勞工及福利局局長蕭偉強、羅致光，以及前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良撰求情信，蕭指尹熱心幫助弱勢，保障貧窮和殘疾人士等權益，雖然未必在所有議題上有共識，但對其可信及有禮印象深刻，相信他會兌現承諾。前黨友羅致光亦指，尹推動社會政策表現和平理性，二人就勞工福利政策有良好有效的交流。辯方指，求情信可顯示尹除公共服務外，為人和平，為政府提供建設性意見，望法庭作進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，尹是出色的廚師，打算在出獄後，將烹飪技術應用在國際人權組織「世界廚房（World Kitchen）」。就案情而言，辯方指尹沒有簽署「墨落無悔」，沒有出席任何選舉論壇，作為民主動員委員，亦不曾參與任何會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷-官質疑無提就本案反思&quot;&gt;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷 官質疑無提就本案反思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員郭家麒由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，蔡求情指，郭於2021年9月已表示擬認罪，是最早一批表示認罪的被告，亦不爭議案情，顯示他具悔意。蔡又指，郭是有原則、願意奉獻、具同理心的人，「我做求情近25年，我可以說他是一個具良好品格的人而不面紅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續讀出郭親撰的求情信，提到他出身草根家庭，八十年代成為醫生，任學生期間目睹多人因工業意外受傷，因而籌辦活動保障工人健康，並成立香港工人健康中心。辯方指，即使郭任職醫生，仍奉獻空餘時間促進弱勢的福祉，他自1994年至2007年任中西區區議員，2004年當選立法會議員，並獲委任為醫管局成員，沙士期間作出貢獻，並與不同官員合作，改善醫療服務。辯方又引郭指，他從無考慮「攬炒」，亦不支持「香港獨立」，任議員多年，目標是確保最邊緣社群獲得足夠資源和照顧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，郭的長篇求情信提及其行醫和公共服務經歷，但沒有提及對本案行為的反思。蔡維邦指，對任何還柙超過3年的人來說，當然私下有反省，而郭在最早階段認罪亦反映他具備高度悔意，只是沒有在信中直接表達，不認為法庭應將折扣減少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kaJ076a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前立法會議員石禮謙&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獲邱誠武石禮謙張超雄撰求情信-稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&quot;&gt;獲邱誠武、石禮謙、張超雄撰求情信 稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡維邦又呈上多封求情信，包括兩名曾受助於郭的市民，有女士提到兒子患罕見面顎變形，需進行手術，等候十年卻被醫院取消，無助之際獲郭幫助和申請資助，成功進行手術；有女士亦指，曾因醫療事故失去初生女兒，郭積極跟進院方調查，堅定尋求公義，形容郭具同情心、毅力和尋求問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭亦獲前運輸及房屋局副局長邱誠武、前立法會議員石禮謙及張超雄撰求情信，邱指二人常就房屋及交通等政策討論，郭一向是弱勢權益的捍衛者，雖與政府意見並非經常一致，但尊重他向政府問責，且二人在改善房屋、工業安全等議題上意見也一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，2019年時，郭曾站出來着群眾冷靜，以避免進一步暴力發生，例如曾協助救護車進入警總，以幫助有醫療需要的人。張超雄亦指郭主張和平，在2019至2020年是調停者，例如七一立法會曾站在玻璃門前阻止示威者衝擊大樓，亦因而受傷；8月機場內時任環球時報記者付國豪被示威者綑綁和襲女十水手時，郭和張亦趕到現場阻止，被示威者數度推開。郭於11月理大被圍時，亦曾與一群校長進入學校，嘗試令年輕示威者冷靜，獲該些校長撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指郭已退黨無重犯機會-屬積極參加者較低程度&quot;&gt;辯方指郭已退黨、無重犯機會 屬「積極參加者」較低程度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，郭為人和平理性，他於公民黨解散前已退黨，並決定退出政治，沒有重犯機會，服刑完畢後如獲醫務委員會允許，預期會繼續行醫，繼續幫助有需要病人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又認為，郭屬「積極參加者」，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符（out of character），具良好品格和公共服務，以刑期3至10年的較低程度為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，郭必然對初選和如何當選作出詳細考慮，不認同郭犯案是與性格不符。辯方重申，郭的行為與他過往多年作為理性政治人物的行徑不同，又指就郭於2020年3月公民黨記者會的言論，當時其行為不可能是違法，不應因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦質疑，與性格不符通常是一時衝動、受刺激而犯案，但本案串謀持續多月，被告有多次機會反思其行為，難以被說服此情況下，被告的參與是與性格不符，而且涉案串謀對香港穩定和安全性有很大影響。蔡同意，但重申郭行為與過往紀錄不符，望法庭考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方求情完畢，案件明早續，將處理餘下兩名新西被告吳敏兒、譚凱邦，以及參選新東的柯耀林求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方為郭家麒申請明日不到庭獲批，散庭時，張可森舉手，並走近被告欄咪高峰，表示想申請明天毋須出席聆訊，梁國雄亦說：「我都係，我都係申請唔嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻，又單手放頭上做心形手勢，並頻頻向旁聽席和律師致意和鞠躬。黃子悅亦向丈夫飛吻。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團：不能撇開2019年反修例運動背景&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XDcpJaL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（26日）踏入第80日審訊，法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。張官指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。而陪審團需要小心考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。張官預計明天可讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無直接證供證明被告達成協議主要依賴環境證供&quot;&gt;官：無直接證供證明被告達成協議、主要依賴環境證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。她指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。在處理環境證供時，陪審團需要先考慮控方能否證明控罪的元素，之後再考慮各被告的情況。張官將上述兩項比喻為兩條線，陪審團需要考慮將他們加在一起後，能否成為一條有足夠力量的繩去支撐。張官同時提醒，需要小心謹慎考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引辯方指-單憑tg訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&quot;&gt;官引辯方指 單憑TG訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述辯方立場指，沒有直接證供顯示各被告與串謀有關，實際上「屠龍」隊員並不知道行動內容及詳情，單憑 Telegram 訊息並不能證明他們為串謀一份子。張官亦指，陪審團需要小心衡量，污點證人黃振強是否如辯方所指，有動機虛構證供並冤枉其他被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方依賴的「共同串謀者原則」，張官指部分證據為 Telegram 的群組及私訊的訊息，雖然被告並不在場，但陪審團要考慮被告的發言，是否為了令計劃可以付諸實行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&quot;&gt;官：需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而需要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開而憑空思考。她解釋指當時有很多人因反修例運動上街，這屬事實，而污點證人黃振強亦提及自己有參與示威。因此，張官認為不能用現時的社會情況去考慮，因必定與當時的環境有差別，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指陪審團需要考慮控方所指向警方投擲汽油彈的行為，是否符合法例中的「恐怖主義行為」定義。控方主要依賴劉知悉「屠龍」的示威精華片段，並知道籌款是用作購買「火魔法」，即汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件明（27日）續審，預計明天將會讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官指涉案炸彈可致400米範圍內嚴重傷亡　伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周五（23日）在高等法院踏入第79天審訊，法官張慧玲第6天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官總結本案多名專家的供詞，當中針對警方於香港華仁書院附近搜獲的一大一細土製炸彈，專家指內含鐵釘增加威力，若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。至於在「屠龍」貨倉中被檢取的伸縮棍，法官重申伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾在示威中使用，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&quot;&gt;官：專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四總結指，案中唯一作供被告李家田，供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周五續引述本案各專家證人的證供，當中涉案於香港華仁書院附近被搜獲的一大一細炸彈，分別有8及2公斤炸藥，由改裝手提電話遙距控制引爆。經專家檢驗後發現，炸彈內有鐵釘以增加威力，而引爆威力達半徑400米。若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。而炸彈中亦被發現有具爆炸性化學物品「HMTD」及炸藥「ANFO」等。專家指「ANFO」屬高性能爆炸品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&quot;&gt;官：伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「屠龍」於荃灣貨倉被檢取的11支伸縮棍，政府化驗所化驗師吳嘉豪曾檢驗。法官提醒陪審團，伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾於示威活動中使用，進行暴動或非法集結，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案涉及大量 Telegram 訊息，而警方又以程式 Cellebrite 擷取涉案手提電話的資料。法官亦分別引述 Telegram 及 Cellebrite 專家的證供，提到 Cellebrite 可復原部分被刪除的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官另引述財務專家的意見，此專家曾分析涉案戶口交易紀錄及金額等，包括黃振強及劉佩凝的戶口。專家報告沒有總結指有眾籌情況出現，但指戶口的匯款模式類似眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由法官張慧玲及3男6女陪審團審理。7名被告依次為張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦、許湛榮及劉佩凝，起訴時年齡介乎20至29歲不等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few years have seen a transformational change in Japan’s approach to space security, with space capabilities now featured prominently in Tokyo’s national security and defense strategies. While Japan has long been considered one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations, its accomplishments have occurred largely in civil space exploration and science, with Japanese government policy ascribing nonmilitary purposes for space activities. However, intensifying threats in the region have led to a new emphasis on leveraging the space domain for national defense and the need for deeper partnerships at the policy, operational, and industrial levels to deliver space capabilities on timelines paced to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan’s 2008 Basic Space Law created the legal basis for the country to pursue national security space activities, its 2022 security documents provided the impetus for “radically expand[ing] the use of space systems for national security.” Sitting in the middle of a complex Indo-Pacific security environment, Japan’s regional security concerns are dominated by intensifying Chinese and North Korean military activities, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine presages what aggression in the region could look like. Tokyo has set 2027 as a key milestone for strengthening its national defense, with space capabilities as one part of a broader strategic effort that includes force modernization, munitions acquisitions, infrastructure improvements, and enhanced training and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and Defense Buildup Program, together with its 2023 Space Security Initiative (SSI), designate key priorities for future space acquisitions, operational activities, and partnerships necessary to advance its national and economic security interests. The SSI outlines the country’s national security space architecture plans. This ambitious vision includes satellites that can detect and track missiles, including hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs); intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking (ISRT) satellites to provide insights on land and maritime threats and targeting information for counterstrike systems; space-based communications satellites; positioning and navigation satellites; and space domain awareness systems, all supported with a suite of government and commercial space launch vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding to expand Japan’s space capabilities and grow its industrial base is following the plans. Tokyo has more than doubled its investments across civil and national security space over the last five years, including in defense-specific and dual-use space technologies, and plans further increases. Over the next 10 years, the Japanese government has committed ¥1 trillion ($6.9 billion) toward a Space Strategy Fund aimed at expanding Japan’s space industrial base that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will administer. Also, over the next five years, an additional ¥1 trillion is anticipated to be allocated for space security. Like the United States and other countries, Japan recognizes the economic and technological benefits of space and how government investments create a demand signal to spur private sector innovation and attract technical talent. It also sees advances in the space domain as helping to solve global sustainability, resource management, and disaster relief challenges here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational reform is also following the plans. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will be renamed the Japan Air and Space Self Defense Force in 2027 to “reinforce its space operation capability and . . . [develop] a system to ensure superiority in use of space.” Within the JASDF, the Japan Space Operations Group (JSOG) was created in 2020 as the first space-focused unit that will continue to grow as it takes on more operational space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s approach to security remains strongly tethered to the policies and actions of the United States, with deepening bilateral ties “at a concrete level” being “of vital importance.” Cooperation and collaboration, particularly with the United States, is an integral part of Japanese strategy in the space domain. Likewise, expanding cooperation with allies and partners has been a pillar of U.S. national space policy across successive administrations. In May 2024, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, Dr. John F. Plumb, characterized such partnership as “an asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match” that advances collective security, underpins military strength, and contributes to the safety and sustainability of the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space has become more prominent in high-level discussions between the two nations, including at the president and prime minister level, cabinet and ministry level, and senior military leader level. U.S. and Japanese space leaders convene regularly through a comprehensive space dialogue, the two countries exchange military liaison officers, and business leaders from both countries now participate in dialogues to discuss U.S.-Japan space industry collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-observations&quot;&gt;Key Observations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few broad observations stood out to the authors throughout the course of their research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of interests:&lt;/strong&gt; With a shared understanding of the threat environment, alignment of strategic interests, strong leadership and political support, and commitment of personnel and resources, there is now a window to advance a comprehensive and enduring agenda for bilateral cooperation on space security. While the authors focused heavily on security cooperation, cooperation across other instruments of national power, such as economic and diplomatic activities, were also recognized as essential to advancing both countries’ national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National security space proficiency and capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations through its civil space programs; however, past government policy mandating that the government of Japan utilize space only for nonmilitary purposes led to its defense institutions and related industrial base having less exposure to, and experience with, space missions. Further, it resulted in a limited market for Japan’s space industry to serve. While the current emphasis on space security creates greater opportunities for U.S.-Japan space cooperation, it also — understandably so — highlights areas where Japan’s defense institutions and industry need to build greater space proficiency, operational experience, and industrial capacity, especially in building and operating large satellite constellations for security missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground architectures and satellite constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the authors’ discussions with government and industry representatives centered on ideas for partnering to build satellites, which are discussed herein. However, it must be emphasized that partnerships beyond just satellite constellations are important in space security mission areas. For example, the missile detection and tracking mission must operate on militarily relevant timelines, which demands equal attention to the ground architecture, data processing and analysis, and connectivity to missile defense systems. There is just as much opportunity to forge partnerships around ground architecture activities as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Both nations emphasize the importance of industrial partnerships for delivering military space capabilities within relevant timeframes. However, there will be a natural tension as each country seeks to expand its industrial base and market access and decide on what each is willing to rely on the other for. Each nation’s industrial base retains unique and complementary strengths. For example, while U.S. industry is strong in systems integration, ground architectures, and large-scale satellite manufacturing capacity, Japanese industry is a global leader in satellite components, robotics, and advanced manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timelines, resources, and risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The pacing threats facing both nations drive aggressive timelines for fielding new capabilities. There may be near-term approaches that rely more heavily on U.S. industry or commercial service providers but offer longer-term pathways to increase Japan’s own industrial capacity. Such a longer-term framing that articulates the overall security and economic benefits each country accrues will be important to both countries’ stakeholders. Moreover, with the yen weakening, Japan’s spending power will not go as far as anticipated despite significantly increasing investment in space security capabilities and personnel. On the U.S. side, defense budgets are likely to be flat or declining. Partnerships not only provide the benefit of increased capacity and resiliency for both countries, but also ways to burden share across resources and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and digital resiliency:&lt;/strong&gt; There is now clear recognition across Japanese government, industry, and academia that security — cybersecurity, information security, personnel security, and facility security — is paramount to further U.S.-Japan space cooperation. Further, Tokyo is attuned to the importance of continuity of operations, particularly having observed Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian satellite and ground networks and the effects of natural disasters on critical infrastructure such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was damaged by a 2011 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Japan-U.S. Alliance, including the provision of extended deterrence, will remain the cornerstone of Japan’s national security policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-national-security-strategy-of-japan-2022&quot;&gt;– National Security Strategy of Japan, 2022&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advances several recommendations for deepening U.S.-Japan cooperation and collaboration in space security. The authors stress that collaboration should not be pursued merely for its own sake — there must be intent behind these actions to ensure the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations. Summarized here and discussed in greater depth later in the report, these are areas where the combined, complementary strengths of both nations’ governments and industries can be brought together to deliver concrete capabilities to advance both U.S. and Japanese national and collective security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating human development:&lt;/strong&gt; While Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations through its civil space program, its past limitation that space be used only for nonmilitary purposes resulted in its defense ecosystem having less experience in the use and development of space capabilities. Thus, building greater space proficiency within Japan’s defense institutions and supporting industry through education and training will be foundational to any space cooperation activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercising and training the space force and joint force:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should be encouraged, with support from the United States, to develop a greater understanding across its military services of how space capabilities contribute to security and defense missions by integrating space capabilities into joint exercises and training. Within the military space community, participation in tabletop exercises and wargames, as well as greater hands-on operational training, aid in understanding space threats, operations, and decisionmaking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing data and information:&lt;/strong&gt; Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start. Further, space domain awareness (SDA) data sharing can be enhanced and expanded trilaterally, building on the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral information exchange model used for data sharing on North Korean missile launches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasizing complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; In formulating partnerships, the United States and Japan should consider the unique and complementary strengths of each nation’s industrial base and not limit their partnerships to the space domain. Both nations should look to each other as they seek to increase supply chain resiliency and seek investors to boost their space start-up ecosystems to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecting national security space constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries have set out national security space architectures that are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors, with partnerships being a core tenet of their respective approaches. The areas of missile detection and tracking, ISRT, SDA, and satellite communications (SATCOM) stand out because of the urgency described in Japan’s strategy documents to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027. In several of these areas, accessing commercial space-based data and services can accelerate the delivery of near-term capabilities and complement government owned and operated architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in digital transformation and cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should include a digital transformation and cybersecurity component within the bilateral space agenda. A digital infrastructure that encompasses data architecture, cloud computing, and cybersecurity can be a catalyst for greater interoperability and information sharing at an operational level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading on policy and in international forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, both Japan and the United States can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, the development of responsible behaviors in space, and the reduction of threats to the peaceful uses of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these recommendations can deliver material capabilities and policy successes, they will still require that policymakers address existing barriers. Chief among these obstacles is the need for leaders from both countries to set clear priorities and direction to move their respective institutions and industries into action. Both countries are undertaking ambitious space architecture plans. Delivering on those plans will be challenged over the long term by resource availability, industrial capacity, and labor availability in highly technical fields — all the more reason to forge industry relationships that leverage each nation’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further barriers include developing a data sharing policy within the United States that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with its Japanese counterpart, as well as Tokyo implementing security improvements, including legislation on security clearances extending from the military to industry, which it has made progress on. U.S. security experts across government and the private sector could be brought to Japan to share best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) hampers bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies which have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues. Notably, in late 2023, Tokyo revised its principles on the transfer of defense equipment and technology, which is expected to enable greater export of domestically produced military technologies and components. While a positive development that can further contribute to supply chain diversification and the defense of like-minded partners that are increasingly under threat, the impact of this policy shift for space-related technology exports is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together both countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these interagency and bilateral interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this study incorporates months of research, detailed briefings, and extensive discussions with government officials, industry representatives, and academic experts in both Japan and the United States, the authors acknowledge that it is not a comprehensive road map to all the opportunities and challenges in space security cooperation. However, as much as possible, the authors sought to identify concrete actions, including near-term options, that policymakers could take that, over time, would lead to material improvements in capabilities, more fielded systems, and a more highly trained and proficient workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Japan sits in the middle of a complex Indo-Pacific security environment. Intensifying Chinese and North Korean military activities dominate regional security concerns, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provided a sobering wake-up call for what aggression in the region could look like. These concerns are reflected in three strategic security documents that Tokyo released in 2022: the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and Defense Buildup Program. These documents emphasize a need for independent security and economic growth at an accelerated pace to protect against growing threats, the risk of invasion from a neighboring nation, and instability around the world. Integrated into each of these three documents is the use of space (or uchū in Japanese) for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, the Allied powers imposed restrictions on Japan’s heavy industry and defense capabilities, including restrictions on aerospace development. This continued until the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, which ended the legal state of war and reestablished peaceful relations between the Allied powers and Japan through the United Nations. The treaty removed several restrictions, including those preventing Japan from entering the space age. Among the restrictions that were lifted, the treaty allowed for Japanese entry into the space age. In 1955, Professor Itokawa Hideo, known as the father of Japanese rocketry, launched a miniature nine-inch rocket, known as the Pencil Rocket, with a team from the Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo, and thus began Japan’s ambitions in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the decades that followed, Japan’s national policy allowed space development only for peaceful purposes (which Japan defined until 2008 as excluding military space purposes), leading to Tokyo’s decades-long focus on research and scientific development in space, led by its civilian space organization, JAXA, and JAXA’s predecessor organizations. However, a fraught security environment in the Indo-Pacific region has prompted Tokyo to reevaluate its security and economic goals. As the country reckons with an increasingly tense security dynamic driven by growing Chinese and North Korean military activity and defense budgets, space capabilities are becoming integral to Japan’s national security. Further, the U.S.-Japan security alliance continues to be at the core of both countries’ approaches to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, with both seeking to deepen their cooperation across myriad national security areas, including in the space domain. Space is now a prominent agenda item in meetings between the U.S. president and Japanese prime minister, as well as several of their cabinet secretaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes an Aerospace Security Project research effort to examine the evolution of Japanese strategy and policy for space security and identify potential areas for space security cooperation between Japan and the United States, including opportunities for industry engagement. The authors reviewed publicly available information; conducted interviews and discussions with a wide range of Japanese and U.S. officials, both in the United States and Japan; and hosted a series of workshops at CSIS with current and former Japanese and U.S. government officials, industry representatives, and academics. Valuable insights were gained regarding the trends, capabilities, priorities, strengths, and challenges within each country’s space ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report outlines the history of space programs in Japan and the country’s space capabilities, developments in space security after the 2008 Basic Space Law, international partnerships, regional space security observations, and alignment with the United States. It continues with a discussion of candidate areas to deepen or expand U.S.-Japan space security cooperation, including across missions and architectures, organizations, industrial and technology sectors, and within international forums. It also discusses potential barriers and limitations that need to be overcome to achieve greater cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-history-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space History of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three distinct but cooperative organizations were tasked with incubating Japan’s nascent national space program: the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL), the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS), and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA). NAL was created in 1955 to research aerospace transportation systems. ISAS was founded in 1964 by the University of Tokyo for research and development and, in 1970, was responsible for the launch of the country’s first satellite. In 1969, NASDA was founded by national law and set space development priorities for Japan. The law that created NASDA was accompanied by a supplementary resolution that limited the development and use of space to peaceful purposes. This resolution was interpreted by the Japanese government as “nonmilitary”; while many other countries around the globe also refer to “peaceful purposes” vis-à-vis their space activities, they often interpret the term to mean nonaggressive but still permissive of military space activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAL, ISAS, and NASDA each held responsibility for different aspects of the country’s space ambitions until they were later combined to create JAXA, which was established by the Law Concerning Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in October 2003. Under this law, JAXA’s objectives are to (1) develop research at academic institutions and universities, (2) enhance space and aeronautics science and technology, and (3) promote the utilization and development of space, but only for peaceful purposes. JAXA has continued to focus on peaceful operations, although it was authorized in the early 2010s to engage in security-related activities. It has since signed agreements with Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) for technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20 years since its founding, JAXA has become a reliable actor in civil space missions. One of the first missions after the organization’s establishment was the Hayabusa mission, launched in May 2004, which collected matter from the near-Earth Itokawa asteroid for further study. This mission made Japan the first nation to collect and return asteroid samples to Earth. The Hayabusa mission was successfully completed in 2010 and a second mission, Hayabusa2, was launched in 2014 to collect samples from the Ryugu asteroid. Hayabusa2 successfully delivered samples back to Earth in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, JAXA contributed the Japanese Experiment Module, known as Kibo, to the International Space Station (ISS) for microgravity experiments. In 2022, Japan officially signed on to contribute to the ISS — which had been in operation for over 23 years — through 2030, making Japan the first country besides the United States to formalize its commitment for an additional eight years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although JAXA’s primary focus is on civil missions, Japanese space policies describe a partnership between JAXA and Japanese national security entities in developing and deploying certain space missions and technologies. For example, because of increased missile activity from North Korea in the late 1990s, including a North Korean rocket that flew over Japan in 1998, Japan launched its first satellite constellation, called the Intelligence-Gathering Satellite (IGS) program, in 2003. IGS satellites are dual use between national defense applications and civil national disaster monitoring. These reconnaissance satellites have been launched with either optical (EO) or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, and each satellite has a projected operational life of five years on orbit. The IGS program has seen over one dozen launches atop JAXA rockets in its 20-year history to include both EO and SAR satellites. However, the data from the IGS program is managed almost exclusively by the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center (CSICE). Japanese policymakers have sought to increase JAXA’s contributions to Japanese space security efforts following the passage of the 2008 Basic Space Law, and collaboration is ongoing on space situational awareness and other areas, although there remains room for significant expansion of such efforts. JAXA is also working with Japanese industry to develop reusable rockets by 2030 to reduce launch costs and compete with international efforts to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-organizations-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space Organizations of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge to understanding the leadership and locus of space policy in the Japanese government is the siloed nature of space across sections of the Japanese government. In the executive branch, the prime minister is supported by the cabinet, which includes the Cabinet Office, Cabinet Secretariat, and 11 ministries. Space activities are ultimately overseen by the Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy. As space is further integrated into defense, the Japanese MOD has become an increasingly important space stakeholder as well. Interministerial rivalry on space issues is common in Japan, and space activities often end up siloed, with a lack of formal coordination across ministries, until issues reach the National Space Policy Secretariat or the Strategic Headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cabinet, a Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy was created in 2008 by the Basic Space Law. Under the headquarters, Japan’s National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) was created in 2012 to assist in the coordination of space policies and budget allocations among the various ministries. It is considered a counterpart to the U.S. National Space Council (NSpC) staff. Similarly, the Committee on National Space Policy, involving representatives from industry and academia, was created in 2012 to serve as an advisory body to the headquarters. In contrast to the U.S. NSpC, the NSPS also holds licensing responsibilities under Japan’s Space Activities Act and Remote Sensing Data Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cabinet Office, which operates under the cabinet, directs the planning, design, and coordination of policies regarding space exploration and the development, maintenance, and operation of the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). QZSS is Japan’s regional satellite navigation constellation that both operates independently and is interoperable with the Global Positioning System (GPS). The cabinet directed the Cabinet Office to operate QZSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministries with primary responsibilities for Japan’s space programs are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), which oversees JAXA&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MOD, which oversees the Japanese military and Self-Defense Force (SDF), as well as the recently established Space Operations Group&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Economics, Trade Industry (METI), which has become more involved with space and helps administer strategic planning and industry funds&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), which handles international space policy diplomacy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), which oversees the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology and its large space research and development group&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT), which oversees the Japan Meteorological Agency, responsible for the Himawari geostationary meteorological satellite constellation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of the Environment (MOE), which is responsible for monitoring greenhouse gasses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), which is responsible for supporting relevant industries and food security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l7H88Ck.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Japan Space Organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space responsibilities are also assigned to the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office (CIRO). Although not part of a ministry, CIRO falls directly under the prime minister and is responsible for providing integrated intelligence to policymakers in the cabinet and the Cabinet Secretariat. Within CIRO, the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center is responsible for acquisition, operations, data collection, and imagery analysis for the growing IGS satellite constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ministry-of-defense&quot;&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD organizes and executes national defense strategy and leads the Self-Defense Force. Space policy and program decisions are created throughout a variety of positions and offices in the MOD, specifically including the Internal Bureau of Defense Policy and Bureau of Defense Buildup Planning. Other space-related organizations include the Joint Staff; Air Staff Office; the Acquisition, Technology &amp;amp; Logistics Agency; and the Defense Intelligence Headquarters. Japan is set to stand up the Japan Joint Operations Command by 2025, which will direct all SDF joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military service responsible for space activities is the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), which was established in 1954. In FY 2027, the service will be renamed the Japan Air and Space Self-Defense Force to “reinforce its space operation capability and . . . [develop] a system to ensure superiority in use of space.” The Space Operations Group was created in 2020 as the first space-focused unit within the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The group is organized to facilitate easy cooperation and interoperability with parallel U.S. organizations. It currently has 150 military personnel and will continue to grow. Its initial responsibility is the operation of Japan’s Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system. The group has four main objectives: (1) enhancing SSA; (2) improving information, communication, and positioning capabilities; (3) leveraging electromagnetic domain capabilities to deny other actors use of the full slate of command, control, communication, computer, and intelligence operations; and (4) working with other Japanese agencies, such as JAXA, and relevant counterparts in the United States and around the world. Beyond the Space Operation Group, the JASDF chief of staff maintains relationships with space leaders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolution-of-space-security-policy-in-japan&quot;&gt;Evolution of Space Security Policy in Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased ballistic missile and space activities from China and North Korea began to shift the security dynamic in the Indo-Pacific and motivated Japanese leaders to rethink Tokyo’s national defense strategy. Japan began to slowly integrate space into its overarching security policies starting in the late 2000s. China’s 2007 direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) test, which created thousands of pieces of debris in low Earth orbit (LEO), also likely influenced Japanese perspectives on space. Japan was one of the first to condemn the test, along with the United States and the United Kingdom, and many others followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, one year after China’s destructive ASAT test, the Diet adopted the Basic Space Law, which went through many iterations to gather support from both the ruling and opposition parties in the Diet. The Basic Space Law was the first law for space development in the country and reversed Japan’s decades-long policy that space be utilized for nonmilitary purposes only, aligning Japan with the same policy approach as many other countries. It established a Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy, which became a driver of space policy and plans in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-space-plan&quot;&gt;Basic Space Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basic Space Law also created the first Basic Plan on Space Policy, which was a foundational document in Japanese space policy and the first to clearly identify national security as an objective of Japanese space activities. This was a turning point in how Japan approached space capabilities as part of its national defense strategy. The Basic Plan on Space Policy is now in its fifth iteration. In both the Basic Space Law and the iterations of the Basic Plan on Space Policy that followed, the development and use of space capabilities are described as a way to improve the lives of Japanese citizens and increase international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, Japan published a second version of its Basic Plan on Space Policy that outlined government-led space activities for the decade ahead, citing a rapidly changing space domain as an impetus to update the country’s policies. The document suggested a fundamental shift in Japanese space development from a focus on scientific and technological research to the utilization of space for national security and environmental monitoring. Further, it emphasized the need for Japan’s aerospace industry to become a competitive supplier of space capabilities and services to buyers outside of Japan in an increasingly international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in January 2015, a third Basic Plan on Space Policy was published, with a request that two industry-focused space acts be adopted by the Diet. These two laws — the Space Activities Act (SAA) and the Remote Sensing Data Act — were enacted in 2016. The SAA was created to establish a system to regulate and license the launch of spacecraft, ensure public safety, and promote the use of space to improve the lives of the Japanese people, including via economic development. The Remote Sensing Data Act is a broadly scoped document that established a licensing regime for space-based remote sensing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, the country released its fourth Basic Plan on Space Policy, acknowledging for the first time the urgency of space assets to advancing national security. This update describes Japan’s space industry as lagging behind other countries in trending areas, such as the deployment of large constellations of small satellites. The document describes the growing importance of space in national security, the dependence of militaries and governments on space systems, and the risks of interfering with the sustainable use of the space domain. It also lays out Japan’s space policy vision: to become a self-sustaining space nation and use space to contribute to a wide variety of national interests, including disaster management and economic growth. An undercurrent of the document is a desire to use space to solve global sustainability issues and strengthen national resilience. Sustainability and resource management are two key pillars of Japanese society and policy and remain a priority for space development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifth Basic Plan on Space Policy was released in June 2023, highlighting the accelerated use of space for national security and the growing dependence of economic and social activities on space systems. The document further notes that on-orbit systems and their ground architectures are increasingly becoming seamlessly integrated and that access to space is democratizing beyond traditional spacefaring nations, which the document labels “space transformation.” The plan further underscores that the symbiotic nature between private and government space investment helps Japan maintain its leading role among spacefaring nations and must be further strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2022-security-and-defense-strategies&quot;&gt;2022 Security and Defense Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan released three new strategic documents as well as an updated defense budget document in December 2022. The NSS, NDS, and Defense Buildup Program together reflect a turning point in Japan’s defense positioning. Integrated into each of these documents is a strong emphasis on the use of space for defense and national security. This is a noticeable change from policies of the past. Japan does not yet operate any satellites exclusively for military purposes, consistent with previous policy, though the SDF exclusively operates military-use communications payloads on private sector satellite buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complex and increasingly threatening security environment frames the 2022 NSS. Described as the most “severe and complex as it has ever been since the end of World War II,” the security environment includes the expanding military arsenals of China and North Korea, the introduction by China and North Korea of advanced weapons such as HGVs, and Russia’s brazen invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine’s effective resistance. The NSS draws parallels between Russia’s hostile actions against Ukraine and the West and potential Chinese regional aggression against Taiwan and others. The NSS also clearly and frequently mentions the threat of a nuclear weapons buildup in China, North Korea, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of growing security demands, these new documents emphasize the need for an independent defense strategy and accelerated economic growth to protect against threats and the risk of invasion from a neighboring nation, as well as challenges to the post–World War II international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSS, which was first issued in 2013, outlines three main national interests: (1) sovereignty and independence while maintaining peace and security; (2) economic prosperity; and (3) protecting universal values and the international order, specifically in the Indo-Pacific region. It also calls upon like-minded nations to come together and cooperate to address global challenges, such as climate change and infectious diseases. The document also states that the line between military and nonmilitary fields has been blurred in areas both technological and economical, another departure from previous national documents that explicitly separated the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is cited heavily in the strategy and is specifically mentioned as a national security policy area, alongside diplomacy, defense, and economic security. The NSS calls for increased comprehensive efforts in space security from the entire government, including the use of the space domain by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the integration of space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic domains into ground, maritime, and air capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missions prioritized in the NSS, including both missile defense and counterstrike operations, will rely heavily on space-based capabilities. The Japanese government had not previously acquired counterstrike capabilities due to the interpretation of its “defensive defense” policy at the time. As the Japanese military is still a self-defense force, government policy permits counterstrikes, but preemptive strikes are not permitted — a distinction that comes after years of debate in the Japanese government dating back to the 1950s. Currently, Japan relies significantly on the United States for information to enable its own missile defense and counterstrike capabilities. The expanded threat of mobile missiles, with unusual trajectories and the ability to be launched en masse, along with the capabilities of hypersonic weapons, are heavily underscored in the document and a key driver for the need for information collected from space-based assets. This includes imagery satellites to detect missile movements on the ground, develop targeting solutions, and provide warning of impending launches, as well as satellites that can detect missiles once launched and develop tracks and firing solutions for missile defense interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a Japanese national security strategy document, space security has its own subsection, “Reinforcing Comprehensive Efforts for Space Security,” in which space is described as “indispensable” for social and economic activities. The SDF and Japan Coast Guard are encouraged to utilize space capabilities. The section also calls for strengthening cooperation between JAXA and SDF on security matters — language that is a departure from past space policies in which JAXA was isolated from defense and security discussions. Greater “cooperation and coordination” are also encouraged between the CSICE, MOD, and SDF in intelligence gathering, including from space-based assets. Furthermore, the section encourages the utilization of civilian space technology and growth in the space industrial base to support the development of satellite constellations and better integration of industry products into space security missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document itself does not lay out specifications for space priorities or space organizations, but it sets the expectation that the country will release a concept supported by the government. This Space Security Initiative — the country’s first space security policy — was announced in June 2023 at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship in the NSS cannot be understated, nor can the emphasis on deepening security cooperation between the two countries. As Japan’s ally “with the world’s greatest comprehensive power,” increased cooperation and coordination with the United States is listed numerous times as a strategic approach and a means by which to achieve Tokyo’s security goals, including in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship in the NSS cannot be understated, nor can the emphasis on deepening security cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 NDS seeks to clarify the national defense objectives of Japan, maintaining that the development of defensive capabilities is solely to protect the nation, not to pose a threat to other countries. Building off the NSS, the NDS is framed by Chinese, North Korean, and Russian threats to both the national security of Japan and the international community. The NDS articulates that the Indo-Pacific region is facing significant challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is building up its military and technological resources to amplify force on its mainland and in the East China and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Korea has become more brazen with its ballistic missile programs and pursuit of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and its impacts in Europe are a warning to the possibilities of invasion or disruption in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document calls for a strengthening of Japan’s defense capabilities and overall deterrence posture, particularly in cooperation with the United States, whose alliance serves as a pillar of Tokyo’s overall security policy. Time is a grounding factor in the NDS, which calls for Japan to be able to primarily defend itself against potential invaders by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the use of space for missile warning is not explicitly stated, missile defense is a stand-out priority throughout the document. Missile defense, and a subsequent counterstrike capability, have rising importance in light of elevated missile launch activity from North Korea and China inching closer to Japanese territory. Space is the key enabler for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities to ensure accurate and responsive missile warning and defense in the nation. Japanese defense policymakers are prioritizing Japan developing its own capability to defend itself, with missile defense systems developed in collaboration with and built to be interoperable with U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDS also details a desire to integrate space into MOD and SDF activities by utilizing satellite constellations for communications, intelligence gathering, and positioning and by building a space domain awareness (SDA) structure to respond to threats in the space domain. Finally, the NDS calls for an enhanced SDA capability to be able to monitor objects in space by FY 2027 and for the continued acquisition of space capabilities and integration into SDF units over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the NSS, the NDS recognizes space as vital for both civilians and the military and calls for increased collaboration between the SDF and JAXA. The NDS also renames the Air Self-Defense Force as the Air and Space Self-Defense Force, emphasizing a renewed focus on space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEFENSE BUILDUP PROGRAM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Buildup Program serves as a guide for the MOD and the SDF to build, maintain, and operate defense capabilities. It provides a general outline of the systems the SDF will procure and operate. The program states that within five years, Japan will strengthen its defense capabilities, and within ten years, the SDF will be capable of deterring future invasions without allied assistance. Space capabilities are called upon early in the document as a tool to improve cross-domain operations such as missile warning, information gathering, and communications. The SDF is directed to develop a space-based space domain awareness capability, which will include the use of supplementary commercial options, and to increase efforts to add layers and resiliency to existing secure military communications. The MOD will also coordinate with JAXA to leverage space as a mechanism to strengthen cooperation with the United States and other friendly nations. Finally, the program echoes the call of the NDS to rename the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to the Air and Space Self-Defense Force, highlighting the increased role space capabilities will play in the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout each of these documents, it is clear that space has become an integral component of Japan’s national security posture. With a focus on information gathering, communication, and positioning data from space capabilities, Japan is focused on further integrating space, including JAXA and industry partners, into its defense architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-space-security-initiative&quot;&gt;2023 Space Security Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build on the NSS, Japan released the Space Security Initiative (SSI) in June 2023 to provide a decade-long strategy for space security and the space architecture needed to achieve those goals. The initiative identifies space as an “arena for geopolitical competition for national power over diplomacy, defense, economics, and intelligence. . . ” and highlights a growing need for an expansion of capability and cooperation with allies. The document outlines requirements for a national security space architecture to include compatibility and interoperability of satellite data, cyber security, and information security; resilience against threats and risks in space; and economic efficiency through the use of commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative identifies parallel framing issues as in the NSS, but it is able to specify the use of space in target areas of policy. The SSI describes the impact Western commercial satellites made in supporting Ukraine in the initial weeks of Russia’s invasion, describes the critical importance of cloud-based data management, and references China’s dramatic increase of space capabilities to include SAR and radio frequency satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI describes a three-pronged approach to establishing a national security space architecture: “Radically Expand the Use of Space Systems for National Security,” “Ensuring Safe and Stable Use of Outer Space,” and developing a “Virtuous Cycle of Security and Fostering [a] Space Industrial Base.” A thorough and ambitious architecture is presented in the document, with space capabilities covering position, navigation, and timing (QZSS and GPS); intelligence (IGS constellation and commercial imagery satellites); communications (commercial SATCOM, defense SATCOM, tactical SATCOM, commercial and optical constellations); missile defense (early warning satellites and a missile defense space system); space domain awareness (SDA satellites and commercial space situational awareness satellites); and on-orbit fuel supply satellites. It also includes space transportation (government launch vehicles and commercial rockets) and optical telescopes and radar run by JAXA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI outlines specific needs for a national security space architecture. Satellite data must be interoperable with U.S. and allied infrastructure. The architecture must have robust cyber and information security; be resilient against space threats, including anti-satellite weapons; be able to protect ground stations; and be able to leverage commercial services, particularly in communications, Earth observation, and data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve security from space, the first priority listed is intelligence collection. This is specified as geostationary-based optical satellites to add to the current IGS constellation. The current IGS system, and intelligence collection systems writ large, place resolution above revisit rate and are stovepiped from other MOD initiatives, creating the need to duplicate particular systems to give information to disconnected government offices. The SSI calls for an increase in satellite resolution, faster data transfer, and cooperation among CSICE, which currently operates and owns IGS data, the MOD, and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, as well as other relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second priority outlined in the SSI is missile defense, specified as continued work with the United States on an early warning satellite. Additionally, the SSI describes a technical demonstration of additional missile defense capabilities, such as detection and tracking to respond to ballistic missiles and HGVs being developed and deployed by China and North Korea. This may be the architecture that presents the most opportunity for collaboration and coordination with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative’s third priority is the establishment of anti-jamming communications capabilities. Tokyo is attuned to the importance of continuity of operations, seeing Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian communication networks on the first day of the conflict. The SSI calls for a layered and redundant communications capability that utilizes multiple orbits, both geostationary orbit (GEO) and LEO, to be interoperable with the United States and additional allies. This communications system will be used not only by the MOD and Self-Defense Forces, but also by the Japan Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth priority relates to position, navigation, and timing services, to be achieved through strengthening the current QZSS constellation. The final aspect of security from space in the SSI is space transportation, with a focus on continuing to operate a space launch vehicle, reduce launch costs, and commercialize operations for government utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI then turns to priorities for security in space and ensuring the safe and sustainable use of the space environment. The top priority in this initiative is enhancing space domain awareness. This encompasses not only situational awareness and movements of other satellites, but also operations and capabilities of other nations’ on-orbit assets. Space domain awareness will offer avenues to collaborate internationally in the Combined Space Operations Center and the Combined Space Operations Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-orbit servicing is a secondary priority area, focusing on on-orbit refueling and servicing to extend the life cycle of satellites in GEO. Subsequently, the SSI details the importance of information sharing across Japanese government agencies that may currently be stovepiped in the decisionmaking process, including the Cabinet Secretariat, the Cabinet Office, the MOD, and the Self-Defense Forces. Strengthening cooperation and information sharing with the United States is highlighted throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SSI specifies that Japan will continue to lend its voice to the United Nations and other multinational organizations to shape norms for responsible behavior in the use of space. Along with the United States, Japan has committed to not conducting destructive, direct-ascent ASAT missile testing and to mitigating any future creation of space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize its ambitious goals, the SSI acknowledges the need to strengthen public-private partnerships in the space domain in a large variety of areas, including personnel exchanges and technical cooperation with industry and government both within and outside Japan; research and development; government support of industry; investment diversification in private entities; and additional backing to industries with dual-use opportunities such as on orbit servicing, SAR and optical satellites, and launch. Additionally, the SSI aims to support a stable supply chain for components of critical technologies, including by issuing a Space Technology Strategy and by bolstering JAXA as the center of space excellence in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Technology Strategy was released in 2024 to build on the 2023 Basic Space Plan and SSI. It serves as a guide for the timeline and development of civilian and military sectors in satellites, space science and exploration, space transportation, and cross-domain technologies. The Space Technology Strategy further prioritizes efforts to mitigate “supply chain risks” to Japan’s “predominance” in space technologies, again linking the “competitiveness” of Japan’s space industry to its national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support these priorities, in November 2023, Tokyo announced that JAXA would be allocated ¥1 trillion over a 10-year period to support the nation’s commercial sector and technology development in the space industry. The funding will focus on satellites, space exploration, and space transportation. An additional ¥1 trillion is anticipated to be allocated for space security from 2023 to 2027. Like the United States and others, Japan recognizes the economic and technological benefits of space and how its investments create a demand signal to spur private sector innovation and attract technical talent. It also sees advances in the space domain helping solve global sustainability, resource management, and disaster relief challenges here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-budget&quot;&gt;Space Budget&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo’s policies and plans for greater space utilization are being implemented through increased funding. According to annual budget request documents published by the Cabinet Office, the government of Japan has been steadily increasing its space budget and, since FY 2019, spending on space activities has more than doubled. In late 2023, the government of Japan announced plans to commit ¥1 trillion ($6.9 billion) over a 10-year period toward the expansion of Japan’s domestic space industry. These resources, established as the Space Strategy Fund, will be managed by JAXA. The FY 2024 space budget begins to reflect this new funding, with large increases allocated to MEXT, the ministry overseeing JAXA, and METI, which has become more involved in stimulating Japan’s space industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7vHoWMw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s overall defense budget has been increasing since 2012, and it saw significant increases following the 2022 release of its defining defense strategy and budgetary documents. Tokyo’s FY 2022 defense budget (including its initial budget and supplementary budget) — framed as a “Defense-Strengthening Acceleration Package” — comprised ¥5.9 trillion ($40.9 billion) and reflected a 6.5 percent increase over FY 2021. In FY 2023, Japan’s “‘First Year’ Budget for Fundamental Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities” totaled ¥6.6 trillion ($45.7 billion), an increase of 11.9 percent over FY 2022. And in FY 2024, a year characterized as “Progress . . . in [the] Fundamental Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities,” Tokyo’s defense budget was ¥7.7 trillion ($53.3 billion), an increase of 16.7 percent. The FY 2025 budget request is planned for release in August 2024 and is expected to reflect continued increases in defense spending aligned with Tokyo’s national security and defense strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD publishes an annual overview of its budget for defense programs, with space domain capabilities categorized in a few broad areas: space situational awareness and space domain awareness, strengthening information-gathering capabilities, enhancing space resiliency, and utilizing space for missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/579ptd3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Japan Ministry of Defense Space-Related Budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/d_act/d_budget/index.html&quot;&gt;“Defense Budget,” Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;; and authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honing in on FY 2023, since that year marks the first MOD budget following the release of Japan’s NSS, NDS, and SSI, space funding nearly doubled, increasing from ¥79 billion ($546 million) to ¥152.9 billion ($1.1 billion). The FY 2023 budget document framed this funding increase with the observation that “the space domain is now the foundation of our citizens’ daily lives and security, and it is extremely important for Japan to ensure superiority in space use”; therefore, “it is necessary to strengthen space operational capabilities.” SDA enhancements saw the greatest growth, including the production of a domestic SDA satellite and consideration of more satellites (¥59.5 billion, $411.9 million) and the development of space command and control capabilities (¥13.7 billion, $94.8 million). The other area that saw significant growth was in information-collection capabilities, with ¥34.3 billion ($237.2 million) allocated to enhancing the X-band SATCOM network and ¥22.6 billion ($156.2 million) allocated to the procurement of data for image analysis. Notably, the FY 2023 budget also begins funding infrared sensor technology demonstrations for HGV detection and tracking (¥4.6 billion, $31.8 million) and demonstrations to acquire and process EO/SAR data and respond to HGVs (¥8 billion, $55.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FY 2024 MOD space budget slightly declined from FY 2023. It maintained an emphasis on SDA to include ¥17.2 billion ($118.8 million) for the launch and deployment of an SDA satellite, scheduled for launch in FY 2026, and space command and control (¥9.2 billion, $63.6 million). The budget also begins funding an optical datalink demonstration in GEO (¥4.8 billion, $33.2 million) and a study on hosted payloads. It continues investments in information-collection capabilities with the acquisition of commercial satellite imagery (¥24.7 billion, $170.6 million) and advancing HGV detection and tracking technology demonstrations, specifying use of the HTV-X space station resupply vehicle as an experimental platform (¥3.8 billion, $26.2 million). The one area that saw a significant increase over FY 2023 is in SATCOM resiliency to build interoperability between X-band military SATCOM and other commercial SATCOM systems (¥10.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts on Japan’s space programs and budgets shared with the authors that the FY 2024 topline decrease for space can be explained through the natural progression of certain programs (e.g., allocating funds to transition the SDA satellite from production to preparing it for launch and deployment) and some delays in budget execution. However, the FY 2025 space budget request, scheduled to be announced in August 2024, is expected to rise significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-industrial-base-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space Industrial Base of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s space industry is worth approximately ¥1.2 trillion ($8.6 billion) as estimated by the World Economic Forum, with the Japanese government seeking to double the size of the industry by the early 2030s. It is dominated by government-funded heavy industry, primarily through the production of space launch vehicles (SLVs), but includes a growing number of space start-ups. Japan’s long-standing focus on indigenous launch capabilities and independent access to space indicates a prioritization on autonomy. SLVs are often seen by rising space powers as a key to competitiveness in the space market and international success in the domain. A majority of SLV operations are now based in the private sector with JAXA oversight. On the start-up front, over a 21-year period (2000–2021), Japan accounted for the third-largest number of investors in space start-up companies, behind the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2019 annual report of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Japan’s space industry comprises three broad categories: (1) space vehicles, including launch vehicles, satellites, and space station components, which make up 87 percent of total production; (2) ground facilities, which comprise 8 percent; and (3) software, which accounts for the final 5 percent. The FY 2022 report, released in 2023, shows a slight rebalancing of 76.6 percent, 9.6 percent, and 13.8 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-industry&quot;&gt;Traditional Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the Japanese aerospace market was dominated by four large companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), IHI Aerospace, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO), and NEC Space Technologies. These companies provide products and solutions across a wide range of industrial sectors — from agriculture to telecommunications to transportation. Aerospace and defense comprise a fraction of their overall business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MHI has been providing launch services in Japan since 2007 and has proved to be a reliable partner to JAXA in the development of three SLVs: the H-IIA, H-IIB, and H3 launch vehicle (in production). Prior to the H3’s failure in March 2023, the H-IIA/B vehicles had 49 consecutive successful launches. In addition to SLV production, MHI produces rocket engines, test facilities, electronic parts, and parts of Japanese systems or components for the ISS, such as the Japanese Experiment Module. The H3 test-launched successfully in February and July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHI is involved in a variety of large industries in Japan, including space, defense, aircraft engines, and long-term research and development. The Epsilon Launch Vehicle, developed by IHI Aerospace and operated by JAXA, is currently on its fifth iteration, known as Epsilon (S), and has a successful record of inserting up to nine satellites into LEO. Additionally, IHI Aerospace contributes solid rocket boosters, a gas jet system, and pyrotechnics to the H-IIA and H-IIB launch vehicles and continues to work with JAXA and MHI on the production of a new solid booster for the H3 vehicle. IHI Aerospace also designed and manufactured the return capsule for the Hayabusa asteroid probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELCO has been developing space technology for Japan since the 1960s, with an emphasis on satellite production, high-performance payloads, and exportable components for satellite programs across the globe. MELCO is also involved in building ground stations, including manufacturing antennas, transmitters, receivers, and radio and optical telescopes, among other products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEC Space Technologies focuses on specific components for satellites and launch vehicles rather than full systems. Components from NEC have been used on over 350 spacecraft worldwide. Though one of Japan’s mainstay industry partners in space, NEC maintains fewer than 450 employees across its space business, serving as a reminder of the small scale of Japanese space personnel and the room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation is the largest geostationary satellite communications operator in the Pacific region, where the company operates 17 geostationary communications satellites. The company was established in 1985 as Japan’s first private SATCOM company. It plans on expanding operations to include Earth observation satellites to enable it to respond to security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SKY Perfect JSAT is headquartered in Tokyo, with a U.S. subsidiary, JSAT International, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to conglomerates that operate aerospace and defense segments, Japan has a unique trading house economy. Known as “sogo shosha,” Japanese investment houses, which are often part of larger Japanese business groups known as “keiretsu,” look to engage in a variety of sectors and technologies; they helped propel Japan into global markets and industrialization, particularly in the aftermath of the post-war reconstruction period. Modern-day houses are increasingly investing in space technologies and companies in Japan and internationally. Traditional firms are also investing in international space start-ups, including through joint ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-space&quot;&gt;New Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small start-ups, many of which are funded by venture capital, are expanding Japan’s space activities beyond the scope of traditional Japanese heavy industry. Several of these companies are capitalizing on Japan’s strength in robotics to innovate in the areas of space sustainability and exploration, such as space domain awareness and on-orbit servicing. Companies such as Astroscale, ispace, and GITAI are focusing on a variety of different mission areas, ranging from on-orbit servicing to lunar missions to robotics on the ISS. Other new space companies, including Axelspace, iQPS, and Synspective, are developing small satellite constellations to observe and analyze natural and human activity on Earth. Listed below are several new space companies, providing examples of the wide-ranging space technologies in development in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astroscale, a Tokyo-based start-up company with subsidiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom, among other countries, specializes in on-orbit servicing, including satellite life extension, on-orbit SSA, and debris-removal technology for the safe and sustainable use of space. Although products from Astroscale are largely still in the development phase, the company has conducted successful test missions. In 2023, Astroscale was awarded a contract by the U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) for the provision of on-orbit satellite refueling services, a demonstration of the potential for collaboration between the U.S. government and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another innovative Japanese company is ispace, a lunar exploration company that also seeks to expand human presence beyond Earth. In late 2022, ispace launched its first Hakuto-R mission, with the goal of a lunar landing in early 2023. Although the lander successfully reached lunar orbit, it crashed into the surface of the Moon, likely due to a software failure, and was unable to complete its mission. If it had been successful, the lander would have become the first private sector spacecraft to land on the Moon. Ispace’s second Hakuto-R mission, which will again attempt a soft landing on the Moon, is currently scheduled for 2024 launch. Additionally, ispace has been contracted by NASA to develop the lander for a 2026 commercial lunar payload services mission to the far side of the Moon. In late 2023, ispace established a U.S. headquarters in Colorado to enable more business opportunities in the United States, especially with the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GITAI is a space robotics start-up capitalizing on Japan’s long history of excellence in robotics. The company aims to partner with launch companies to build colonies on the Moon and Mars. While this may sound far-fetched, the company has formed successful relationships and contracts with Toyota Motor Corporation and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; has completed a successful technology demonstration mission inside the ISS; and has engaged with U.S. space companies. Like other Japanese space start-ups that have established a U.S. headquarters or subsidiary, GITAI has moved most business operations to the United States to better conform to U.S. export control regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axelspace designs and produces Earth observation microsatellites and their components and successfully launched its first satellite in 2014. The company currently has five satellites in orbit with customers in over 30 countries. Axelspace’s business model centers on sustainability, including using collected optical imagery and data services to monitor climate change resulting from deforestation and supporting a sustainable space environment through policy advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, iQPS and Synspective are building small satellite constellations for Earth observation, leveraging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology that enables the collection of data and imagery day and night, and in all-weather conditions. The information can be used to support environmental monitoring, disaster management, and national security applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growing-prominence-of-space-in-the-bilateral-relationship&quot;&gt;Growing Prominence of Space in the Bilateral Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our bilateral partnership is among the strongest in the world, in part because we’re always adapting it to meet the evolving challenges of our time. That’s the case on everything from advancing security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, to bolstering our economic and energy security . . . we’re also expanding the horizons of our partnership in a very literal way, through space cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-january-13-2023&quot;&gt;– U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken, January 13, 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space has become more prominent in high-level discussions between the United States and Japan, with political and military leaders from both nations committing to deepen cooperation in space security. This builds upon a long history of space cooperation, especially across civil space organization missions and organizations, which span human spaceflight, scientific research, satellite navigation and communication, and defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, U.S. president Joe Biden and Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio announced a bilateral space framework agreement, further cementing cooperation on space exploration, while also discussing the need to better align force postures in the space domain. The U.S. and Japanese defense and foreign ministers now regularly highlight the growing importance of space to stability, security, and economic prosperity. In 2023, they committed to deepen cooperation “on space capabilities to strengthen mission assurance, interoperability, and operational cooperation.” Then, in April 2024, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida went further, announcing a bilateral collaborative effort on a satellite constellation to detect and track missiles, including hypersonic glide vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers from both countries emphasize the increasing importance of space in their defense strategies, with space cooperation providing “an asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match.” Japan plans to “radically expand the use of space systems for national security” while also playing a “proactive role in shaping norms for responsible behavior in outer space.” The United States is prioritizing resilient space architectures, promoting responsible behaviors in the space domain, and expanding space cooperation to enhance information sharing and develop combined operations in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artemis-program-and-artemis-accords&quot;&gt;Artemis Program and Artemis Accords&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is a partner of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to explore the Moon and Mars. As part of the Artemis missions, the Lunar Gateway will serve as an outpost that will orbit around the Moon to stage deep-space exploration. In November 2022, NASA and the government of Japan announced specific contributions under the “Gateway Implementing Arrangement.” Under this arrangement, Japan agreed to contribute critical components to the Lunar Gateway’s International Habitation module and the JAXA HTV-XG spacecraft to launch and deliver resupply missions for the Lunar Gateway. Japan’s contributions to the International Habitation module will include an Environmental Control and Life Support System, cameras, functions for thermal control, and batteries for additional modules. In return, NASA agreed to fly a JAXA astronaut as a Lunar Gateway crew member on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology later added that the country seeks to have a Japanese astronaut land on the Moon in the late 2020s as the first non-American on the Moon, an aim that was reinforced by Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden in a 2024 state visit where Japan’s anticipated role of providing the first international Artemis astronaut on the lunar surface was formalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Japan was one of seven original signatories to NASA’s Artemis Accords in 2020. The accords, which are separate from the Artemis campaign, are a set of “principles for cooperation in the civil exploration and use of the Moon, Mars, comets, and asteroids for peaceful purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-space-collaboration-agreement&quot;&gt;2023 Space Collaboration Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the U.S. secretary of state and Japan’s minister of foreign affairs signed a space collaboration agreement titled “Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, for Peaceful Purposes.” The specific areas of collaboration emphasized include space science (including Earth and lunar science), space exploration, technology, and mission assurance and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-security-consultative-committee&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC), often referred to as the “2+2” meetings and comprising both countries’ foreign and defense ministers, is a long-standing bilateral forum for discussing security and defense cooperation. The joint statement from the January 2023 SCC meeting emphasized alliance modernization and renewed both sides’ “commitment to deepening cooperation on space capabilities to strengthen mission assurance, interoperability, and operational cooperation.” It also, notably, included a declaration that “attacks to, from, or within space . . . in certain circumstances, could lead to the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” which commits the United States to defend Japan if attacked by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-comprehensive-dialogue-on-space&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Comprehensive Dialogue on Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cement both nations’ commitment to bilateral space cooperation, Japan and the United States engage in a Comprehensive Dialogue on Space. This is one of only two comprehensive dialogues that the United States maintains, and it is the most longstanding one. In March 2023, the eighth meeting was held in Tokyo, which included representatives from the governments of both nations and, for the first time, industry participants. Policymakers discussed national security, including Japan’s 2022 NSS, as well as commercial and civil space cooperation, with an emphasis on space situational awareness. The ninth dialogue is planned for the summer of 2024 in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-military-cooperation&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Military Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We cannot secure stable use of space by unilateral effort, therefore, it is essential to cooperate with the U.S. and our partners at all stages from peaceful time to armed contingencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-major-general-yajima-masahito-director-general-of-the-defense-planning-and-policy-department-air-staff-office-japan-air-self-defense-force&quot;&gt;– Major General Yajima Masahito, director general of the Defense Planning and Policy Department, Air Staff Office, Japan Air Self-Defense Force&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent organizational developments have marked closer space ties between the two countries, especially at the operational level. The first instance of operational military cooperation stems from a 2020 agreement between the U.S. Space Force and Japan’s Office of National Space Policy, whereby two U.S. payloads will be hosted on Japan’s QZSS satellites. The U.S. payloads have space domain awareness optical sensors and have been delivered to Japan to launch on the QZS-6 and QZS-7 satellites from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, Japan participated in its first senior-level meeting of the Combined Space Operations initiative, where it joined a cohort of 10 countries working to improve multilateral space coordination, information sharing, and operational cooperation for the space domain. Political and military leaders from each of the 10 nations’ departments of defense meet annually to deter conflict, optimize resources, facilitate information sharing, and enhance mission assurance and resilience. The anticipated establishment of a U.S. Space Force command element in Japan in 2024 would facilitate further opportunities for bilateral training, exercises, and operational collaboration. This would be similar to U.S. Space Force command elements established in the Republic of Korea under the Space Force component supporting U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and in Tampa, Florida supporting U.S. Central Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments supplement an already established liaison officer initiative whereby Japan places a space liaison officer with the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM). The U.S. Space Force (USSF) has an officer assigned to U.S. Forces Japan; that role is expected to transition into a new USSF field command element in Japan later in 2024. As combined training and operational collaboration increases, further embedding liaison personnel would likely be welcome by Tokyo, including the placement of USSF or USSPACECOM personnel with the Japan Space Operations Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further integrate military approaches, Japan and the United States participate in hosted wargames. Each year since 2001, the United States has hosted an annual Schriever Wargame, originally organized by Air Force Space Command and now led by the U.S. Space Force. Japan has been a participant since 2018. Participation in these wargames builds confidence and insight into the strategy, capabilities, and decisionmaking of other nations, especially with regard to space threats. In 2024, Japan joined NATO members and other partners to participate in the French AsterX exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deepening-cooperation-in-space-security&quot;&gt;Deepening Cooperation in Space Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are abundant opportunities for deepening U.S.-Japan cooperation and collaboration in space security, building on the decades-long relationship in civil and commercial space cooperation and the nascent security activities underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment on threats and strategic interests, guidance from senior leadership and political support, and the commitment of personnel and resources create a window to advance a comprehensive agenda for space security cooperation. Questions of implementation remain, including how to translate high-level policy intent into meaningful actions to deliver space capabilities, create interoperability across systems, and enhance mission resilience. This must be done while leveraging the complementary strengths that both countries bring forth, building greater collective knowledge and expertise in the space domain, strengthening the industrial base and promoting a culture of innovation, and expanding the talent pool across each country. But collaboration should not be pursued just for collaborations’ sake — there must be intent behind actions to ensure that the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes several areas where the combined, complementary strengths of both nations’ public and private sectors can be brought together to deliver concrete space capabilities to advance both U.S. and Japanese national and collective security interests. These areas span collaborative efforts at the policy, operational, and technical levels and involve the governments, industry, and academia of both countries. The following section unpacks persistent challenges to greater cooperation. Each area includes discussion of the authors’ observations and findings from their research, interviews, and workshops, as well as the recommendations that follow therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collaboration should not be pursued just for collaborations’ sake — there must be intent behind actions to ensure that the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultivating-human-development&quot;&gt;Cultivating Human Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s past limitation that space be used only for nonmilitary purposes led its space ecosystem to grow around JAXA, civilian space missions, and civilian-led space science and technology research. This has been reinforced in the bilateral relationship through long-standing cooperation across space science and human spaceflight, as well as through expansion to cislunar and the Moon through NASA’s Artemis program and the Artemis Accords. Yet while Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations, its defense institutions and supporting industry have little exposure to, and limited experience in, military space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes establishing requirements for military space systems, developing and utilizing those systems, and integrating them into joint military operations. Building such knowledge and proficiency starts with education and training, which serves as the foundation for the space security relationship. Japanese officials describe this as “human development,” expressing a near-unanimous view across government, industry, and academia on the need for space education and training for both military and civilian personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To jump-start this human development, U.S. space institutions across government and academia could partner with Japan’s MOD and the JASDF to provide civilian and military personnel with greater space domain knowledge. This could include invitations by the U.S. Space Force to attend “Space 100/200” courses and Defense Acquisition University space acquisition courses. U.S. academic institutions, partnered with Japanese academia, can also serve an educational role. The USSF has partnered with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies for its professional military education, which — in addition to other academic institutions — has established executive education courses in space security. To maximize these education and training opportunities, leaders on both sides can also encourage greater foreign language proficiency across their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Japanese experts further describe a shortfall in “human resources” — the workforce required to support Japan’s space security vision — and cite the need for more engineers (e.g., aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and software engineers). In the near term, such a human resources shortfall is expected to place greater strain on JAXA, given its current workforce level and resources and the industrial base that supports it. Not only is JAXA supporting an expanded space exploration program, including the development of the Artemis Lunar Gateway and lunar rover, it is being asked to partner with the MOD to support the Space Security Initiative and develop many of the satellite systems described in it. This includes delivering the first domestically designed and produced SDA satellite for the JASDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help educate and inform MOD space professionals, JAXA assigns subject matter expert employees to the MOD defense policy bureau. However, it is important for the MOD to retain its own cadre of space professionals who are experts in space security policy, operations, and technology, as JAXA supplying personnel to the MOD is not a long-term solution to the MOD’s human resource shortfalls. Given JAXA and its predecessor organizations’ long-time focus on nonmilitary activities, it also lacks knowledge and experience with military requirements and operations, which differ in significant ways from those in a civil space context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a call to “expand and enhance” JAXA’s human resources and to recruit, train, and retain space professionals who can develop, build, and operate both civil and national security space missions. Over the next 10 years, the Japanese government has committed ¥1 trillion toward developing Japan’s domestic space industry. This Space Strategy Fund is aimed at supporting JAXA and the expansion of Japan’s space industrial base. Japan’s expanding start-up ecosystem should be nurtured as a pathway to bring greater technical talent into the space ecosystem. As one 2023 study notes, “Japan’s start-up ecosystem is currently able to draw top-tier talent to high-growth start-ups at a scale that was not possible fifteen years ago.” However, expertise takes time to cultivate. Partnerships with U.S. space and technology companies, especially on cooperative projects involving codevelopment or coproduction, can hasten this knowledge and experience while also adding needed capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also observed within Japan was the lack of space-related media and think tanks in contrast to the robust presence of media in the United States dedicated to reporting on civil, commercial, and military space developments. Public discussion about space programs and plans, technologies and start-ups, and the security and economic benefits of space may also lead to excitement, understanding, and greater support among the Japanese population. Without this public reporting, space would not receive broader attention and inclusion in conversation. Both U.S. and Japanese government and industry leaders could be more deliberate in their engagement with traditional Japanese media on space initiatives and collaborative efforts to build understanding and broader encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exercising-and-training-the-space-force-and-joint-force&quot;&gt;Exercising and Training the Space Force and Joint Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From early warning and intelligence to border and maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and high-end combat, space capabilities contribute to nearly every aspect of modern military operations. As Japan develops the space capabilities outlined in the SSI, it will be vitally important not just for the JASDF to build space proficiency, but for the broader Japanese joint force to understand how space capabilities enable its missions. In turn, such joint force learning will shape requirements on what the SDF needs from space systems moving forward. This learning is built through education, as discussed above, and integrating space elements into exercises and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these exercises is where theory meets reality. This is where both Japanese and U.S. forces work through the space capabilities each side can bring, the quality and timeliness of information needed from those systems to make decisions, and how that information is presented and delivered to users. These exercises can also be used to build interoperability between systems and identify any factors that may limit mission effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space capabilities can be increasingly integrated into bilateral and multilateral joint exercises, such as Keen Edge, Keen Sword, and Rim of the Pacific, and into routine service-specific and joint training, at both the command and field levels. Notably, Keen Edge 2024 — a command-level bilateral exercise between U.S. forces and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to enhance joint operations and interoperability for crises and contingencies in the Indo-Pacific — featured USSPACECOM participation for the first time. Military commanders will find that space capabilities play a key yet less visible role in joint force employment and can be a useful contributor as Japan evolves its command and control structures and stands up a joint operations command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the military space community, JASDF officials noted the value of taking part in the U.S. Space Force Schriever space wargame series and USSPACECOM’s Global Sentinel exercise, both of which expose participants to multilateral space operations scenarios. Such wargames and realistic scenarios, along with immersive tabletop exercises and collaborative studies, were cited as ways to improve Japanese understanding of space threats and the principles of operating in space for those new to the domain. They can also be leveraged by space policymakers and operators to explore scenarios that might lead to “the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” as discussed at the 2023 U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting, including considerations regarding the decisionmaking processes and information needs of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, JASDF officials recognize that their space forces will need to gain greater operational experience as they field satellite constellations that support Japan’s national security. As the MOD and JASDF expand into new mission areas in which satellites in orbit can maneuver to characterize other objects in space, such as space domain awareness, additional training will accelerate their ability to effectively employ the systems once they are fielded. Japan’s first SDA satellite is planned for launch in FY 2026, so now is the time to commence such training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such training and sharing of operational best practices support a policy goal shared by both countries to advance responsible behaviors in space, including conducting activities in space that promote the safety and sustainability of the domain. These capabilities also benefit the United States by having additional assets capable of identifying unfriendly or unusual satellite behaviors in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector Japanese and U.S. satellite operators have also gained greater operational insights from their participation in space wargames and exercises. For example, Japanese industry participated in a space situational awareness tabletop exercise through USSPACECOM’s Joint Task Force-Space Defense Sprint Advanced Concept Training initiative, which has since been renamed the Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell. The satellite operators were presented with operational problems such as how to respond to others’ satellite close approaches and maneuvers, satellite breakup events, etc. These scenarios challenged their thinking, helped them refine their own best practices, and forged key relationships with U.S. government and industry partners. Exercises such as these are all the more critical given Japan’s participation in USSPACECOM’s JCO cell. As industry becomes a trusted partner in fielding and operating satellite systems, its involvement in joint exercises will continue to become more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHARING DATA AND INFORMATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing helps build a more complete picture of emerging threats and enables each country to act with more fulsome knowledge than it would be able to individually. Whether for missile defense, counterstrike, space operations, or cyber defense, information will need to be disseminated to users in a timely manner and increasingly at machine speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An information exchange model often cited is the trilateral mechanism between the United States, Japan, and South Korea that enables real-time data sharing on North Korean missile launches. However, in the space domain, both U.S. and Japanese officials shared observations that the current information-sharing paradigm is “largely emails and PDFs,” not space threat information or operational data that both sides can access, analyze, and use. As both countries emphasize speed and adopt greater automation, advanced processing, and artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, they must be able to share datasets on operationally relevant timelines, whether in terms of real-time data on the launch and trajectory of a threatening hypersonic glide vehicle or regarding the maneuvering and close approach of an unfriendly satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start, especially with the increasing availability of both classified and unclassified threat assessments from the U.S. government, industry, and academia. Further, SSA and SDA data are strong candidates for enhanced sharing given the emphasis both countries place on these capabilities. The Japanese MOD, the JASDF, and JAXA maintain terrestrial SSA sensors and are developing an SDA satellite. The USSF is expanding its global space surveillance network (working with allies) and SDA satellites, and U.S. commercial SSA providers add capacity with shareable data and orbital analysis. The two nations are collaborating further on a USSF SDA payload to be hosted on a Japanese QZSS satellite, yet no concrete plans have been made to provide that SDA data to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clear area in which both parties bring data and information to the table that can increase collective capacity to identify unusual and unfriendly behaviors and attribute threats in the space environment. Such information sharing can also support both nations’ leadership efforts to reduce space threats through the promotion of principles and norms for responsible space activities. Further, because SSA is an essential capability for a majority of spacefaring nations, establishing a cooperative information-sharing mechanism can provide the building blocks for greater multilateral information sharing on space activities going forward, including between Japan, South Korea, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSA and SDA operations and operational data remain highly classified within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). It will be critical for U.S. policy officials, working with USSPACECOM, to update and streamline policy permissions for sharing such information and to accelerate the implementation of the DOD’s revised classification policy for space programs and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMPLEMENTARY INDUSTRIAL BASE STRENGTHS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both nations emphasize the importance of partnerships between U.S. and Japanese industry for delivering military space capabilities within relevant timeframes. However, there will be a natural tension between the countries as each will seek to expand its own industrial base and decide what it is willing to rely on the other for. Moreover, while Japanese industry is well versed in building exquisite scientific satellites for JAXA and contributing to civil missions, the contrasting scale and timeline shift for developing, producing, and fielding military systems is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is useful to consider the unique strengths maintained in each nation’s industrial base that lend themselves to collaborative efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas where timely action is particularly critical, the quickest pathway to a near-term, interoperable capability may be for Japan to acquire space systems from U.S. aerospace and defense companies that maintain an institutional and operational knowledge base that may be impossible to scale from scratch. But a strict “buy American” approach does not meet Tokyo’s policy objectives of security and industrialization that would help it strengthen its industrial base and attract talent. Likewise, a Japanese domestic-only approach in which U.S. industry does not see benefit or expanded market access is equally unproductive, especially as Japan seeks to speed up its technical and operational proficiency in developing and utilizing military space systems. Therefore, it is useful to consider the unique strengths maintained in each nation’s industrial base that lend themselves to collaborative efforts that enhance the alliance’s overall deterrence and defense posture in addition to meeting industrial development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strength across U.S. industry is its institutional knowledge of military space systems, particularly from its aerospace and defense primes, which have been designing, building, and operating military satellite systems for decades. U.S. industry brings experience in systems integration of large satellite constellations and in constructing the ground infrastructure necessary for data processing, analysis, and connectivity with users on militarily relevant timelines. In some areas, such as LEO intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and communications satellites, U.S. industry has scaled up manufacturing capacity with hot production lines. Sharing lessons learned from past projects and providing systems integration and ground architecture expertise may prove invaluable as Japanese industry takes on large national security space constellations with pressure to deliver in a short time span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry holds a particular strength in satellite components, with proven hardware in areas such as transponders, amplifiers, optical links, and solar arrays. These components, built by Japanese companies such as MELCO and NEC, are used in hundreds of satellites from dozens of nations around the world. As the United States seeks to increase supply chain resiliency, it should look to these Japanese component providers as part of its broader trusted supplier base. Further, Japan has long maintained strength in certain cutting-edge technology areas, such as robotics and advanced manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector. There are best practices to be drawn from these sectors and applied to both Japanese and U.S. satellite production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the commercial services front, both nations have long-standing commercial SATCOM operators, such as Sky Perfect JSAT and Viasat, that are being joined by a new crop of commercial space companies. Bolstered by private capital, these companies are providing data, analytic products, and services in areas like Earth observation, space situational awareness, SATCOM, and in-space servicing. They offer capabilities that can be integrated into each country’s space architectures, providing shareable data and additional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 report on trends in start-up space investments by U.S. analytics firm BryceTech, roughly 50 percent of all investors in start-up space companies since 2000 were from the United States (43 percent) and Japan (7 percent). BryceTech further noted that “participation from international investors has been increasing since 2018, primarily in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.” Such capital, including reciprocal investments in each nations’ space sectors, can boost the development of the commercial space capabilities and services described above to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Japan’s Space Strategy Fund has the potential to strengthen Japan’s broader space and technology ecosystem so that it can more substantially contribute to the space security needs of both countries. Ideally, the fund would focus not only on big ticket hardware like space launch vehicles, but also on stimulating Japanese start-ups, advancing dual-use technologies, and developing space data analytic tools and services that can support the MOD’s objectives, as well as encouraging Japanese firms that are beneficiaries of the fund to partner with U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. and Japanese start-ups are one source of innovation and disruption within the space ecosystem, government agencies are also introducing disruptive acquisition approaches and business models to traditional space acquisition programs. As the developer, acquirer, and operator of the next-generation Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), the U.S. Space Development Agency — along with its industry partners — is well equipped to share insights on acquisition best practices, the development of open source and modular components, and spiral development methods to incrementally deliver new capabilities over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while it may be expedient to focus on partnering constructs within the space ecosystem, what each country needs most from the other may not be space specific. For example, while Japan may be best served by U.S. industry aiding in the system integration of its military satellite constellations, the United States may be best served leveraging Japanese industry for overseas ship repair and maintenance, or mass production of drones and munitions, given Japan’s strengths in advanced robotics and manufacturing. Expanded thinking on industrial base cooperation and broader “win-win” approaches that leverage each nation’s complementary strengths should be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;architecting-national-security-space-constellations&quot;&gt;Architecting National Security Space Constellations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its Space Security Initiative, Japan for the first time presents a road map for a multifaceted space security architecture with constellations of satellites performing missile detection and tracking, information collection, communications, positioning and navigation, and space domain awareness, supported by a suite of space launch vehicles. Meanwhile, the United States is in the midst of major changes to its national security space architecture, prioritizing mission assurance through diverse, resilient space architectures that includes greater investment in proliferated missile warning and missile tracking (MW/MT); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; communications constellations of smaller, less exquisite satellites; and space protection and space control capabilities. Both countries emphasize that government systems and commercial services, including new areas of space commercialization, will be needed to implement these strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington and Tokyo appreciate that their alliance and partnerships provide them with an asymmetric advantage and that their cooperations “broaden the number of systems collectively available for space operations, both on orbit and on the ground; strengthen resilience; expand our options for diplomatic and military responses; and complicate an adversary’s decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both approaches are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors. However, despite increased funding for space in both countries, delivering on these plans will be challenged over the long term by resource availability, industrial capacity, and labor accessibility in highly technical fields. Japanese experts emphasize that they need U.S. partners, as Japanese industry lacks sufficient human resources and would be hard-pressed to deliver space capabilities at the scale and timelines needed. While the United States brings deep experience in military space systems development and operations, it also seeks additional capacity for resiliency and filling gaps and new ways to share the burden. Moreover, as the U.S. approach transitions to proliferated architectures, there will be opportunities to create new concepts of operations, different technology development and production arrangements, and new partnering constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors considered numerous ideas on architecture cooperation across different space mission areas, informed by discussions, briefings, and workshops with U.S. and Japanese government and industry representatives. Several of those will be discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all areas described in the SSI could be candidates for greater bilateral cooperation, missile detection and missile tracking, tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting capabilities, protected SATCOM, and SDA stand out because of the urgency to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027 described in Japan’s strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MISSILE DETECTION AND TRACKING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding missile arsenals of North Korea and China, including advanced ballistic and cruise missiles and HGVs, have made space-based missile detection and tracking one of the more pressing areas of need for the United States and Japan. This led leaders from both countries to commit, in April 2024, to pursue “bilateral collaboration on a Low Earth Orbit detection and tracking constellation for missiles such as hypersonic glide vehicles, including potential collaboration with U.S. industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, a shift in approach is underway toward a proliferated MW/MT architecture with satellites in multiple orbits to increase resilience against growing space threats that also takes advantage of commercially derived components and practices. The U.S. Space Force, through its Space Development Agency, is building out hundreds of satellites in LEO through the PWSA; the USSF and MDA are building medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites, and the USSF is replacing its GEO and high Earth orbit space-based infrared systems through a next-generation overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5cSdScn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Popular Orbit Regimes.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Aerospace Security Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan aims to develop a sovereign capability and, while there is interest in LEO collaboration, it has not yet coalesced on an overall architectural approach. To date, Tokyo has relied on missile warning data shared from U.S. space-based infrared systems and defense support program missile warning satellites in GEO and high Earth orbit and its own ground-based radars. Some in Japan question the need for a global architecture and instead argue that regional needs can be met with GEO systems that provide persistence and sensors that can monitor the region. Japanese industry has proficiency in building large satellite buses that could be integrated with an OPIR payload for GEO operations. Others argue that LEO or MEO add complementary capacity and increase resiliency, with opportunities to build numerous smaller satellites and supply satellite components over time with more regular technology refreshes. Regardless of the approach, such an architecture is a significant, long-term resource investment. At this point, it is important not to foreclose options, but policymakers, program officers, and political leaders must make decisions on requirements in short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this backdrop, the authors offer a few ways to think about cooperation going forward. Building and operating a space-based missile detection and tracking architecture is new for the MOD and SDF, their acquisition organizations, and the industrial base. Phased approaches that enable Japan to better learn the military mission and new target set (e.g., HGVs) to inform its overall requirements and to build technical and operational proficiency over time came up repeatedly in workshops and discussions led by the authors. It was also argued that, of all space mission areas for U.S. industry to heavily engage in, missile detection and tracking is particularly symbiotic. It is one of the few technology areas that Japan’s industrial base has not yet developed, and it cannot be acquired through commercial services. Further, it is an area in which the United States is planning to field hundreds of satellites in a global constellation and is a natural extension of the already close missile defense relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the MOD and the U.S. Space Development Agency centered on the tracking and transport capabilities of the PWSA LEO architecture offers an attractive pathway for such phased collaboration and contributes to greater overall resiliency. With its planned architecture of smaller, less expensive satellites numbering in the hundreds, PWSA provides an incremental approach for Japan to learn the mission and to scale its small- to mid-sized satellite development and production (building “reps and sets”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described herein are several recommendations specific to missile detection and tracking cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near term, a PWSA ground station could be deployed in Japan and PWSA data shared with Japan. Building off the current early warning data-sharing model, this would allow both Japanese and U.S. users to gain familiarity with PWSA tracking data; build experience processing, analyzing, and fusing it with other missile early warning data; and provide feedback on the data quality, latency, and connectivity needed to support decisionmaking and missile defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near term, a joint technology and production demonstration program could be pursued for missile detection and tracking and transport layer satellites. This would give both industrial bases opportunities to explore different partnering arrangements while also building Japanese industrial capacity. For example, Japanese optical communications payloads could be integrated into transport satellites, and coproduction or licensed production arrangements could be explored for both transport and tracking layer satellites. Both constructs could fit within the Space Development Agency’s “future capabilities initiative,” in which incremental improvements can be on-ramped into future tranches of PWSA capability. Japanese optical communications payloads should be interoperable by design with PWSA optical communications, which are open source.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a joint technology development program could also include a coordinated test campaign and sharing of test data, especially involving performance against HGVs. Japan could participate in U.S. PWSA testing activities and, likewise, the United States could take part in Japan’s testing scheme as it flies its own military infrared (IR) payload demonstration on a future HTV-X mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the mid to long term, Japan could scale up its domestic industrial capacity and technical proficiency to build a sovereign operational constellation that is informed by a clearer understanding of mission needs and is complementary to and interoperable with the U.S. PWSA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If timely fielding of an operational capability is the driving need, Japan could lean heavily on U.S. industry early on, taking advantage of active satellite production lines and minimizing time for design and development. As Japan builds experiential knowledge and domestic production capacity, this dependency would wane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan decides to pursue a GEO architecture, industry options such as a Japanese satellite bus paired with a Japanese or U.S. OPIR payload could be examined. For example, Japan has funded plans to fly a military IR payload demonstration on a future HTV-X launch that could be a candidate. While the payload is likely to be highly capable, U.S. experience shows that such new design and development efforts are complex, costly, and take time. While satellite interoperability between U.S. and Japanese systems will be harder with two different designs, opportunities for fusing data in ground stations from GEO and LEO systems could be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be emphasized that partnerships beyond satellite constellations are important in this mission area. For missile detection and tracking — a mission that must operate on militarily relevant timelines — the ground architecture, data processing and analysis, and connectivity to missile defense systems can oftentimes be more challenging than satellite development and will demand equal attention. There is just as much opportunity to forge industry partnerships in ground station processing, advanced analytics, battle management, and command and control functions as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is just as much opportunity to forge industry partnerships in ground station processing, advanced analytics, battle management, and command and control functions as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, RECONNAISSANCE, AND TARGETING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI describes the need to “advance target detection and tracking capabilities” for Japan’s standoff defense capability and maritime domain awareness. This includes better understanding the surrounding terrestrial, maritime, and air operational environments, building an intelligence picture of threats, and providing indications that the threat has changed. Further, Tokyo’s standoff counterstrike systems will require real-time targeting information provided by intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various Japanese representatives shared that the government plans to invest in a constellation of dozens of electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites that would provide ISRT capabilities in day, night, and all-weather conditions. These systems would also play a role in detecting and tracking missiles prior to launch, such as tracking adversary mobile missile movements in and out of garrison, mapping missile-related facilities, and building patterns of activity among missile units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of ISRT, Japan has a strong sovereign foundation on which to build. The Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center, working with Japanese heavy industry, has built and operated EO and SAR satellites as part of its IGS constellation for over two decades, with plans to further expand the constellation. Japan’s domestic commercial remote sensing industry is emerging, with both mainstays and start-ups building commercial imagery satellites, especially in SAR, and aiming to sell data products as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry and the Japanese government have a strong pedigree in this mission area. They also have a long history of working closely with U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. space companies providing commercial imagery. Therefore, cooperation efforts should focus on adding capacity and resiliency to the alliance, engaging in ISRT data sharing, building greater analytic and multi-intelligence insights, and gearing the overall architecture toward supporting military requirements and delivering actionable information on operationally relevant timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors identified key partnership areas across ISRT, which are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries see benefits in the greater adoption of commercial satellite data and analytic services to support traditional military missions as well as to enhance maritime domain awareness, support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, and track global trends and environmental changes. The MOD is likely to increase its FY 2025 budget for the acquisition of commercial imagery, and the U.S. Space Force has begun leveraging commercial data sources. This is an important trend to continue, not just to support national security priorities and decisionmaking but also to strengthen the global competitiveness of both countries’ commercial space sectors, which are facing increasing competition from Chinese competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Japanese industry has experience building EO and SAR satellites, a demand for scale and the timely fielding of systems will necessitate partnerships that abide by Tokyo’s “security and industrialization” policy while also leveraging U.S. industrial scale and systems integration expertise. Such partnering arrangements could include coproduction and license production agreements between U.S. and Japanese space companies and the acquisition of commercial EO and SAR data or dedicated access to commercial satellite constellations. In the longer term, Japan could scale up its domestic industrial capacity to sustain this constellation on its own. In order to better collaborate, U.S. firms — and the U.S. government — would benefit from a greater understanding about Japan’s general architecture envisioned for an ISRT constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISRT is another mission area in which collaboration will need to be fostered beyond satellites, with a commensurate focus on ground systems, data processing, and analysis, as well as interoperability across those ground systems. This includes developing a ground architecture and processes for tasking, collecting, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data from the EO/SAR constellation. Further, the volume of data from a large ISRT constellation will be immense; there will not be enough human analysts in Japan or the United States to scrutinize each image for military intelligence value. Partnerships that emphasize data processing, automation, and the development of advanced analytic tools, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, can be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable one of its priority mission areas, counterstrike, the JASDF recognizes that it will need to improve proficiency in military intelligence analysis and target development, such as the targeting of “vessels and landing forces.” The Bilateral Intelligence Analysis Cell, established in November 2022, aims to do just that, with Japanese and U.S. analysts at Yokota Air Base jointly analyzing video feeds from remotely piloted aircraft. It could be expanded to incorporate space-based remote sensing data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors were encouraged to explore ways that data sharing between CSICE and the MOD and SDF could be increased, as Japan’s defense and intelligence institutions remain highly stovepiped. The authors note that this remains a perennial challenge within the United States as well — how to ensure that the intelligence community supports both national decisionmakers and warfighters. The private sector can be a pathway for breaking down stovepipes. One additional area of collaboration across U.S. and Japanese companies could be demonstrating the fusion of multiple sources of information — not just EO and SAR, but also radiofrequency signals collection, hyperspectral imagery, and open-source intelligence. Industry, and particularly start-ups, are not beholden to the same stovepipes that governments are. They may be able to make greater progress on demonstrating the higher-value intelligence insights gained from multi-intelligence concepts of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE DOMAIN AWARENESS AND COUNTERSPACE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have advanced capabilities in tracking and monitoring space objects and debris. They are increasing their SDA investments as threats to space capabilities grow and the domain becomes more congested. SDA is already an area of active partnerships across both governments and industries. As described earlier, a 2020 agreement between the U.S. Space Force and Japan’s Office of National Space Policy led to two U.S. SDA payloads being hosted on Japan’s QZSS satellites (which have not yet launched). Industry partnerships are also being cemented, such as the agreement Northrop Grumman and IHI Aerospace struck in March 2023 to build small maneuverable satellites and other capabilities to enhance SDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier section of this analysis described opportunities to enhance data sharing to improve the accuracy and coverage of space object tracking, reducing the risk of collisions and enhancing overall space traffic management. Described here are areas of cooperation centered on SDA capabilities and infrastructure and joint initiatives focused on debris mitigation and removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, Japan is not bound to decades-old space object tracking systems and catalog systems. Japan has an opportunity to take a clean-sheet approach to building a common operating picture of the space domain by leapfrogging ahead: leveraging state-of-the-art commercial technology and fusing space surveillance data from both the Japanese and U.S. government and commercial sources, including data from JAXA ground optical telescopes and radars and commercial data (e.g., LeoLabs, Slingshot, and COMSPOC). Further, such a capability could support government and commercial satellite operators alike, providing detections of close approaches by other satellites, building patterns of activity by unusual or unfriendly objects in space, and analyzing the risk of satellite collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other hosted payload concepts in addition to the USSF SDA-QZSS partnership could be explored. Beyond the IHI-Northrop Grumman partnership to develop a joint SDA capability, other Japanese and U.S. companies are studying concepts that would integrate SDA payloads onto next-generation SATCOM systems and provide them to governments as a service. The recent announcement that the QZSS constellation will expand to 11 satellites provides an opportunity for further hosted SDA payloads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries could also consider coordinated operations between their SDA satellites — including Japan’s SDA satellites, the first of which is planned for launch in 2026 — and U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites. Such coordinated operations would aid in training, add capacity, and reduce the duplication of target coverage. Japanese scholars raised the idea of SDA satellites and U.S. GSSAP satellites “operating in coordination,” particularly once Japan’s second SDA satellite is fielded, as it is anticipated to have increased “mobility and imaging capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan is a leader in developing technologies for debris removal, including active debris removal with technologies such as laser ablation, while the United States has extensive experience in space operations. Joint demonstrations and missions could validate active debris removal technologies while also advancing new operational concepts for debris mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both governments should also explore options to cooperate on space protection and build a baseline understanding of how each side views counterspace capabilities, although the topic and any capabilities will be highly sensitive. The JSOG possesses equipment to detect satellite jamming that will be useful for government and commercial operators alike as electronic attack weapons become more proliferated. Japan’s NDS also lays the groundwork for the development of capabilities “necessary to disrupt or neutralize the opponent’s use of space.” For example, as part of efforts to secure its use of the electromagnetic spectrum, Tokyo allocated funds in its FY 2024 budget for communication and radar jamming capabilities. While further counterspace activities are likely to be highly classified by each country — and have long been treated as such in the United States — a general discussion on basic concepts, capabilities, and scenarios would be helpful to understand how each side thinks about the mission area and, importantly, to avoid miscalculations. The recent U.S. DOD push to lower classification barriers for certain space capabilities, along with Japan’s membership in Combined Space Operations, provides an opening to overcome foreign disclosure barriers to sharing information with Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROTECTED SATCOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilient satellite communications are also an area of emphasis in both countries. The United States has long operated a range of military SATCOM systems, complemented by commercial GEO, and is increasingly leveraging LEO broadband networks, with Starlink being the most prominent. Japan also has a long pedigree in satellite communications, leveraging Sky Perfect JSAT to develop and operate a network of GEO satellites for military use. Japan’s SSI outlines plans for a multilayered and redundant SATCOM network across GEO and LEO orbits, with government and commercial systems meeting growing demands for connectivity across Japanese forces and weapons systems. While SATCOM cooperation between Japan and the United States is already underway and Japan has established a line of effort dedicated to commercial LEO broadband, government officials have expressed particular interest in partnering on protected SATCOM that can provide secure anti-jamming and anti-spoofing connectivity, especially as adversaries increasingly employ electronic warfare systems and tactics. On the Japanese side, its Joint Staff C4 Systems Department (J6) is leading protected SATCOM investment efforts, while on the U.S. side, the Space Force’s Space Systems Command (SSC) is leading the acquisition of protected tactical SATCOM capabilities across satellites, ground infrastructure, modems, and user terminals. Partnerships in the area of protected SATCOM could be explored in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, as part of the U.S. SSC protected tactical SATCOM program, SSC is funding a project to deliver protected tactical waveforms over commercial and international GEO and MEO commercial satellite constellations used by the U.S. military and coalition forces. This is an area in which Japanese SATCOM operators could be a partner to SSC in providing platforms for the maturation of this capability. Japan would then be in a prime position to scale this across its fleet of SATCOM assets used for security purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Japan refines its acquisition approach for a protected SATCOM system, one model to consider is the approach recently taken by Australia to develop a sovereign military SATCOM capability. The government of Australia required bidding teams to comprise a prime contractor with extensive military SATCOM experience and several Australian businesses. Such an approach could even lead to greater interoperability across U.S., Japanese, and Australian SATCOM systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Japan fields SATCOM capabilities with optical communications payloads, opportunities exist for cross linking between communications networks, especially if both sides can align on common optical interface standards. Japanese government and industry representatives expressed particular interest in connectivity between Japanese space assets and the PWSA transport layer, creating even greater resiliency and multipath options for data delivery to users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investing-in-digital-transformation&quot;&gt;Investing in Digital Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is essential to maintaining a battlefield edge, creating greater mission effectiveness through data accessibility and connectivity across users and resilience and security in the face of threats to IT infrastructure and communications networks. The U.S. Department of Defense is implementing a cloud strategy and making investments in capabilities such as the Air Force and Space Force’s Cloud One. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has long invested in a cloud-based architecture known as the IC Cloud that enables users to log into a desktop from any IC location and access mission-related information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar digital transformation is underway in Japan, with senior leaders discussing how a government cloud network can enable information collaboration, crisis response, and increased operational efficiencies across the government. Tokyo is attuned to the importance of digital resilience and continuity of operations, having experienced natural disasters affecting critical infrastructure such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant and seeing Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian satellite and ground networks. With regard to the latter, Ukraine’s successful migration of government and banking data to a cloud storage system in the initial days of Russia’s invasion proved crucial to the continuity of Ukrainian government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, national security leaders in both countries recognize that the private sector leads in cloud storage, computing, and security, and they benefit by adopting these commercial services. Neither government can match the scale, speed, performance, and agility of commercial technology companies or their investment in digital infrastructure. These companies invest billions of dollars per year in cybersecurity alone, continuously improving their networks and cloud infrastructure while under constant cyberattack. Microsoft, for example, cites 1.5 million attempts a day to compromise its systems and invests roughly $1 billion annually in cloud security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Neither government can match the scale, speed, performance, and agility of commercial technology companies or their investment in digital infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral space agenda would be well served by including a digital transformation and cybersecurity component: an area that is not exclusive to space but would enable the sharing of sensitive mission data and operational information. Japanese partnerships with U.S. digital infrastructure companies could be particularly valuable, with companies such as Amazon Web Services planning to invest ¥2.26 trillion ($15.4 billion) to expand its Japanese cloud infrastructure by 2027 and Microsoft investing $2.9 billion in Japan on AI and cloud infrastructure, workforce training, and a research lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging these investments, the MOD and the JSOG could identify their expanding space architecture, including space operations, command and control (C2), and space domain awareness data, as early candidates for migration to the cloud. This interest was conveyed to the authors in conversations with Japanese space operators who recognize the benefits of cloud for greater connectivity, data management, and network security. U.S. officials emphasized that information security is essential to expanding data sharing given the sensitivity of space technology, operations, and increasing cyber threats to satellite networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compatible digital infrastructures with common interface standards would provide the technical foundation to facilitate greater connectivity and data exchanges between U.S. and Japanese networks. Working from similar digital infrastructures creates more direct opportunities to share cybersecurity best practices and also creates a more accessible and fulsome data environment for both countries to exploit using AI tools and other innovative applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD is also modernizing the information-sharing networks it uses for international partners to securely access, process, and analyze sensitive mission data and to deliver insights to users. For example, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) is accelerating the development of the INDOPACOM Mission Network, which is built off of the DOD’s larger Mission Partner Environment program to share information and enable a common operating picture with allies and partners. Another U.S. information sharing system, the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System program, provides connectivity for sharing military intelligence information. Not only should the DOD be encouraged to leverage commercial solutions, taking advantage of the benefits described earlier, but also to expand access points within the MOD and the JASDF, including the JSOG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leading-on-policy-and-in-international-forums&quot;&gt;Leading on Policy and in International Forums&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability has long been a theme in Japanese society and policy. Tokyo is well positioned to continue extending this theme into space as a leading voice on enhancing the sustainability of space. Both Japan and the United States, through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, developing responsible behaviors in space and reducing threats to the peaceful uses of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s actions bolster its standing in these areas. It has designated sustainability and resource management as clear priorities for space development. New space companies, such as Astroscale, have crafted business models around the removal of on-orbit debris and the disposal of spacecraft reaching their end of life. Others are developing remote sensing satellites to monitor climate change as well as the security environment. Tokyo is becoming a destination for important space symposia, including on the topic of space sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatically, Japan is increasingly exercising its voice on space security and sustainability issues. In April 2024, it joined with the United States to introduce a United Nations Security Council Resolution on Preventing Nuclear Weapons in Space, calling on nations to uphold their obligations under the Outer Space Treaty. This resolution was drafted in response to news that Russia may be developing a satellite with a nuclear device that would be indiscriminate in its destruction of satellites in orbit. In September 2022, Tokyo pledged not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent ASAT missile testing, working with the United States and other nations to promote international discussions on responsible behaviors in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should be seen as a regional leader on space security issues and as a partner of choice for countries in the region. In 2021, as part of the Quad, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States established a space working group to share space-based Earth observation data with one another and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific to build a collective understanding of climate change risks and support the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources. In 2023, Japan, South Korea, and the United States held a trilateral dialogue on space security focused on threats in the space domain, the responsible use of space, and national space strategies. Building off of Japan’s close bilateral defense partnerships with Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS), during Prime Minister Kishida’s official visit to Washington, D.C., in April 2024, it was announced that AUKUS partners “are considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also well situated to engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Several member countries see Japan as the most trusted major power in the region, China as a strategic partner, and the United States as often focused on pressuring countries to pick sides (the United States vs. China). Many of these nations seek to grow their nascent space programs and benefit from the use of space in areas such as Earth observation for maritime domain awareness and natural resource management. They also have a vested interest in preserving the safe, secure, and sustainable use of space. Working with Japan, they can add an important perspective to international discussions on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-persistent-challenges&quot;&gt;Addressing Persistent Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While opportunities abound for cooperation that can deliver material capabilities in support of national policy and security strategies, policymakers will still need to knock down barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-and-time-urgency&quot;&gt;Priorities and Time Urgency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be important for leaders from Japan and the United States to set clear priorities for their space partnership, harnessing each other’s strengths and building interoperable systems to add needed capacity and resiliency for both countries in a timely manner. While both countries have ambitious space architecture plans and have increased resources for space security development and utilization in the past few years, those resources will need to be prioritized and efficiently allocated. Clarity on when capabilities are needed to posture for regional threats will also be important to move their respective institutions and industries into action. Japanese defense strategy highlights the need to take primary responsibility for dealing with invasions by FY 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building satellites and their ground stations is a multiyear, resource-intensive effort. The timelines for when certain space capabilities are needed to keep pace with the threat will factor heavily into which architectural solutions are pursued and the phasing of those solutions. Fielding a capability in the near term will necessitate a reliance on more mature technologies and existing commercial services where spigots can be turned on. However, investments in longer-term research and development (R&amp;amp;D) efforts are necessary to ensure next-generation capabilities keep apace of the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-demand-signal&quot;&gt;Government Demand Signal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the opportunities for industrial partnerships that present themselves, both U.S. and Japanese industry would benefit from stronger signals and top cover from both governments when attempting to partner to support priority bilateral projects. Much of their reasoning ties to risk and technology export limitations. Several industry representatives conveyed that their companies limit substantial investments in satellite design, R&amp;amp;D, and facilitation unless they have high confidence in a market and customers. Thus, to encourage and support industry collaboration, both governments must create a demand signal and market for such cooperative endeavors, including for interoperability and integration across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not currently a government-to-government agreement for industry collaboration on space, although other mission areas have examples that the space relationship may be able to build on. Integrated Air and Missile Defense is one such example. In Integrated Air and Missile Defense, an agreement covers the U.S.-Japan missile defense relationship and provides guidance on cooperation, including information sharing and the codevelopment/coproduction of specific systems, among other items. Frameworks like this help make possible industry collaboration, such as the March 2024 agreement between the Missile Defense Agency and Japan’s MOD to codevelop a hypersonic missile defense capability. A similar agreement in space could guide industry prioritization of particular architectures, cooperation models, and information-sharing exchanges. The U.S. DOD and the MOD have a bilateral memorandum of understanding for research, development, test, and evaluation projects, an agreement that commits the nations to increasing opportunities for bilateral collaboration on defense-related emerging technologies. Although space is not mentioned as part of this agreement, this may be an initial avenue to explore space technologies that support defense capabilities such as missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there should be follow-through on publicly announced cooperation agreements. During the April 2024 state visit, the United States and Japan announced the negotiation of a Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA). A TSA would provide a framework for U.S. commercial space launch from Japan and opens further opportunities for space-related technology collaboration within industry. Accelerating the completion of negotiations on this TSA will show that both governments have the momentum to follow through with action on high-level talking points that will impact industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-sharing-policy&quot;&gt;Data Sharing Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. side, there is no comprehensive data exchange framework that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with their Japanese counterparts. Some U.S. government officials express frustration that such a framework may take years to develop, negotiate, and coordinate through administrative processes. Notably, many areas of current U.S.-Japan cooperation take place through idiosyncratic processes and bespoke agreements, not overarching frameworks. Therefore, the speediest way to enable cooperative efforts, such as missile detection and tracking data exchanges, is through a standalone bespoke agreement negotiated at the senior White House, DOD policy, and State Department levels with their Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas of cooperation being proposed — such as missile detection and tracking, SDA, and ISRT — involve sensitive technology, capabilities, and mission knowledge that largely fall under U.S. security classification controls, from controlled unclassified information up to higher classification levels. Thus, technical exchanges between U.S. and Japanese companies to explore specific partnership arrangements across satellite development, manufacturing, and architecture interoperability would be limited absent U.S. government clarity on technology transfer and data sharing. Such direction has been provided for other defense cooperation areas such as SM-3 missiles and Blackhawk helicopters, and both parties have instituted processes and practices to protect sensitive information. A similar approach could be adopted for space security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly significant challenge is the difference in cultures of security between the United States and Japan. This includes personnel, information, facility, and cybersecurity, among other areas of difference. The U.S. public and private sectors involved in national security have long-established policies and processes in place and a culture built around protecting sensitive information and advanced capabilities. Security clearances require an intensive look into the backgrounds of personnel employed in the national security ecosystem. However, in Japan security is established more on a case-by-case basis, looking at particular aspects of security for projects and evaluating specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now clear recognition across Japan’s government, industry, and academic community that security — cybersecurity, information security, personnel security, and facility security — is paramount to further U.S. space cooperation. Implementing security improvements, including recent steps by the Japanese government to institute private sector security clearances and extend classification protections to economic security information, are encouraging and should serve as foundations for getting closer to functional equivalency across several of these security areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. security experts across government and the private sector could offer training and share best practices. For example, in 2023, Japan’s MOD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency developed its first Defense Industrial Security Manual, with advisers from the U.S. Defense Technology Security Administration and the U.S. Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an acute awareness across the Japanese government and industry of their cyber vulnerabilities. Greater sharing of cyber threats and cyber best practices is the most immediate way to improve Japan’s network and cybersecurity. Partnerships with U.S. technology companies, especially in cloud security and cybersecurity, could also be particularly valuable in providing network resiliency and ensuring government continuity of operations. This would also benefit operational space elements, such as the JSOG, to inform their efforts to protect against cyber threats to their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;export-policies&quot;&gt;Export Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the U.S. interpretation of its commitments under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) hamper bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies that have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues. In December 2023, Tokyo revised its principles on the transfer of defense equipment and technology, which is expected to enable the greater export of military technologies and components. While a positive development that can further contribute to supply chain diversification and the defense of like-minded partners that are increasingly under threat, the impact of this policy shift for space-related technology exports is unclear. This policy revision demonstrates a significant shift in Japanese defense policy writ large, as well as a political motivation to support such shifts in a range of policy and strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterparts-and-interagency-communications&quot;&gt;Counterparts and Interagency Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Observing the U.S. space ecosystem, there are so many points of contact that it is hard to know even what organizations Japanese interlocutors should engage with. As noted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in a 2016 report, there are “approximately 60 stakeholder organizations” across U.S. national security space. Observing the Japanese space ecosystem, responsibility for space security capabilities is spread out across the government. For example, QZSS is with the Cabinet Office, missile detection and tracking with the MOD internal bureaus, SDA with the JASDF, SATCOM with Joint Staff J6, and ISRT with Japan Defense Intelligence Headquarters. Further, Japan’s defense and intelligence institutions remain highly stovepiped. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together the countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these bilateral and interagency interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured here is a summary of the recommendations for space security cooperation described throughout the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating human development:&lt;/strong&gt; Education and training is foundational to build greater space proficiency across Japan’s defense institutions and supporting industry. Partnerships between the MOD and JASDF and U.S. space institutions across government and academia could include enrollments in U.S. Space 100/200 and Defense Acquisition University courses. Partnerships with new space and technology start-up communities can expand the pipeline of “human resource” talent needed in both Japan’s and the United States’ space ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercising and training the Space Force and joint force:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should develop a greater understanding of how space capabilities contribute to the joint force, including terrestrial and maritime operations, by integrating a space component into bilateral and multilateral joint exercises and into routine service-specific and joint training. Within the military space community, participation in tabletop exercises and wargames, including multilateral space operations scenarios, as well as greater hands-on operational training, aid in understanding space threats, space operations, and decisionmaking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing data and information:&lt;/strong&gt; Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start, especially with the increasing availability of both classified and unclassified threat assessments from the U.S. government, U.S. industry, and academia. Further, SDA data sharing can be enhanced, including the sharing of data from U.S. payloads hosted on Japanese QZSS satellites. SDA information sharing is also an area to expand trilaterally, building on the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral information exchange model used for data sharing on North Korean missile launches. Updating U.S. policy permissions for data sharing and accelerating implementation of the U.S. DOD’s revised space classification guidance can quicken results and build momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasizing complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; In formulating partnerships, the United States and Japan should consider the unique and complementary strengths of each nation’s industrial base and not limit the partnerships to the space domain. For example, while U.S. industry is strong in the systems integration of military satellite constellations, ground architectures, and scaled-up satellite manufacturing capacity, Japanese industry is a global leader in satellite components, robotics, advanced manufacturing, and shipbuilding and repair. Both nations should look to each other as they seek to increase supply chain resiliency and seek investors to boost their space start-up ecosystems to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecting national security space constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries set out national security space architectures that are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors, with partnerships being a core tenet of each country’s approach. The areas of missile detection and tracking, ISRT, SDA, and SATCOM stand out because of the urgency to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027 as described in Japan’s strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile detection and tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; Updating U.S. policy permissions for data sharing and accelerating implementation of revised space classification guidance can quicken results and build momentum. A partnership between the MOD and the U.S. Space Development Agency centered on the tracking and transport capabilities of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture offers an attractive pathway for such phased collaboration and contributes to greater overall capability and resiliency. PWSA ground station deployment in Japan and data sharing, a joint technology and production demonstration program, the exchange of best practices on modular design and tranche-based acquisition and launch, and ground architecture partnerships offer ways to build collective industrial base capacity and overall mission proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should focus cooperation efforts on adding capacity and resiliency, building greater analytic and multi-intelligence insights, and gearing the overall ISRT architecture toward delivering actionable information on operationally relevant timelines. Another area to explore includes coproduction/license production agreements between U.S. and Japanese space companies and greater access to EO and SAR commercial data and analytic services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space domain awareness and counterspace:&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast to the U.S. challenge of modernizing legacy space traffic management and catalog systems, Japan has an opportunity to take a clean sheet approach to building a common operating picture of the space domain by leapfrogging ahead: leveraging state-of-the-art commercial technology and fusing space surveillance data from both the Japanese and the U.S. governments and commercial sources. The partners should also explore other hosted payload concepts beyond the USSF SDA-QZSS, consider coordinated operations between their SDA satellites, and explore options to cooperate on space protection. The United States and Japan should further leverage U.S. efforts to reform space program classification to hold in-depth discussions about counterspace concepts of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected SATCOM:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should be an early international partner in the U.S. SSC project to develop protected tactical waveforms over commercial and international communications satellites. Additionally, discussions on optical interface standards can inform Japan’s development of optical communications payloads, and the latter should grow the opportunities for cross linking between communications networks, creating greater resiliency and multipath options for data delivery to users.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in digital transformation and cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should include a digital transformation and cybersecurity component to the bilateral space agenda and encourage the MOD and the JSOG to designate their expanding space architecture, including space operations, C2, and SDA data, as an early candidate for migration to the cloud. This would also facilitate the greater sharing of sensitive mission data and operational information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading on policy and in international forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Both Japan and the United States, through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, developing responsible behaviors in space and reducing threats to the peaceful uses of space. Japan should be seen as a regional leader on space security issues and as a partner of choice — along with the United States — for countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges that can serve as barriers or limitations to such cooperative efforts will also need to be addressed in key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priorities and time urgency:&lt;/strong&gt; It will be important for leaders from both countries to set clear priorities for the space partnership, harnessing each other’s strengths and building interoperable systems to add needed capacity and resiliency in a timely manner. Clarity on when capabilities are needed to posture for regional threats will also be important to move their respective institutions and industries into action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government demand signal:&lt;/strong&gt; Both governments must provide clear signaling and direction to industry on specific areas of cooperation and assurance that barriers to cooperation will be addressed, particularly for large-scale bilateral projects on key mission areas like MW/MT and ISRT. Companies will limit investments in substantial satellite design, R&amp;amp;D, and facilitation, unless they have high confidence in a market and customers and that technology-sharing limitations will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing policy:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States lacks a comprehensive data exchange framework that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with its Japanese counterparts. The speediest way to enable cooperative efforts, such as missile detection and tracking data exchanges, is through a stand-alone agreement developed at senior government levels. This authority must operate on a tactically relevant timeline and not be hamstrung by legal reviews concerning the ownership of operational data, binding and nonbinding agreements, and other prosaic details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing policies and processes to protect sensitive information and advanced technologies, and inculcating them into organizational cultures, is paramount to further U.S. space cooperation. The security imperative encompasses personnel, information, facilities, and cybersecurity, among other areas, and is ripe for U.S. security experts to engage in training and share best practices across government and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. ITAR and interpretation of its MTCR commitments hamper bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies that have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterparts and interagency communications:&lt;/strong&gt; A consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together both countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these bilateral and interagency interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For the sake of national security, we will dramatically scale up the use of space systems and ensure the safe and stable utilization of the domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-japanese-prime-minister-kishida-fumio-june-2023&quot;&gt;– Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio, June 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is increasingly emphasized in the defense strategies of countries around the world — from global space powers such as the United States, China, and Russia to evolving space leaders such as Japan and France. Aggressive behavior from China and North Korea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have caused a shift in the way the Japanese government perceives defensive capabilities and the role space will play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new security emphasis in the space domain is significant, and its recent policies suggest greater Japanese activity in space security in the next five to ten years, spanning from homegrown technology and capability development to expanding international partnerships. Tokyo has an acute awareness of the economic benefits of space and space technology, but developing those capabilities and expanding industrial capacity will likely be a challenge, given the urgency of the need to field operational capabilities in the near to mid term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japan continues to strengthen its space capabilities, its immediate focus continues to be on its space launch sector. Notable milestones will be the success of the H3 and Epsilon S rockets, which aim to cement Japan’s leadership role in space launch, provide a competitive regional alternative to Chinese and Indian launch services, and — in the case of the H3 rocket — play a critical role in the Lunar Gateway program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Japan’s traditional heavy industry developing launch vehicles, new entrants are exploring robotics, on-orbit servicing, and remote sensing solutions that may further transform Japan’s space industry and keep it at the leading edge in certain space technology areas. Sustainability and resource management are two key pillars of Japanese society and policy and are priority areas for space development. Japanese companies are well positioned to develop space solutions to better understand the impacts of climate change and to remove on-orbit space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo will continue to seek ways to indigenously advance technology and bolster its domestic industrial base. This is to be expected, but it will also be challenging given the urgency of the security environment and the slow pace of development that has defined other areas of Japanese industry. Traditional Japanese space entities, such as JAXA and heavy industry, are expanding their scope from a smaller set of primarily scientific space systems supporting long-term civil missions to larger constellations with a defense and security mission focus. The MOD and SDF must develop new technical and operational expertise in space security to support these new and diversified activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan will actively expand the role of space capabilities in its security posture going forward. As emphasized in its national defense documents, launch, missile warning, SDA, information gathering, communications, and navigation are all space mission areas with growing defense and national security significance. The establishment of the Space Operations Group also signals a more active role by the SDF in Japan’s space enterprise and the continued integration of space capabilities into national security missions. However, while Tokyo is increasing its focus on space and increasing its space spending, its ambitions — especially in the build-out of its space architecture for national security — still surpass its budget. It will be crucial for Japanese policymakers to ensure that Japan’s investments into national security space are providing interoperable and secure capabilities that complement the alliance’s ability to achieve its objectives in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan intends to become an increasingly important voice on space in international forums, such as on the threats to the peaceful use of space and responsible behaviors in space, including sustainable use. Tokyo will also continue to be vocal in advocating for stronger and more resilient norms for the use of the space domain to counter adversary threats to the safety of the domain for all users globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Japanese alignment with the United States on regional threats, the growing role of space in national security, and Japan’s increased focus on security opens up greater cooperation opportunities beyond traditional civil space cooperation. However, this security focus will continue to come into tension with Japanese processes and cultural norms, and the two countries will need to continue to break down barriers to cooperation, such as aligning on security and technology protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both nations’ governments and industries alike have a multitude of space cooperation opportunities before them that will individually and collectively strengthen their overall national and economic security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　引述李家田供稱遭警暴　賴振邦沒作供故沒相關證供&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SNwSt5p.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周四（22日）在高等法院踏入第78天審訊，法官張慧玲第5天總結供詞及引導陪審團。就案中唯一作供被告李家田的證供，法官總結指，李供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，但由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪受審，僅女被告劉佩凝獲准保釋。（繪圖：Kensahung）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李家田供稱受襲用刑警否認&quot;&gt;官：李家田供稱受襲、用刑　警否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周三指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四續總結李的證供，覆述李供稱在警員上門時遭襲擊及施行水刑，指警員將配槍子彈取出，放在李的手心磨擦，自己在威逼利誘下作出招認。而有份拘捕李的警員作供時，則否認曾暴力對待李，又稱自見到李直至帶他到警署，一直與他在一起，沒有看到有人不當對待李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李稱選擇作供因信法庭畀到公義&quot;&gt;官：李稱選擇作供因信法庭「畀到公義」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官總結指，據李的說法，當警員入屋後，曾帶李家田入廁所，而警署警長馮保羅稱：「我宜家畀機會你，黃振強已經篤到你應一應，你肯講嘅話，我就淨係告你支槍，如果唔係你就好大鑊」；李回應「冇」，隨後被警方施行水刑，又一度被打腹部。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員又威嚇「同樣嘅情況都可以發生喺你阿媽身上」，李遂表示「支槍唔喺我度，喺鴻仔度。」李又指母親為菲律賓人，不諳粵語，而且自警方入屋後已再沒有見到同住的母親，他亦相當擔心母親的狀況，所以作出招認。隨後警方向他展示一些涉案人物的相片及向他介紹名字，著他記住，但他在錄影會面中則沒有完整覆述這些名字，只提到「強」及「乸乸地」的人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而李在作供時亦仔細講述了他在錄影會面中，甚麼內容屬實，又有哪一部分是虛構，應警方所需而作出的招認。例如李在會面中供稱曾把手槍保管在綠色袋中，李稱屬虛構。而李在非自願的情況下提供手機密碼。此外，李亦供稱一直相當害怕，但仍選擇出庭作供，因為「法庭係會畀到一個公義我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官賴振邦沒作供沒逼飲滴露等證供&quot;&gt;官：賴振邦沒作供　沒逼「飲滴露」等證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對第五被告賴振邦的案情，辯方曾經指出當警員到「3C 工作室」上門拘捕賴時，警員曾嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，並不斷罵他為「曱甴」，而作供警員則一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，賴行使權利沒有作供，故本案中沒有他被逼「飲滴露」等證供，而陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。而賴被捕後亦行使其權利保持緘默，陪審團不可因而對他有不利想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官應考慮賴是否涉案-tg-用戶再考慮串謀否&quot;&gt;官：應考慮賴是否涉案 TG 用戶　再考慮串謀否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指 Telegram 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」是賴振邦，而賴又曾在訊息介紹自己是 Bobby，而認罪被告彭軍壕口中的 Bobby 是賴。辯方則否認賴是用戶「接完紙鶴未？」及 Bobby。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方曾指，賴振邦的姐夫張堅順曾稱呼賴為「阿邦」，而非 Bobby。而法官引導時則指，家人以中文名字稱呼賴，是否等於他不是 Bobby，陪審團應以常理作判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪被告彭軍壕曾與 TG 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」聯絡，而辯方指「接完紙鶴未？」是另有其人，指彭為了減刑，而剪裁證供、生安白造。法官指，陪審團應考慮賴是否用戶「接完紙鶴未？」，警方檢獲的電話是否屬於賴，再考慮他是否串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又曾向警員指出，警署警長馮保羅曾帶隊，連同其他警員，在警署內見賴振邦，期間要求賴脫去衣物，只剩下內褲，著其在牆角踎低，有警員不斷喝罵他為「曱甴」等。而有份參與行動的警員則否認曾發生上述事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders are determined to prevent Taiwan’s permanent separation and eventually bring it under their control. Beijing’s growing use of its military to put pressure on Taiwan in recent years has stoked concerns that it may invade the island. Yet China has options other than invasion, one of which is a blockade designed to break the will of Taiwan’s people to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing’s goal is to punish Taiwan and demonstrate its ability to exert control over the island, China could conduct a quarantine, led by law enforcement forces rather than the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine would aim to demonstrate Beijing’s power — not severely cut off trade to Taiwan. While a quarantine would pose major challenges for Taiwan, it would not be sufficient to force Taiwan to make major concessions or unify with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would be the next rung up the escalation ladder. Unlike a quarantine, a blockade would be led by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and would involve kinetic acts of war against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would aim to cripple Taiwan by cutting off trade, especially imports of energy and other material needed to sustain Taiwan’s bustling economy and population of nearly 24 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China can inflict sufficient pain on the island for long enough, it could force Taiwan to the negotiating table or help China set the conditions for a successful invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of a blockade would hinge on Taiwan’s resilience and the scale of its response as well as the international political and economic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may also have to contend with direct military interventions. The United States and key allies like Japan have bases in the region that can project considerable power to oppose China’s forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Drawing on Chinese military writings, tabletop exercises, private consultations, and expert surveys, this report lays out China’s potential motivations for a blockade and maps out possible scenarios of how China could approach blockade operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-china-might-blockade-taiwan&quot;&gt;Why China Might Blockade Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military planners have long considered a blockade to be one of the main campaigns for which the PLA needs to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science of Campaigns, a textbook published in 2006 by China’s National Defense University, defines a “joint blockade campaign” (联合封锁战役) as “an offensive campaign that is implemented by Navy-, Air Force-, Second Artillery- and Army campaign large formations with the assistive concerted efforts of the armed police force and militia . . . to sever enemy economic and military connections with the outside world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Second Artillery was renamed the “Rocket Force” in 2015 as part of larger organizational reforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would aim to take advantage of Taiwan’s status as an island with limited natural resources. Taiwan is much more dependent on trade than other large economies. In 2022, Taiwan’s imports and exports amounted to 61 and 69 percent of its GDP, respectively. By comparison, China’s imports and exports were only 15 and 20 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zO86jBc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is particularly reliant on foreign energy supplies, importing about 97 percent of its energy. It also imports approximately 70 percent of its food, though it is self-sufficient in certain staples that could help sustain its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reportedly, Taiwan has less than two months of coal and natural gas reserves for electricity generation, six months of crude oil reserves, and six months of food stockpiles. In the most likely blockade scenarios, these stockpiles would be subject to Chinese bombardment, reducing Taiwan’s ability to resist. Making matters more challenging, a survey conducted by the CSIS China Power Project found that many experts believe China could sustain major military operations against Taiwan for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does not need to hermetically seal off Taiwan to achieve its goals. Curtailing trade into Taiwan by even 50 percent would prove detrimental for Taiwan, especially if Beijing stops all or most imports of oil, natural gas, and coal, which would eventually cause progressive failures in electric power distribution around the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uq7AjxE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a blockade would not be without its drawbacks for Beijing. There is no guarantee that a blockade alone will achieve Beijing’s goals. If Taiwan proves resilient, and if it receives assistance from the United States or others, China may find it impossible to force Taiwan’s capitulation without forcefully occupying the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, there are numerous factors at play that likely shape Chinese decisionmakers’ thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of a blockade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6EofWe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mixture of pluses and minuses shows that a blockade of Taiwan would be a serious gamble and would not guarantee China more success than an invasion. There is also the possibility that China would need to escalate a blockade into an invasion if Taiwan is not willing to capitulate or if the U.S. and other forces intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is important to distinguish the standalone “joint blockade campaign” detailed in this report — which is a campaign-level operation intended to achieve strategic objectives — from a blockade operation that is embedded within a broader invasion campaign. An embedded blockade would be short in duration and intended to help set the conditions for the amphibious invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in the near term, a blockade could be more appealing for Beijing. In a 2023 CSIS China Power Project survey of experts from the United States and Taiwan, a highly kinetic joint blockade was seen as more likely than an invasion in the next five years — though only by a small margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This likely reflects beliefs that China currently lacks the capability to successfully invade Taiwan, but this strategic calculus could shift as the PLA’s capabilities grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-china-could-implement-a-blockade&quot;&gt;How China Could Implement a Blockade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would be an unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex operational and logistic hurdles. Chinese decisionmakers would have to not only command joint military operations but also coordinate law enforcement and maritime militia forces to support the PLA. They would also need to prepare for war with Taiwan and the possibility of war with the United States and its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China is rapidly enhancing its capabilities, including the kinds of forces needed for a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint blockade operations would rely most heavily on six main types of PLA forces: naval surface and submarine fleets; air forces (including the PLA Air Force, Naval Aviation, and Army Aviation); conventional rocket forces; coastal and air defense forces; and support forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N6Wp0ud.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA writings emphasize that seizing the “three dominances” (三权) in key domains — information, maritime, and air — is crucial to executing a joint blockade campaign. China’s varying forces each play a role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile strikes could, therefore, play a pivotal role. PLA writings stress the importance of degrading key enemy capabilities like air and coastal defense batteries before widely deploying China’s forces close to Taiwan to enforce a blockade. China may also target key civilian targets to limit Taipei’s ability to govern and respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could instead launch a less kinetic blockade to try to reduce international backlash — as outlined in the second and third scenarios below. However, this would risk exposing China’s blockading forces to counterattacks and not putting enough pressure on Taiwan to achieve Beijing’s desired goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8E3LeoD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ “When organizing comprehensive firepower strikes, we should carefully select important military targets that have a significant impact on our blockade campaign and targets that substantially threaten our blockading forces. . . . Simultaneously . . . we should employ aviation units and submarines to conduct large-scale mine-laying operations against enemy ports and shipping lanes.” — Science of Campaigns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA would not be operating alone in executing a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese maritime law enforcement forces would play a key role. The China Coast Guard (CCG) is the largest coast guard in the world by number of oceangoing vessels. Once the PLA has established the “three dominances,” the CCG — with help from China’s civilian maritime law enforcement agency, the Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) — would help maintain and enforce the blockade by interdicting noncompliant ships. This is critical to allowing China to portray the blockade as a domestic law enforcement matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding out China’s blockading forces would be the maritime militia — a network of organized, trained, and armed personnel operating in fishing vessels and other civilian craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These militia would not engage in force-on-force operations, but they could fill gaps in China’s ISR and complicate Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness by swarming in certain areas. The militia could also potentially aid in logistics by ferrying limited amounts of equipment and personnel to PLA vessels supporting the blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could also receive support from partners like Russia. As China and Russia have grown closer in recent years, their militaries have conducted joint naval and aerial exercises in the Western Pacific and elsewhere. Russia may not intervene directly, but Beijing could request that Moscow take action to show support for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given the challenges China might have with beyond-visual-range target identification, a joint China-Russia military operation is likely to occur immediately before China blockades Taiwan or far from the main blockade areas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The scenarios outlined below are only three examples of potential blockade approaches. There are other conceivable scenarios. In each of these scenarios, Beijing assesses that it must use military force to either deter an outright shift toward independence or force Taiwan to accept unification.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;all-out-kinetic-blockade&quot;&gt;All-Out Kinetic Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario aligns most closely with PLA doctrinal writings and is believed by many U.S. analysts to be the most likely approach China might take if its goal is to use a blockade to force Taiwan to capitulate, negotiate on unification, or set the conditions for successful invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is predicated on the PLA establishing the “three dominances” (in the information, air, and maritime domains) to set the conditions for effectively imposing and sustaining a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDTZRzK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law, Beijing states that Taiwan has engaged in unacceptable moves toward independence and announces that the PLA and maritime law enforcement forces will conduct seven days of joint live-fire exercises around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement indicates that exercises will begin in 48 hours and take place in five air and maritime exclusion zones. The operations involve unprecedented levels of PLA activity, including aircraft and surface vessels encroaching into Taiwan’s claimed territorial waters and airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this visible activity, Chinese submarines covertly deploy sea mines at the entrances to six of Taiwan’s key ports and energy terminal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these mines are timed for activation and are not yet active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south, the PLA mines the entrance to the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s busiest and most important trade hub, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal, which is the island’s leading LNG importing terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the north, the PLA lays mines at the entrances to ports at Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, Su’ao, and Hualien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/P8s4gck.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day three of the exercises, as a separate operation, China and Russia hold a joint strategic aerial patrol over the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs notes that this is part of regular China-Russia patrols, but Chinese media commentators suggest that it is meant to deter Japan from intervening and to create concerns about Russian support for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FpH438f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day of exercises, China announces that in 48 hours the PLA will initiate “special law enforcement operations to punish Taiwan independence elements.” The original five exclusion zones are replaced by a single large maritime and air exclusion zone covering the entire island and Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The exclusion zone extends to the boundaries of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone to the north, east, and south. China could call it a “blockade zone” instead of “exclusion zone.” There are differences between the two. Calling it an exclusion zone may help to portray the operations as a domestic law enforcement activity, but Beijing would in principle need to differentiate between enemy military vessels (which are lawful targets) and neutral or enemy merchant vessels.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing warns that unauthorized vessels or aircraft entering the zone will be warned and then fired upon if they do not comply. Approved Chinese-owned commercial vessels are permitted to transit the strait and enter Chinese ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C6EgxO6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 48 hours later, China commences its “special law enforcement operations.” Beijing emphasizes the law enforcement elements to cast its actions as an internal affair in line with Chinese laws in the hopes that this will diminish international support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA announces that approaches to major Taiwan ports have been mined with smart munitions, which are now activated. Shipping insurance rates for the area surge, and shippers immediately halt traffic to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vafDHbQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the PLA Rocket Force, Air Force, and Navy launch joint firepower strikes against hundreds of targets, including Taiwan’s air and naval bases, coastal and air defense batteries, communication facilities, and military command and control infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/57Oc185.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA forces then strike Taiwan’s civilian ports and airfields and supporting transportation infrastructure. They also attack Taiwan’s energy import terminals, fuel storage facilities, and power grid to undermine the island’s ability to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oOIkCSx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA simultaneously cuts Taiwan’s undersea internet cables, incapacitates Taiwan’s communication satellites, and launches cyberattacks against government and commercial entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China could specifically target Taiwan’s financial institutions to create panic and confusion among Taiwan’s public.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These attacks aim to disrupt communications and internet access within Taiwan and sever the island’s connections with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nYVyrN3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Taiwan’s defensive capabilities are significantly degraded, China positions seven naval surface action groups (SAGs) around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each SAG comprises three to six ships — including destroyers, frigates, support vessels, and covertly deployed attack submarines — for a total of over 30 warships. The vessels remain 70 nautical miles from Taiwan’s coast to avoid attacks by Taiwan’s remaining shore-based anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA Navy also positions its Shandong aircraft carrier strike group southeast of Taiwan to launch sorties of J-15 fighters east of the island. The carrier’s presence is primarily aimed at deterring and combating Taiwan or U.S. Navy vessels attempting to convoy blockade-running ships into Taiwan from the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WaR85yd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China simultaneously deploys over two dozen law enforcement (CCG and MSA) vessels within the maritime exclusion zone to picket the approaches to Taiwan’s main ports. These could be accompanied by maritime militia vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fQ4wbvF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial large show of force, China scales down PLA deployments and relies more on shore-based anti-ship and anti-aircraft cruise missile batteries to enforce the blockade and deter intervention. This leaves China’s navy less exposed to counterattacks, but if the situation escalates, Beijing could redeploy forces to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCG and MSA remain largely deployed to enforce the blockade and portray China’s actions as a law enforcement operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after offensive operations begin, Beijing pauses kinetic strikes to offer an opportunity for negotiations and time for noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO). China offers to establish humanitarian corridors for Taiwan citizens to seek refuge on the mainland and says Chinese civilian airplanes and vessels would take part in the evacuation. These actions are aimed at weakening Taiwan’s internal cohesion and willingness to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Taiwan continues to resist after this initial pause, China periodically engages in more missile strikes to stop Taiwan’s military from reconstituting damaged equipment and deploying additional mobile weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is prepared to enforce the blockade for months but builds in subsequent pauses if Taiwan is willing to negotiate. Implementing a protracted blockade will require the PLA to periodically rotate personnel and equipment — a tall order for a military that last engaged in a war more than four decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of military operations, China engages in massive efforts to stir up pro-Beijing and other elements within Taiwan to advocate for negotiating with Beijing. This includes spreading false rumors, sabotaging counter-blockade efforts, and inciting unrest and public demonstrations against Taiwan’s government. Beijing could further elevate the status of a particular opposition leader or proxy in Taiwan and offer to negotiate with them instead of Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;mining-blockade&quot;&gt;Mining Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first blockade scenario is representative of the likeliest approach China may take, it is not the only plausible option. China can vary the level of forces it deploys and adjust its rules of engagement to manage escalation. This second scenario is a scaled-down version of the all-out kinetic blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the first scenario, China begins by announcing major live-fire exercises to take place in five air and maritime exclusion zones off Taiwan’s major ports. As part of the exercises, China’s rocket forces fire over a dozen ballistic missiles over and around Taiwan, but they splash down in the water rather than hitting targets in Taiwan. This is intended to intimidate Taiwan and international shipping companies and deter other countries from intervening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the exercises, PLA submarines covertly lay sea mines at the entrances of Taiwan’s major ports. The mines are timed to activate later to coincide with the start of blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five days of exercises, the PLA announces the start of “special law enforcement operations” and releases the coordinates for an air and maritime exclusion zone around Taiwan. Whereas in scenario one the zone covered the entire Taiwan Strait, in this scaled-back scenario, the zone only covers the eastern half of the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N1oqpwX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the PLA does not conduct joint firepower strikes against targets in Taiwan. However, PLA cyber forces conduct non-kinetic attacks to disrupt military and civilian communication systems and internet access and to disable energy and transportation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enforce the blockade, the PLA Navy positions seven SAGs around Taiwan, and Beijing announces that mines have been laid near the entrances of key ports. China also deploys approximately 20 law enforcement vessels around Taiwan throughout the maritime exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of maritime militia vessels are also positioned alongside law enforcement ships to provide ISR and swarm vessels attempting to enter the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vtZzVR4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial ships are to be engaged by law enforcement and maritime militia vessels unless only PLA Navy ships are in range, and they are to first try nonlethal measures such as ramming and spraying water cannons. Taiwan navy vessels are to be engaged by PLA forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enforce the no-fly zone, the PLA regularly flies aircraft around Taiwan. Since Taiwan’s air defense capabilities are still intact, the PLA relies more heavily on unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Chinese forces are ordered to not strike first, but they are authorized to return fire if they are attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has advantages and disadvantages compared to the all-out kinetic scenario. By not cutting off the entire strait, Beijing would aim to allow commercial traffic to continue transiting, which may reduce the economic fallout for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would also seek to avoid U.S. intervention since a partial blockage of the Taiwan Strait does not significantly impact international trade and is less likely to be seen by the United States and many other countries as violating international customary laws on freedom of navigation and overflight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not launching joint firepower strikes against targets in Taiwan and by maintaining more strict rules of engagement, Beijing may hope to avoid rapid escalation of the conflict and reduce the willingness of the United States and other countries to intervene. However, failing to degrade Taiwan’s defensive capabilities and the island’s energy infrastructure will leave China’s air and maritime forces exposed to counterattacks and leave Taiwan with a greater ability to withstand Chinese pressure for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Taiwan escalates significantly, Beijing could intensify its own approach and evolve operations to resemble the all-out kinetic blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-blockade&quot;&gt;Limited Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final blockade scenario is largely consistent with the second scenario but lacks mining. It is the least kinetic and escalatory of the three scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the second scenario, China stages large-scale drills around Taiwan, including live firing of ballistic missiles that splash down in the waters near Taiwan. Beijing then announces the start of “special law enforcement operations” and publishes the coordinates for a maritime and air exclusion zone that covers the main island of Taiwan but does not cut off the entire Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys air, maritime, cyber, and other forces in much the same way as in scenario two, and they operate under the same rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r1AghJf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference from scenario two is the lack of mining. Mines serve to deter vessels from attempting to run the blockade, and they offer a more passive means for the PLA to threaten noncompliant ships. Without mines, China’s forces will need to play a more active role in stopping entry into Taiwan and may therefore be put in more situations in which commanders have to make decisions about exactly how to engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach could have potential upsides. This limited blockade is easier to implement since covert minelaying can be difficult — especially in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait. This limited blockade is also more reversible. Mines typically cannot be easily removed or deactivated, meaning that once the mines are laid China is committed to its approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By avoiding the use of mines and kinetic attacks against Taiwan, Beijing would seek to control potential escalation spirals between the PLA and Taiwan’s forces. More broadly, by taking this approach, Beijing would seek to demonstrate restraint to the international community, which could lend China’s actions greater credibility among countries seeking to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is the least likely of the three. The lack of kinetic operations and mining leaves the PLA highly exposed to escalation by Taiwan or interventions by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5VwjmCG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three scenarios are intended only to offer three illustrative ways China could blockade Taiwan. Of these three scenarios, the all-out kinetic blockade is the more plausible one and most in line with Chinese military doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that China could pair a blockade with other kinetic military operations. For example, Beijing could combine a blockade of the main island of Taiwan with a seizure of one or more outlying islands administrated by Taiwan, such as Kinmen or Matsu near China, the Penghus near Taiwan, or Pratas in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would cut off Taiwan’s ability to reinforce and defend these islands, and seizing an island could provide Beijing a “win” even if the blockade does not lead to Taipei’s capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of a Chinese blockade depends on many factors. Taiwan’s resilience and willingness to defend itself and the extent to which Washington and its allies intervene are critical. How well prepared the PLA is and how Beijing controls its frontline forces and manages escalation are important not only to a successful blockade but also to ensure that a blockade does not unintentionally escalate into an invasion or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its current military capabilities, some in Beijing may assess that a blockade carries a higher chance of operational success than an invasion in the near term. Yet Chinese decisionmakers likely recognize that a blockade would be an immensely risky choice with no guarantee of success.&lt;/p&gt;

This report outlines key policy recommendations aimed at strengthening this alliance, enhancing coordination, and ensuring a robust and unified approach to countering threats and preserving peace in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intensifying military activities in and around the Taiwan Strait, economic coercion tactics against Taiwan, and aggressive rhetoric about compelling reunification have increased anxiety in Taiwan, across the region, and around the world. These actions increase the prospect of a conflict over Taiwan, either a full-scale Chinese invasion or aggression that falls in the “gray zone” below the threshold of military force. Additionally, an annual report by the U.S. intelligence community suggests that Beijing is aiming to have its military prepared for decisive action to absorb Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, countries are concerned by increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait, but worries are particularly acute in the Indo-Pacific region. That concern does not always translate into concrete action, however, and countries across the region have different calculations on how best to promote stability in the Taiwan Strait and the degree to which direct engagement on the issue serves their national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the United States, Japan, and Australia stand as the anchors of regional stability. And yet, despite the combined power that the three countries bring to the table and the common interests they share in cross-strait stability, the discussion among Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra about preventing and responding to a crisis remains underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As concern about Beijing’s military modernization has intensified in recent years — along with China’s maritime pressure in the East China Sea — the United States and Japan have deepened dialogue on issues related to China. The reality of Japan’s close geographic proximity to Taiwan — a fact brought home by China’s military exercises around the island in August 2022, which included ballistic missile launches that landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone — has prompted the two governments to expand bilateral planning related to a Taiwan contingency. Although still politically sensitive, the openness with which Japanese officials discuss responses to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait today stands in sharp contrast with a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of Taiwan issues in official channels with Australia are more limited. Concern about the threat posed by China to Australia’s interests closer to home has driven significant change in Australia’s defense posture, to include its commitment to the AUKUS initiatives and a new national defense strategy intended to address the “most challenging strategic environment since the Second World War.” Nevertheless, focus in Australia on cross-strait stability, and Australia’s potential role in a crisis, remains more limited than in Japan. Given the critical role that both Japan and Australia would play in a crisis — economically, diplomatically, and even militarily — improving trilateral coordination related to Taiwan should be a strategic priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help drive a focused discussion among these three critical allies on preserving cross-strait stability, the CSIS Australia Chair, in partnership with the CSIS Japan Chair, brought together 22 leading American, Japanese, and Australian strategic thinkers for two days of Track 2 discussions in Canberra in March 2024. The result was a rich dialogue on current dynamics in cross-strait affairs; the strategic interests at stake in cross-strait stability for the three allies; and opportunities to deepen cooperation on the economic, diplomatic, and military fronts, with the goal of promoting cross-strait stability. The group engaged in a vigorous debate on how to best respond to increased Chinese gray zone coercion and to reinforce deterrence against a potential Chinese use of force to compel unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts emerged from the two-day conference. Participants in the three countries broadly agreed that they should deepen direct links with Taiwan, both in government and in civil society, deliberately expanding beyond long-standing constraints on official ties; this engagement should include support for Taiwan’s efforts to expand its role in international organizations. Participants also broadly agreed on the need to develop an economic resilience agenda for Taiwan, to limit its vulnerability to Chinese economic coercion by diversifying trade and supply chain links outside of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On questions of military deterrence, views were more mixed. Some participants advocated for a focused trilateral discussion on sustaining deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, including a division of labor that maximizes the effectiveness of capabilities each country brings to the table. Some Australian participants noted that the national conversation in this area lagged behind that of others; while certain types of trilateral initiatives might provide a useful mechanism to do more, in some areas individual governments need a more proactive list of ways to engage Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the dialogue, CSIS asked each participant to draft a short response to the following question: Given the enormous stakes involved, what more can be done by individual countries and by groupings of like-minded nations to preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait? An expansive question, it was hoped, would generate thoughtful, creative, and novel ideas. This report is the product of those discussions, organized as a compilation of policy recommendations put forward by the individual contributors in the following essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-for-further-chinese-economic-coercion-against-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Potential for Further Chinese Economic Coercion against Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By James Carouso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Tzu famously said, “In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. . . . Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” Chinese president Xi Jinping might be expected to follow this doctrine to realize his goal of bringing Taiwan under China’s control for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s practice of using gray zone tactics to achieve its territorial objectives has been largely successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Killing fellow ethnic Han, who compose more than 90 percent of both China’s and Taiwan’s populations, in a Taiwan conflict would tarnish the achievement of a reunified China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Chinese soldiers are only children, meaning their parents have no other offspring. Their deaths could have a severe social backlash, especially if the fighting is drawn out and does not go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuilding a destroyed country, especially while fighting an insurgency, would be an expensive and morally draining enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China does not use military force, other powers would be reluctant to fire the first shot or intervene militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A likely strategy for Xi to achieve Taiwan’s surrender of its sovereignty would be through economic strangulation. Xi could announce that any nation that trades with Taiwan would have its exports to China subject to high tariffs, if not outright bans. Moreover, bilateral China-Taiwan trade could end (China accounts for about 25 percent of Taiwan’s total trade and takes 22.6 percent of Taiwan’s exports). In 2010, China cut off exports of rare-earth metals to Japan after a boating collision. Chinese exports of critical minerals could once again be used as a means to coerce third nations into inaction. Harassment of shipping and air traffic could cause associated insurance premiums to reach unsupportable levels, or insurance could become unobtainable if China boycotts shippers and insurance carriers that continue to do business with Taiwan. Chinese air and naval incursions across the Taiwan Strait median line and naval activity to the east of Taiwan seem designed to remind the world that China could quickly end global transport links with the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One indicator of China’s willingness to apply economic coercion to Taiwan without using kinetic acts or a formal blockade occurred in December 2023, a month before Taiwan’s elections, when China suddenly announced that Taiwan had put up trade barriers in contravention of both World Trade Organization rules and its 2010 trade deal. China’s Ministry of Commerce added that these barriers have had a “negative impact” on Chinese companies, implying that China was considering retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan government and key private sector companies have recognized Taiwan’s economic vulnerability and have taken some actions to mitigate the risks. Tsai Ing-wen, following her election as president in 2016, instituted the New Southbound Policy to promote trade and investment with Indo-Pacific nations, besides China. The value of trade with all of these countries increased from $96 billion in 2016 to $180 billion in 2022, and investment flows rose from $2.4 billion in 2016 to $5.3 billion in 2022. In 2022, Taiwan’s investment in these countries combined made up about 35 percent of its total investment abroad, outstripping investment in China for the first time. Nevertheless, China remains Taiwan’s largest single trade partner and stock of outward foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has no intention to economically decouple from China, seeking stability in its bilateral relations. But further diversification of trade and investment would be welcome. Like-minded countries could accelerate this process by agreeing to multilateral trade agreements that include Taiwan. The multilateral approach would reduce China’s ability to retaliate as well as tie Taiwan more broadly into the ex-China global supply chain. The terms of any such agreement would have to include lowering trade barriers and therefore would go beyond the May 2023 trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, just after U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, China suspended imports of more than 2,000 Taiwanese food products. It banned Taiwanese pineapples, beer, grouper, pomelos, and other goods heavily dependent on the Chinese market. While these goods made up less than 2 percent of Taiwan’s total trade with China, the political intent was clear, especially as it coincided with increased incursions by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft into Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Taiwan’s government launched campaigns such as #FreedomPineapple asking friendly countries like Japan to import more Taiwanese farm products whenever China imposes a new ban. To prevent similar acts of coercion in the future, like-minded countries should go further and agree on a standby arrangement to lift any trade barriers to Taiwanese goods targeted by China. In addition, they could agree to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to a percentage equivalent to the impact on Taiwan’s exports. A trip wire of this sort would put the onus on China not to weaponize trade with Taiwan unless it is willing to also suffer economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, like-minded nations should continue efforts to insulate themselves from dependence on China for goods critical to national economic security and defense. Efforts to establish more semiconductor foundries outside of Taiwan are useful in worst-case scenarios, but these new foundries still depend on some inputs from China. For example, China began restricting exports of gallium and germanium in July 2023 (it produces 80 percent of the world’s gallium and 60 percent of germanium). Both minerals are essential for production of high-end semiconductors, solar panels, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, China has historically restricted rare-earth exports, though it accounts for more than 90 percent of global production of rare-earth elements. These necessary components are used in more than 200 products across a wide range of applications, especially high-tech consumer products such as cell phones, hard drives, electric and hybrid vehicles, and flat-screen monitors and televisions. Significant defense applications include electronic displays, guidance systems, lasers, and radar and sonar systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various programs are underway to produce these elements outside of China and stockpile them in the interim, China’s manipulation of market prices severely hampers these programs. Like-minded nations need to work together to achieve economies of scale, long-term take-or-pay arrangements with non-Chinese sources, and joint stockpiling agreements to increase security of supply and reduce overall carrying costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that China can use economic means to achieve its ends in Taiwan even if it means a hit to China’s economy. Taiwan and its friends must work together to identify their economic vulnerabilities to China and coordinate to limit the impact of potential Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-japan-and-australia-should-bolster-taiwans-economic-resilience&quot;&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia Should Bolster Taiwan’s Economic Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Bonnie S. Glaser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasing military threat to Taiwan has prompted the United States and some U.S. allies to sharpen their focus on strengthening deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. Efforts to bolster deterrence include transforming U.S. force posture in the Indo-Pacific to make it more resilient, mobile, distributed, and lethal, as well as helping Taiwan’s military acquire and train with weapons to support a porcupine strategy to deter China from blockading or invading the island. The United States and Japan are enhancing Taiwan Strait deterrence through various actions, such as a plan to enable small detachments of marines to deploy to the Nansei island chain and a decision to equip a U.S. Marine Corps regiment in Okinawa with antiship missiles that can target People’s Liberation Army Navy ships. Numerous U.S. allies have contributed to deterrence by stating publicly that their countries have a stake in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intensified attention by the United States and its allies to shore up military capabilities to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is necessary and welcome, but an effective strategy to maintain cross-strait peace and stability must also include stronger economic support for Taiwan. Although Taiwan’s economic development has been relatively stable over the last decade, with growth rates averaging 3.2 percent between 2012 and 2022, the island faces growing risks due to overreliance on the Chinese market and relatively weak connections with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Taiwan’s dependence on China has declined in the past few years. Its peak reliance was in 2020, when almost 44 percent of Taiwan’s exports went to mainland China and Hong Kong, while the United States had a 15 percent share. As a result of China’s economic slowdown and an increase in U.S. and European demand for semiconductor chips and other information and communications technology (ICT) products, Taiwan’s exports to China dropped to 35 percent of the total in 2023, the lowest share in 21 years. Meanwhile, the combined shares of exports to the United States, Europe, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries increased by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news, however, is that Taiwan is still highly vulnerable. China remains the island’s largest export market and most important trading partner while at the same time posing an immense and growing threat to Taiwan’s security. Beijing is already beginning to ramp up economic coercion as part of its strategy of using gray zone tactics to strangle Taiwan. If Chinese leader Xi Jinping concludes that “possibilities for a peaceful reunification have been completely exhausted,” justifying the use of “non-peaceful means” (the language of Article 8 of the PRC’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law), it could shut down a substantial portion of Taiwan’s trade flows and paralyze key sectors of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, intensifying strategic tensions between China and the West, as well as China’s stagnating economy, make Taiwan’s reliance on China for economic growth no longer viable. Economic diversification is essential to secure sustainable, modest economic growth in the future. Robust economic support for Taiwan’s economy must therefore be part of a strategy the United States and its allies pursue to enhance Taiwan’s resilience. Concrete steps should be taken to support Taipei’s efforts to foster secure supply chains and negotiate agreements that encourage trade diversification. In 2023, Taiwan was the fourth-, seventh-, and ninth-largest trading partner of Japan, Australia, and the United States, respectively. All three countries should prioritize negotiations with Taiwan on economic and trade issues, with the goal of eventually signing bilateral free-trade agreements (BFTAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden should do its utmost to complete the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on Twenty-First Century Trade this year. Whoever wins the U.S. presidential election should build on that achievement by launching negotiations to sign a BFTA, which has bipartisan congressional support. Canberra should resume talks with Taiwan aimed at a BFTA, which it suspended in 2017 due to pressure from Beijing and fear of retribution. Japan signed an investment accord with Taiwan in 2011, but its close economic relationship with China as well as Taiwan’s ban on food imports from five Japanese prefectures affected by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident have inhibited discussion of a BFTA with Taipei. The latter obstacle was removed in February 2022 when Taipei lifted the import restrictions. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, Taiwan has the right to conclude trade agreements with other WTO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to bolster Taiwan’s economic security should also include efforts to expand Taipei’s regional economic interactions. Both Taiwan and the PRC have applied for membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Although the trade pact’s consensus-based accession process poses hurdles to Taiwan’s membership, Tokyo and Canberra should encourage other members to base their positions on approving new members on their readiness and willingness to meet CPTPP criteria. Taiwan’s inclusion would enhance economic security and supply chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific and enable Taiwan to boost exports to CPTPP member countries. Japan has already expressed strong support for Taiwan’s application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra could also join forces to respond directly to China’s intensifying use of economic coercion against Taiwan. For example, they could offer preferential access to their markets for products targeted by Chinese sanctions and support Taiwanese businesses targeted by Chinese pressure through purchase commitments and export credits. In addition, Japan and Australia could strengthen dialogue with Taiwan, either bilaterally or multilaterally alongside the United States, on digital trade, supply chains, international standards setting, critical infrastructure, and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan would still be consistent with the One China policies of the United States, Japan, and Australia. Nevertheless, to reduce PRC concerns, all three allies should explain their intentions to Beijing and reiterate that they will adhere to their respective One China policies and their commitments not to support Taiwan’s independence. Increased economic engagement is essential if like-minded democracies hope to strengthen Taiwan’s resilience and preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-the-economy-of-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Securing the Economy of the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Erin Murphy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economic security is as important as any military component in a potential Taiwan Strait crisis. Such a conflict would result in mutually assured economic destruction for both China and Taiwan and devastating consequences for the global economy. Economic security in the strait could be strengthened by further engaging Taiwan economically — both through expansion of its semiconductor and high-value electronics industries and involvement in regional trading blocs — and demonstrating to regional partners and key countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) the impact of a strait crisis on their markets. These steps provide more outlets for Taiwan to weather China’s coercive tactics, build more resilient supply chains, and offer more leverage for outside actors to convince both China and Taiwan to pursue peaceful measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan occupies an important place in the global economy, especially for economies in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, accounting for 22.6 percent of total trade in 2022, followed by the United States at 13.3 percent, Japan at 9.7 percent, Hong Kong at 7.3 percent, and South Korea at 6.2 percent. In 2016, Taiwan launched its New Southbound Policy to enhance cooperation in the region, which partially contributed to Taiwan’s business investments in ASEAN exceeding its investments in China for the first time in 2021. Between January and October 2021, Taiwan invested $5.3 billion in ASEAN, most of it funneled to Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, the highest proportion of overall investment in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese companies manufacture close to 70 percent of the world’s semiconductors and approximately 90 percent of the most advanced chips. For example, semiconductors account for a sizable portion of Taiwan’s cumulative $8.9 billion investment in Singapore, led by companies such as United Microelectronics Corporation. In addition, Taiwan plays an outsized role in electronics manufacturing, with its most notable companies, TSMC and Foxconn, providing manufacturing services for leading electronics manufacturers such as, but not limited to, Apple, Dell, Nvidia, and HP. In 2020, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics firm, invested $270 million in Vietnam to produce tablets and laptops, expanding its investment by another $80 million in 2021. The company also invested $350 million in its Indian subsidiary for iPhone production. Moreover, Taiwan is the fifth-largest exporter of machine tools, the primary manufacturer for bicycle brands such as Giant, Merida, and Peloton, and a significant textile and apparel manufacturer, producing products and garments for brands such as Adidas, Lululemon, Nike, and Under Armour. Taiwan is also home to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of Taiwan’s economy to the global supply chain makes the prospect of a conflict in the strait more daunting. A Rhodium Group assessment concluded that a blockade in the strait without international responses or second-order effects could result in a loss of $2 trillion to the global economy. Trade and investments globally would be affected. A full-on military conflict would be even more devastating, ensuring a collapse of the chips industry and disruption of critical supply chains from China and Taiwan. Countries would be forced to choose to side with China or risk coercive measures from it if in noncompliance with China’s demands. In addition to the real economic consequences, the lives of 23 million Taiwanese and foreign workers would be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability in the strait may be strengthened by expanding participation in regional trade agreements and frameworks. Economic ties between the United States and Taiwan have strengthened with the advent of bilateral dialogues, development finance collaboration, the 2021 launching of the U.S.-Taiwan Technology Trade and Investment Collaboration supporting cooperation on critical supply chains, and most recently the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, which was signed into law in August 2023. The initiative is the first major trade agreement approved by Congress and the administration under President Joe Biden that includes specific trade facilitation parameters to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States and Taiwan. This agreement could serve as an example of how governments could navigate tricky political waters and find ways to engage Taiwan economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engagement on trade and deeper economic integration could be extended to other multilateral agreements as well, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Both Taiwan and China have applied for membership to the CPTPP to join countries from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Although there are serious political considerations regarding Taiwan’s membership, CPTPP members should also weigh the consequences of letting in China without Taiwan and the impact on stability in the strait. CPTPP members could also consider a loose affiliation in terms of economic engagement with the Taiwanese economy, particularly on issues such as digital trade and critical supply chains, in which Taiwan has demonstrated experience as a trusted partner and willing participant. Engagement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, of which Taiwan is a member, is one model for members to work together to address critical economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also behooves regional allies and like-minded partners to work together when it comes to Chinese economic coercion. The risk of coercive measures from China will certainly rise along with tensions in the strait. While Taiwan has borne the brunt of China’s threats and coercive tactics, China’s measures, including import bans, critical minerals export bans, and other economic threats, have also affected Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. Countries can work together to identify potential targets for coercion and strategies to address punitive measures. Further economic engagement among regional partners could help mitigate the harmful effects of coercion, leading to new markets for products banned by China — such as fruit, wine, and seafood — or finding substitute products should China cease exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, must consider how a conflict could affect them. It is not necessarily a question of choosing sides but how their economies and overseas workers would be directly affected. A conflict in the strait would have a direct impact on their economies, especially as China is one of their largest trading partners and engagement would be severely disrupted. ASEAN should consider urging a peaceful resolution or maintaining the status quo to maintain its members’ stability and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic interdependence has not prevented wars in the past, as evidenced more than once in Europe. But it can cause actors to think twice. A conflict between Taiwan and China would not be limited to their borders and would immediately affect the globe. The United States, its partners and allies, and countries in the Indo-Pacific should find ways to ensure economic stability in the strait, which will contribute toward maintaining the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underscoring-the-costs-of-aggression-and-benefits-of-restraint-in-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Underscoring the Costs of Aggression and Benefits of Restraint in the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By David Shullman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait is widely understood. A Taiwan crisis could lead to catastrophic conflict and a global economic meltdown. With Chinese leader Xi Jinping seemingly more impatient than his predecessors to unify with Taiwan and rapidly developing People’s Liberation Army (PLA) capabilities to compel unification by force if necessary, the United States and its allies must enhance deterrence and prevent China from taking more aggressive actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the deterrence debate remains confined to a limited set of options primarily revolving around the use of military force. Given the circumstances, more creativity is needed to devise an extended menu of means to enhance deterrence on both sides of the cost-benefit ledger to affect Xi’s decision to use force regarding Taiwan. This means considering actions that may offend both advocates of hard-line positions on China and those who abjure exploiting the insecurities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, more must be done to expand the benefits China expects from restraint. CCP leaders define China’s claim over Taiwan as central to the legitimacy of regime rule. U.S. diplomatic statements and stepped-up engagement with Taiwan in recent years have eroded Beijing’s sense that eventual unification is possible absent the use of force. Washington and its allies must reassure Beijing that, should China refrain from using force, the United States will remain committed to the One China policy, will oppose Taiwan declaring independence, will support resumed cross-strait dialogue, and will not establish a formal defense alliance with Taiwan. If Chinese leaders are convinced that inaction forecloses the possibility of unification, they will not remain invested in restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine commitment to these long-held U.S. positions, frequently communicated privately and publicly to Beijing and U.S. allies in the region, helps expand options for U.S. and allied messaging on the other side of the ledger — the potential costs for Beijing of aggressive moves such as invasion or a military blockade. Options for deterring aggressive Chinese action against Taiwan fall into two broad categories: deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. Deterrence-by-denial strategies are designed to deter action by making China’s objectives toward Taiwan militarily infeasible. Deterrence-by-punishment strategies involve threats to raise the cost of aggression, even if that aggression is successful. Included in this category is the promise of intolerable military and economic retaliation in response to China’s use of force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punishment strategies, however, are inherently less reliable than denial strategies, which offer the stark promise of blocking China from achieving its objectives through overwhelming military capabilities. For punishment strategies to work, they must convince China of allied willingness and resolve to impose punishments and follow through on threats after China has initiated aggression and possibly made significant gains. This fact is particularly important at a time when China’s risk tolerance is growing and deterrence is eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for the United States and its allies, therefore, is cobbling together enough convincing potential punitive actions across domains — primarily the military domain but also the diplomatic and economic domains — to alter the cost-benefit analysis for Xi such that he would reconsider using force against Taiwan. This is particularly challenging given that Xi is already aware of many of the risks and would use force only if it is worth the expected costs of preventing an intolerable outcome — for example, Taiwan declaring independence or a gradual shift in the military balance that renders China unable to compel unification in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shifting balance of military power in China’s favor suggests that additional types of costs are required to enhance deterrence. Some argue that China already understands the potential costs of a Taiwan conflict and therefore nothing can increase the collective deterrent value of potential punishment. But this is incorrect: more can be done to exploit the CCP’s deepest insecurities regarding its internal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is ultimately a “political proposition,” as Stephen Kotkin puts it. Any combination of punitive measures that deters China from aggression against Taiwan succeeds primarily because they prompt fear of economic instability and thus political costs for Xi and the CCP. If deterrence by punishment requires signaling to Xi credible political costs greater than the benefits of an action, then there is value in capitalizing on Xi’s worst fears regarding internal threats to the regime’s legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi needs little convincing about the general risks of internal dissatisfaction and regime insecurity — a subject that consumes much of his attention — or the idea that failure to achieve victory in a military invasion of Taiwan could produce these results. Nor does Xi doubt that his enemies would exploit these vulnerabilities. But he has probably given less attention to the massive economic challenges that would result from Chinese aggression against Taiwan and could compound instability. While Xi probably judges that other countries’ economic interdependence with China may deter them from intervening in a Taiwan crisis, it is not clear he views the economic costs to China itself as an additional reason not to initiate conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. or allied messages of concern that Chinese use of force against Taiwan would prompt economic instability in China could heighten Xi’s unease along these lines, potentially enhancing deterrence. The goal would not be to threaten Chinese leaders but to convey legitimate concerns about the impact of potential Chinese aggression on both regional and Chinese stability. Beijing would naturally reject any such U.S. message as wrongheaded and unwelcome interference in domestic affairs, but that is beside the point. Consistent messaging could enhance deterrence by indirectly amplifying Xi and other leaders’ already potent concerns that the CCP’s enemies will exploit internal instability in the event of anything less than total victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges and risks of incorporating messaging about internal instability resulting from aggression into a deterrent approach would be significant. First, the United States would need to be clear it has no interest in exacerbating China’s instability, which, if extreme, could produce catastrophic results for the Chinese people, the global economy, and U.S.-China relations. This being true in peacetime and during potential conflict, Washington would need to be clear that it would never view Chinese regime destabilization as a war aim. Instead, U.S. messaging would have to underscore concerns that economic crisis and political instability would be a natural consequence of China’s initiation of conflict. Washington would also need to clarify these aims with key Indo-Pacific allies, whose partnership is critical to maintaining stability in the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, the United States and others would have to carefully consider how to raise the salience of domestic instability with Chinese interlocutors. A combination of private conversations with Chinese officials and increased nonofficial public messaging on the subject would be a good start. In addition to conversations allied officials should have with their Chinese counterparts about the potential for conflict over Taiwan to spiral and ultimately lead to a broader war, Washington, and possibly allied governments, could also privately communicate growing concern about the impact of a war on China’s internal situation. Nongovernment researchers could dedicate more attention to the costs of conflict to China’s economy and governance capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added emphasis on the potential internal costs for destabilizing actions in the strait would, of course, be effective only as part of the array of other measures the United States and its allies must take to enhance deterrence. Further buildup of military capabilities to dissuade China from believing it might achieve a swift and painless victory will remain central. The United States and allies must continue to support Taiwan’s defensive “porcupine strategy” and ensure the island can hold out, potentially until U.S. arrival, and China must understand that threats of nuclear use will not dissuade Washington from intervening in a Taiwan crisis. Greater allied coherence on punitive economic and military responses to potential Chinese aggression is also essential. Beijing must be convinced it will face not just U.S. military power but also Japanese and Australian power — an impression that should regularly be underscored through joint military exercises and force posture decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Beijing’s calculus shifting and U.S. regional military dominance no longer tenable, a more robust punitive arsenal of consequences flowing from China’s use of force against Taiwan is required. Washington should be willing both to tolerate the bilateral tension of raising with Chinese interlocutors the internal costs of using force in the Taiwan Strait and to reaffirm long-standing U.S. positions that reassure Beijing that military aggression is unnecessary. Deterrence will be enhanced by guiding Xi toward a course defined by faith in the rewards of restraint and greater concern that aggression may put the CCP’s vital interests at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jennifer Hong Whetsell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During just two weeks in February 2024, 124 aircraft and 74 navy vessels belonging to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were detected around Taiwan. Of those, 47 crossed the median line, entering Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Through such actions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under General Secretary Xi Jinping is attempting to erode the rule of law and threaten Taiwan’s vibrant democracy. To achieve his goal of “reunification,” Xi has intensified gray zone activities in the Taiwan Strait and expanded China’s military, which now rivals that of the United States in terms of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s increasing coercion across the Taiwan Strait, Russia’s unprovoked war with Ukraine, the potential for the war in Gaza to escalate into a regional conflict, and the deepening relationship between North Korea and Russia, the United States and its allies must explore all avenues to uphold stability in the Indo-Pacific, preventing authoritarian actors from further degrading global peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-deterrence-through-space&quot;&gt;Enhancing Deterrence through Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of scientific, economic, and technological opportunities in the space domain has sparked fierce global competition to launch more spacecraft, proliferate more orbits, have more lunar landings, and generally outperform others in this increasingly promising field. Unfortunately, these endeavors are not all peaceful. Space has become increasingly militarized due to the absence of international safeguards and worsening global tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 15, the White House confirmed that Russia developed a counter-offensive satellite weapon that can disrupt military and civilian communications and harm other space assets if detonated, leading to severe disruptions in space and on Earth. China is also planning a record 100 orbital launches for 2024. Seventy of these launches will collectively send more than 290 spacecraft into orbit, each potentially carrying payloads of advanced satellites with surveillance and other military and intelligence capabilities. In addition to its continued proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, China launched a classified military satellite into geostationary orbit on February 23, raising alarm among U.S. officials. With recent launches and more on the horizon, China will have persistent visual and radar surveillance over strategically important areas throughout the Indo-Pacific. In this aggressive space race, ensuring national security and resiliency requires the ability to monitor activities on the ground from space; augmented Earth-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and uninterrupted access to communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies recognize the importance of the space domain for national security and global stability, as exemplified in recent joint statements. Nonetheless, space cooperation remains nascent. Through collaboration in space, the United States, Japan, and Australia can inhibit the expansionist ambitions of Xi, Russian president Vladimir Putin, and, to an extent, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while establishing rules and norms for space operations and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen cooperation in this critical domain, Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra need to ensure the three capitals are aligned in their goals and objectives for the space domain, and through the strengthened cooperation, enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FULLY LEVERAGE EACH NATION’S STRENGTHS BY SYNERGIZING THEIR SPACE ASSETS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long been at the forefront of space technology, boasting robust national and commercial infrastructure, extensive experience, and a storied history of successes. It has launched numerous satellites into orbit for both military and civilian purposes. Today, the U.S. government is focused on establishing “mega constellations” for resilient and redundant communications and improving its command and control capabilities by leveraging space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also a formidable player in the space domain. Recent milestones include its launch of the H3 space rocket and its successful landing of a lunar mission, making it the fifth nation to accomplish this feat. These achievements are particularly noteworthy given Japan’s relatively small budget compared to that of other space-faring nations. Furthermore, Japan’s involvement in space war games, including the Schriever Wargame and other space-based military exercises, sets it apart as one of the few Asian nations to have engaged in such activities. Japan has been training alongside the United States and other allied partners for more than a decade to achieve interoperability for conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Australia does not possess robust military or commercial space assets, compared to the United States and other space-faring nations, its geographic location and vast real estate represent unique strategic assets within the space ecosystem. Australia holds tremendous potential for becoming an instrumental Southern Hemisphere launch site for its missions and those of its allies. Located near the equator, Australia’s northern regions offer a distinct advantage for launching larger payloads into LEO at a more affordable cost. This is due to the Earth’s rotation, which allows rockets to harness additional energy, achieve greater launch velocity, and carry larger payloads more efficiently. Additionally, unlike the United States, Japan, and many other space-faring nations, Australia’s vast uninhabited land provides an opportunity for establishing inland launch facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ technical know-how and experience, Japan’s advanced technological assets and well-trained personnel, and Australia’s valuable real estate and increased access to orbital belts can be collectively leveraged to enhance the effectiveness of each nation’s respective space assets. Through such synergistic collaboration, the three partners can more effectively counter the ambitions of Beijing and Moscow for space dominance, thereby improving stability both in space and on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESTABLISH RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND PROMOTE SPACE SUSTAINABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instability in space is exacerbated by congested orbital belts, overcrowded with debris and satellites, as well as a lack of rules and regulations governing the space domain. The United States has promoted norms for responsible operation in space through multilateral and international platforms, both new (e.g., Artemis Accords, antisatellite test bans) and existing (e.g., UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space). It has been successful in aligning with like-minded nations, such as Japan and Australia. However, Beijing and Moscow have sought to counter such efforts by forming their own regional blocs and advancing destabilizing norms in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other like-minded nations, the United States, Japan, and Australia can advance more clearly defined rules of engagement for space, establish enforcement mechanisms, and promote space sustainability. The current dearth of norms and rules of engagement implicitly sanctions Beijing and Moscow to continue engaging in dangerous and irresponsible behaviors in space. However, by collaborating to preserve space for responsible use and operations, the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded nations can deter Beijing and Moscow from employing space assets and technologies that threaten peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps-strengthening-deterrence-from-space&quot;&gt;Next Steps: Strengthening Deterrence from Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia should expand cooperation in the space domain to strengthen deterrence and uphold stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific by considering the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to elevate the topic of space and norm setting within bilateral and multilateral dialogues and exercises, shaping the space environment to be operated with peace and sustainability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue specific cooperative efforts in such areas as sharing data, improving space domain awareness, and cross-training military and intelligence personnel. Continue to elevate space domain exercises with each other and invite other like-minded partners to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest more in domestic space infrastructure, including constructing ISR-capable satellites, developing capabilities that facilitate interoperability, and promoting technological advancements in the commercial space sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decrease barriers to cooperation between the three nations by reviewing and amending technology transfer regulations and classification levels in the areas that would benefit from enhanced cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation in the space domain is complex because alignment of key factors, such as technical capability and capacity, trust in intent and practice, and sharing of common threat pictures, is crucial to continuity and success. Today, due to differing priorities, the United States, Japan, and Australia share many, but not all, of these factors. However, given the current threats in the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific, as well as the advancing capabilities of actors whose motivations are not always clear or good, the three countries cannot afford to delay proactive cooperation in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;japanese-perspectives&quot;&gt;Japanese Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-xi-jinpings-expanding-domestic-governance&quot;&gt;Countering Xi Jinping’s Expanding Domestic Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Masuo Chisako&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, China has been engaged in a massive, unprecedented military buildup. When discussing the risks surrounding Taiwan, China’s neighbors and Western countries tend to focus on China’s military threat. Unlike under the presidency of Hu Jintao, however, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has shown little sign of involvement in Beijing’s foreign policy in recent years. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping has consolidated political control over the PLA, he does not trust it and purged many of its high commanders in 2023. Since the PLA has turned into a “difficult” organ for Xi to use, he is unlikely to invade Taiwan by force in the immediate future. Instead, he might seek “unification” of Taiwan through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s centralization of power has considerably changed the nature of Chinese policymaking. Simply put, the regime is increasingly inclined to deal with international problems in the same manner as it does domestic ones. Xi’s decisionmaking team has relied heavily on the staffs that belong to the chain-of-command structure under the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in the Chinese Communist Party, such as police and national security agents, to consolidate his supreme power domestically. Now the same team is calling for “centralized and unified leadership” in foreign policy. Xi has emphasized the importance of security, as he believes domestic and foreign threats are working in tandem to overthrow the Chinese communist regime. To prevent such a possibility, the administration tries to “plan for external and domestic security in an integrated manner.” Because the Xi administration does not clearly distinguish between the issues inside and outside of China’s borders, it has increasingly applied domestic governance methods to deal with external issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these conditions, two actions — (1) analyzing China’s maritime national program and (2) expanding Taiwan’s international role — should be pursued to upgrade cooperation among democracies to deter China from taking aggressive measures against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyzing-chinas-maritime-national-program&quot;&gt;Analyzing China’s Maritime National Program&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the maritime contents of China’s territorial and spatial program, launched in 2021, allows for deeper investigation of China’s preparations to expand its effective control over the sea and air surrounding Taiwan. At the same time, it is important to study China’s new infrastructure construction and collect data on Chinese maritime behaviors. The latter effort includes the development of new technologies to intercept Chinese satellite systems such as BeiDou and monitor the behaviors of Chinese official and private vessels using signals other than the Automatic Identification System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the starting year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, China launched a national territorial and spatial program that stipulates the usage, development, and conservation of the 3 million square kilometers of water jurisdiction (管轄海域) it claims, making use of its own satellite and digital technology. Since about a half of the water is disputed with neighboring states, this serves as an action plan for China to expand its effective control substantially in the name of domestic governance. The East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea are equally under pressure from Chinese state planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, China attempted to expand its effective control of Taiwan’s Kinmen Island by using a fishing boat incident as an excuse. This follows a similar pattern to a Chinese fishing vessel incident that occurred in Japanese waters near the Senkaku Islands in 2010. The China Coast Guard (CCG), headed by the Central Military Commission since 2018, is responsible for establishing domestic control over claimed territory, whereas the PLA prepares against external threats. As a result, the CCG has been taking new measures to increase pressure on Taiwan in the name of domestic administration, seeking to fulfill established targets related to the national territorial and spatial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for Taiwan and its liberally minded global counterparts to track those developments and deter China from taking further actions. However, it will be more and more difficult in near future as China is creating new types of infrastructure that can lay a foundation to implement its military-civil fusion strategy. Various satellite constellations centered on BeiDou, including the ones that enable space-based broadband communications, have been combined with the underwater surveillance system in preparation for contingencies when the PLA needs to mobilize private vessels and air/sea drones. Countries need to work together to study China’s new program and to increase maritime defense awareness against Beijing by monitoring and countering its new technology. This effort can also improve preparedness against it in the East and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-taiwans-international-role&quot;&gt;Expanding Taiwan’s International Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been engaged in a competition for diplomatic recognition with Taiwan in an attempt to extinguish the island’s identity and influence from international fora. Chinese pressure has intensified since Taiwanese president-elect Lai Ching-te’s victory in January 2024. Taiwan maintains its international presence in advanced semiconductor production, but this presence should be secured and upgraded amid the hardening international competition between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the organizations directed by the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission have gained political power in China as they have contributed to Xi’s growing domestic supremacy in recent years. They include the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Justice. All of those bodies are now directed by Xi Jinping’s old and close allies. As China’s security pact with the Solomon Islands and its police cooperation with other South Pacific island countries illustrate, such forces have also extended their influence over foreign relations. In simple terms, China’s version of the KGB, that performs domestic surveillance and has helped to centralize power in Xi’s hands, is transforming China’s international approach. It naturally prefers secretive infiltration operations, in both domestic affairs and external relations, such as controlling the internet, diffusing fake news, bribing with money and benefits, and exerting influence through religious, cultural, and academic exchanges. Its activities are conducted using the latest information technology and are likely to consolidate pro-China authoritarian regimes in developing countries. China’s recent efforts to form a global partnership network seek to make these governance models and technologies available to developing countries as international public goods. This can accelerate international competition between democracies and autocracies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this picture, Taiwan has the best-developed measures to tackle Chinese infiltration efforts due to its abundant experience. Other like-minded countries need to learn from it. If the preventive measures developed in Taiwan can be systematically shared and improved upon among global democracies and offered to developing countries, the spread of Chinese autocracy can be mitigated or prevented. Perhaps establishing a private center in Taiwan that studies anti-infiltration methods and trains relevant personnel from all over the world is a good idea for advancing Taiwan’s international presence. To this end, it is also necessary for Western countries to position Taiwan as a bridgehead for securing democracy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Mori Satoru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulating-a-regional-deterrence-architecture&quot;&gt;Articulating a Regional Deterrence Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main strategic objective of China’s campaign to use force to unify Taiwan would be to force Taiwan to give up the indefinite continuation of the status quo and agree to eventual unification with a timeline. China’s growing nuclear arsenal will generate strong concern over the so-called stability-instability paradox and illuminate the significance of establishing conventional deterrence. The central question regarding conventional deterrence of Chinese armed aggression against Taiwan is whether Taiwan and other parties can credibly demonstrate the necessary will and ability to convince China it has no prospect of succeeding in forced unification with Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States (hereafter “the coalition”), together with Taiwan and other willing and able states, need to send at least three messages to China in credible ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot win a short, sharp war to unify Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot prevail in a protracted war over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing and will not deliver military dominance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) likely has multiple war plans based on various assumptions. If China assumes unification is possible only by full-scale invasion of Taiwan, achieving the main goal of deterrence and response requires at least three lines of effort: (1) dislodge the invading forces that must cross the Taiwan Strait (deterrence by denial), (2) fend off PLA attacks to destroy coalition forces capable of targeting the invading forces and sustain the war-fighting effort (deterrence by resilience), and (3) continuously gain advantage in the competition with the opponent (deterrence by cost imposition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these lines of effort requires various missions and capabilities. Table 1 illustrates missions and capabilities that potentially contribute to these three types of deterrence; some have been extracted from the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy. Different countries have different capabilities and are capable of different missions. Ultimately, their decision to use those capabilities and carry out certain missions will be political. However, for the purposes of deterrence, it makes sense to notionally identify typologies of states that will need to implement the missions and employ those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dVoh8D.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Missions and Capabilities for Deterrence Roles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 1, frontline states will need to implement more expansive missions and capabilities (Tier 1), whereas supporting states will focus more on resilience- and denial-related efforts to support frontline states (Tier 2). Backup states will provide functional cooperation (Tier 3) to the frontline and supporting states. These are ideal types of roles for response and deterrence, but the framework permits identifying areas that allow for capability aggregation and require mission coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Taiwan’s security, the Tier 1 role would need to be played primarily by Taiwan and the United States, while the Tier 2 and 3 roles would likely be played by Australia, Japan, and the United States. Japan assuming a larger share of the Tier 2 and 3 roles would have strategic implications for coalitional deterrence, and certain efforts could be facilitated by trilateral cooperation among Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections (1) examine how Japan can contribute to credible deterrence messaging and (2) propose ways the coalition can cooperate to reinforce those messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-a-short-sharp-war-strengthening-the-coalitions-ability-to-dislodge-the-pla-invasion-force&quot;&gt;Deterring a Short, Sharp War: Strengthening the Coalition’s Ability to Dislodge the PLA Invasion Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Japanese government decided to fundamentally bolster Japan’s defense capabilities. The effort will enable it to carry out limited offensive operations and consequently allow the United States to focus more on the defense of Taiwan and the role of defeating PLA invasion forces. Japan’s decision to fundamentally bolster its defense consists of strengthening seven kinds of capabilities: (1) standoff capabilities, (2) integrated air and missile defense, (3) uncrewed systems, (4) cross-domain operation (mainly space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic) capabilities, (5) command and control and intelligence, (6) logistics and civil defense, and (7) sustainment and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Japan’s defense strategy has involved offensive operations by U.S. forces and defensive operations by Japan (the “American spear” and the “Japanese shield”). However, Japan’s new capabilities, such as counterstrike and active cyber defense, go beyond traditional defensive operations. If realized, these capabilities will enable Japan to assume certain offensive operations, as Japan eventually needs to assume defensive and offensive military operations to defend its territory. This, in turn, will free up U.S. forces previously devoted to the defense of Japan and allow them to concentrate more on the defense of Taiwan. In essence, the division of labor between Japan and the United States will evolve from function based (using the spear and shield to defend Japan) to theater based (Japan defending itself and the United States defending Taiwan). In other words, Japan’s defense capability buildup will allow Japan to assume a larger portion of the Tier 2 role and thereby enable the United States to focus more on the Tier 1 role and enhance overall deterrence vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should accelerate acquisition of the following capabilities required to fulfill the Tier 2 role: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in various domains, (2) missiles and platforms capable of long-range precision strikes against PLA Navy ships and PLA Air Force aircraft, (3) missiles and platforms capable of neutralizing the PLA’s ability to wage missile salvo attacks against Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) bases, and (4) a close command and control architecture that will enable effective counterstrike operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s weapons systems and munitions should be interoperable with the United States, Australia, and preferably Taiwan to facilitate wartime sustainment and replenishment. Joint capability development of certain weapons systems such as hypersonic and counter-hypersonic weapons and uncrewed undersea vehicles (UUVs) should be pursued based on common standards to maximize interoperability. Technocratic arguments against Japan joining the second pillar of AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, deserve attention, but Japan’s participation in certain pillar two programs to maximize interoperability makes sense from a strategic point of view. Japan’s information security issues should be cleared as soon as possible to facilitate multipronged efforts to advance joint capability development with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enduring-in-a-protracted-war-enhancing-resilience-and-sustainment-capacity&quot;&gt;Enduring in a Protracted War: Enhancing Resilience and Sustainment Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s strategic goal in any effort to defend Taiwan is to maintain the capability and the resolve to keep up the fight if deterrence fails. In other words, Japan must have the resilience and endurance required for a protracted conflict. Japan must push forward full steam ahead on national efforts to harden JSDF bases and facilities and rapidly build up gaps in civil defense architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building resilient networks for the JSDF and the Japanese government’s digital systems and critical infrastructure will prove decisive in enduring any conflict involving China. In the event of a crisis or contingency over Taiwan, sophisticated Chinese cyberattacks taking various forms will likely overwhelm Japan’s cyber defense capacity — a major vulnerability in the coalition. Japan needs to rapidly build up its capability for cyber defense both through a robust cyber unit development program and enhanced joint exercises and training with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During crises, China would very likely conduct information operations to dissuade the Japanese public from supporting U.S. operations to defend Taiwan. China would likely generate a war scare among the Japanese public to break Japanese public resolve; it would also attempt to deepen divisions in Japanese public opinion over the issue of whether and how Japan should get involved in a Taiwan contingency. Australia, Japan, and the United States should advance information sharing about the pattern of Chinese and foreign disinformation, and cooperation in the counter-disinformation realm should also be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area for cooperation is reinforcement of munition production capacity. There should be a major international effort among the United States and its allies — including Australia and Japan — to expand munitions production capacity. To create an environment that encourages further investment by defense companies in production capacity, the governments of Australia, Japan, and the United States should consult on possible demands over the next 5 to 10 years to communicate prospects for munitions procurement to the defense industries of the three countries. Coproduction of certain missiles should move forward without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-and-sustainable-balancing-demonstrating-unity-of-effort&quot;&gt;Persistent and Sustainable Balancing: Demonstrating Unity of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, Japan, and the United States should send a signal to China that its arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing. The three countries should coordinate various lines of effort to increase deterrence through joint capability development and mutual reinforcement of resilience and sustainment. Unity of effort among Australia, Japan, and the United States should be demonstrated through joint declarations in appropriate forms. One possible format would be a biannual trilateral foreign and defense ministers’ meeting, or a “2+2+2” meeting. The Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) and Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting could be held back to back, and the trilateral could be held in between. The process of issuing a joint declaration would compel defense and foreign ministries to coordinate various programs and explore new initiatives aimed at strengthening deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to build credible conventional deterrence in the Indo-Pacific will compel Australia, Japan, and the United States to depend more on U.S. theater nuclear forces. Consequently, if deterrence fails, the coalition will likely face a stark choice between submission and U.S. nuclear escalation. To maintain strategic options and avoid such an eventuality, conventional deterrence and response must be strengthened and made more credible in a short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actions-short-of-violating-one-china-policies&quot;&gt;Actions Short of Violating One China Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait — broadly defined as Taiwan’s continued de facto independence from mainland China — is increasingly under challenge. Although Beijing likely prefers a peaceful resolution to a costly war in achieving the “reunification” of Taiwan, it is engaging in nonpeaceful measures short of war to coerce the people in Taiwan to accept Beijing’s political demands. Despite Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen’s signals that her government would not seek de jure independence, Beijing closed off dialogues with Taipei by imposing the politically untenable precondition of endorsing the 1992 consensus and working to isolate her government. Now, with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te in May, whom Beijing regards as an even more pro-independent and worse counterpart than Tsai, pathways for the two sides to resume constructive dialogue remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because facts on the ground composing the status quo are far from static, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should strengthen ties with Taipei through all measures short of violating or changing their respective One China policies. One primary objective of such efforts is to prevent Beijing from challenging the status quo even further, including through a full-scale military invasion of Taiwan. Another is to restore Taiwan to a state where the government can engage in positive dialogue with Beijing without feeling pressured to concede excessively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognizing-the-value-of-high-level-visits&quot;&gt;Recognizing the Value of High-Level Visits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Taiwan has become an increasingly popular destination for bipartisan delegations of lawmakers from Australia, Japan, and the United States, among others. Japanese parliamentary delegations to Taipei, often led by the Japan–Republic of China Diet Members’ Consultative Council, have been expanding in size; one comprised the first foreign visitors to congratulate Lai on his victory in the presidential election. In May, more than thirty Japanese lawmakers attended his inauguration ceremony. Since the summer of 2021, the consultative council has held strategic dialogues with legislative representatives from Taiwan and the United States under an initiative led by former Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo and U.S. senator Bill Hagerty. Twice in 2023, the ruling parties in Japan and Taiwan — the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Progressive Party — convened 2+2 meetings involving senior parliamentarians well versed in security and diplomatic issues. High-ranking members of the LDP, such as vice president, Taro Aso, and the then chair of the LDP Policy Research Council, Koichi Hagiuda, visited Taiwan last year. These activities will likely continue regardless of the current domestic political instability in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s subnational actors are also following this trend. Tokyo Metropolitan governor Yuriko Koike visited Taipei in early February to meet with President Tsai, Vice President and President-Elect Lai, and Taipei mayor Chiang Wan-an, who all agreed to enhance cooperation between the two cities. During a meeting with Taiwan’s minister of digital affairs, Audrey Tang, Koike also expressed interest in bolstering cooperation with Taiwan for Tokyo’s digital transformation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has the tradition of including Taipei in its para-diplomatic outreach, such as the Asian Network of Major Cities 21. As Japan aims to strengthen its informational resilience against cyberattacks and mis-and disinformation operations, including in times of contingencies, its local governments might offer avenues for further cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of forging and maintaining durable and broad public support for Taiwan in these democratic societies cannot be overstated. In its absence, no costly action in support of Taiwan, whether in peacetime or during contingencies, would be possible for these governments. High-level visits, serving as signs of expanding bipartisan political support for Taiwan, are important in this context and provide moral support for the Taiwanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tangible-steps-to-enhance-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;Tangible Steps to Enhance Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these visits remain at the level of cheap talk, failing to produce measures to help Taiwan materially or credibly signal to Beijing the resolve of the United States and its partners to defend the status quo around Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States should work to translate their ever-expanding yet relatively low-cost domestic political support for Taiwan into tangible steps toward enhancing Taiwan’s resilience in all dimensions of statecraft, including diplomacy, information, the military, and the economy. Examples include supporting Taiwan’s entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and conducting joint training and intelligence sharing with parts of the Taiwanese government in both traditional and nontraditional areas of security, including space, cyberspace, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is how to realize this shift, since these steps are considered “costly” precisely because they may incite Beijing’s backlash. Two considerations are critical. The first is coordinated strategic communication among Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington to frame any enhanced ties with Taipei as efforts to offset Beijing’s increasingly aggressive postures in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing must receive consistent messages that draw a clear linkage between its behavior and signals of international support for Taiwan. Accordingly, if Beijing credibly softens its position, then these activities must be either curtailed or compensated through other accommodating measures offered to Beijing. Questions about reversibility or offset options must also be considered for various measures of cooperation with Taiwan in case of Beijing’s acquiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Australia and Japan, as former victims of China’s economic sanctions, should lead efforts — with support from the United States — to build multilateral economic resilience. In anticipation of China’s responses to these countries’ closer ties with Taiwan, they should craft joint countermeasures, such as diversification strategies away from the Chinese market. Taking these steps and publicizing them widely will reduce the psychological impact of possible Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated strategic messaging among Australia, Japan, and the United States must show (1) that enhanced measures with Taiwan are tied to China’s changing grounds in the Taiwan Strait and (2) that these governments have already thought through countermeasures for China’s economic coercion with great care and coordination. Such messaging will help policymakers navigate domestic politics and garner broader support from other like-minded major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is necessary for pushing forward more sensitive areas of security cooperation with Taiwan but will also be important in the areas of boosting Taiwan’s diplomatic and economic resilience through multilateral forums, especially where the United States is absent. For instance, the CPTPP — which was saved by Japan’s leadership after U.S. withdrawal from its original form, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — remains one of the most strategic and advanced multilateral trade agreements to enhance the rules-based economic order in the Asia Pacific. To preserve the legitimacy of this new economic institution, Japan, with the help of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, should seriously review China’s and Taiwan’s bids for entry. CPTPP membership does not require statehood, and CPTPP members should act collectively to support Taiwan’s entry based on their fair review of candidate’s readiness and willingness to play by the rules. In this process, CPTPP members open to Taiwan’s entry should also consider establishing a new, smaller multilateral trade framework among themselves as an interim step. Continuous encouragement of U.S. reentry to the CPTPP should also not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating growing political support for Taiwan into tangible measures despite risk of Chinese retaliations is a signal of regional stakeholders’ resolve to preserve the status quo, the peace and stability in the region, and the rules-based international order. These signals of support should also help the new Lai government navigate its contested domestic political environment and any new opportunities for dialogues with Beijing. Of course, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should also coordinate closely with Taipei to maintain shared strategic aims toward Beijing throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tokuchi Hideshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Asia, positioned at the forefront of the great power rivalry, is a tinderbox with three nuclear authoritarian states and several flash points, including the Taiwan Strait. Because the region lacks an overarching security framework, a cluster of U.S. bilateral alliances works as the stabilizer. The hub-and-spokes alliance system is becoming more networked than ever but is still not fully integrated. For example, the Japan–South Korea relationship is rapidly improving but remains fragile. The Philippines seems to have made a strategic choice to be tougher on China, but it is uncertain how long this will hold due to the unwillingness of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to make a binary choice between the great powers. Finally, Taiwan, one of the leading regional partners of the United States, is not officially included in the U.S. bilateral alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-in-east-asian-international-relations&quot;&gt;Recent Developments in East Asian International Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new security initiatives in the region include the Quad, a strategic dialogue and cooperation between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and AUKUS, a strategic security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quad is evolving to engage with other partners, such as France, while AUKUS also has potential to evolve, as AUKUS partners are “considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Japan renewed their Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation in October 2022, which states, “We will consult each other on contingencies that may affect our sovereignty and regional security interests, and consider measures in response.” In May 2023, Japan and the United Kingdom committed themselves “to consult each other on important regional and global security issues and consider measures in response” by issuing the Hiroshima Accord. The partnership between Japan, South Korea, and the United States has new momentum, according to “The Spirit of Camp David” joint statement of August 2023, which announced the three countries’ “commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to coordinate our responses to regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect our collective interests and security.” This commitment does not necessarily mean joint contingency planning or military action, but their operational cooperation to address common challenges, presumably including Taiwan contingencies, likely will be enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partners are cooperating more closely than ever, sharing a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). Moreover, the vision is evolving, as with Japan’s New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” launched by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING ATTENTION TO THE TAIWAN STRAIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan will remain a focal point of East Asian security because China has the ultimate goal of unification of Taiwan. For China, the Taiwan issue is at the core of its interests. In November 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping told U.S. president Joe Biden that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. He also reiterated that China will realize unification and that it is unstoppable. Moreover, China has never denied the prospect of forceful unification. A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer said that unification is more precious than peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is increasingly important for industrial democracies in the region and the world, though their national interests related to Taiwan may differ. As far as Japan is concerned, Taiwan’s importance is obvious due to its geographical proximity, shared threat perception on China, trade and economic partnerships, and shared fundamental political principles and values. Since the Japan-U.S. joint statement of April 2021, several diplomatic statements have reiterated “the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” including the Australia-Japan Leaders’ Meeting Joint Statement of October 2022, the Japan-NATO joint statement of January 2023, the G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué of May 2023, and “The Spirit of Camp David” in August 2023. The Japanese prime minister’s expression that the “Ukraine of today may be [the] East Asia of tomorrow” may allude to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s 2024 presidential election, citizens chose the diplomatic path to strengthen their defense, maintain autonomy, and enhance partnerships with other democracies, including Japan and the United States. Taiwan has proved once again to be a mature democracy. As Rory Medcalf argues, “Taiwan is a democratic model in the Chinese-speaking world. It disproves the nonsense that only Western people cherish a free society.” This fact — as well as Taiwan’s continuous pursuit of autonomy, stronger defense posture, and international partnerships to be more resistant to China’s pressure — will make China tougher on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-proposals&quot;&gt;Policy Proposals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. ENGAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous U.S. engagement in the region, buttressed by robust U.S. military presence, is a must to prevent China’s miscalculation. As an alliance requires mutual cooperation, allies must take the lead and help the United States remain engaged in the region. It is particularly important today as the United States remains divided and seems more inward looking. Regional allies, particularly Japan, must provide a more dependable stationing environment for U.S. forces to operate effectively and promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONNECTING SMALL NETWORKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-centered alliance network, the Quad, AUKUS, and Japan-Europe partnerships should align with each other to generate synergy for deterrence, remaining vigilant over the Taiwan Strait. The Quad leaders’ joint statements lack reference to the Taiwan issue. It is important to work with India to ensure that all four Quad partners share recognition of Taiwan as India’s voice grows in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSFORMING SHARED RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN INTO COOPERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. commitment to Taiwan remains ambiguous. Most countries’ cooperation with Taiwan is limited to a nongovernmental or unofficial basis. Provocation of China will not be in their interests. However, it is in their interests to send a clear message to deter China. Western democracies should not be complacent in their shared recognition of the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is more important to transform this recognition into actual cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL BREATHING SPACE FOR TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Taiwan’s international breathing space narrows, the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia, should cooperate to prevent Taiwan from being suffocated. First, Taiwan should not be excluded from international organizations tackling global issues such as the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan’s contribution to those issues is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) should be utilized more for security purposes. The GCTF is a platform for Taiwan to share its expertise with partners around the world but should be used to help Taiwan enhance its capabilities as well. Several security-related issues, such as network security, media literacy, and humanitarian rescue, are already on the agenda. Nevertheless, the GCTF’s scope should be expanded, and more officials and experts should participate in security cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the nongovernmental basis for Japan’s relationship with Taiwan should be more flexible. Japan should learn from the practices of unofficial U.S. and Australian engagement with Taiwan and explore the possibility of expanding security partnerships — for example, in the category of people-to-people contacts. As part of this approach, intelligence cooperation using the PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAWS) should be explored to address the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region. Also, taking the opportunity to establish a permanent joint headquarters under the defense minister, Japan should craft a mechanism for effective policy and operational coordination with international partners, including Taiwan, as Taiwan contingencies will directly affect Japan’s national security. Japan should expand security-related intellectual exchange by inviting Taiwanese private researchers as visiting scholars in its in-house security think tanks to closely exchange expertise with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBLIC EDUCATION ON TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Taiwan Strait becomes more unstable and the risk grows, efforts for deterrence are urgently needed. The sense of urgency for deterrence must be shared with the general public so that international partnerships work most effectively. For this purpose, public education on Taiwan — including its geography, history, politics, and economy, as well as the delicate international relations involving Taiwan — must be promoted in the domestic societies of the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia. The intellectual communities of those democracies should cooperate in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-ukraine&quot;&gt;Lessons from Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tsuruoka Michito&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important questions regarding a possible military contingency over Taiwan are whether, to what extent, and in what way the United States would be directly involved in military terms. Put simply, will Washington send its troops to Taiwan? With some exceptions, successive U.S. governments have maintained what is called “strategic ambiguity” regarding the U.S. response to a Taiwan contingency. The case of the war in Ukraine, including Washington’s response, provides a good starting point in exploring the question of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden, from the beginning, ruled out the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Despite an unprecedented level of weapons and intelligence assistance to Kyiv, the Biden administration has kept that promise. There are three possible explanations as to why Washington does not send troops to Ukraine: (1) Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the United States does not have an obligation to defend Kyiv; (2) Ukraine is not important enough to U.S. strategic interests; and (3) Russia has nuclear weapons, and the United States does not want to risk a nuclear exchange with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first point, if the United States is not sending troops to Ukraine because Ukraine is not part of NATO and the United States has no obligation to help Kyiv, then Taiwan could be seen as in a slightly better position, in legal terms, than Ukraine. Although the United States does not have a treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, Ukraine has the Budapest Memorandum, which it concluded in 1994 with the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom when Kyiv agreed to give up all of the nuclear weapons left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The document gives Ukraine “security assurances,” as the three countries committed to respecting Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity and reaffirmed their “obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force” against Ukraine. However, though the memorandum is an international agreement registered with the United Nations, it failed to be of any use during Russia’s invasion in 2014 when it illegally and unilaterally annexed Crimea and intervened in the Donbas region — or during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States has domestic legislation, not a security treaty, regarding its relationship with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act calls “any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a “grave concern” to the United States. The act also states it is U.S. policy to maintain the capacity to “resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.” In terms of legal power, it is not easy to compare the Budapest Memorandum and the Taiwan Relations Act due to their different statuses. Yet, arguably, domestic U.S. legislation has more power to be implemented, as it has an enforcement mechanism, whereas the international community lacks such a mechanism, as has been amply demonstrated. Taiwan, therefore, seems to be in a slightly more advantageous position than Ukraine when it comes to the legal dimension of U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, assuming Ukraine is not important enough for the United States to send troops, can Taiwan make a case that it is more important and worthy of troops? It must be noted that neither the United States nor any other country requires prior treaty commitment to exercise the right of collective self-defense, as it is enshrined in the United Nations Charter as an “inherent right” of all states. Therefore, if the United States were to determine that sending troops to Ukraine is imperative to its own interests, it could do so as a right rather than as an obligation. The United States has exercised the right of collective self-defense without treaty obligations on such occasions as the liberation of Kuwait or the counter–Islamic State global coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria. It is therefore inaccurate to say that the United States is not able to defend Ukraine because it does not have a security treaty with the country. Washington, if unbeknownst to many Americans, made its decision not to send troops there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Taiwan, its significant semiconductor industry is often mentioned as a reason why defending the island democracy is a strategic imperative for the United States. Yet it cannot be the deciding factor for sending troops there; it would be inconceivable for a U.S. president to send troops to Taiwan to protect semiconductor factories. Arguments related to U.S.-China strategic competition and the international order, by contrast, are more persuasive. The fall of Taiwan would be a huge blow to the U.S.-led international order in the Indo-Pacific region and strategic competition between the United States and China. Given how the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy describes China as the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” addressing China is, arguably, more strategically important than countering Russia. Taiwan is on the front line of U.S.-China strategic competition, and the stakes seem higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if the real reason that the United States does not send troops to Ukraine is Russia’s nuclear weapons and the risk of nuclear escalation, can Taiwan and others in the region, including Japan, be certain that the United States is prepared and willing to address China’s nuclear weapons? This is an inconvenient and unsettling proposition. On one hand, it may be argued that a line must be drawn between treaty allies such as Japan and partners such as Taiwan. President Biden has repeatedly emphasized U.S. commitment to defend “every inch” of NATO territory. Similarly, the United States has reiterated its nuclear commitment to Japan on numerous occasions. On the other hand, the need to avoid a third world war or nuclear Armageddon, something Biden has often referred to, has caused concerns among U.S. allies. While they agree that a nuclear exchange between nuclear powers must be avoided, for nuclear deterrence to work, nations must be prepared to escalate the situation by demonstrating their resolve to employ nuclear weapons when necessary. Avoiding nuclear escalation at any cost is not a position consistent with the logic of nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the three plausible explanations as to why the United States does not send troops to Ukraine, Taiwan could well make the case that it is in a better position than Ukraine. Nonetheless, the proposition that Russia has nuclear weapons and therefore that Washington needs to be extremely cautious is worrisome. It is in the United States’ interest to dispel such concerns among allies in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The challenge of countering nuclear-armed adversaries intending to change the status quo by force is hardly new. Yet there is added urgency in tackling this challenge in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in view of a possible Taiwan contingency vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Yamamoto Katsuya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s elections have ended peacefully, proving once again to the international community that mature democracy has taken root in Taiwan’s civil society. However, China has trumpeted the failure of Taiwan president-elect William Lai to win a majority of votes and the failure of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to retain its majority status in the legislature as evidence to the Chinese people that Taiwanese citizens do not widely support the DPP. This is because an authoritarian regime such as the People’s Republic of China would never allow a robust democracy that could elect a head of state and a majority in the legislature from different parties. However, the fact that the Taiwanese president did not win a majority and the fact that the ruling party did not win the majority in the legislature are not strange situations in a democratic society with the separation of powers. It is also evidence that Taiwan’s civil society has a good sense of balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election also makes it clear once again that none of the forces in Taiwan want unification with mainland China. The DPP, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), and the Kuomintang (KMT) all campaigned to maintain the status quo. Of course, many Taiwanese citizens, including DPP supporters, have made it clear that they oppose unification as well as independence. When former president Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT said in an interview with German media just before the election that Xi Jinping should be trusted, even the KMT immediately denied it. The majority of the international community also expects Taiwan to maintain the status quo, and President Xi Jinping’s China is the only country in the international community today that strongly advocates for the unification of Taiwan and China. In recent years, Xi Jinping considers even those who support the status quo group to be one of the anti-unification section. As he enters his third term in power, President Xi Jinping will become increasingly active in maneuvering for Taiwanese unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, Japan, which is adjacent to Taiwan, is the country most affected by developments in the Taiwan Strait and the country most in need of maintaining the status quo. Thus, Japan has two roles to play. The first is to make efforts to maintain the status quo, and the second is to be prepared in case these efforts are not successful and deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-efforts-to-maintain-the-status-quo-and-deter-in-the-taiwan-strait-and-western-pacific&quot;&gt;Japan’s Efforts to Maintain the Status Quo and Deter in the Taiwan Strait and Western Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Japan must strengthen its defense capabilities, which will give more latitude to the activities of U.S. military forces in the Indo-Pacific. It will also give more leeway to U.S. military forces assigned to the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. In light of recent China-Russia coordination, a conflict in the Taiwan Strait could naturally induce Russia’s activities in Europe. Japan’s strengthening of its defense capabilities will help alleviate European concerns about the Indo-Pacific region. The ability of Europe and Japan to adequately defend themselves in their respective war zones is an important factor in ensuring the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions maintain peace and stability in the international community. Unlike warfare in Europe, all warfare in the Indo-Pacific — whether fighting, evacuation of noncombatants, or trade involving neutral parties — takes place at sea. Thus, the maritime scene in a contingency will be complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one of the most feasible scenarios for China’s invasion of Taiwan is an economic blockade. The international community, including Japan, should recognize China’s blockade of Taiwan as an act of war. The region where China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are located occupies a pivotal position in the world economy. An economic blockade of Taiwan and the sinking of even one merchant vessel would send shipping insurance rates in the Western Pacific skyrocketing and paralyze maritime trade. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan would plummet; the Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong stock markets would halt trading; and the international economy would quickly suffer. Vessels engaged in maritime trade are operated by various interests of different nationalities, including ship registries, ship owners, operators, and shipping companies. The Taiwan-related vessels subject to the blockade are also Japan- and Australia-related vessels. Japan needs to make sure President Xi understands that an economic blockade is an act of war against the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is to enhance information sharing among the first island chain. From Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines to Australia, the like-minded partners comprising the archipelago should share a common operational picture (COP) of the region. China’s gray zone and hybrid operations and activities are spread throughout all domains, not just the oceans and cannot be addressed in any one instance alone. In response to China’s activities to attempt to change the status quo, the countries of the first island chain need to share and visualize their COPs and repeatedly appeal to the international community. Japan must emphasize the urgency of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brainstorming-preparing-for-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Brainstorming: Preparing for Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current international order must be firmly prepared for a new world order after deterrence fails. Even if the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends in Putin’s defeat, a Russia that has regained its strength is bound to turn on Ukraine and the Baltic states again. Thus, after the war in Ukraine, NATO will have to become an even stronger defense alliance against Russia. Similarly, even if China’s invasion of Taiwan fails at least once, China could turn on Taiwan again. Xi Jinping has repeatedly included Taiwan in his concept of national rejuvenation and the “China dream.” In the meantime, the democratic societies of the first island chain must work together to frustrate China’s intention to invade again. The U.S.-Japan alliance and Japan’s role in this new partnership must grow. Brainstorming for this purpose will also be a strong deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering China’s attempts to change the status quo means countering a big nuclear weapons state. It is said that Xi wants to be the Mao Zedong of the twenty-first century, and it would be a nightmare for all if Xi were to follow Mao’s perception regarding the use of nuclear weapons. It is time for Japanese society to seriously debate the effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Hayley Channer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China’s rise and stated intention to bring Taiwan back under its control, a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific could break out. Australia has multiple stakes in Taiwan’s future, not least the potential for Australia’s closest partners, the United States and Japan, to be drawn into a conflict with wider destabilizing effects. However, in the context of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s increasing gray zone coercion of Taiwan using methods short of war, the policy question of how Australia pursues its relationship with Taiwan and cooperates with the United States and Japan in building Taiwan’s resilience is complicated. There is scope for Australia and Taiwan to elevate their bilateral trade and diversify renewable energy supply chains, thereby increasing Taipei’s resilience and signaling some resolve to withstand CCP pressure. But there are also strategic risks that must be considered and balanced against the opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-dominant-trade-position-with-australia-dissuades-canberra-from-deepening-economic-ties-with-taipei&quot;&gt;China’s Dominant Trade Position with Australia Dissuades Canberra from Deepening Economic Ties with Taipei&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is by no means an inconsequential trade partner for Australia, but it pales in comparison to Australia’s relationship with China. China is Australia’s largest export market, accounting for 35 percent of exports in 2020. In contrast, Taiwan represents Australia’s sixth-largest export market. There is also a large gap between China and all of Australia’s other trade partners. In 2023, China accounted for 26.8 percent of Australia’s two-way trade, and the next-largest partner was Japan with 9.9 percent. Taiwan accounted for only 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the large gap between China and Taiwan in Australia’s trade relations, it is common for Australia to have a free trade agreement (FTA) with its major trading partners, which would typically include Taiwan. Australia has FTAs or economic cooperation agreements with China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and India. Taiwan has been lobbying Australia for a more formal economic partnership partly because such agreements provide Taipei with greater international legitimacy and reinforce its independence from China. However, Australia is unlikely to agree to an FTA given the limited practical benefit, as Taiwan currently applies low tariffs on Australia’s main exports of minerals and energy. Further, such an agreement would almost certainly cause relationship damage with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China exerts pressure across all domains — political, military, technological, and social — to dissuade Australia and other countries from entering into FTAs with Taiwan. For this reason, Taiwan has FTAs with only a handful of economies, the largest being New Zealand and the smallest being the Marshall Islands. In response to Canberra taking security and political positions that angered Beijing, Australia has faced punitive trade measures from China since 2018, costing its economy an estimated $31 billion in lost commodity exports. To stabilize relations with China as much as possible, Australia is unlikely to negotiate an FTA with Taiwan that would deliver little trade benefit. However, apart from an FTA, there are other areas where Australia can help Taiwan increase its resilience, such as energy security and the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy-and-supply-chains-are-a-primary-area-to-enhance-australia-taiwan-cooperation&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy and Supply Chains Are a Primary Area to Enhance Australia-Taiwan Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan have a strong relationship when it comes to traditional energy security. Taiwan relies heavily on energy imports, and Australia is its largest provider, supplying approximately two-thirds of its coal and one-third of its natural gas. However, beyond Australia exporting more coal and gas to Taiwan, Canberra has an opportunity to strengthen Taipei’s energy security and further Australia’s national priorities by cooperating on renewable energy sources and their supply chains. Plus, further integrating Taiwan into global energy supply chains will increase its value to the international community and complicate China’s calculations in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two areas where deeper Australia-Taiwan cooperation on renewable energy and supply chains would be particularly valuable are hydrogen and lithium-ion batteries. Australian and Taiwanese senior officials have been discussing hydrogen cooperation since at least 2021, when trade ministers from both countries participated in a hydrogen trade and investment dialogue. In 2022, the Australian government also hosted a Taiwanese business delegation to explore hydrogen opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan bilateral cooperation in this area could be expanded to trilateral or even quadrilateral cooperation with Japan and the United States. Australia and Japan have a Clean Hydrogen Trade Program, and Australian and Japanese businesses have been partnering on groundbreaking hydrogen projects. The United States is also heavily investing in hydrogen, including as part of the industrial policy measures contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Combining Australian, Taiwanese, Japanese, and U.S. efforts on the hydrogen supply chain could streamline individual and bilateral efforts. This could be realized through commencing trilateral or quadrilateral dialogue with officials and industry leaders, progressing to a formal agreement and joint development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other opportunity for greater Australia-Taiwan cooperation is in large-capacity renewable batteries. Demand for lithium batteries, used in electric vehicles (EVs), grid storage, and consumer electronics, is greatly increasing. Taiwan has a growing battery industry, and Australia produces 60 percent of the world’s lithium, which is needed for lithium-ion batteries. Both Australia and Taiwan stand to benefit from cooperation on batteries: Australia from value-added mineral resources, access to Taiwanese technical capabilities, and potentially more Taiwanese investors and customers, and Taiwan through diversifying its battery manufacture, better securing its critical supply chains, and supporting its EV sector. Australia and Taiwan have commenced cooperation on batteries, including an agreement between Taiwanese battery company Aleees and Australia-based mining company Avenira to develop a manufacturing plant for lithium battery cathodes in Australia’s Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan cooperation on batteries, perhaps expanded to Japan and the United States, has the potential to supplement the global battery supply chain. China currently dominates the mid- and downstream stages of battery processing and manufacture, accounting for approximately 73 percent of global manufacturing capacity in 2023. Should Beijing seek to withhold trade in this sector for political or strategic reasons in the future, it is important that other battery supply chains are developed. At best, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States could produce a battery supply chain without a production stage in China, reducing Beijing’s ability to weaponize this commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-accession-to-regional-trade-pacts-would-aid-its-cause-but-is-currently-unlikely&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Accession to Regional Trade Pacts Would Aid Its Cause but Is Currently Unlikely&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary way Taiwan asserts its agency in the international system is through its membership of country groupings as an “economy.” Taiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiative and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Other CPTPP members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, with the United Kingdom expected to be admitted in 2024. Considering Taiwan’s high trade and labor standards, it would be an ideal CPTPP member and accession would hold considerable symbolic importance to Taipei, similar to FTAs but on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China has also applied for membership. Considering that Beijing is unlikely to reform its economic practices sufficiently to achieve membership, some CPTPP members — concerned about repercussions from China should Taipei be accepted and Beijing rejected — hesitate to accept Taiwan. As the CPTPP is a consensus-based agreement requiring endorsement by all, some members could perpetually delay Taiwan’s application. Although Japan welcomed Taiwan’s bid publicly and Australia would likely support it privately, current circumstances reduce the likelihood of CPTPP membership being an avenue to support Taipei’s resilience. Nevertheless, Australia and Japan should continue lobbying for Taiwan’s accession within the grouping, with the hope of gaining wider support from other CPTPP members in the future. One way to do so would be through an internal CPTPP working group, as Taiwanese diplomats have suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait will be extremely challenging given that China is attempting to change the status quo incrementally through coercion of Taiwan and its partner nations. Beyond Australia’s bilateral relations with Taiwan or coordinating efforts with Japan and the United States, Canberra’s primary interest in Taiwan is stability. However, it may be possible for Australia to work more closely with Taiwan on renewable energy and supply chains in a way that is less escalatory and still supports Taipei’s resilience. While careful calculation is imperative, without some resolve, Australia risks continual backsliding in its relations with Taiwan, to Australia’s detriment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maximizing-australias-subnational-government-and-civil-society-engagement-with-taiwan&quot;&gt;Maximizing Australia’s Subnational Government and Civil Society Engagement with Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By John Fitzgerald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-and-community-resolve&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Community Resolve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective diplomatic, economic, and military deterrence requires liberal democracies to show and communicate the willingness of free citizens to bear the costs of deterrence and conflict and associated disruptions to their way of life. An otherwise well-designed deterrence strategy is unlikely to deter if a liberal democracy fails to communicate the resolve of its citizens and the likely choices of its decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a liberal democracy, Australia and its citizens have proved willing to bear the costs of the significant trade penalties China has imposed on them in retaliation for Canberra’s decisions around foreign interference, cyber threats, critical infrastructure, and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Such forceful demonstration of public resolve signals that the people of Australia, no less than their government, are willing to bear the costs of preserving institutional integrity and national sovereignty in the face of foreign coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Australia were to impose economic penalties on the PRC over a Taiwan contingency or to support U.S.-led efforts to assist Taiwan, a similar demonstration of public resolve could not be taken for granted. Such a demonstration would require broader public agreement than exists at present about what is at stake in the Taiwan Strait, why this matters to Australia, what the people of Taiwan want for their future, and why that too matters for Australians. Although Taiwan’s place in the growing geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States receives ample public attention, Australians are seeing and hearing too little about Taiwan itself. Greater public awareness of why Taiwan matters to Australia in the long term, on its own merits, needs to be generated through more extensive and intimate subnational and community ties between the people of Taiwan and Australia. Civil society has a part to play in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-civil-society-and-subnational-government-ties-matter&quot;&gt;Why Civil Society and Subnational Government Ties Matter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan confronts challenges and risks as grave as any country — including pandemics, floods and earthquakes, cybersecurity risks, gray zone disinformation and foreign interference, and possible maritime blockades and invasion — but it faces them without the benefit of international cooperation that risks on this scale normally entail. In view of Taiwan’s exclusion from major international organizations and its difficulties sustaining government-to-government cooperation with countries that recognize the PRC, Taiwan does not enjoy the degree of international cooperation merited by the challenges and risks it faces from one day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government, irrespective of which party is in office, limits its engagement with the government of Taiwan. Under its One China policy, Canberra publicly opposes unilateral actions on either side of the Taiwan Strait that could undermine peace and stability in the region. It is reluctant to cooperate directly with the government of Taiwan to secure peace and stability through the normal avenues of interagency cooperation, military-to-military liaison, and department-to-department and ministerial-level collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just Taiwan that loses out under this arrangement. Taiwan has much to offer in return for international assistance and support through sharing skills and experience in managing gray zone tactics, cybersecurity, natural disasters, energy transition, and preparation for conflict scenarios. Australia’s subnational governments and civil society do not operate under the same constraints as the federal government and so are in a position to pick up where national government relations leave off, particularly in sharing skills and experience across areas of common concern. They could draw on Taiwan’s experience and expertise to assist Australia in meeting its own challenges around natural disasters and pandemics, cybersecurity, gray zone disinformation, foreign interference activities, and other areas of common concern, at the same time building familiarity through people-to-people ties that would stand both sides in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-taken-and-missed&quot;&gt;Opportunities Taken and Missed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stands in the way of creating more extensive subnational and nongovernment ties between Taiwan and Australia. According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian government “strongly supports the development, on an unofficial basis, of economic and cultural relations with Taiwan, including a range of two-way visits, state, territory and local government contacts, trade and investment opportunities and people-to-people links.” Public opinion polling suggests that Australians of all backgrounds and all walks of life want to assist Taiwan in the event of conflict. Australians share similar democratic values with people in Taiwan, and Australian society is comparable to Taiwan in scale and complementary in its level of social and economic development. The underlying conditions are in place for closer people-to-people and local government engagement between the two societies. What is missing is encouragement, familiarity, and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Taiwan side, foundations, think tanks, and social entrepreneurs show growing interest in engaging with their Australian counterparts. But few comparable efforts are initiated from the Australian side, leading to missed opportunities. Where opportunities are taken, experience shows that expanded community engagement correlates closely with levels of state and local government engagement with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-diaspora-and-beyond&quot;&gt;The Diaspora and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratic government of Taiwan cannot afford to be naïve about diaspora community engagement given the historical role of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang (KMT) party agents in penetrating and mobilizing overseas Chinese (huaqiao) community organizations during the Cold War. Today, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) maintains a diaspora affairs (qiaowu) program in its Bureau of Consular Affairs and under each of the ministry’s five regional departments. These qiaowu bureaus date from the KMT government’s martial law administration during the Cold War, when they competed with CCP United Front agencies to win the hearts and minds of ethnic Chinese overseas. In democratic Taiwan, qiaowu offices have been repurposed from broad outreach programs extending to all Chinese overseas to a narrower role serving a limited range of community and consular functions for Taiwanese overseas. The PRC, by contrast, has stepped up its United Front operations among the Chinese diaspora (including the Taiwan diaspora) to mobilize overseas Chinese in support of China’s claims in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither can Australia afford to be naïve. It is home to around 1.4 million people of Chinese descent, of whom around 80,000 were born in Taiwan or are Australians of Taiwanese descent. Care is needed to reduce the likelihood of disagreement or conflict over Taiwan triggering social fractures and community alienation in Australia. Diaspora issues loom large for Taiwan and Australia in any possible sanctions or conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is space for new institutional initiatives to compensate for the increasingly disproportionate investment in diaspora affairs between the PRC and Taiwan. One way forward is for Australian think tanks and universities to collaborate with nonprofits and think tanks in Taiwan with unrivaled expertise in exposing and analyzing Chinese-language disinformation and interference operations among diaspora communities. Another is for Taiwan and Australia to look beyond the Taiwanese or ethnic Chinese diaspora in search of broader community support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Public interest in Taiwan and the PRC reaches well beyond diaspora communities to include Australians of all backgrounds. Again, such an approach would require wider community familiarity with Taiwan than exists at present and a disproportionate investment in local government and community ties by Australians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwan-outreach-australian-response&quot;&gt;Taiwan Outreach, Australian Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, public diplomacy programs aimed outside the diaspora are largely confined to development assistance programs in a small cohort of countries with official ties. To the author’s knowledge, no agency or program is responsible for supporting people-to-people ties with countries lacking formal diplomatic relations but wishing to expand and intensify their social, cultural, and community links with Taiwan. Rather than engage directly with broader community or civil society organizations in countries such as Australia, the Taiwanese government prefers to outsource this work to nongovernment brokers such as think tanks and other civil society organizations through outreach to leaders and elites from friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Taiwan’s think tanks have been quick to take advantage of their government’s New Southbound Policy to reach out to Australia. The Prospect Foundation and the Taiwan Asia Education Foundation (TAEF) routinely invite Australian political leaders and experts to participate in their high-profile annual forums. Former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, and Scott Morrison have each taken the opportunity to deliver keynote addresses at major think tank forums in Taipei. Turnbull accepted an invitation to chair the International Advisory Council of the Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI), a recently established independent think tank. And Doublethink Lab, arguably the region’s most capable nongovernment body focusing on Chinese government interference and cyber operations globally, has closely covered the Australian experience in countering foreign interference. Taiwanese think tank publishing arms also provide ample coverage of Australia, including the first major study of Australian relations with Taiwan to appear in print in many years, Taiwan and Australia: Advancing the Partnership of Four Decades, published in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiatives taken by Taiwan actors are highly significant, and the willingness of Australian invitees to accept their invitations is reassuring. Yet few comparable brokers or initiatives have emerged from the Australian side to create closer engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. A proportionate Australian response would match new initiatives coming out of Taiwan one for one. A disproportionate response would make maximum use of the space allowed to local government and civil society under Australia’s One China policy to fill gaps in national government engagement with Taiwan created by adherence to that policy. Australia’s independent civil society organizations and state and local governments could do more and are well placed to do more, but they need a dedicated platform to provide brokerage in Australia comparable to that exercised by think tanks in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government approves of people-to-people ties with Taiwan, as well as trading relations and local government relations. In some cases, it offers direct support — for example, by providing opportunities and funding for Australian graduates to work and study in Taiwan under the New Columbo Plan. Australia also participates directly in the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), a government-to-government platform for sharing expertise and experience with Taiwan and selected partners on matters of common concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth has few programs advocating for stronger ties at the subnational level or promoting civil society engagement with Taiwan, though plenty of resources are available. DFAT houses a public diplomacy initiative with annual grant programs supporting cultural diplomacy and Indigenous diplomacy, both highly relevant to Taiwan. DFAT also provides generous funding for people-to-people initiatives with Greater China, including Taiwan, through its National Foundation for Australia-China Relations. But in practice, few government grants support Taiwan-related initiatives. The Commonwealth could usefully channel more of these resources toward subnational and nongovernment initiatives relating to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some state and local governments are building closer community ties and investment pathways with Taiwan. Queensland’s trade and investment office in Taipei is the sole Australian state office based in Taiwan and is reputed to be the largest subnational government office on the island. In recent years, the Queensland office claims to have attracted several hundred million dollars of talent investment in support of science, technology, and industry development in Queensland, particularly in biomedical research and development. Six of Australia’s seven active sister-city links with Taiwan are based in Queensland. Cities in Taiwan also cooperate with the state through clusters of local city links organized through networks supporting smart city and Asia-Pacific city linkages. The state’s Taipei office assists with civil society partnerships as well, some of which go back decades. It also facilitates relations with state cultural institutions, including Brisbane’s QAGOMA Asia Pacific Triennial, which hosts major exhibitions of Taiwan art and culture. Other Australian states and territories are missing out. The state government of Victoria has few links with Taiwan and no personnel in Taiwan, and in consequence the state hosts no sister-city links or relations with major cultural institutions in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest among universities to collaborate in research and teaching and in support of Indigenous diplomacy. There is further scope for university collaborations on diaspora affairs, including cooperation with specialist nonprofit research organizations such as Taiwan’s Doublethink Lab, a world leader in research and communication around foreign interference and cyber operations among sinophone communities in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charities customarily link communities and countries by providing routine assistance within communities (including diaspora communities) and by reaching out internationally to provide relief as needed. Taiwan is a special case. As a rule, charities and foundations that work in the PRC do not operate in Taiwan, and those that operate in Taiwan have no presence in the PRC, with few exceptions. Absent recognition from international charities based elsewhere, people in Taiwan have found additional incentives to establish independent charities to conduct charitable work comparable to that of large international charities at home and abroad, such as the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families and the Tzu Chi Foundation. The latter operates in Australia and the PRC. In the 1950s and 1960s, some Australian charities assisted the families of war orphans in Taiwan, but to the author’s knowledge, none has taken the opportunity to launch new initiatives in cooperation with Taiwan in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan offers unique opportunities for Australian chapters of international service clubs. As a rule, international service clubs have a negligible presence in the PRC and hence face few risks to assets or personnel arising from engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. Rotary International, for example, runs a large chapter network in Taiwan that is active in supporting local charities and providing international development assistance. Rotary is also very active in Australia. In 2023, several hundred delegates from Taiwan attended the annual Rotary International convention in Melbourne. Local chapters of Australian service clubs, such as Lions, Rotary, Apex, and Probus, could expand contacts and exchanges more systematically — for example, by providing local support in rural and regional Australia, where thousands of young Taiwanese labor in farms, abattoirs, and warehouses on working holiday visas with little connection to local residents. Local chapters of service clubs could offer similar assistance to visiting Australian students in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability matters in every deterrence domain. Military deterrence requires interoperability among national armed forces. Cybersecurity demands interoperability of data and security systems. Interoperability of financial systems is essential for cross-border cooperation in tackling financial crime and international terrorism. And interoperability among police forces, coast guard services, and development agencies is a high priority in planning for coordinated emergency responses in the Indo-Pacific. Timely attention should be paid to interoperability among civic institutions wishing to cooperate with Taiwan across national borders, including possible cultural, legal, and regulatory hurdles limiting cross-border cooperation among charities, foundations, service clubs, and other civic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil society is well placed to play expanded roles in Taiwan’s relations with countries in the region after basic questions are resolved about who can do what, where, and how. Answering these questions calls for basic research into: (1) the compatibility of legal and regulatory frameworks for Australian charities, foundations, and nonprofits wishing to work in Taiwan; (2) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and other civil society institutions can work in Taiwan, which cannot, and why; and (3) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and civil society institutions would be willing to cooperate with counterparts in Taiwan and what it would take to get them started. Parallel research could be usefully undertaken in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-a-disproportionate-effort&quot;&gt;Conclusion: A Disproportionate Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government takes no position on the issue of Taiwan’s sovereignty, but it opposes the use of violence to resolve the issue. It works with allies and partners to deter conflict by building capability, establishing credibility, and communicating resolve to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For effective deterrence, democratic countries need to communicate to all concerned that their people, not just their government and policy specialists, have the understanding and resolve to bear the costs of deterrence. To this end, communities need to understand what is at stake in Taiwan, why it matters, and what Taiwan’s forceful incorporation into the PRC could mean for their well-being and prosperity. Liberal democracies need to bolster communication around deterrence by building community resilience and communicating national resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, local governments and civil society have key roles to play in this effort. The Australian government is constrained by its One China policy commitments. Subnational governments and civil society are less constrained, but through misunderstanding and want of encouragement, they often refrain from engaging with their counterparts in Taiwan as deeply and often as they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building public knowledge and understanding about Taiwan requires disproportionate effort by Australia’s subnational governments and nongovernment organizations, consistent with their missions and resources, to engage with counterparts in Taiwan, develop mutual support networks, counter gray zone tactics used to undermine public resolve, and find practical ways to assist each other in any crisis. Ahead of any crisis, this requires building connections and ensuring interoperability among subnational and nongovernment players in the region to facilitate more extensive communications and intensive people-to-people ties. These players include states, provinces, and cities; charities, philanthropies, and nonprofits; universities and schools; clubs and associations; faith-based groups; sporting leagues; educational and cultural institutions; and think tanks, among others. Building routine connections between people and organizations in Australia and Taiwan promises immediate benefits to both while building and communicating resolve to assist one another in a time of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-battle-and-taiwan-strait-security&quot;&gt;The Information Battle and Taiwan Strait Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Benjamin Herscovitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is using a vast array of tools of statecraft to shift the cross–Taiwan Strait status quo in its favor. Among other policy levers, Beijing is regularizing the presence of the People’s Liberation Army around Taiwan, stepping up its efforts to exclude Taipei from international organizations, and both punishing and rewarding the Taiwanese people with a mixture of economic coercion and inducements. As well as calibrated U.S. and allied responses to these and other examples of China’s statecraft, preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait demands action in the information domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global information campaign against Taiwan has two major components: (1) the spread of disinformation about the international status of Taiwan and the One China policies of various countries, and (2) the reshaping of various countries’ positions on Taiwan to bring them in line with Beijing’s One China principle. According to this principle, Taiwan is, inter alia, “an inalienable part of China.” By propagating the idea that Taiwan is by right, and so should be in practice, part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Beijing’s information campaign is incrementally creating an international environment more conducive to China’s eventual annexation of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-disinformation-about-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Disinformation about Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China spreads disinformation by regularly making erroneous claims about history, international politics, and other countries’ policies. Although the PRC has never ruled Taiwan and imperial Chinese dynasties had either incomplete or, in most cases, little to no political control or influence on the island, Beijing nevertheless incorrectly claims that the island “has been an integral part of China’s territory since ancient times.” Beijing also frequently misrepresents the 1943 Cairo Communiqué by claiming that it declared Formosa/Taiwan should be returned to China, when it actually stipulated that the island should be returned to the Republic of China, or China as ruled by the nationalist Kuomintang, not the PRC as ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China deceptively claims that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 affirms “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.” But this UN resolution makes no mention of Taiwan’s status; it is solely concerned with transferring China’s representation in the United Nations from Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government to the PRC. As with China’s false claims about Chinese and Taiwanese history and the Cairo Communiqué, the disinformation regarding this UN resolution seeks to internationalize and legitimize Beijing’s One China principle and the PRC’s claim to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also spreads disinformation by misrepresenting various countries’ One China policies as versions of Beijing’s One China principle. Numerous states subscribe to different configurations of One China policies that recognize the PRC as the sole legal government of China without also endorsing Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of the PRC. Despite this, the Chinese government routinely asserts that its One China principle is “a universal consensus of the international community.” China also regularly seeks to deceive the public about the One China policies of other governments. For example, Chinese diplomats in Australia have published a series of op-eds in major Australian newspapers and local Chinese-language media in 2022–24 falsely claiming that Canberra is committed to Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propagating-beijings-one-china-principle&quot;&gt;Propagating Beijing’s One China Principle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also successfully persuading countries to willingly sign on to its One China principle via less deceptive methods. As countries shift their state-to-state relations from Taiwan to the PRC or upgrade already established ties with Beijing, the Chinese government is persuading them to endorse its One China principle via communiqués and joint statements. Countries that recently switched recognition to China, including Kiribati and Solomon Islands in 2019, Nicaragua in 2021, Honduras in 2023, and Nauru in 2024, have agreed to joint communiqués that formally and fulsomely support Beijing’s view that Taiwan is an inalienable part of PRC territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Chinese government is persuading countries to endorse Beijing’s One China principle when they expand or upgrade ties. For example, the 2023 joint statement between Timor-Leste and China establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership included a clause stipulating “firm adherence to the one-China principle.” This was a dramatic shift toward Beijing’s position, considering that previous bilateral messaging had referred to a One China policy without specifying that Timor-Leste would regard Taiwan as an “inalienable part of the Chinese territory” and oppose “any form of ‘Taiwan independence.’” Timor-Leste is just one of many countries that have been persuaded in recent years to embrace China’s position on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing stepped up its efforts to internationalize its One China principle after Taiwan’s 2016 election of a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president, and the Chinese government is unlikely to wind back this push following the reelection of a DPP candidate in January 2024. With Beijing signing more capitals up to its One China principle as they either sever state-to-state ties with Taipei or upgrade existing relations with the Chinese government, the number of nations that formally subscribe to the One China principle is likely to increase further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-should-be-done&quot;&gt;What Should Be Done?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China probably cannot annex Taiwan simply by shifting international official and public opinion and the particulars of the One China policies of a range of countries. But Beijing likely understands that its efforts to isolate and eventually take control of Taiwan will be aided if more countries and publics can be won over to the Chinese government’s view that the island is a province of the PRC. To preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait, Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded states should counteract China’s efforts to spread Taiwan disinformation and propagate its One China principle by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jointly and individually rebut the Chinese government’s disinformation about Chinese and Taiwanese history, the Cairo Communiqué, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and international support for Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide private support and advice to other states regarding the options available to them as they consider how to articulate their positions on Taiwan and emphasize that they need not adopt Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use ministerial speeches and official statements to more regularly reassert the latitude that states enjoy to engage with Taiwan under their respective One China policies and, where necessary, rebut examples of Chinese government disinformation about these policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforce via official government messaging to their publics, subnational governments, and private sectors that extensive and deep engagement with Taiwan in the trade, investment, political, cultural, people-to-people, and other arenas is entirely consistent with maintaining One China policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calibrated military responses from the United States and its allies are essential for preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait. But hard power is not enough. The fight to maintain the status quo of a de facto independent liberal democracy in Taiwan will be jeopardized if like-minded countries cede the information domain to China. Just as it would be better from China’s point of view to take Taiwan without having to fight, other countries can foreclose the possibility of such an easy victory by ensuring that Beijing does not win the world over to its view that Taiwan is simply a province of the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-the-united-states-and-japan-can-support-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;How Australia, the United States, and Japan Can Support Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Huong Le Thu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how to enhance Taiwan’s resilience, it is essential to know what resilience is. Resilience is defined as “the will and ability to withstand external pressure and influences and/or recover from the effects of those pressures or influences.” NATO considers resilience its first line of deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces pressure on all fronts: an increasing threat of military invasion, relentless intimidation and gray zone provocations, challenges to its domestic affairs through campaigns of mis- and disinformation, and attempts to take advantage of its open democratic system. Furthermore, like any other country, Taiwan faces frequent natural disaster risks characteristic of its geographical position, such as earthquakes, cyclones, and floods. As such, the country has long taken steps to prepare its citizens to play responsible roles in the face of frequent crises. Resilience is key to national comprehensive defense. Taiwan’s primary concept of resilience — preparing the population’s response to any disaster — also hardens it to the external pressures of a stronger adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an International Crisis Group analysis, China’s preferred scenario in the event of an armed invasion would be a lightning war that quickly subdues the population before any outside power can come to the island’s aid. U.S. intervention cannot be presumed, particularly as uncertainty mounts around the results of the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. In a contingency of an armed invitation, Taiwan needs to have the capacity to hold out until military support from the United States can be mobilized. Today, Taiwan is not optimally postured to do that. While the cross-strait military balance of power overwhelmingly favors China in quantitative and qualitative terms, Taiwan can still take steps to improve its position, such as investing in its asymmetric capabilities. Hence, Australia, Japan, and the United States need to support Taiwan’s efforts to make these investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s primary goal is to win without fighting, then the primary battlefield is not necessarily military but psychological: China must subdue the spirit of the Taiwanese people and their desire to resist Beijing. Victory is achieved through consistent long-term operations enabled by information technology, making China’s strongest weapon its mis- information and disinformation campaigns. Hence, protection of Taiwan’s cyber infrastructure becomes a primary priority. For a democratic society, managing the challenges of misinformation must be balanced with liberal values that safeguard the open flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-resilience-through-early-preparation&quot;&gt;Increasing Resilience through Early Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an invasion, China would almost certainly conduct cyber and electromagnetic attacks to disrupt Taiwan’s ability to communicate. The island will need to strengthen its infrastructure to ensure it can remain connected to the outside world after the first waves of attack. Reducing energy dependency by stocking more fuel reserves will also be important. Given the potential power crunch the island faces in 2025 with the planned closure of its last two nuclear reactors, Taipei should consider postponing the shutdowns as well as expanding its liquified natural gas (LNG) storage capacity. The same logic applies to other critical supplies such as food and medicine. Taiwan has achieved only 31.3 percent self-sufficiency in food, and it imports about 50 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients from China. It should quickly find ways to replenish its stores. A greater investment in civil defense preparedness, building on past civil society initiatives, would also be wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital resilience should include reinforcing the access of officials and public figures to communications networks, securing essential databases, developing alternative communications pathways to international audiences, and improving the physical security and cybersecurity of terrestrial infrastructure. A 2023 RAND Corporation report showed that China had gathered intelligence on nearly 300,000 points of interest (POIs) in Taiwan, including 550 POIs containing the locations of such network infrastructure as cable landing stations, internet service provider facilities, and mobile telephone facilities. Another 2,397 POIs detail the location of local, provincial, and government offices. These facilities could be targeted in advance and destroyed by rocket artillery or captured by special operators emerging on the first day of the attack. The case of Ukraine has shown the value of using satellites to link disconnected local networks, particularly when hard infrastructure is likely to be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar alternative could be arranged in Taiwan by linking very small aperture terminals (VSATs) to 5G base stations in a variety of locations. As the terrestrial connections to core networks are severed, groups of 5G base stations could form edge networks and use VSATs to interconnect them. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would almost certainly hit electrical generation early in a conflict. Taiwan will need to prepare backup power sources for its edge and core networks and construct duplicate cable landing stations at alternative locations, at least for the highest-priority government agencies and military units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-the-robustness-of-taiwans-satellites&quot;&gt;Increasing the Robustness of Taiwan’s Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an island nation such as Taiwan, satellites are the most feasible — albeit much less capable — substitute for submarine cables. Satellites cannot replace the enormous capacity of submarine cables, but they can connect high-priority fixed and mobile users, including government leaders, private citizens, and military units and the organizations and industries that support them. However, this option is complicated and deserves closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both government-owned and commercial communications satellites cover Taiwan and the air and sea lanes surrounding the island. Communications satellites owned by the United States and other governments are mostly in geostationary orbit (GEO), while commercial communications constellations operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and GEO. The RAND report showed that a total of 182 communications satellites lie in the portion of the GEO arc visible from Taiwan. Of these, 63 are operated by commercial constellations based in countries likely to be sympathetic with Taiwan if China attacks it. The U.S. government and the governments of allied nations also operate 32 communications satellites that could provide coverage to users in Taiwan, including four wideband global system (WGS) satellites. Each WGS satellite can provide 500 megahertz of X-band capacity and 1,000 megahertz of military Ka-band capacity, which is at a higher frequency than commercial Ka band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons capable of destroying LEO satellites. It also has maneuverable satellites that could act as space mines by exploding near a GEO satellite and showering it with debris. The U.S. Department of Defense judges that China might also be improving its ground-based lasers to cause structural damage to LEO satellites and might be developing a new ASAT weapon to strike GEO satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government could help by providing some capacity from the four WGS satellites operating within view of Taiwan. Partners should consider supporting Taiwan by using commercial and military satellites for priority Taiwanese government, military, and civilian communications in the presence of heavy jamming attacks. Australia, Japan, and the United States can work closely with commercial providers to regularly practice shifting communications among satellites. Partners could support developing protocols to grant access to lower-priority public offices, businesses, and individuals on an as-needed or as-available basis. They could assist with providing a diversity of options to deploy mobile generators to maintain electrical power for critical satellite terminals. Moreover, a long-term approach to capacity building should be considered — including, for example, student training programs and research and development collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trilateral support in information capacity resilience is not without challenges when it comes to the restrictive and sensitive nature of information protection. Support for capacity building should be long term; it requires commitment from three governments and must be binding enough to sustain the changes in electoral cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-resilience&quot;&gt;Energy Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy security is national security. Energy dependence, laid bare after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, limited many European and NATO members in their security decisions. Energy resilience is of critical importance in preventing the swift takeover of Taiwan by Beijing. Right now, Taiwan is not optimally prepared: it imports 97.3 percent of its energy. Building the energy system’s resilience will depend on expanding storage capacity for the stockpiling of oil, coal, and natural gas as well as effective planning for the rationing and efficient redirection of energy to critical sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure not only increases Taiwan’s ability to withstand coercion but also helps deter a blockade. Coal is particularly suited to enhancing resilience during a blockade due to its high energy density, ability to be stored either on- or off-site, and capacity to be dispatched as needed. Data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) maintains that Taiwanese oil stockpiles surpass 100 days. Taipower, the state-owned electricity company, is investigating potential sites to store enough coal to generate up to 50 days of electricity, and MOEA has reported that coal inventories will increase in the coming years. CPC Corporation, Taiwan’s state-owned petroleum and natural gas company, has plans to install additional storage tanks at each of Taiwan’s three LNG terminals to achieve a 24-day storage capacity by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;Democratic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of Taiwan’s ability to sustain a potential blockade and other war scenarios is the spirit of the nation. Taiwan is at the center of Chinese interference operations and attempts, and infiltration by Chinese intelligence and subversion actors is at an all-time high, as demonstrated during the January 2024 election. Yet the robustness of Taiwan’s election procedures and results has affirmed confidence in the island’s societal and democratic resilience. This is not pure luck but a result of a crafted system designed to recognize and respond to disinformation. Success is based on a decentralized network that relies equally on civic responsibility as well as media and information organizations, think tanks, fact-checking platforms, and general education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience against subversion is the most critical element, albeit the hardest to grasp, in the island’s long-term future. Hardly any other country has such acute awareness of China’s sharp power as Taiwan. Partners in the region can often learn more from Taiwan than Taiwan can learn from them in this regard. But continuous support in defending democratic resilience needs to become a staple going forward as the sophistication of influence operations and frequency of disinformation campaigns only increase. The acute awareness among the Taiwanese people of the critical role of civic responsibility to their nation’s resilience may also hold lessons of value for the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-could-do-much-more-to-deter-beijing-and-support-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Could Do Much More to Deter Beijing and Support Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Lavina Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne in March, Australian foreign minister Penny Wong stated that the region is facing its “most confronting circumstances in decades,” including the expansion of military power without “measures to constrain military conflict,” “unsafe actions at sea” and in the air, and militarization of “disputed features,” noting that a major conflict in the region would be devastating. Her solutions were threefold: (1) leader-level and military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China; (2) a commitment to build “preventive infrastructure to reduce the risk of crisis, conflict and war by accident”; and (3) investments in military capability to deter a conflict. Diplomatic dialogue and building institutional frameworks to manage inadvertent escalation can be useful tools of statecraft if an adversary is content with the status quo and open to both. In other circumstances, military deterrence is essential to preventing conflict in the Taiwan Strait and other regional flash points in the South and East China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wong’s strategic appraisal of the increasing risk of conflict reflects the assessments made in Australia’s 2024 National Defence Strategy, 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR) and 2020 Defence Strategic Update. In all three documents, Canberra assessed that Australia would no longer have warning time for a major attack on its territory or military assets and that there was an urgent need to develop enhanced deterrence-by-denial capabilities to prevent this from occurring. The DSR recommends changes to defense force structure and force posture to enhance Australia’s capabilities as well as support U.S. and allied force projection, also for the purposes of deterrence. This approach continues under the just released 2024 National Defence Strategy, which explicitly acknowledges that the “risk of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is increasing.” The U.S.-Australia alliance and the AUKUS partnership are key to Australia’s development of deterrence-by-denial capabilities in the short and long terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s intent to advance its deterrence-by-denial capabilities — alone and with the United States and partners such as Japan — is the most effective response to increasing Chinese belligerence and coercion toward Taiwan. Stability in the Taiwan Strait can come only from deterrence, and deterrence is possible only with a favorable military balance of power and demonstration of capability, readiness, and willingness to act. Over its history, China has likely learned that long wars are disastrous, and the uncertain end to Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine may encourage China to have greater patience in its ambition of “reunification” with Taiwan. This gives Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded partners a narrowing window of time to organize and develop capabilities for credible deterrence. However, any failure to do so urgently undercuts the credibility of strategic pronouncements about the growing risk of regional conflict and will increase instability in the Taiwan Strait. In short, China will be watching progress on this front and making assessments of both capability and resolve as it continues to expand and modernize its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, already a growing gap between the dire strategic assessments made in recent Australian defense policy reviews and Canberra’s willingness to commit to the necessary increases in defense expenditure or to make speedy and effective decisions on defense capability, posture, planning, and readiness. While U.S. intelligence reports that Chinese president Xi Jinping has asked the People’s Liberation Army to be ready to annex Taiwan by 2027, none of the Australian government’s current procurement decisions will significantly contribute to the deterrence of China before the end of the decade. At the earliest, Australia will receive its first Virginia-class submarine after 2032 and the first of six new Hunter-class frigates in 2034. Given the history of cost blowouts and delays in Australian defense procurement programs, the surface fleet is unlikely to grow in size until the mid-2030s. Further, Australia’s plans to acquire long-range strike capabilities depend on an expansion in U.S. defense industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Australian government works to stabilize its relationship with China, it also avoids speaking plainly to the public about the real risks of conflict, Australia’s interests in contributing to deterrence, supporting the U.S.-Australia alliance, and the economic and strategic consequences for Australia should war occur. In these circumstances, it becomes difficult to politically justify major procurement decisions such as AUKUS and the much-needed expansion in the defense budget. Indicative of the current government’s real commitment to deterrence, defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is predicted to increase from 2.0 percent in 2023–24 to 2.4 percent by 2033–34. Only an extra AUD 5.7 billion $3.8 billion) will be added to the defence budget over the next four years. Australia will only be able to make a meaningful military contribution to strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait after around 2033 — apart from having a useful strategic geography and making contributions to allied signals intelligence through joint defense facilities such as Pine Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting these worrying shortcomings aside, nonmilitary forms of deterrence can also make an important contribution to deterrence and strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait. Like other regimes, the Chinese Communist Party will base its decision to use force not only on military calculations but also on nonmilitary factors such as the impact on regime security and the personal interests and calculations of President Xi. Existing research identifies a range of nonmilitary costs that could be imposed on China should it choose the path of war, such as economic, diplomatic, institutional, and reputational consequences. A great lesson from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the failure of the United States and European countries to signal their firm resolve to impose broad-based sanctions on Russia to influence and deter Moscow’s cost-benefit calculations. In the case of deterring Beijing, the choice between “national rejuvenation” and taking Taiwan by intimidation or force must be made clearer (i.e., that both are not possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More could also be done to increase and support Taiwan’s international relevance and counter China’s efforts to restrict Taiwan’s interactions with the international community. The greater Taiwan’s economic role and presence in the world are, the more prosperous it becomes and the more resources it will have to defend itself, contributing to strategic stability. More comprehensive engagement with Taiwan by more countries means that the risks and costs for China of military action increase. This should include support for Taiwan’s membership of international organizations where statehood is not a requirement for accession, renewed efforts to form bilateral trade agreements, and Taiwan’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which directly counters China’s ability to use economic levers of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Australia’s approach of stabilizing diplomatic relations with China is preventing it from contributing to the nonmilitary aspects of deterrence. The government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was prepared to pay a high price to clear a path for his November 2023 meeting with President Xi, dropping or suspending cases against China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) for imposing coercive trade sanctions from 2020 on a range of Australian goods — cases Australia likely would have won. Moreover, Canberra was slow to protest China’s use of sonar near an Australian frigate upholding the UN sanctions regime against North Korea in international waters, which injured four navy divers; it did so only after domestic political pressure. Renewed dialogue did not spare Yang Hengjun, an Australian human rights and democracy activist, from receiving a suspended death sentence by a Chinese court in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canberra has shown no interest in pushing Taiwan’s membership of the CPTPP and has given mixed messages about its eligibility to join. Neither has it sought to expand bilateral trade or intergovernmental engagement with Taipei. It may be some time before Australian leaders realize that stabilizing relations with China — a country that relies on escalation, intimidation, and tactical surprise — is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Rather, the more one concedes to Beijing, the more it demands. In the meantime, Australia is avoiding confrontation with Beijing and has little appetite to lead on widening Taiwan’s international space. In doing so and avoiding strong pushback against coercive behavior by Beijing, it fails to contribute to deterrence or stability in the Taiwan Strait through important nonmilitary tools of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-dangerous-balancing-act&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Dangerous Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Richard McGregor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any ordinary democracy, the results of Taiwan’s January 2024 election would have heralded an era of continuity in politics, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate winning a third consecutive term in the presidential palace. But continuity in Taiwan’s domestic politics conveys neither certainty, nor stability, nor peace, as Beijing will not accept the current status quo on an island it regards as its own sovereign territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP’s roots in the island’s independence movement and its refusal over the last eight years to sign on to Beijing’s required One China formulations make the ruling party an avowed foe of China’s ruling communists. Beijing’s dark view of the DDP and its president-elect, Lai Ching-te (William Lai), will ensure that Beijing retains pressure on the ruling party through various means until it gets its way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of such ongoing pressure, Taiwan needs the same support from like-minded members of the international community as it did before the election. The essential elements of its survival are the same as well: a combination of internal resilience and external options, both necessary to ensure it retains a say in its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners are indispensable in this respect, but it goes without saying that outsiders can only do so much. The Taiwanese political system has to commit to using its own powerful economic and technological qualities to build the strength it needs for its own defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting Beijing’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the election requires context, most notably an attempt to understand how Chinese president Xi Jinping and the Politburo view the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP did not enter the election with wind in its sails. After two four-year terms, the party’s standing suffered from the wear and tear of many long-standing governments. The party was also hurting due to domestic factors such as inflation, high housing prices, and shortfalls in staple foods such as eggs. However, the DPP’s greatest asset in the campaign was the disarray among the opposition candidates. If the DPP is the anti-China party, the opposition groupings collectively represented the “anti-anti-China parties.” Although both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) oppose the DPP’s China policies, they cannot back policies that embrace Beijing in any real fashion because doing so is electoral poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months prior to the election, Beijing’s interlocutors were fatalistic in private about the likelihood of a DPP victory and straightforward in saying such a result would almost certainly provoke a military response. That bellicose messaging moderated slightly in the weeks leading up to polling day, when the parties and candidates opposed to the DPP tried, and then spectacularly failed, to form a winning coalition for the presidency. Although a military response might still come, the expectation of large-scale exercises effectively blockading the island, as happened after the visit to Taiwan by then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022, has not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a large display of force, Beijing has settled on calculated small-scale incursions near the island, seemingly designed to keep the incoming Lai administration on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Chinese coast guard officials off the small island of Kinmen, near Fujian Province, boarded a Taiwan tourist boat, the first time such an interdiction has happened. People’s Liberation Army Navy research ships increased their patrols off Taiwan’s east coast, heralding a sharp uptick in such incursions. Beijing mounted another calculated psychological incursion in the diplomatic arena as well, announcing in the days after the election that the tiny Pacific island of Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Beijing has attempted to keep the incoming president off balance and under pressure ahead of his inauguration while retaining room for escalation both before and after the ceremony in May. Beijing may have taken some solace and thus may have acted with a modicum of restraint because the DPP did not win a majority in the parliament, the Legislative Yuan, in the January election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMT and TPP, if they join forces, can now block DPP legislation. In such a scenario, there will be ample opportunities for Beijing to sow instability in Taiwanese politics, long one of its core aims. Still, the underlying reality of Taiwanese domestic politics is that the population overwhelmingly supports the island’s current governing arrangements of de facto independence from China, and they vote accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scholars in Beijing are realistic enough to recognize the reality of Taiwanese public opinion, but communist party leaders in Beijing do not accept it. The long-standing cross-strait standoff — in which Beijing puts political, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan while the government in Taipei tries to fend it off and cultivate support from the United States and its allies — is often broadly referred to as the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the term “status quo” has been enshrined in core U.S. policy pronouncements and those of U.S. allies and partners in the region, promoted as something that should be defended and protected. Increasingly, however, the term is becoming dangerously misleading in describing the situation in and around the island. Far from static, as the term implies, the cross-strait status quo is dynamic and changing inexorably in Beijing’s favor. The status quo today is very different from the status quo of even a decade ago. China’s military now dwarfs that of Taiwan and can blockade the island in the space of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Taiwan’s election, Beijing wants to shift the status quo even further in its favor. Xi wants concrete, visible progress of the kind Taiwan will not give unless it is coerced into doing so. China does not have the means to easily invade and occupy the island, nor does it appear to have a set timetable to do so. But the PLA does have a large and growing military advantage across the strait and the means to move quickly on the island, and Xi has tasked it to be ready to do so by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also made it clear that Xi’s “one country, two systems” model for unification, enshrined in a speech in late 2019, has not shifted, despite many reports to the contrary. Xi’s use of the phrase “one country, two systems” in 2019 was widely seen to have been a disaster for Beijing’s aims in the wake of Hong Kong. But while Taiwanese voters and outside commentators may have seen Xi’s use of the term as a self-harming mistake, Beijing has shown no sign of doing away with the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Huning, a member of the party’s top body, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, has been in charge of forging new policies for unification since the 20th National Congress in October 2022. Wang, who has been a leading ideologue at the top of Chinese politics for more than a decade, has stuck with the formula while rolling out initiatives — largely economic ones — to add ballast to Beijing’s plans for the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s democracy has been essential to developing an identity independent of China. It also has been beneficial to its people, who lived under authoritarian rule until the late 1980s. But the United States and its partners, including Japan, Australia, and Europe, while supportive and admiring of the island’s democratic system, should not overly focus on this quality in marshaling support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the key to building support for Taiwan beyond the United States and its closest allies and into the rest of Asia and Europe is a focus on stability and, by extension, the global economic devastation that would flow from any armed conflict — the worst-case scenario of an invasion. The same messages might gain traction in Beijing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars do not countenance at any length the idea that the threat of economic catastrophe from a cross-strait war could deter Chinese military action, other than to suggest that Taipei and its friends are playing with fire in resisting unification. Privately, the message is acknowledged, if not taken on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it makes sense that the threat of economic devastation could work to restrain Beijing. Economic growth over the past five decades is the foundation stone of the party’s standing among the Chinese people. It is not something that Beijing wishes to damage, especially now that the economy is slowing. For countries such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to reinforce that point in dialogue with China thus makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-can-reduce-timidity-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Can Reduce Timidity on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rory Medcalf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Australian foreign policy accentuates stabilizing relations with China, it would be easy and tempting for Canberra to entrench timidity in its policy regarding Taiwan. Instead, now is the time to invest in understanding and explaining why Taiwan matters to Australia’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the moment to creatively explore the boundaries of what Australia can do to engage and support Taiwan as a vital part of the regional and global economy and a dynamic and progressive democratic society. This effort should extend to using the middle-power agency Australian statecraft extols. More can be done to operationalize the sophisticated position Australian governments have defined: a One China policy that acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s One China principle, which insists that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Australia is emerging from years of confrontation, friction, and freeze in relations with China, its largest trade partner. The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, elected in May 2022, prides itself on ending this painful phase, with disciplined diplomacy captured in the mantra of “cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in the national interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has gradually eased most of the coercive economic sanctions it imposed in 2020 when a conservative Australian government called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping presumably came to realize the coercion was not working in the face of Australia’s hardened public attitudes and political resolve, he needed a face-saving way out, and a change of government in Canberra provided that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is long-standing bipartisanship in Australia on foreign and security policy. Both the conservative Liberal-National Coalition and Labor support the U.S. alliance, partnership with other Indo-Pacific powers such as Japan, engagement with Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, and a relationship with China that combines massive trade (especially in Australian iron ore exports) with U.S.-led strategic balancing. The fact that the current government remains committed to AUKUS, an arrangement through which the United States and United Kingdom will help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, confirms that Labor is conscious of China as a source of grave geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are political differences in Australia on China policy. Labor’s emphasis on engagement with Asia is sometimes miscast as being soft on China. It has been in China’s interests to play up — and make real — the perception that some Australian governments are more accommodating of its priorities than others. This strategy aligns with the fact that Canberra is treading with great care when it comes to Taiwan. Long has this been so. After all, it was conservative foreign minister Alexander Downer who in 2004 questioned the applicability of the U.S. alliance in a Taiwan context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in recent years has something of a divide emerged in Australian politics on Taiwan, with current opposition leader Peter Dutton saying on the record, contra Downer, that Australia would support the United States in a Taiwan conflict — or more precisely, that not doing so would be “inconceivable.” While Dutton may rightly be criticized for seeking to exploit the China challenge for partisan advantage, it should be uncontroversial to express the judgment that the U.S.-Australia alliance would be broken if Australia stood aloof while the United States went to war with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Albanese Labor government has studiously avoided explaining Australia’s defense modernization and the intensification of the U.S. alliance in terms of a hypothetical Taiwan conflict, even though this is a plausible contingency that would profoundly engage Australian interests. Instead, for example, Canberra’s April 2024 National Defence Strategy presents a general case for power projection, deterrent capability, the U.S. alliance, and various Indo-Pacific partnerships — all in terms of preventing future coercion and threats to the connected regional economy on which Australia’s prosperity and survival depend. Some critics of the AUKUS arrangement distort it as a precooked deal to lock an Australian submarine force into a Taiwan war under U.S. command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artificially narrow debate, plus Beijing’s insinuation that closer Australia-Taiwan contact would put stabilization at risk, unhelpfully reduces Taiwan in the minds of many Australians to a source of trouble or a proxy for a U.S. primacy imperative, with no political character, rights, or agency of its own. Instead, Australian governments should not be afraid to remind their people (including the business community) of the truth: Taiwan is a self-ruled and democratic polity with its own complex cultural and political history. It is a vital part of the Indo-Pacific and global economic order, particularly given the critical place of its advanced semiconductor industry in global technology supply chains. Bilaterally, Taiwan is hardly insignificant: it is Australia’s sixth-largest export market for goods and services and its seventh-largest partner in two-way trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan also have in common the fact that they are liberal democratic islands, with similar population sizes of more than 20 million people, which seek to navigate a complex and contested region where many of the other political systems are much less friendly to individual rights. Taiwan upholds the values a democratic and progressive Australia cares for — inclusion, diversity, self-determination, free expression, transparency, accountability, civil liberties, and respect for First Nations peoples — more than anywhere else in Asia. Australians who care about their democracy would also do well to note that Taiwan is a laboratory for identifying and countering electoral manipulation; it functions as an early-warning system for their own and others’ democratic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australias-options&quot;&gt;Australia’s Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current economic relations between Australia and Taiwan are strong and could be bolstered through appropriate ministerial contact. Domestic prosperity and international stability intersect in many portfolios other than the obviously sensitive areas of foreign affairs and defense. Australia could follow New Zealand’s example and negotiate a free trade agreement, plus support Taiwan’s membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a quality trade arrangement where Taiwan eminently belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue, parliamentary engagement, and education are three obvious areas where Australia and Taiwan could do more together to build each other’s awareness and resilience in an era when middle-sized democracies benefit from sharing best practices. Dialogue could occur in the purely informal space of the think tank, or academic “second track,” or in a grayer zone where government observers and even occasionally government-affiliated voices could share their expertise. There is no fundamental reason why private sector experts and representatives of subnational governments could not also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides would benefit enormously from sharing knowledge and policy innovations in such fields as critical infrastructure, supply chains, cybersecurity, and social cohesion. They could thus collaborate in providing security to their economies and societies in ways that do not touch on sensitive questions of diplomatic recognition or military cooperation. Likewise, in preparedness and emergency response — whether against natural disasters and climate impact or more state-directed strategic threats — Australia and Taiwan would find it mutually beneficial to swap notes on their hard-earned experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, parliamentary engagement is a promising avenue. The April 2024 visit to Taiwan by a cross-party group of some of Australia’s most forthright and active parliamentarians is a significant example. It may also be worth considering minilateral variants of parliamentary dialogue that bring together parliamentarians from two or more democracies, such as Japan, the United States, and European nations. Such dialogue would reinforce messages of democratic solidarity while providing cover for any one country should Beijing translate displeasure into punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education provides another channel of connection while also building Taiwan’s capacity. The minilateral Global Cooperation and Training Framework set up in 2015 brings together Australia, Japan, the United States, and Taiwan as education powers and is a logical pathway for Australian education providers to contribute to Taiwan’s resilience while benefiting from its human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia should seek to maximize its use of this channel while encouraging wider participation. The framework provides a potential vehicle for other democratic education powers, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, India, and South Korea, to deepen their connections with Taiwan as part of the global research, teaching, and training ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australia, a stable geopolitical and geoeconomic environment involves much more than a permanently fragile stabilization with China. Australian statecraft has the wit to balance stabilization with the diversified interests and values that define Australia’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-new-era-operational-challenges-to-execute-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Resolving New-Era Operational Challenges to Execute the Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Mick Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the current debate about deterrence and potential war over Taiwan centers on the physical and moral elements of national fighting power. In the physical realm, a stalemate over military assistance in the U.S. Congress, the inability of the West to mobilize the defense industry quickly enough, and the kinds of weapons to be procured for Taiwan’s defense are dominant themes. In the moral arena, debate includes the extension of military service models and the will of the Taiwanese youth to defend their nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a third element must be considered. Generating strategic advantage for Taiwan also demands mobilization of intellectual capacity. The need for this third leg of a twenty-first-century mobilization trinity of industry, people, and ideas is most compellingly demonstrated in the Russo-Ukraine war. After two years of destructive mass warfare in Ukraine and beyond, both sides remain waging a twenty-first-century war with twentieth-century ideas. Any change in the trajectory of that war will require improved and synchronized mobilization of people, industry, and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same challenges and opportunities exist with the defense of Taiwan and deterring Chinese aggression. Until recently, Taiwan has persisted with older ideas about defending itself based on conventional capacity and outdated assumptions about the Chinese military. Having watched events in Ukraine in the past two years, Taiwan has been shocked into reassessing its defense. The Russo-Ukraine war has demonstrated that a smaller yet technologically sophisticated nation can forestall the territorial aspirations of larger authoritarian nations if it has the will to do so. It has breathed new life into an older Taiwanese strategy, the Overall Defense Concept, which anticipated the approach Ukraine adopted after the Russian invasion of February 2022. But this is just a starting point for thinking about the defense of Taiwan. More development is needed, and Taiwan’s partners — particularly think tanks and professional military education institutions — could work collaboratively with Taiwan in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpopular-term-good-concept-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Unpopular Term, Good Concept: The Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Taiwanese admiral Lee Hsi-min proposed the Overall Defense Concept, which redefined how the Taiwanese government views “winning the war” should China seek to absorb Taiwan by force. The core of this revised theory of victory is that winning the war is defined as “fail[ing] the enemy’s mission to occupy Taiwan.” This was a shift in traditional thinking about defense and national security in Taiwan. However, many in the military resisted its implementation. As one article on this topic describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Overall Defense Concept was more popular with American analysts and officials than it was with currently serving Taiwanese generals and admirals. Driven by personal animosity and the fact that true asymmetry undercuts the rationale for pursuing high-profile, high-prestige, and high-cost weapons, these military leaders and civilian enablers purged the Overall Defense Concept as soon as Lee retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unpopularity of the concept in some circles, it remains a more suitable military strategy for a country in Taiwan’s circumstances given the magnitude of changes in China’s conventional military capabilities over the past three decades. Seven key ideas underpin Lee’s theory of victory to ensure that the mission of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to occupy Taiwan fails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abandon the traditional war of attrition and adopt concepts of asymmetric warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and adopt the concept of denial instead of control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shape battle space conditions and engage PLA forces where and when they are at their weakest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on preventing PLA mission successes and attacking their center of gravity rather than on the total destruction of PLA forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent PLA forces from establishing beachheads on Taiwanese soil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better utilize Taiwan’s geography and civilian infrastructure in a holistic plan of defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for and conduct insurgency and other resistance operations to ensure that the PLA — if it can land — cannot effectively control Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phases&quot;&gt;Phases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Overall Defense Concept divides the defense of Taiwan into three key phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The initial phase is a force protection phase. It would include physical hardening, deception, electronic warfare, continuous redeployment of military units, stockpiling, and air and missile defense activities to ensure that Taiwan’s military and civilian infrastructure (and its leadership) can absorb and survive initial PLA air and missile strikes. As Lee writes, “Without proper force protection measures, most of Taiwan’s military power could be destroyed or neutralized in the initial phase of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The second phase is the pursuit of a decisive battle in the littoral. Extending 100 kilometers from the Taiwanese shore, this would integrate shore-based antiship missiles, sea mines, naval warships, and air force aircraft to attack high-value PLA air and maritime targets. Key targets would include large Chinese amphibious ships, command and control nodes (on ships and in the air), and other PLA platforms considered mission critical for a successful amphibious landing. Along with more conventional weapons, an important capability in this phase would be Hsiung Feng missiles mounted on trucks. The missiles would be dispersed in Taiwan’s urban and mountain regions to survive initial PLA strikes and then would be launched at PLA ships during an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3:&lt;/strong&gt; This phase aims to destroy PLA forces landing on beaches in Taiwan. At most, 14 beaches on the Taiwanese mainland are suitable for amphibious landings. Taiwan’s navy would lay sea mines in the waters off these potential landing beaches. A fleet of mine-laying ships is being constructed and launched for this purpose. Concurrently, swarms of small fast-attack boats (crewed and uncrewed), similar to those developed by Ukraine for its Black Sea operations, and truck-launched antiship missiles will engage high-value targets in the PLA invasion force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defense strategy is appropriate for a nation of Taiwan’s geography, location, technological capacity, and human resources, many operational challenges remain to execute this strategy. As the war in Ukraine has demonstrated, new technologies introduced to the modern battlefield have resulted in new war-fighting challenges that are as relevant to Taiwan as they are to Ukraine. The following five key operational challenges provide focus for a mobilization of intellectual capacity in Taiwan, supported by key security partners such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to enhance the implementation of a future version of an Overall Defense Concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating old and new technology. The first challenge is effectively and rapidly integrating new technology (e.g., meshed civil-military sensor networks, drones, and democratized access to digital command systems) with old technology (e.g., tanks, helicopters, and artillery). No military can afford to get rid of all old equipment and recapitalize with new technology; it is a gradual process. But this process can often be unevenly distributed throughout an institution. In particular, the security of data and communications links between different systems is a major challenge. The integration of old and new technologies has tactical, operational, strategic, and institutional elements and relies on growing links between the military and industry as well as faster sharing of battlefield lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The massing versus dispersion predicament. A new-era meshed civil-military sensor framework has resulted in an environment where all the signatures of military equipment, personnel, and collective forces can be detected more accurately and rapidly. When linked to digitized command and control systems and precision munitions, it significantly reduces detection-to-destruction time in military operations. Massing military forces for ground combat operations, large-scale aerial attacks, or naval operations, therefore, becomes a high tactical and operational risk. Even if an array of hard- and soft-kill measures can protect massed forces, they are almost assured of detection, which makes achieving surprise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is equally a challenge in the maritime environment, whether in the Taiwan Strait or in the sea lanes connecting Taiwan and its military partners. Modern military forces must be able to operate in both dispersed and massed forms across domains, and they must minimize their detection signatures when they mass in a way that ensures an improved chance of surprising the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Lowering the cost of defending against missiles and drones. While enormous investments have been made over the past couple of decades in the development of remotely controlled autonomous and semiautonomous uncrewed systems, the capabilities to counter these systems have lagged in investment. This has changed since the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine war, particularly with Ukraine’s introduction of long-range aerial and maritime strike drones and shorter-range battlefield first-person view (FPV) drones. But there remains a massive gap between the capabilities of uncrewed systems and those that counter them. The Chinese missile, rocket, and drone capability deployed within striking distance of Taiwan is even more significant than that deployed by Russia against Ukraine. There remains a large disparity in the cost of missiles and lethal drones and the systems that defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As such, the aim must be not only to reduce the cost of hard- and soft-kill systems but to entirely flip the cost equation. As such, a key operating challenge for Taiwan is to develop a variety of low-cost hard- and soft-kill systems for use against PLA uncrewed vehicles and missiles, which also imposes costs on China, not on those who defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The right balance of long-range strike and close combat. The Overall Defense Concept includes a mix of different short- and long-range combat capabilities. Both are required. But getting the balance of investment in aerial and maritime strike weapons, on one hand, and close combat capacity, on the other, is crucial. As such, a key operational problem for Taiwan and its partners to address is the appropriate balance in the deep battle and the close fight (with appropriate support mechanisms for both). Not only must the balance of investment be mostly right, but there should be an effective operational synchronicity within the Overall Defense Concept between these two military endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Closing with the enemy. Modern combat forces require new-era techniques that are quicker, lower signature, and more survivable at crossing the operational and tactical spaces between them and their objectives. Ukraine’s struggle to penetrate Russian minefields and defensive belts in southern Ukraine exemplifies the failings of current Western military doctrine. Although this might largely be seen as a tactical challenge for ground, air, and naval forces, it is also an operational and strategic problem. How might U.S., Japanese, and other allied forces approach an operational area around Taiwan in a contingency in a way that minimizes detection and targeting by the PLA?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solving-operational-problems&quot;&gt;Solving Operational Problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature on previous military innovations and adaptation provides insights from historically successful military transformations relevant to Taiwan. Some of the most important characteristics of leading successful military transformations in the modern era are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPECIFICITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military organizations need clear ideas of the operational problems to be addressed. As Williamson R. Murray and Allan R. Millett wrote in Military Innovation in the Interwar Period, “A number of factors contributed to successful innovation. The one that occurred in virtually every case was the presence of specific military problems, the solutions of which offered significant advantages to national strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COLLABORATION WITH SECURITY PARTNERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, NATO countries provided support to each other in developing strategic and operational concepts and shared relevant doctrines and technologies. They also developed NATO standards for equipment, training, and logistics. A similar approach will be necessary in the Western Pacific, less the NATO alliance architecture. Support may include input on technological and conceptual lessons from Ukraine and co-development of new technologies and tactics. It should also include joint testing and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TESTING AND EXPERIMENTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an operational problem has been recognized, the nature of the challenge clarified, and the idea to solve it identified, the new ideas for operating concepts must be tested. This is important for several reasons. First, it ensures expensive, time-consuming organizational changes are not launched without some notion of whether they will work. Second, it provides transparency into new ideas, allowing for more robust examination and critique. Finally, experimentation is an important part of building institutional buy-in for change. As Don Starry wrote in “To Change an Army,” “Changes proposed must be subjected to trials. Their relevance must be convincingly demonstrated to a wide audience by experiment and experience, and necessary modifications must be made as a result of such trial outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DIFFERENT MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of successful adaptation is an institutional view of what makes an organization effective in the operational environment. In Winning the Next War, Stephen Peter Rosen found, “Wartime innovation has been most effective when associated with a redefinition of measures of strategic effectiveness by the military organization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBEDDING NEW IDEAS IN DOCTRINE AND INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE TRAINING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When operational problems have been specified and solutions have been tested and approved, these must be embedded in military doctrine. New doctrine is crucial because this is the foundation for all individual and collective training within military institutions. This is the way true institutional change occurs. It ensures that new ideas are standardized across the entire military organization and with security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINKING TACTICAL INNOVATION TO INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New ideas — and the new organizations that accompany them — guide the adaptation of existing materiel and development of new equipment. New operational concepts developed for Taiwan will also require changes in how current equipment is used. It is also likely that new kinds of equipment and munitions will be required. The process that links new ideas and new defense production must be sped up and potentially distributed among Taiwan’s security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-taiwan-deter-aggression-by-providing-war-fighting-solutions&quot;&gt;Helping Taiwan Deter Aggression by Providing War-Fighting Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan should not have to address these operational problems alone. Nations such as Australia, Japan, and the United States can assist Taiwan with evolving its operational concepts, solving difficult military challenges, and implementing a 2020s version of the Overall Defense Concept. Doing so will necessitate rigorous simulation, testing, and experimentation. It will also demand a collaborative Taiwanese security partner approach to developing new methods of effectiveness for war fighting in modern conditions, as well as improved links between military adaptation and rapid industry production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, good political and military leadership is essential to ensuring that the solutions to these issues are embedded into Taiwanese strategic and operational doctrine, individual and collective training methodologies, and promotion systems for senior officers. Given the pace of military development in the PLA, this transformation must be led and executed with one eye on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　若不信納李家田證供　仍須考慮能否肯定為本案串謀者&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周三（21日）在高等法院踏入第77天審訊，法官張慧玲第4天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。官另總結黃振強、彭軍壕轉任從犯證人的經過。其中黃振強稱良心發現希望交代事件，改為認罪，否認為最多50%減刑而作供；黃一度投訴被捕時遭警施襲，但在庭上稱無法界定是否被打。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周二指，自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強事前著隊友毋須帶裝備，但另與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，著陪審團考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與「殺警計劃」。官又指，一被告選擇出庭作供，若陪審團認為其說法真實、可能真實，或未能肯定控方說法，就應裁定罪名不成立；官另指，擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為，亦交由陪審團決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官即使不信納李家田證供-仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&quot;&gt;官：即使不信納李家田證供 仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲周三續總結證供，就案中唯一選擇作供的被告李家田，控方盤問時詳細問及李在「屠龍」群組內的訊息，李遂一解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，控方盤問以顯示李的證供不可信，例如李供稱於示威現場只在旁觀察。官強調，陪審團即使不信納李的證供，認為他有份參與「屠龍」行動，非只在旁觀察，而是衝擊警方及擲汽油彈等，但此屬本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團應先考慮是否信納李的證供，若能肯定控方的說法，認為李不可信，才須考慮其沒被控訴行為，用作背景考慮李是否本案串謀者。官重申，陪審團應考慮控方能否令其肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及他是否曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另提及被告張銘裕和嚴文謙的被捕經過，其中嚴一方稱警方沒宣布拘捕、襲擊嚴等；警員否認。法官強調，由陪審團決定是否相信警員證供，但嚴行使其權利沒出庭作供，故庭上沒證供顯示他曾被打。至於張銘裕則表示「咩都唔知」，警員亦沒搜出與案有關物品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&quot;&gt;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就從犯證人、自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強，法官總括黃由被捕後，至轉任控方證人的經過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，黃投訴被捕時遭警員施襲，但在庭上作供時稱無法界定是否被打，指應交由專家判斷。參與拘捕行動的警員分別作供，指拘捕時黃激烈反抗，故須以武力將其制服，但否認曾「打、嚇、氹」黃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黃的錄影會面，黃承認部分說法與其庭上證供有分歧，例如錄影會面稱不願試槍，故欺騙同謀者吳智鴻指自己受傷；但黃庭上則指，他在中大事件受傷而無法出席試槍。官覆述黃的解釋，指被捕時記憶混亂、狀態差，但否認錄影會面時欺騙警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，黃振強原否認串謀謀殺等罪，至2023年5月時，黃要求會見警員，指希望改認罪和交代事件。官引述，黃供稱良心發現而交代事件，並非為求獲得最多50%減刑而出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另指，黃在盤問下同意，他所承認的認罪案情部分不正確，例如案情指9月的台灣軍訓屬本案串謀一部分，但黃在庭上供稱，於11月才與吳智鴻達成協議，「屠龍」一方加入殺警計劃的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或搞錯咗&quot;&gt;官：須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或「搞錯咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就另一從犯證人彭軍壕，官覆述其證供，彭指得悉吳智鴻等人被捕後，已預料自己亦將被捕，屆時將會認罪。官引述，彭被捕後拒絕提供手機密碼，又指沒特別留意轉任控方證人最高可獲50%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官提及，辯方盤問時特別關注，彭曾去信律政司，指據雙方早前同意（as agreed），將撤銷《反恐條例》下爆炸罪和串謀謀殺的控罪。彭解釋，信件由囚友撰寫，寄出後才發現內容出錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團須考慮，彭是一早與警方達成協議，或是如彭所言「搞錯咗」。官另指，彭父為警署警長，彭供稱沒要求父親與律政司「講數」；而處理本案的警員亦稱，沒因彭父為同袍而對彭「輕手啲」，強調會公平處理各個被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underground in an anonymous building in the Kharkiv Oblast is one reason for Ukraine’s defensive prowess against a numerically stronger and well-armed aggressor. Military teams work from makeshift briefing and ops rooms leading off corridors stacked with dusty and discarded office furniture, intently focused on an array of computers that access, control and act on live feeds from the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attention”, says one member, standing up, his voice slightly raised, and the room instantly stills. “There will be a Russian helicopter attack at 1230”. His warning gives soldiers on the front a mere 10 minutes to pack up their artillery and move it discretely away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a high-stakes gaming saloon, complete with Ninja-pro gaming chairs and many donning heavy metal goth T-shirts. “The toughest lesson”, remarks one commander, codenamed “Cuba”, is the “cost of a mistake, in many cases irreversible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous day, 11 Russian tanks had attacked the Khartiia Brigade positioned north of Kharkiv. Five tanks were knocked out by a mix of missiles, artillery and mines dropped by drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, the unit wargames Russian positions and movements, with intelligence fed by a combination of reconnaissance, open sources, local knowledge and intercepts. A chart with toy soldiers covers the table, while a three-dimensional depiction is screened on the wall behind. The aim is to interpret patterns from even one single troop movement, as the unit tries to discern Russian intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of national survival has transformed some units to enable them to operate at “NATO standard”, one soldier explains. This war is producing, pound for pound, possibly the most effective armed forces in the world in Ukraine – even if not the best-equipped or trained – and certainly the most resourceful, innovative and now with significant battlefield experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this, however, is that the Russians have also learned fast, although not quite at the same tempo as the Ukrainians. Their development of glide-bombs, each with 2,000 kg warheads, now being produced at a monthly rate of 30,000, has delivered a cheap, immensely destructive shock weapon. Russia’s size and improving prowess should keep European defence planners up at night and remind them that they have an enduring strategic stake in Ukraine’s success, no matter how much some Western politicians may want to cut and run from Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-time-to-micro-manage-kyiv&quot;&gt;No Time to Micro-Manage Kyiv&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is not the time to micro-manage the risk in Ukraine’s actions, hold back supplies or maintain strict caveats on the use of equipment, especially against military targets in Russian territory, out of fear that Putin might escalate, perhaps with a nuclear option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Ukrainians have learned that the externally imposed stipulations of keeping the war inside the boundaries of Ukraine have only enabled Russia, and tragically left Ukraine in a lethal war of attrition. It is still too early to say if Kyiv’s surprise military incursion into Kursk Oblast, launched in early August, was the right approach, although it has succeeded in buoying Ukrainian troops and civilians alike, especially after the failure of its vaunted 2023 counteroffensive against stubborn (and closely knit) Russian defences. Ukrainians and allies have all been concerned that the maths of overwhelming Russian numbers would over time only serve to give Russia the upper hand against the plucky but quantitatively disadvantaged Ukrainians. Even though Russia has already suffered 600,000 casualties, with as many as 15–20% of them killed, its population is at least four times that of Ukraine and its economy 15 times the size. This is reflected in comparative mobilisation personnel numbers, as well as the ability of Russia’s defence industry to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian intervention into Kursk has several aims, says Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Kyiv’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, including relieving the pressure on the front elsewhere and offering a physical buffer zone for hard-pressed Ukrainian army units around the eastern town of Sumy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kursk advance offers space for diplomatic brinkmanship to seize the moment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically it also shows, he says, “that we can turn the tide … and show the results to Western taxpayers”. He is hopeful that the Kursk operation will provide a similar impact as the “Prigozhin mutiny”, referring to the drive from Rostov-on-Don towards Moscow in June 2023 by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner Group. It ended in negotiations with a surprised Kremlin, but if nothing else, illustrated just how hollowed out and vulnerable the Russian state is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kursk advance offers space for diplomatic brinkmanship to seize the moment. Until now the political dimension for peace has been behind the military curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linking-war-and-peace&quot;&gt;Linking War and Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s move into Russia should not be seen in isolation from the 10-Point Peace Plan proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But for peace to take root, not only will Ukraine have to demonstrate to the Russians that there is more to be gained from peace than continuing the war, and that there is a method by which this can be achieved, but also that all external powers are pushing the parties to the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Experience”, says Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in a meeting with us in Kyiv in August 2024, “teaches us that Russia only negotiates in good faith when it is placed under pressure, and negotiation is the only option. And we also have learned from our own history that facilitators want to end the war rather at the expense of Ukraine, which is also often true for cases of war in other parts of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enormous challenges remain, not least among the group of states that put narrow interests before people, and where politics trumps human rights. A number of key African and Latin American states, for instance, fall into this category, including Colombia and South Africa. The latter has been willing to pressure Israel over Gaza through the world courts, but not Russia, its ally in BRICS, over its invasion of Ukraine. Egypt and Ethiopia are similarly among the African fence-sitters, indicating as much about their preference for Putin’s type of democracy as their interests in arms transfers and geopolitical allegiances. Brazil and China, with their own peace formula, are running essentially a rival to Ukraine’s own process – one which might even have Russia’s tacit approval as a fellow BRICS country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rival processes usually expect Ukraine to make concessions that China, Brazil or any other BRICS member would be unwilling to concede. Most Ukrainians are committed to a single negotiating principle: the return of all Ukrainian territory as per the 1991 borders, including Crimea. That Ukraine is striving for its sovereignty should be important to African states in particular, given the continental propensity for weak borders that criss-cross ethnic allegiances and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutrality in this war usually means being in favour of Russia. And victory for Russia would lead only to the conclusion that, as Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister, explains to us, “Dictators International would be”. This has consequences for democrats everywhere, from Venezuela to Zimbabwe, as civilians struggle against authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals also matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s demands are not just about territory and its return. As the Ukrainian Nobel laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk clarifies in the same meeting, it offers “an historic opportunity to change the approach to justice for war crimes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War usually visits poor places, making them even poorer. Ukraine’s daily reality of war is brought home walking the streets of Kharkiv, where one drives by ravaged apartments and buildings eviscerated by supersonic missiles, and hears the distant thundering of artillery shells in battlefields north of the city. These distant booms are regularly interrupted by ear-piercing wailing sirens, alerting incoming air raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-costs-of-double-standards&quot;&gt;The Costs of Double-Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of discounting Russia’s wanton destruction of communities across eastern and southern Ukraine lies not only in the loss of civilian lives and destruction of civilian infrastructure. It’s that war puts the interests of the state above – and seemingly beyond – those of the individual, the opposite of the very premise of the human rights regime that followed the Second World War where, in the jurist Hersch Lauterpacht’s words: “The well-being of an individual is the ultimate object of all law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauterpacht was born close to Lemberg, now Lviv, in modern-day Ukraine. Other Ukrainians have taken up the same struggle, not least Matviichuk, whose Center for Civil Liberties has documented more than 78,000 war crimes so far. Digital technologies offer huge advances in tracking perpetrators, from soldiers to commanders and even the silicon chips and production lines responsible for the missiles and drones raining down on Ukrainian cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will need safeguards, such as through eventual Ukrainian membership of the EU and NATO (with NATO-like security guarantees in the interim). The Ukrainian ambition is to achieve the former by 2029 ahead of the next round of European parliamentary elections, confirms Maria Mezentseva, a Rada member from Kharkiv tasked with Euro-Atlantic integration. NATO membership should be easier “since it is a political decision” she says, although admitting Ukraine while it is at war is unlikely. But even if the political risks of inclusion into Alliance remain, the obvious levels of NATO–Ukraine interoperability are routinely demonstrated by the likes of the Khartiia Brigade, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerating-integration&quot;&gt;Accelerating Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion has offered, in this way, an accelerant to Ukraine’s Western integration. This has not only been expedited through accession talks, but also through the movement of people – there are now more than 5 million Ukrainian refugees in Europe – and through the deepening logistics chains with the West, not to mention Ukraine’s now leading position in defence technology innovation. Much remains to be done, not least in improving governance, but the advantages of this inclusion are clear: Ukraine’s per capita wealth is just $2,200, well below the Eurozone average of $37,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of Ukraine’s progress post-war will depend on the continued flow of money, and that will hinge on its role as a bulwark against Russia, but also its capacity to clean up its governance and put in safeguards against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, the priority remains keeping money and arms flowing from the West, while talking peace, a balancing act so far carefully managed by Zelenskyy, with seemingly inexhaustible energy. This is driven by the fear of the costs of failure. When asked what he thinks about first thing in the morning, the governor of the Lviv Oblast, Maksym Kozytskyi, responds, “My overriding daily fear when I wake up is learning that a close friend has been killed. Everything else can be managed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine illustrates just how much technology matters to modern war. Without the internet and advances in drone technology, soldiers would be operating virtually blind. But it is also a reminder of war’s constants, of the importance of logistics, training, mass, manoeuvre and fighting spirit. A Khartiia officer proudly described his troops’ prowess with the Browning “5-oh”, he said, termed a “strategic weapon” by the Russians at its sharp end. But he also bemoaned the shortage of artillery ammunition, especially of “NATO standards”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine itself can do more, not least in mobilising troops, despite improvements through its Reserve-Plus and Army-Plus apps. Only infantry can hold ground, not (yet) drones. Even so, Kyiv feels very different to a wartime city – eerily normal as opposed to some version of London in 1942. Managing debt volumes and spending finances well require sacrifices, everywhere. Sometimes “your best isn’t good enough”, cautioned Churchill. “You must do what is required.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine should take care in this regard not to take offers of outside assistance for granted. Afghanistan is a recent reminder of the fickleness of friendships, no matter the catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-scenarios&quot;&gt;Four Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the ongoing Kursk intervention, leaving out the likelihood of Putin’s departure and Russian economic implosion, four peace scenarios are imaginable. The first would be Ukraine’s ejection of Russia, through military means or negotiations. This requires the on-time delivery of weapons promised by the West and required by Kyiv, and, for its part, Ukraine to turn out more trained and refreshed brigades. The second would be for Kyiv to negotiate from a position of weakness. A third would be to meet Putin’s demands, and not strive for Ukrainian security guarantees through NATO (or EU) membership. But this presumes that Putin abandons what former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko, who survived dioxin poisoning by Russian agents, describes to us as an “imperial project to recreate the Russian empire, an ambition of Putin’s which is impossible without including Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth, wild-card, possibility is that an outsider – Donald Trump (should he win the US election) or even President Xi perhaps – threatens Russia and Ukraine respectively with an escalation and a reduction of support to Kyiv in order to cut a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While militarily fraught with risk, Kursk has successfully changed the narrative of the war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this presumes, of course, that most Ukrainians would back negotiations. While support for Zelenskyy has decreased from his peak of over 90% at the start of 2023 to just 54% in June this year (albeit before the Kursk invasion), fewer Ukrainians support negotiations if they involve conceding post-1991 territory. The share preferring to seek a compromise to negotiate an end to the war fell from 43% to 26% in favour when respondents were asked to choose between negotiating with Russia and continuing to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace will fundamentally be a political decision. “We have lost too many Ukrainian lives”, says the Mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, speaking to us while sirens wail outside, “which is why peace has to be accepted by society as a whole”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoding-kursk&quot;&gt;Decoding Kursk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kursk incursion is intended to offset Russia’s inexorable economic and numerical advantage through surprise, manoeuvre and Ukrainian tactical cunning. Until Kursk, “it appeared that Ukraine was going to fall,” confesses Oleksandr Lytvynenko, a veteran intelligence officer and now the Secretary of Ukraine’s National Defence and Security Council, “one hundred to two hundred metres per day, very slow, but apparently unstoppable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating the tactical opportunity Kursk offers into strategic success will depend on many factors, not least, as Zelenskyy has pointed out, the scale, speed and type of international assistance. “It is undoubtedly important for us that our partners remove the barriers that prevent us from weakening Russian positions as required by the course of the war”, he said on 17 August, 11 days after launching the Kursk operation. “The long-range capabilities of our forces are the answer to all the most important, to all the most strategic issues of this war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this imperative can be added the need to construct a diplomatic case, support and method, maintain current and future economic integrity, and build and rebuild armed forces capable of resisting Russia’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While militarily fraught with risk, Kursk has successfully changed the narrative of the war. Whether that is in itself enough to keep the taps of international support turned on through and beyond the November 2024 US election will depend on Kyiv holding its ground to use as a bargaining chip in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the political spin, support for Ukraine or Russia is about support for or against the current international rules-based order, in particular the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. While Russia and its supporters want to deepen that principle internally, permitting the right to conduct their own affairs free from the threat of international condemnation on the grounds of human rights for example, they want to retain the right to interfere externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Kursk, the stakes have got higher. And they could be raised even further if other similar surprise Ukrainian actions, such as over Crimea or elsewhere, were to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lytvynenko says that Russia’s approach towards his country is premised on the need to reject Ukrainian identity. “But”, he smiles, “we don’t think this way because, axiomatically, we are not Russian”. But he also warns against Ukraine trying to slug it out in perpetuity with Russia, given its relative numerical strength. Rather, Kyiv needs to focus on an asymmetric strategy, fighting a smart war. “We have no territorial claims against Russia”, he adds. “We don’t want to intervene in Russia to change its government or its way of life. We just want to determine our own future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends on success on the battlefield. Given the implications inside and outside Ukraine for the rule of international law, human rights and justice, and even more than Putin deserves defeat, Ukrainians deserve victory.&lt;/p&gt;
