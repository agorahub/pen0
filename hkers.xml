But the unique status of the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard complicates this broad geopolitical framing of the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic is increasingly viewed as an arena for power projection and spillover from conflicts elsewhere. In this regard, the Svalbard archipelago is an important case study because it has economic, scientific, political, and security implications for states in the High North, the United States, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. Svalbard’s unique status as a sovereign territory of Norway with provisions for foreign nationals, Russia’s presence on the territory and its interests at sea, as well as the archipelago’s proximity to critical Russian military locations make Svalbard a potential geopolitical flash point. This brief examines the geopolitics of Svalbard and the security implications for Norway, the United States, and NATO. Through close examination of the archipelago, the authors aim to contribute to a more granular understanding of Arctic geopolitics and how NATO and the United States can best prepare for heightened geopolitical tensions in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on cooperation that has long characterized Arctic politics has deteriorated. During the Cold War, despite the geographical proximity between NATO member Norway and the Soviet Union, a geopolitical equilibrium ensured that interstate clashes in the Arctic were practically nonexistent. In fact, both sides pursued significant scientific collaboration in the region. The early 2000s saw rapid growth in Arctic interest and engagement among Arctic states, including Russia, on everything from economic development to climate research. However, simultaneously, Russia has increased its military presence and activity in the North. After Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, security affairs in the Arctic became more tense, with the final remnants of regional cooperation evaporating after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Moreover, some see Russian overtures to deepen ties with China as strengthening Beijing’s claim of being a “near-Arctic” state and thus posing a challenge to the seven other Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing geopolitical tension in the region warrants closer scrutiny by European High North countries, the NATO alliance, and the United States. Few case studies embody this development better than Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago with an area about twice the size of Belgium and located approximately 650 kilometers north of the Norwegian mainland and just 1,000 kilometers from the North Pole. An analysis of the links between geography and power politics around Svalbard — Norway’s northernmost territory, with a unique political and economic status — reveals the complexity of the geopolitical competition in the Arctic, and how simple depictions of conflict/no-conflict scenarios can be unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Svalbard’s unique regional position is especially pertinent. The archipelago has significant strategic importance, as its location could be crucial to controlling access to and from Russia’s Northern Fleet on the Kola Peninsula, which houses Russia’s strategic nuclear submarines. Waters around Svalbard also contain plentiful fish stocks, such as cod and shrimp, and extensive deposits of metal minerals. Melting ice will gradually improve access to some of these resources and may facilitate an increase in shipping activity in this part of the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Russia is particularly attentive to the implications of climate change for the commercial development of the Northern Sea Route, which offers a shortcut for vessels traveling between Europe and Asia, primarily along the Russian Arctic coast. However, even in the Arctic, where a melting icescape presents new opportunities for states to maneuver, overly broad framings of the geopolitical rivalry term are often too simplistic. Instead, it is imperative to more closely examine specific cases of geopolitical competition and rivalry in the North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The archipelago has significant strategic importance, as its location could be crucial to controlling access to and from Russia’s Northern Fleet on the Kola Peninsula, which houses Russia’s strategic nuclear submarines.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both scholarly and journalistic works tend to misunderstand the sovereignty of Svalbard and its associated geopolitical dimensions. Despite Norway having “full and absolute sovereignty” over Svalbard, according to the Svalbard Treaty, misconceptions abound regarding Svalbard as a “shared space” or Svalbard’s legal status being ambiguous. Another dubious claim is that the “Norwegian interpretation of the Svalbard treaty is disputed by its other signatories.” Moreover, some argue the archipelago is shrouded in “NATO ambiguity” and question whether it is covered by the alliance’s territorial security guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statements such as these are inaccurate and obscure the legal and political situation surrounding Svalbard. They seem to confuse the ambiguity concerning the archipelago’s maritime zones with a more fundamental dispute about Norwegian sovereignty of the territory writ large and — unintentionally or deliberately — amplify a narrowly circumscribed issue while ignoring other geopolitical dimensions concerning Svalbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to overcome this inaccuracy is to examine the more tangible geopolitical dimensions of Svalbard in international politics. These include (1) explicit challenges to Norwegian policies on land, (2) disagreement over the legal status (sovereign rights) of the maritime zones, and (3) the potential military use of Svalbard in a larger conflict with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context-political-history-of-svalbard&quot;&gt;Context: Political History of Svalbard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of Svalbard’s unique legal status may be traced to its role as a locus for commerce and trade centuries ago. Initially named Spitsbergen by the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz in the sixteenth century, the archipelago was renamed Svalbard by Norway in 1925, while Spitsbergen is now the name of the archipelago’s largest island. Only in the early twentieth century, when promising discoveries of coal were made and mines were established, were negotiations opened to establish an administration of the Svalbard archipelago, at first driven by Norway’s wish to define the territory’s legal status after the dissolution of its union with Sweden in 1905. Although various models were discussed before World War I, postwar negotiations in 1920 resulted in the Spitsbergen Treaty (here referred to as the Svalbard Treaty), which confirmed Norway’s sovereignty over the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gMLB5aF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Svalbard in the European High North.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After affirming Norway’s full and absolute sovereignty and responsibility for managing the islands, the treaty attempts to secure the economic interests of foreign nationals as a key objective. This was done by including provisions on equal rights and nondiscrimination in the most relevant economic activities at the time. For example, Norway may not treat other nationals less favorably than its own citizens in certain areas, and taxes levied on Svalbard in connection with mining may be used solely for local purposes. Moreover, the islands may not be used for “warlike purposes,” and no military fortifications may be built on the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union was not present during the treaty negotiations due to its ongoing civil war, so the one concern at the time was whether the Soviets would challenge the treaty, given their geographic proximity to the area and claims of historic use. In 1924, however, the Soviet government unconditionally and unilaterally recognized Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago and acceded to the treaty in 1935. The Soviet Union made several attempts to gain special status on Svalbard in the aftermath of World War I and later in 1944 with a suggestion by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov to Norwegian foreign minister Trygve Lie that the treaty should be scrapped in favor of a bilateral arrangement. However, Norway firmly rejected this suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International economic interest in Svalbard plummeted before World War II, and soon only Norwegian and Soviet mining companies conducted economic activities there. Consecutive Norwegian governments have sought to maintain the Norwegian population on the islands, predominantly by subsidizing coal mining with the state-owned company Store Norske and supporting the islands’ largest community, Longyearbyen. Similarly, successive governments in Moscow sought to maintain a sizeable Soviet population through the state-owned mining company Arktikugol in the company towns Barentsburg, Pyramiden, and Grumant — of which only Barentsburg is active today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-changing-landscape-the-geopolitical-relevance-of-svalbard&quot;&gt;A Changing Landscape: The Geopolitical Relevance of Svalbard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As interest in Arctic issues has risen over the last decades, Svalbard and its special legal provisions, economic history, and geostrategic location have received considerable attention. Three specific geopolitical dimensions warrant further examination from both Norwegian and Transatlantic observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-challenges-to-norwegian-svalbard-policies&quot;&gt;1. Challenges to Norwegian Svalbard Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Norway’s sovereignty over Svalbard is undisputed, there have been debates since 1920 about how Norway adheres to the treaty and implements its provision. As the sovereign, Norway regulates all activities in the archipelago, but citizens and companies from a number of other countries operate there. Over time, the critique from some treaty signatories over alleged treaty breaches has grown as Norway has implemented stricter environmental regulations, increased the coordination of research activities, and limited certain types of activities, especially with concern for the fragile environment on the archipelago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaints have primarily come from the Soviet Union and, later, Russia — the only country with a sizeable albeit declining population and distinct communities in the archipelago. These complaints have focused on Russian companies not being allowed to use helicopters beyond mining activities, expansion of environmental regulation, creation of national parks, and questions concerning the use of a satellite station for military purposes. One additional issue that has attracted Chinese interest in Svalbard has been Norwegian efforts through the Norwegian Polar Institute to better coordinate research in Ny-Ålesund, a small research settlement on the island of Spitsbergen. Here, China expressed concerns over whether Norway was overreaching in regard to its treaty obligations to foreign entities. As China has increasingly engaged with Arctic politics and governance, it has also become increasingly concerned with its “rights” and “interests” on Svalbard. This is reflected in China’s 2018 Arctic policy, which, despite its status as a near-Arctic state, invokes provisions of the Svalbard Treaty six times to legitimize certain Chinese rights in the Arctic writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge has been Russian complaints about Norway using Svalbard for military purposes in breach of Article 9 of the treaty, which states, “Norway undertakes not to create nor to allow the establishment of any naval base in the territories specified in Article 1 and not to construct any fortification in the said territories, which may never be used for warlike purposes.” The Norwegian coast guard docks in Longyearbyen to resupply, and the Norwegian navy sends a frigate to Svalbard regularly to highlight Norwegian sovereignty and capability in the area. Russia, in turn, argues this is a challenge to the Svalbard Treaty, though the treaty does not hinder Norway having military presence on or around the archipelago as long as the purpose is not “warlike.” Russian sensitivities to the question of military activity on Svalbard relate not only to the treaty but primarily to the proximity of Svalbard to the Northern Fleet on the Kola Peninsula and its strategic position to defend Arctic territory and project power in the Greenland, Iceland, and United Kingdom–Norway (GIUK-N) gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar complaints have come from Russia concerning the Norwegian satellite station located on Svalbard, one of the largest in the world, which has prompted Russia to question whether the data gathered are being used for warlike purposes. Norway is obviously sensitive to such protests given its treaty obligations in Svalbard and the broader long-standing but fragile tranquility that has existed in the Arctic region. However, Norway has consistently manifested its treaty obligations to limit military activity for warlike purposes on Svalbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aKZeMgq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Telecommunications domes of KSAT, Kongsberg Satellite Services, on a mountain near Longyearbyen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While complaints such as these from Russia or China do not directly erode Norwegian sovereignty, the sum of the complaints could amount to a larger challenge to how Norway adheres to the treaty. In addition, Russia — if it wanted to escalate a conflict while retaining some form of plausible deniability — could initiate actions to undermine Norwegian sovereignty using these complaints as justification. Notably, the Russian consul general in Barentsburg recently led a highly symbolic military-style parade that involved a helicopter and dozens of vehicles waving Russian flags to mark the anniversary of the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. Albeit primarily done as a way to get attention by the new director of the Russian state-owned mining company Trust Arktikugol, Ildar Neverov, this event does highlight the increasingly tense relations on Svalbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statements from Russia regarding Svalbard seem to continually support an underlying policy of strategic uncertainty concerning both challenges to Norwegian rules and regulations on Svalbard and Russia’s legal position when it comes to the maritime zones around Svalbard. At the same time, it is unlikely that undermining the Svalbard regime at large or dispelling the treaty itself is in Russia’s interest. Russian companies and actors respect Norwegian sovereignty and authority in practice. As the only other country with a sizable population on Svalbard and with interests in various economic activities ranging from coal mining to tourism and fisheries, the status quo suits Russian economic interests as well as Russia’s desire to ensure the Barents Sea region remains politically stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While complaints such as these from Russia or China do not directly erode Norwegian sovereignty, the sum of the complaints could amount to a larger challenge to how Norway adheres to the treaty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-challenges-to-norwegian-jurisdiction-around-svalbard&quot;&gt;2. Challenges to Norwegian Jurisdiction around Svalbard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is an ongoing disagreement over the status of the maritime zones around the territory beyond 12 nautical miles from the archipelago’s shores. The question is whether the 200-nautical-mile maritime zone and the continental shelf around Svalbard are covered by the provisions in the 1920 Svalbard Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the European Union, in particular, has been a proponent of the former view — that the fisheries protection zone (FPZ) and shelf are subject to Norwegian jurisdiction but that Norway must adhere to the Svalbard Treaty’s provisions. This issue came about because of a dispute between Norway and the European Union over the right to fish for snow crabs since 2015, which led to another dispute over cod quotas from 2020 that emerged as a result of Brexit. Russia has taken a different approach, maintaining a form of strategic ambiguity or uncertainty as to its position, while arguing that Norway could not establish any zone unilaterally and thus only, flag states have jurisdiction over fishing vessels in the FPZ. Regarding the shelf, however, Russia argues that it is covered by treaty provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two aspects of this dispute with potential to further intensify geopolitical competition in the region. The first relates to access to resources and possible attempts by fishing vessels from various countries to claim their treaty-protected rights, as exemplified with the European Union in the snow crab case. China, which has the world’s largest fishing fleet, could hypothetically also assert itself on this issue through possible Chinese claims to equal access to fishing rights, though no official attempts have been made so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second issue is the possible escalation of interactions in the FPZ between Russian vessels and the Norwegian coast guard. Although escalation when interacting with Russian fishing vessels is the primary concern, questions are increasingly being asked about the activities of Russian vessels at large in Norwegian waters. For example, in January 2022, one of the two subsea cables crucial for information technology on Svalbard was cut after Russian fishing vessels had been operating extensively in the area. Although Norwegian authorities have not publicly identified the perpetrator, many have speculated the incident is connected to Russian intelligence gathering and hybrid activity in the Norwegian Arctic. With the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September 2022, this issue became increasingly relevant in the Norwegian security and defense debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating the matter is the fact that both fishing and research vessels from Russia have access rights to Norwegian waters that are difficult to curtail. The fishing vessels’ ability to fish throughout the Barents Sea regardless of zonal boundaries constitutes one of the core pillars of the successful comanagement scheme of fisheries cooperation between Norway and Russia. The research vessels’ access to the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the FPZ, and the shelf rests on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Article 246, which states, “The coastal State should normally grant its consent” except in a few specific circumstances. In other words, the burden of proof concerning Russian vessels conducting illegal activities in Norwegian waters including the FPZ lies with Norwegian authorities. This creates a significant operational and bureaucratic hurdle for Norwegian law enforcement and limits Norway’s deterrence of Russian gray zone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making inspections and possible arrests in Svalbard’s waters particularly sensitive is Russia’s refusal to acknowledge the FPZ as waters where Norway has the authority to inspect and arrest — although in practice Russian fishers generally accepts inspections by the Norwegian coast guard. Still, in a tenser security environment, the concern has been that Russia could claim that Norway is exceeding its jurisdiction if Norwegian authorities inspect and arrest a Russian vessel. In turn, Russia could respond by threatening to use military force, as it has previously hinted at when Russian fishing vessels were arrested in the FPZ by the Norwegian coast guard in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-military-use-of-svalbard-in-an-east-west-conflict&quot;&gt;3. The Military Use of Svalbard in an East-West Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the role Svalbard might play in a large-scale conflict that involves the Arctic cannot be ignored. Although Article 9 in the Svalbard Treaty states that the area should not be used for “warlike purposes” — which is not the same as a de-militarized zone — the degree of concern over the possible use of the archipelago for military purposes has historically fluctuated with the degree of East-West tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was particularly concerned about the possible military use of the archipelago, demanding strict adherence to the treaty’s ban on the use of the islands for warlike purposes including the establishment of fortifications or naval bases. If war were to break out, control over Svalbard would have been the primary motivation for the Soviets, both to limit NATO command and to use it as a base for Russian military forces in order to protect strategic submarines with nuclear ballistic missiles. This was the central component of the Soviet Union’s bastion defense concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nP2zgi3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian flags flying in the miners’ town of Barentsburg on May 7, 2022. Sign in foreground reads “our goal is communism” in Russian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased Russian military activity in the European Arctic since 2005 has highlighted Svalbard’s geostrategic location. Although there are no military fortifications on the archipelago as per the Svalbard Treaty, the concern for Norway is that it would rapidly be subject to Russian attempts to control it if a full-scale conflict between NATO and Russia broke out. The archipelago’s proximity to the Russian Northern Fleet, located at Severomorsk in the Kola Peninsula, and Svalbard’s strategic position as a potential base for so-called antiaccess and area denial (A2AD) operations in the Barents Sea and the North Atlantic are still the primary drivers of Russian security interests in the region. Some are questioning whether Svalbard truly holds such a strategic position given the technological advancements in Russia’s long-range ballistic missiles and the change in defense concepts in the North. Regardless, it seems likely that Svalbard will remain a potential area for Russian power projection, as Russia will likely be intent on rebuilding its Arctic force posture and capabilities attrited in Ukraine and in response to Sweden and Finland’s NATO memberships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threat-landscape-russia-vis-à-vis-norway-and-nato&quot;&gt;Threat Landscape: Russia vis-à-vis Norway and NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a Norwegian defense planner or policymaker, the main security concern in regard to Svalbard will undoubtedly remain Russia. Across all the geopolitical dimensions highlighted above, the Russian threat looms large since the military use of the archipelago is relevant only in a NATO-Russia conflict. It is rather unthinkable that other EU or NATO states would significantly impede Norway’s territorial sovereignty in the territory through either covert or military action. Moreover, other potential adversaries in a large-scale conflict (e.g., China) are too far removed from Svalbard to pose any short- to medium-term threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-scale challenges to Norwegian policy on land or jurisdiction at sea, however, include a range of actors that could pose a challenge other than just Russia. As mentioned, the most active challenge to the Norwegian position regarding maritime zones in recent years has come from the European Union and some of its member states: first, over access to snow crab fisheries and, second, over the share of cod quotas in the FPZ after Brexit. It is also possible to imagine countries other than Russia and EU member states, such as China, moving to challenge the Norwegian position or claiming equal rights to economic activity in the water column or on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, from a geopolitical perspective, Russia remains the primary security concern due to the high number of Russian fishing vessels operating in the zone each year in accordance with the comanagement regime of shared fish stocks in the Barents Sea. Despite the one-time issue over Chinese protests regarding research, the same conclusion holds for possible disputes on land over Norwegian policies and alleged violations of the Svalbard Treaty by Russian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Russian geopolitical threat remains paramount, Chinese encroachments facilitated by an isolated Russia may complicate the Arctic security landscape in the longer term. The coast guard agencies of Russia and China recently signed a cooperation agreement on strengthening maritime law enforcement to great fanfare in Murmansk, a city on Russia’s western flank close to Norway. Moreover, when all other Arctic coast guard agencies suspended their participation in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, Russia invited China to join the forum — clear signs of China’s expanding presence in the High North. As Iris A. Ferguson, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and global resilience, has put it, Chinese efforts aim “to normalize its presence and pursue a larger role in shaping Arctic regional governance and security affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the Russian geopolitical threat remains paramount, Chinese encroachments facilitated by an isolated Russia may complicate the Arctic security landscape in the longer term.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-us-policy&quot;&gt;Recommendations for U.S. Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region, the administration under U.S. president Joseph Biden sent a strong and clarifying signal that it would prioritize the region. The strategy effectively updates the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region and is organized around four pillars of action: security, climate change and environmental protection, sustainable economic development, and international cooperation and governance. Regarding the security pillar, the strategy aims to expand the military and civilian capabilities necessary to protect U.S. interests in the Arctic — for example, through increasing the U.S. Coast Guard’s icebreaker fleet. While the strategy states that “the US seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative,” it also recognizes that rising geopolitical tension, especially following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, may bring geopolitical competition to the Arctic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these considerations in mind, the United States should pursue the following course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-push-for-a-coordinated-nato-approach-with-special-consideration-for-svalbard&quot;&gt;1. Push for a coordinated NATO approach with special consideration for Svalbard.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, Svalbard’s geographical position could be central in controlling access to and from Russia’s Northern Fleet on the Kola Peninsula, which houses Russia’s fleet of nuclear submarines and is Washington’s primary focus in the High North. Thus, Washington needs to recognize that Svalbard represents a potential flash point in a looming Arctic power struggle and should work with Norway to tailor deterrence in a manner that minimizes the impact on the archipelago’s unique legal status. This approach should carefully balance a robust defensive posture while taking Svalbard’s status into account to minimize the risk of further military tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the risk of the Kremlin using Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty as pretext to escalate any expanded NATO presence, the alliance should credibly signal its intention to minimize capability development and military exercises in or around Svalbard. To avoid compromising overall deterrence, this restraint should be complemented by a strong amphibious force in mainland Norway, including through military exercises responding to conventional Russian escalation in or around Svalbard. Part of this effort could be built into NATO’s biannual Cold Response exercises, which Norway hosts to test allied troops’ ability to fight and survive in an Arctic environment. At the same time, clarifying that NATO’s Article 5 covers Svalbard as part of Norwegian territory is important to avoid any strategic ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major diplomatic line of effort could also be achieving alliance-wide consensus on Svalbard Treaty applicability of Svalbard’s maritime zones. This means resolving the ongoing dispute between Norway and the European Union to avoid Russian exploitation of an allied rift possibly in favor of the Norwegian position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-work-with-regional-allies-to-strengthen-resilience-of-critical-infrastructure-such-as-fiber-optic-cables-on-the-arctic-seabed&quot;&gt;2. Work with regional allies to strengthen resilience of critical infrastructure, such as fiber-optic cables on the Arctic seabed.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent CSIS brief examining the Russian Arctic threat after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine notes that Russia’s use of hybrid tactics in the region “seems to be increasing in both frequency and severity.” These fears are first perhaps best exemplified by the severing of a critical subsea information technology (IT) cable serving Svalbard while Russian fishing vessels were operating extensively nearby. Norwegian authorities have also arrested several Russian nationals for illegal photography across the country and have observed unannounced drone sightings over Svalbard. Western stakeholders seemed to acknowledge this vulnerability following the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, especially given Norway’s importance as Europe’s main pipeline gas supplier. In fall 2022, Norway deployed its Home Guard to protect critical maritime infrastructure, a move that was supported by NATO ship patrols in the North Sea. The U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region also recognizes the need to address this risk, stating Washington’s intent to “make targeted investments to strategically enhance security infrastructure as required to enable these aims, while building the resilience of critical infrastructure to protect against both climate change and cyberattacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the depleting effects of Western sanctions and the weakened state of Russia’s Arctic forces, if tensions between NATO and Russia continue to escalate, it would be reasonable to expect the Kremlin to increase its use of hybrid tactics around Svalbard, at least in the short- to medium-term. Sporadic ad hoc initiatives to counter Russian hybrid threats may thus fall short of the mark and would benefit from a more structured NATO approach. For example, NATO can facilitate regional tabletop exercises spanning the political and military spectrum that incorporate hybrid elements into conventional military scenarios. Other options include improved consultation and information-sharing channels between allies, government institutions, and the private sector to enhance initial detection and response to emerging hybrid crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-establish-the-acceptable-scope-of-regional-governance-specifically-the-role-of-china&quot;&gt;3. Establish the acceptable scope of regional governance, specifically the role of China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States should attempt to preserve what remains of the Arctic’s geopolitical exceptionalism — the increasingly tenuous status quo that has historically excluded hard security issues from regional governance. This should include building upon the resumption of limited work in the Arctic Council, announced in June 2022 by seven of the council’s eight member states — Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Part of this effort should also address China’s growing ambitions in the Arctic and their implications for Svalbard. The United States should emphasize that China, as a near-Arctic state, is welcome to engage with regional stakeholders on environmental issues and sustainable economic development in the Arctic, including through its legitimate research activities on Svalbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States and Norway should clearly signal that any undue Chinese encroachment into the governance and security affairs of the European High North will not be tolerated. It should be noted that the manifestation of Arctic geopolitical tension is not uniform across the circumpolar region. Rather, military activity in the Arctic is constrained to various subregions, most prominently the High North/North Atlantic region and the North Pacific/Bering Sea region. In the former, Russia’s military buildup of the Northern Fleet and surrounding forces factors into the Kremlin’s larger geostrategic competition with the West and is linked to nuclear deterrence capabilities and access to the Atlantic writ large. In the latter region, Russia’s military buildup contributes to increased bilateral cooperation with China and highlights the belated U.S. awakening to Arctic security and geopolitical issues on its northwestern periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the actions and related effects of Chinese actors in the Arctic so far have been rather limited, China has increasingly attempted to gain a foothold and influence in various parts of the Arctic and in different branches of Arctic economic activity. China’s interests do not necessarily align with those of Western Arctic states, though when it comes to specific economic projects in the Arctic, Chinese investments and capital might still be in demand and warranted. The effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 are likely spur more China-Russia cooperation in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This risk of undue Chinese encroachment into the European High North is particularly acute in regard to the closer cooperation announced between the Chinese and Russian coast guards. China’s coast guard has displayed a tendency for aggressive behavior, exemplified by Chinese vessels recently blocking and threatening a Philippine patrol vessel in the South China Sea. China has developed expansive sovereignty claims over the South China Sea, most of which were rejected at a tribunal brought against China by the Philippines under UNCLOS in 2016 at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. A flotilla of Chinese vessels also recently entered a gas site operated by Vietnamese and Russian state firms in Vietnam’s EEZ. Similar Sino-Russian cooperation in the maritime domain has already manifested elsewhere in the Arctic region as the U.S. Coast Guard encountered Chinese and Russian warships operating together near Alaska on several occasions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While unlikely in the short term, the Chinese and Russian coast guards could increase their presence in the Barents Sea in the long term, possibly using the legitimate presence of Chinese and Russian nationals and entities in or around Svalbard as pretext. This approach would not be dissimilar to Russian operations to protect Russian nationals in South Ossetia and Crimea. The United States and Norway should be cognizant of this dubious track record and clearly signal that any similar encroachments will not be tolerated in the waters around Svalbard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of Arctic security often fail to examine specific issues of concern, exemplified by an often-counterproductive framing used to discuss the Svalbard archipelago. Research and discussions about such potential flashpoints and their related issues are needed to dispel commonly held misconceptions, especially when it comes to understanding sovereignty and sovereign rights, as well as distinguishing between different types of security threats and potential conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the 1920 Svalbard Treaty, which Russia has acceded to and has not challenged, sovereignty over the area is undisputed. As part of Norwegian territory, Svalbard is also unequivocally covered by NATO’s Article 5. Given the heightened tensions between Russia and the West, Norway must work with the United States and other allies to clearly refute any misconceptions about NATO ambiguity on the archipelago. This work should start at home by cementing a shared understanding of the legal and political complexities of Svalbard issues within the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arctic security studies often generalize, leading to sweeping conclusions that do not consider regional complexity and disparate security challenges north of the Arctic Circle. Closely examining specific Arctic environments such as Svalbard is necessary for a more granular understanding of regional geopolitics and how possible conflict scenarios might unfold in the North.&lt;/p&gt;

The discussion gathered 30 participants (governmental and non-governmental organisations) at the Permanent Mission of Estonia to the UN for a dialogue on ransomware, crisis prevention and responsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the dialogue discussed what constitutes the international peace and security threshold for ransomware incidents. The second part reflected on the implementation of existing norm that notes that states should respond to requests for assistance when facing a cyber incident. This report provides an overview of the main points raised during the workshop as well as recommendations for future dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ransomware incidents have captured the attention of both developed and developing economies. While incidents vary in complexity, when successful, they can deliver nation-wide crippling effects. As many cases have shown, governments have become a particular target of many ransomware groups, leaving departments, critical infrastructures, essential services and entire local governments unable to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the context of the OEWG, several member states have highlighted the importance of recognising ransomware as an emerging threat in the context of international peace and security. While important, this also raises challenges, such as determining when and what qualifies as a ransomware incident beyond the criminal sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the event was threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share/reflect on lessons learned from responding to and recovering from ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discuss how the OEWG’s work should/could reflect such a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examine how experiences of responding to and recovering from incidents could help shape future cooperative and coordinated responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ransomware has been recognised in the 2023 Annual Progress Report (APR) – a consensus report annually discussed and negotiated by member states engaged in this process – one of the continuous challenges for the OEWG (and the future Programme of Action (PoA)) is to understand how to go beyond adding new emerging threats to the list and effectively address them in a constructive manner within the scope of the UN First Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussions, the following indicators were considered when reflecting on when a ransomware incident could cross the international peace and security threshold: scale, scope and speed, impact, motivation and funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, representatives discussed the implementation of norm 13(h) on requests for assistance and how to foster coordination and collaboration to support ransomware recovery. The following priority areas emerged during the dialogue: ensure cross-government awareness of the criticality of the incident in a timely and effective manner; strengthen coordination among states providing and/or seeking to provide support to the victim state; and develop sustainable capacities for countries to proactively monitor and respond to incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop discussion illustrates that context-sensitive discussions can provide further understanding of the activities and challenges underpinning the practice of responsible behaviour in cyberspace by developed and developing countries as well as state and non-state actors. In exploring ransomware specifically, the dialogue engaged representatives in a detailed and practical assessment of lessons learned and the human, technological, contextual and procedural challenges involved in providing responses to large-scale incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-crime-to-international-peace-and-security-when-and-where-to-draw-the-line&quot;&gt;From Crime to International Peace and Security: When and Where to Draw the Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often ransomware is associated with criminal groups and activities. Criminal actors have made use of ransomware for multiple purposes such as financial gain, data theft and exfiltration, and disruption of operations and espionage, among others. However, as these groups have increasingly sought to disrupt public entities and critical services, additional considerations on what might differentiate the criminal and national security dimensions of ransomware require further attention. Countries such as Costa Rica, the US, the UK and others have already highlighted the risk that ransomware poses to national security. During the workshop, other states, such as El Salvador and Switzerland, also noted the high priority of ransomware within the international agenda and their own domestic cyber threat landscapes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, member states have reiterated the importance of ransomware incidents within the context of the OEWG. However, the fact that, despite widespread reference to it, ransomware was only referenced in this year’s APR instead of last year’s, is perhaps indicative that there are elements that still merit further discussion. As cases, victim countries and tactics continue to evolve, states should consider what distinguishes the criminal and the international peace and security dimensions of ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first part of the discussion, member states and stakeholders were invited to reflect on what constitutes the international peace and security threshold for ransomware incidents. To kick off the dialogue, Costa Rica and Vanuatu shared their experiences of being at the forefront of disruptive and notorious ransomware incidents. Following that, other states and representatives engaged in the discussion, providing their own views on what should inform the delineation (or lack thereof) of the international peace and security threshold for assessing ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first part of the dialogue, participants addressed the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidents such as the one faced by Vanuatu and Costa Rica have shed important light on the disproportionate impact of ransomware on a national economy and government functions. From national experience, what is the internal “tipping point” when the incident shifts from criminal/law enforcement issue to a national security issue?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on those national experiences, what kinds of factors differentiate the prosecution of ransomware incidents within the criminal law from those that reach an international peace and security threshold?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are potential qualifiers that could support future OEWG discussions?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-peace-and-security-indicators-for-ransomware-incidents&quot;&gt;International Peace and Security Indicators for Ransomware Incidents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators were highlighted by participants as potential determinants for differentiating the criminal scope from the national and international security scope of ransomware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale, Scope and Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first set of indicators raised by government representatives was scale, scope and speed. In the case of Costa Rica, for example, the fact that incidents hit “hard and fast” with more than 20 ministries targeted, with nine of them becoming severely impacted, clearly showcases the disproportionate reach and disruptive effects that ransomware may bring about in the public sector. For Vanuatu, the incident, which took place less than a month after the new government had been elected, affected a wide range of government entities, all gov.vu email and domains, as well as reportedly leaving citizens “scrambling to carry out basic tasks like paying tax, invoicing bills and getting licenses and travel visas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants noted that ransomware, although important, would be more clearly demarcated as an international peace and security issue when connected with critical infrastructure (CI) or disruption of essential services. Given the extensive references to CI in previous Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and OEWG reports, ransomware mitigation experiences would help states understand how CI norms are implemented, tested and challenged. It was also pointed out that ransomware incidents may raise questions related to the applicability of international law to cyberspace – for example, whether such an incident could entail a breach of sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an evidence and experience-based dialogue on scale, scope and speed indicators highlighted the different levels of prioritisation of the threat by governments. States present at the event that have not been severely affected by ransomware noted that there is little incentive for them to treat ransomware as a national security threat by default. Rather they assess it on a case-by-case basis – which shows that despite the agreement on indicators, views differ on the use of the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on scale, scope and speed is indissociable from the evaluation of the impact or effects of such incidents. In addition to economic loss and scale of disruption, states noted that they will consider incidents a national security concern when they have a “damaging and destabilising effect”, as well as when there is any threat to life. In the case of the latter, one participant suggested that “the impact of the incident matters more than the mechanism”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Costa Rica, the scale of economic damage extends far beyond the requested amount for the ransom. Criminals initially asked for $10–20 million but attacks against the treasury resulted in an estimated loss of $38–62 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As raised by Vanuatu, small island countries are even more susceptible to ransomware incidents – where the economic impacts can be comparable to those of natural disasters. Other states reiterated the importance of dealing not only with immediate unavailability of access to data but being more attentive to the medium to longer-term impacts such as the one highlighted by Vanuatu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some states noted that carefully assessing and evaluating the motivations of malicious groups is fundamental to the classification of an incident as a national security threat. As highlighted by Costa Rica, the fact that the criminal group had been sending messages to the government saying that “we are determined to overthrow the government by means of a cyber attack, we have already shown you all the strength and power” was particularly illustrative of threat actor motivations when assessed in conjunction with the disruption caused and persistence of the activities conducted by the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Vanuatu, motivation and intention became evident because malicious actors not only harvested data but sought to use it as leverage to perpetrate other attacks. It shows that despite the criminal activities of extortion and exfiltration, these actors wanted not only to go after government services, but to exploit other sectors too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives highlighted the importance of states effectively prosecuting criminal groups. If there are government links to funding groups that are conducting ransomware-as-a-service or other malicious activities, some participants stated that this relates more to the international security realm. Representatives recognised the added value of strategies to investigate groups by “following the money”. Further dialogue among states is required to better understand the relationship between criminal prosecution mechanisms and sanctions vis-à-vis the framework for responsible state behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reserving the Right Not to Define the Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives also noted that despite the importance of distinguishing criminal, national security and international peace and security dimensions of ransomware and other emerging threats, states might wish not to publicly indicate what the threshold is – and to therefore retain the option of determining what and when an incident meets the national security concern on a case-by-case basis. Determining the threshold might also be dependent on political prioritisation (or lack thereof) and/or level of capacity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision to not determine the threshold provides strategic ambiguity for the state to respond to criminal groups or state-linked actors. At the same time, determining the threshold too clearly could signal permissibility – anything below the threshold would not be as strongly prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed during the event, wherever the threshold may lie, the discussion should centre around when and under which circumstances criminal mechanisms should be complemented by international ones. Further dialogue on responses to ransomware would help determine what kinds of incidents relate to the scope of the OEWG. States should continue to review/share case studies to understand the evaluation and the consistency of indicators used for the assessment of ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-international-cyber-crisis-assistance-from-lessons-learned-to-effective-coordination-in-prevention-and-response&quot;&gt;Enhancing International Cyber Crisis Assistance: From Lessons Learned to Effective Coordination in Prevention and Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the consensus report of the UN GGE introduced a voluntary commitment from states to “respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another state whose critical infrastructure has been subject to malicious ICT [information and communications technology] acts” (norm 13(h)). Governments have been increasingly collaborating to respond to incidents in conflict and crisis scenarios as they relate to cyber activities. Across regions, they have been devising different models and strategic partnerships to strengthen approaches that can bolster resilience, enhance capacities and sustain responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different types of assistance depending on the severity, type and context of a case. One dimension of requests for assistance, and perhaps more “traditionally” so, is tied to capacity building projects – concentrating in areas such as the development of national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and the establishment of early warning systems. However, the proliferation of large-scale incidents against multiple government bodies such as Costa Rica, Vanuatu, Montenegro, Moldova, Albania and other countries propelled discussions into a slightly different arena of transnational cooperation and rapid response mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the use of malicious ICT tools in crises and conflict zones, such as in the case of Ukraine, has resulted in yet another set of modalities for cooperative activities and models that put considerable pressure on coordination and timeliness in response activities. Each of these types of activities, while complementary to one another, presents a diverse yet rich landscape of experiences related to this norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ransomware being one of the driving causes of some international assistance cases, the second part of the discussion began with contributions from Montenegro, the UK and Microsoft. They all provided initial remarks on how they have been cooperating and coordinating internationally to respond to such incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the discussion, participants addressed the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many state and non-state actors have actively supported other states in responding to and recovering from large-scale incidents. Based on this experience, what are the main lessons learned from that cooperation (what has worked/what needs to be done better)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can states better coordinate with each other and with non-governmental stakeholders when providing assistance?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the perspective of countries that received assistance, what are some of the main points that should be considered for the enhancement of future rapid response actions?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should these experiences inform the implementation of “norm h” on requests for assistance?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montenegro provided a thorough and detailed assessment of what requesting and receiving assistance looked like when it was hit by a major ransomware incident in August 2022. The incident reportedly affected 150 workstations across 10 government institutions. Overall, as highlighted during the meeting, the incident impacted CI, public services and other parts of the government, such as the prosecutor’s office and revenue and customs. At the time, France, the US, the UK, Estonia and others joined efforts to support Montenegro in the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to and recovering from an incident of this scale extends far beyond having the technical capacities to do so. Participants noted the following priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensure-that-domestically-government-entities-are-aware-of-the-criticality-of-the-incident&quot;&gt;Ensure that Domestically Government Entities are Aware of the Criticality of the Incident&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norm 13(h) on request for assistance assumes that countries are ready or aware of what kinds of support they might need. While that can be the case for some, depending on the scale and level of disruption from the incident, victim states might become overstretched in who they need to speak to. Some representatives also noted that sometimes the biggest challenge at the time of the incident is to convince other government stakeholders of the impact and criticality of an incident. In some cases, politicians remained agnostic about large-scale ransomware incidents until they started being reported and/or they discussed with national experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other representatives noted that knowledge of the incident is also crucial if a malicious activity is emanating from the territory of a particular state. This is particularly relevant for demonstrating due diligence. As noted, and as further elaborated in UN GGE 2021, if the state whose territory might have been identified as the origin of malicious activity offers to provide assistance (or even requests to receive assistance), such support can “help minimise damage, avoid misperceptions, reduce the risk of escalation and help restore trust”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-coordination-among-and-within-states-providing-andor-seeking-to-provide-support-to-a-victim-state&quot;&gt;Strengthen Coordination Among and Within States Providing and/or Seeking to Provide Support to a Victim State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants noted that lack of coordination among donor countries can often lead to a duplication of assistance and different expectations depending upon the donor and recipient. This shows that even if the offer of support is abundant, a lack of coordination can become an extra burden for victim countries. One of the participants noted that, at a certain stage, 15 countries were providing support to Pacific Island countries on basic steps to set up and run their CERTs. While important, the offer is indicative of multiple funding channels and highlights the need for more joint efforts in capacity building to avoid duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designation of a national coordination point from the victim country is equally important to facilitate deployment of crisis response support. This could be the national CERT or other nationally relevant designated entities. As the experiences shared in the room highlighted, the victim country is often faced with an increasing pressure of having to effectively respond both to the incident and to external requests. The national coordination point should be able to be “in the know” enough to coordinate with other government agencies on how to best direct external support for internal needs – but it does not necessarily need to be the most technical actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK proposed four points that should be considered by states in providing assistance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, avoid waiting for the crisis. Investments in resilience may need to come upfront but in the longer run they are more cost effective than remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devise models internally and internationally that can respond in an agile and timely manner. As one representative noted, states might seek to close memorandum of understandings with other strategic partners and gradually build their bilateral cooperation channels to have both the administrative and relational components in place to respond to any cyber crises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horizon scanning can help states better understand their own national/regional threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On capacity building and the implementation of norm 13(h), donor countries need to better coordinate given the finite pool of resources. Furthermore, the establishment of embassy networks and cyber attachés can often significantly support cyber capacity building. However, it is crucial that the private sector is involved in assistance provision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-capacity-for-proactive-monitoring-and-response&quot;&gt;Develop Capacity for Proactive Monitoring and Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montenegro’s case, the 2022 ransomware incident led to the creation of multiple policies and bodies within the government, such as the Agency for Cybersecurity, and the publication of the 2022–2026 iteration of its national cyber security strategy focusing on capacity building and raising awareness among the government and population. Costa Rica and Vanuatu have had similar domestic shifts that have enhanced the visibility and understanding of how cyber incidents relate to national security. Other developing economies also shared their own experiences in establishing ICT-focused agencies – especially small island countries that are embedding cyber security within these broader initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other representatives raised the point that awareness of malicious ICT activities – be they ransomware or other attack types causing critical disruptions to a state – is primarily dependent on having the proper capacity to identify and respond. As noted, “capacity building is not just about awareness of an incident but providing the infrastructure and capability to respond” in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter point was equally highlighted by several representatives. Many participants suggested that capacity building efforts often concentrate on training activities and exercises when certain countries are in need of IT equipment. Training, albeit important, is only one part of the solution. Having access to technology and the proper setup is equally crucial for countries to effectively implement and allocate the human resources that have been part of trainings and other capacity building efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-reflections-for-future-dialogues&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Reflections for Future Dialogues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of ransomware in the 2023 Annual Progress Report shows that states see this particular cyber threat as a shared concern. While far from being the only or the single most important threat, ransomware stands out because it has greatly affected developed and developing countries alike. As such, it can bring a diverse array of countries to the table for an informative and constructive dialogue on responsible state behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, representatives suggested that collaboration and exchanges on defining the impact of incidents as they relate to the economic, social and cultural dynamics of a country could help the identification of common approaches to impact measurement and interpretation. As the dialogue showed, ransomware can have disproportionate effects in developing economies. This is particularly the case with economic losses resulting from incidents. A regional or development-sensitive approach to impacts and emerging threats could positively contribute to further the understanding of how responsible state behaviour and implementation of the acquis relate to development and capacity builidng strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cooperation during crises, it became clear that having the capacity to respond to a cyber crisis is not just a question of technology, infrastructure or human resources, but of having the appropriate mechanisms in place – and being capable of mobilising them in a timely manner. While procurement was often referred to as being time-consuming and slow, representatives suggested that it would be beneficial to have a network or an effort to map rapid-response teams/deployments and other capabilities that could be used in time of crises. Furthermore, cooperative crisis response strategies can be further enhanced when they are the result of a layered process where existing bilateral, multistakeholder and regional trust building efforts help speed up and enhance timely responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dialogue highlighted, a thorough discussion on ransomware can help untangle some important challenges facing the OEWG and broader international cyber cooperation – that is, what distinguishes a criminal approach from an international security approach; how crisis response and other international assistance experience can help inform future or existing norms; what kinds of capacities are required/expected in conducting response activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a facilitated platform for exchange where stakeholders can participate and bring practical inputs is particularly useful to complement governments’ experiences in handling large-scale incidents. The OEWG, PoA and other multistakeholder spaces can and should support that continuation at the international level. An emerging model for non-political information exchange can help build trust, enhance transparency over responsible state behaviour, and serve as an example for other cyber-related international security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, a federal court in Texas handed down its judgment in Van Loon v Treasury, upholding the Office for Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s groundbreaking decision to place Tornado Cash, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, under economic sanctions for its role in facilitating money laundering. The ruling suggests that, at least in the US, DeFi platforms will not be able to escape regulatory and legal liability just because of their decentralised nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeFi platforms, which allow users to directly transfer cryptoassets to one another without using an intermediary cryptoasset business, have exploded in popularity in recent years. Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, has estimated that, between November 2019 and November 2021, “the total capital locked in DeFi services [grew] by more than 1,700% … to $247 billion”. This has led some to fear, and others to hope, that cryptoasset trading might escape the anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions regulations that are being applied to the sector, due to the apparent lack of an intermediary that can be held accountable for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, OFAC designated an entity it called “Tornado Cash” under the US cyber sanctions regime. OFAC alleged that this entity, a decentralised cryptoassets tumbler, had laundered in excess of $7 billion of cryptoassets on behalf of cyber-criminals and a hacking group sponsored by the North Korean government. A cryptoassets tumbler, sometimes called a mixer, allows users to send cryptoassets to a wallet address, where they are pooled with those sent by other users, before withdrawing cryptoassets of equivalent value from a different wallet address, in order to make them harder to trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeFi protocols work by using smart contracts – blockchain-based code that automatically executes when certain conditions are fulfilled. DeFi platforms often have a “frontend” – a website providing a user-friendly way to interact with the underlying protocol. Platforms usually also have a system of governance, often through allowing holders of “governance tokens” to vote on changes to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Tornado Cash, smart contracts automatically execute when one of its wallet addresses receives a deposit of cryptoassets from a user. No human intervention beyond that of the user is required in the process, which is executed automatically by code. Tornado Cash is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), members of which hold “TORN” tokens. Though the active smart contracts cannot be amended or revoked, the DAO votes on issues like whether new smart contracts should be released, and maintains a “frontend” website. When new smart contracts are released, the website replaces its links to the old contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-legal-arguments&quot;&gt;The Legal Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making the designation, OFAC relied on provisions in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which authorises the US president, during a national emergency, to prohibit transfers or transactions, over which the US has jurisdiction, involving any foreign country or person, or their property. The US has used IEEPA to designate foreign cyber-criminals, the North Korean government and persons deemed to have given material assistance or provided financial or technological support to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OFAC argued that even token holders who do not participate in governance votes are part of the association, because the value of their tokens stands to increase if the platform prospers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs argued that Tornado Cash was not an “entity” so could not be designated, on the basis that there had been no agreement between its alleged members to cooperate and thereby form an “association”. (In legal terminology, the requirements for the formation of a specific type of entity called an unincorporated association had not been met.) The plaintiffs argued that ownership of a TORN token is insufficient to establish agreement, highlighting that many token holders do not actively participate in the governance of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reply, OFAC argued that “association” should be given its ordinary meaning, and so all that is required for Tornado Cash to be an “association” is that it is an organised body of individuals that furthers a common purpose. No mutual agreement is necessary, and OFAC argued that Tornado Cash satisfied the test because its founders, developers and members of the DAO (individuals who own at least one TORN token) had all acted to achieve the common purpose of “operating, promoting, and updating” the Tornado Cash platform. OFAC further argued that even token holders who do not participate in governance votes are part of the association, because the value of their tokens stands to increase if the platform prospers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court found Tornado Cash to be an “association”, agreeing with OFAC’s broader definition. Drawing attention to the specific roles of the founders, developers and the DAO, the court highlighted that “utilising this structure, Tornado Cash has been able to place job advertisements, maintain a fund to compensate key contributors, and adopt a compensation structure for relayers, among other things.” However, the court went further, saying that the Tornado Cash DAO has “through its voting members … demonstrated an agreement to a common purpose,” making the DAO is an unincorporated association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs also argued that Tornado Cash is not an organisation but autonomous software which cannot be the property of the Tornado Cash entity, because no one can prevent others from using the smart contracts and at least some are unalterable. In response, OFAC argued that smart contracts are kind of legally recognised contract (specifically, a unilateral contract), and that such contracts can be a kind of property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the court agreed with OFAC. As Judge Pitman put it: “The fact that smart contracts [perform a task] without additional human intervention … or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as a type of contract and, thus a type of property …” As the smart contracts “provide Tornado Cash with a means to control and use crypto assets” and generate fees for the DAO, the association had a property interest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are likely to appeal the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, it chimes with other rulings at the district court level, suggesting an emerging judicial consensus. For example, in February 2023, a federal district court in California ruled that Ooki DAO was an unincorporated association, as it “existed for the purpose of running a business, and specifically, to operate and monetise the Ooki Protocol”. Token holders were deemed to have agreed to participate by exercising their voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ability to prohibit transactions involving smart contracts is also a valuable tool for OFAC, as it makes it harder for sanctions to be circumvented&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clearest implications, unsurprisingly, concern the US sanctions regime. Assuming that the judgment is affirmed and reflects the approach to be taken across the country, OFAC will be able to designate most if not all DAOs, as well as the relevant protocol’s founders and developers, without needing to show any agreement between them. All that must be shown is some common purpose, which will usually be an easy test to meet in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to prohibit transactions involving smart contracts is also a valuable tool for OFAC, as it makes it harder for sanctions to be circumvented. If wallet addresses and smart contracts are not the property of the designated entity, and so cannot be placed on the Specially Designated Nationals list, it could be possible to create a new “frontend” website to facilitate continued, lawful access to the smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, if the exercise of DAO voting rights qualifies as an agreement to cooperate, it will be relatively easy for regulators and law enforcement to establish the existence of an unincorporated association. As the Ooki DAO case shows, this may be critical for establishing that an entity falls within scope of a particular law or regulation, even if this is not required under IEEPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if smart contracts are the property of the DAO, they are essentially part of the DAO. This makes it easier to hold the DAO accountable for what the smart contract does – for example, if the DAO does not update the protocol to comply with AML regulations. The smart contract is effectively a service that the DAO provides, rather than something separate to which the DAO merely facilitates access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DeFi platforms the new frontier in crypto, the US courts have sent a signal that their founders, developers and DAO members cannot escape legal liability just because they are part of a decentralised structure. This signal, though unwelcome for some in the crypto industry, starts to close a potentially significant loophole that risked undercutting efforts to fight money laundering and other forms of illicit finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world&quot;&gt;Integrated Review Refresh (IR23)&lt;/a&gt; describes a more contested and volatile world which may require greater defence capacity while funds remain tight. With a regular Naval Service that is already operating at or close to capacity, there is little scope to surge. This paper examines whether and how the Maritime Reserves (MR) can bring extra fighting power at an affordable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper finds that one of the strengths of the MR is the calibre of many of its personnel. However, they have suffered from a lack of clarity on their purpose for several years. This has been exacerbated by the decision to stop training altogether for four months in 2020/21 and then to reduce budgets for training, including reserve training days, by 30%. Recent moves to restore training budgets and publish the new “Maritime Reserves Orders 2023–24” have been welcomed, as has progress in building and reshaping capabilities, especially in information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, fundamental conceptual and structural problems remain; there is a lack of ambition in the published requirement for reserves across many parts of the MR. Furthermore, the mission outlined in this year’s orders focuses on reservists exclusively as augmentees (although there are, in practice, a few exceptions), something out of line with the UK’s major Five Eyes counterparts. It also goes against best practice in comparable areas in its sister services, most notably for the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR), whose nearest counterparts in airborne and special forces view collective capability as essential for delivering operational demands and building unit spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bolder vision is necessary. That means being clear about requirements, which must be grounded in a proper understanding of what a reservist can deliver well, what they can turn their hand to, and what is impractical. It is no criticism of dedicated full-time leadership to say that the reserves need a stronger voice across Navy Command to provide that understanding. As is now the case in the Army, RAF and Strategic Command, this should include a part-time volunteer reservist voice on the Navy Board and in other Naval Service headquarters and policy branches. The Royal Navy Reserve (RNR) still has a well-developed officer structure (unlike the RAF Reserves, who are having to rebuild theirs) which would facilitate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserves could provide much greater affordable capacity in seagoing appointments and ashore. Seagoing reserves could be grown by recruiting officers with watchkeeping qualifications to crew offshore patrol and littoral vessels, and, with regular reserves, provide a surge capability in war to vessels in re-fit or as casualty replacements. Ashore, lessons from Ukraine suggest that growing a remotely-piloted aircraft division (RPAS) in HMS Pegasus (formerly the RNR Air Branch) from civilians skilled in operating drones would add significant value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in the number of pilots in HMS Pegasus has been driven by a combination of extreme pressure on flying hours and ever-increasing safety requirements from the Defence Safety Authority (DSA). This should be revisited, both to see whether small sums could significantly rebuild numbers of reserve pilots flying and whether DSA demands are truly necessary. The lack of surge capability means that the Naval Service would also struggle to expand its critical (and recently reduced) staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper identifies that there are some roles which need to be re-examined in light of the deteriorating security environment, such as protection of ports, coastal critical national infrastructure (including nuclear power stations) and the littoral, which are currently largely neglected. Recent reports of Russian activity in the North Sea highlight this. A reserve capability, including a substantial explosive ordnance disposal search element, including divers (a recently disbanded reserve capability, where safety considerations seem to be the driving force again) could provide a cost-effective solution, whether in the MR, the Coastguard or Army Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Marines, the RMR could be structured for use as formed bodies, similar to 4 Para and the Australian 1 Commando Regiment and 131 Commando Squadron RE. This would provide scalability for a very fine but expensive regular force, greatly improving the offer to officers, who are only 65% recruited (with none aged under 30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other two services and Strategic Command, the MR budget is delivered centrally within the Naval Service, and then through Commander Maritime Reserves (COMMARRES). Delivering it through the capability areas could protect them from savings measures made without knowledge of their impact on outputs, such as those in 2020. This would align the Royal Navy with the other services and Strategic Command. With this transfer should come a change in the chain of command to align with capability owners and away from COMMARRES, allowing the latter to focus on areas such as N1 personnel matters, selection and recruiting, where reserves must be distinctive. The Naval Service leadership is right to recognise that reserves are needed, but a wider vision and structural change that maximises their value and amplifies the reservist voice are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on recent progress, a bolder approach to the MR is recommended. This must identify the real need for maritime reserve forces, including scalability of both the Dark Blue and Lovat elements, at modest cost. A revised management structure and newly appointed senior part-time volunteer reserve officers in each of the major headquarters should be at the heart of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, with war in Europe and growing tensions around the world, most of the UK’s European neighbours are seeking affordable ways to grow their defence capabilities against a background of economic stress. In most cases, this involves expanding their reserve forces. Moreover, the UK’s major Five Eyes partners (Australia, Canada and the US) already have a much larger proportion of their forces in their reserves, on the basis that they offer an inexpensive route to (lower readiness) capability, can bring in ideas and technologies, and link the regular armed forces to the wider nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Command Paper Refresh comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The War in Ukraine has reminded the world that Reserves are essential both on and off the battlefield. Making the Armed Forces more capable and resilient, the Reserves deliver both mass and access to battle-winning specialist civilian capabilities that Regular forces cannot readily generate or sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve forces are not an entitlement. They exist to provide surge and/or niche capabilities to allow a service to meet its commitments in extremis, which they can often do at a much lower peacetime cost than regulars. Holding contingent mass and specialist skills in the reserves allows Defence to do more with less in conflict. Both are important at a time when the UK is facing a more “contested and volatile world”, as the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh (IR23) puts it, and given Defence’s financial constraints. This paper examines whether and how Maritime Reserves (MR) can better contribute to the Naval Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the background of the war in Ukraine, and after a loss of momentum in the rebuilding of Britain’s reserves, the UK armed forces took a fresh look at their reserves as part of the IR23. Previous RUSI papers have considered opportunities for the reserves to contribute to Army and RAF outputs. The Army and RAF each now have a seat on its service board occupied by a reservist with extensive experience of combining a civilian career with uniformed service. UK Strategic Command has also created a position for a senior one-star reservist with direct access to the commander to advise on its use of reserves. Reservists also head up the US and Canadian naval reserves, making the Royal Navy (RN) an outlier in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexities of the maritime domain impose different challenges on RN planners, but the Naval Service has not engaged with or shaped the purpose of the reserves in the same way as the Army and the RAF, because of the absence of volunteer reserve voices in its structures. Consequently, the MR has had an extremely difficult time. A lengthy Maritime Reserves Directive was published in 2020, but the Reserve Forces and Cadets Association External Scrutiny Team (EST) observed that it was still not clear exactly what the Naval Service feels it needs its reserves for. The EST’s 2021 report states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The RN’s intent is less clear to us. We were told that the requirement should be driven by the Service need but we are concerned that could lead to the feeling of the Reserve being considered purely as a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concern followed the RN’s unilateral decision to stop all training for four months in 2020/21, prompting a former First Sea Lord to suggest that cutting the Naval Reserve “would be an insult to its members and a disaster for the Navy”. The speed at which some of the cuts had to be reversed suggested that the then Navy Board was unaware of the measure’s impact on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, the 30% cut in training budgets has been reversed and new orders outlining the way forward for reserves have been published. While both are welcome improvements, this paper argues that they do not fully address the underlying problems with MR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Future Reserves 2020 (FR20) study called for objective measures to show the capabilities and costs of reserves, and Reserve Forces 2030 (RF30) identified Ministry of Defence (MoD) accounting as a critical impediment to change. While the Army has made some progress on costs since FR20, the Naval Service appears not to have made the same progress or published an understanding of what the MR can do. Nor has there been recognition of the benefits of senior part-time volunteer reserve (PTVR) representation in headquarters and policy centres, even though the Royal Navy Reserve (RNR) continues to have PTVR leadership at unit and branch level (unlike the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR) or much of the RAF Reserves). This paper offers some areas for consideration that may help planners find effective ways to harness the potential in an MR. Typically, such reserves are to fill gaps, either as individual augmentees or small units, or to provide surge support for specialist operational needs (limited, pre-defined, additional mass). Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those with previous service expertise and where RNR training can prevent skill fade (for example, the air branch, engineers or a resuscitated reserve divers branch).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where it would be too expensive or otherwise impossible for the regular service to develop a full-time, regular career path when only small numbers are needed (for example, maritime trade operations or elements of intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where specialist civilian skills would be available (for example, medics, cyber or media operations) or where skills developed in the military can be sustained in the commercial world (including, again, the air branch).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines wider opportunities that stem from both the recent limited experience of reserves undertaking many of the seagoing roles in coastal, fishery protection and littoral vessels and broader experiences from the past and of the UK’s allies today. Moreover, a number of maritime roles from which the Navy withdrew several decades ago, including protection of most ports and elements of coastal security, appear to pose serious potential threats. While such roles need not necessarily be forced onto the Naval Service, the paper examines whether the reserves could offer cost-effective options with a low peacetime cost that could be called out at scale and composed of people with local knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the RMR, which makes up a quarter of the MR, has an extremely limited function in providing individual augmentees and specialists for the regular force. The Royal Marines are embarked on a journey to become a maritime force capable of special operations, which led to a (recently dropped) proposal to require reserve recruits to undergo the main element of the regular pathway. When the Army Reserves have special forces and airborne units, as well as a commando engineer squadron, all with capabilities as formed bodies at least at sub-unit level, the narrow and unambitious RMR role is worthy of broader examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In considering opportunities and lessons for reserves, this paper focuses on the PTVR elements. The Naval Service has full-time reserve service (FTRS) personnel and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), who are technically civil servants, with 80% sponsored reservists. They provide logistics and operational support but offer no capacity to scale up in war. Both categories are largely ignored in this paper, although where FTRS and Additional Duties Commitment personnel are involved in reserve units and supporting structures, they are relevant to this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, Chapter I outlines the current state of the reserves and examines several roles where gaps exist. Chapter II looks at examples of the use of maritime reserves, including by the UK’s allies. Here, the main focus is the major Five Eyes countries, both because their potential adversaries are overseas, unlike the continental NATO partners, and because they share the UK’s tradition of voluntarism rather than conscription in uniformed services. Chapter III plots a way forward. The Maritime Reserve Organisation structure is shown in the Annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-todays-maritime-reserves&quot;&gt;I. Today’s Maritime Reserves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MR are comprised of two elements: the RNR and the RMR, totalling approximately 2,800 trained personnel. This chapter explores what they do, how they are structured and operate, and how they compare to their major Five Eyes peers.&lt;/p&gt;

The above comparisons include US Marines and Royal Marines. Coastguard forces are excluded as they differ so much between countries. The Australian Commandos are also excluded as they are part of the Australian Army but are discussed in the paper as they make an interesting comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-royal-naval-reserve&quot;&gt;The Royal Naval Reserve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNR currently has 14 regional units which support multiple specialisations, plus HMS Ferret and HMS Pegasus, which act as national sites for intelligence and aviation respectively. The capabilities are divided into three groups (plus a fourth for the RMR) and a headquarters function (see Annex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each geographic unit typically has a range of skills, including seagoing general warfare support (principally for offshore patrol vessels) and battle staff and support functions, including for mine warfare, amphibious warfare and submarine operations. This is slowly changing as individual specialisations become more geographically focused to enable specialist training to take place at regional training centres, reducing wasted resources in terms of time and cost of travel. An example is the engineering branch now administered by HMS Vivid in Plymouth, with the (PTVR) Commanding Officer “double hatted” in command. Nevertheless, where geography requires it, general warfare individuals can become members of their nearest unit for representational purposes while engaged in a capability function centred elsewhere. While this is a step forward, the overall vision of the new MR document is now based on a strictly limited mission “to provide sufficient, capable and motivated personnel, at readiness to support RN operations around the globe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the provision of individual personnel is out of line with most other reserve services in major Five Eyes countries, and also specifically with comparable reserve organisations in the UK. In particular, this arrangement makes the “offer” for the RMR a quantum lower than the formed body capabilities of, for instance, special and airborne forces in the Army, where squadron-level capabilities are seen as essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNR has a well-developed junior and middle-ranking officer corps, with those joining from civilian life (apart from certain professionally qualified officers like doctors and chaplains) doing either an eight-week course through Britannia Royal Naval College (BRNC) Dartmouth or a modular equivalent in units, at BRNC or elsewhere to fit their tighter civilian commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their Army counterparts, but unlike the current RAF, students joining University Royal Naval Units (URNUs) can offset part of the BRNC course against training at the URNU or basic training in their units. Almost all RNR units are commanded by PTVR officers. These officers manage with an exceptionally slim full-time cadre compared to the other services and recently suffered further reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the higher ranks, the RNR is in a very different place from the other services. In the Navy, the senior officer with a specific volunteer reserve focus is a one-star appointment as Commander Maritime Reserves (COMMARRES), which has been filled by a succession of FTRS officers and regulars for many years. The new appointee does, however, have some PTVR experience from the beginning of her service. There is no senior PTVR representation in any command or policy branch outside COMMARRES’ staff, including 3 Commando Brigade. Despite this, MR officers have done well competing for the handful of “purple” posts outside the Naval Service, with a one-star officer responsible for implementing FR30 in the MoD, and a Captain RN (OF5) currently serving in Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the comparable-sized RAF Reserve has a PTVR two-star officer on the Air Force Board Executive Committee, a PTVR one-star officer, and several PTVR half-star (OF5) officers in various headquarters and departments. The Army has a senior reservist in almost every single headquarters and policy branch, including two-star officers on the Executive Committee of the Army Board and its Field Army counterpart, the deputy commanders of divisions and brigades and staff officers in key branches from the Military Secretary’s department to Army Recruiting and Initial Training Command. It also has a reserve brigade (19 Light Brigade) commanded by a PTVR brigadier. These senior elements in critical structures are essential to ensuring the reserve voice is heard at a high-enough level to influence thinking in otherwise regular systems that are often inadequately aware of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic Command, which has the smallest reserve element of the four commands, also has a senior PTVR one-star position with direct access to the commander and has ensured that reserve officers are distributed widely throughout it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small further difference to the disadvantage of MR units is that they do not have individual honorary officers as Army Reserve units have honorary colonels and Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) units have honorary air commodores. So, even this informal voice with access to power is not provided for MR units; instead, honorary officers are held in a pool by the regular service (although one or two have reserve service), administered by Naval Regional Commander Eastern, with a primary role of advising First Sea Lord and in many cases allocated to (regular) warships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key difference between the MR and those in the other commands is that their budget is held and delegated to units and heads of departments via MR HQ. In the other commands, the budgets are delegated to the relevant functional area. This connects the reserve component to capability, including those only required in war or major operations, without the link to functional areas. Elements that are not regularly used in peacetime may wither and gaps only become apparent when it is too late. After all, a crucial role of reserves is to provide elements of capability in warfighting that are not needed in peacetime, either at all or at the requisite scale, and so would be expensive to maintain in the regular service. This arrangement has arguably given reserves a safeguard at a time when their voice was lacking in all other parts of the Navy. However, if each regular headquarters and command had a senior reserve voice, as in the other services, the best of both worlds could be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination, these factors mean that the various elements of the Naval Service have few institutional arrangements that bring understanding of reserve capabilities, strengths and shortcomings. The fact that the four-month training ban, when the then Navy Board was unable to easily see its impact even on current operations, had to be speedily partially unwound highlights the problem. In these regards, the RN is out of line with the Army, RAF, MoD and Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MR does have an officer development programme up to commander level and occasionally beyond. As with the Army Reserve, there is a bespoke reserve Intermediate Command and Staff Course (ICSC(MR)) for SO3/2 and Warrant Officers, then the Combined Reserve Advanced Command and Staff Course (ACSC(Reserve)) for senior SO2/SO1. The RMR typically attend the ICSC(Land Reserve). Unlike the Army Reserve, all MR officers must attend ACSC(Reserve), or the full course, to be substantially promoted to SO1. The Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) also takes OF5 MR from time to time. While laudable, there are weaknesses with the Combined Reserve ACSC(Reserve), which are examined more fully in an earlier paper in this series on the Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seagoing-elements-of-the-rnr&quot;&gt;Seagoing Elements of the RNR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RN does not have warships in a reserve fleet that reservists can crew in times of tension. Nevertheless, for reasons of cost and the capacity of its regular force size, the RN has vessels undergoing refit in which it has no/limited crews, as regular personnel are rightly concentrated in operational vessels. In war, it seems likely that such vessels would be accelerated back into service and a combination of volunteer reservists and ex-regulars with key skills could thus contribute to providing mass at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the “core” element of the RNR’s General Warfare Sea Specialisation is primarily composed of ratings because officers require a suite of skills deemed too difficult and too expensive to be taught ab initio and maintained in the time available for training reserve officers. The watchkeeping qualification for officers, for example, is now the same as for the Merchant Navy, and gaining it requires extensive seagoing experience. However, officers are used in three disciplines where the training burden is lower: mine warfare; submarine operations; and amphibious warfare. And while major warships may be too demanding for full reserve crews, coastal, fishery and littoral vessels are potentially more suitable and generally less complex if, as in the past, officer recruitment focused more heavily on those with the relevant civilian watchkeeping qualifications. When the RN took operational command of the Border Force afloat assets, some of the personnel provided for several months were reserves who acquitted themselves well. Experiments are now planned with RNR ratings in RMR teams providing protection for the RFA and supporting vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive development is the priority being given to officer recruiting (on target, unlike other ranks, which is running at about 50%) and phase-two training for general warfare officers in all three specialities. The potential for wider employment at sea is also being looked at. Nevertheless, the scope remains limited compared with the US and Canadian navies; allowing officers greater roles, including command of offshore patrol vessels as they do abroad, is outside the scope of current studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coastal-security-and-port-protection&quot;&gt;Coastal Security and Port Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain neglected coastal security in the build-up to the Second World War, leaving its coastline and nearby ships vulnerable to E-boats (see Chapter II). For an island nation that depends on the sea – approximately 95% of British goods (by weight) travel by sea – there is little clarity on who has responsibility for the protection of ports, save to state that it is not a task formally given to the RN. Few ports have been designated as strategic and thus warrant any form of naval protection. Moreover, while the coastguard, police and border force all have some maritime (or at least aquatic) responsibilities, none has any equipment publicly evident to deliver this, particularly at a scale to provide meaningful defence in the event of the UK being engaged in a war in Europe. Similarly, no evidence of exercises to protect any part of this critical national infrastructure (CNI) has been unearthed, except, perhaps, in the narrow area of cyber. Indeed, much of the UK’s wider CNI is coastal, including all its nuclear power stations, and similar points can be made about a lack of preparedness. Recent reports of Russian vessels carrying out “hostile” reconnaissance of UK waters and sub-sea infrastructure add a further dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a requirement emerge to remedy this, the MR could be well placed to satisfy it in an affordable manner. Moreover, with only three naval bases for the RN’s warships and submarines, these sites are very vulnerable to attack. Each would benefit from more physical protection in the event of war, but the RN should consider how to distribute its ships to reduce their vulnerability, much as the RAF is doing for its aircraft, which are also grouped into very few locations in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More widely, the UK lacks intelligence arrangements for coastal security beyond a few coastguard and border force clusters, as well as an element of satellite monitoring. If, for example, a yacht operator spotted a group of people offloading equipment in a marina which looked as if it could be heavy weaponry from a motor yacht, there is no avenue for them to report it aside from calling 999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mine-warfare&quot;&gt;Mine Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a generation ago, the RNR had its own ships, most of them River-class minesweepers operating as MCM10. When these were replaced with more capable, but also more complicated, Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels (MCMs), the RNR continued with detachments of divers and a few personnel trained on the REMUS remote mine-hunting system. Today, all that remains are a few battle staff and watch officers. This seems to be a consequence of rising safety standards and a widespread belief that the current skills involved in the operational side of mine warfare are too complicated for reservists. However, this contrasts with the Army’s Royal Engineers’ view of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) work, where the reserve regiment (101 City of London Regiment) is similar in size to its regular counterpart (33 Engineer Regiment (EOD)). The Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham and Minley, which has been repeatedly praised by the RFCA External Scrutiny Team for their success in making training reserve friendly, has recognised that the strongest requirement for a surge capability is in the search for mines and other EODs, the main focus for reserve training. At the same time, ex-regulars and those reservists who can take the time off can do the full regular course and offer the full range of skills including dismantling mines and suspected devices. Both regular and reserve IED teams and individuals were used on Operation Herrick in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-warfare&quot;&gt;Information Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information warfare (IW) is the fastest-growing element of the MR, although, as with other elements, figures are not published. This includes information operations, cyber, intelligence, media operations, maritime trade operations and communications technology. While IW has been part of an armed forces’ armoury since the dawn of time, as any reader of The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle knows, modern equipment and social media have taken it to a new level, as the war in Ukraine has shown. The RN has recognised their importance and that these skills should lie predominantly with the MR. Cyber offers an opportunity for the Navy and the MR to grow a key capability. The capability gap across government has led to a commitment to more reserves, although the difficulties in keeping quality operatives in regular service are still not fully acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR information operations are a national asset, with elements at Chicksands. Most personnel are at Portsmouth, where training and employment is managed by the single unit of HMS King Alfred that works closely with the new (Regular) Operational Advantage Centre (OAC) there. Like the General Warfare and Operations Support capabilities, the IW capability is commanded by a PTVR captain (OF5), with each of the six elements led by PTVR commanders (OF4). Tasking comes mostly through the (regular) OAC but into reservist teams, whose command and N1 (personnel) arrangements are handled by the PTVR commanders. This means that the people responsible for N1 issues, including supporting recruiting, individual appraisals and leading work, can bring their highly relevant civilian skills to the Naval Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangements for the six branches are different in this regard. In the case of cyber and communications technology, all recruits work in the industry and cyber applicants pass through a Defence-wide system for selection. In the case of media operations and intelligence, recruits have to pass an assessment and a useful proportion start with civilian skills. There is no separate selection for information and maritime trade operations, and recruits are trained from scratch, but a number bring valuable civilian backgrounds. This is a complicated area as these disciplines involve civilian-recognised skills but lack the professional structures which govern military personnel in areas like medicine and law. The RNR’s IW capability structure seems well designed to cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two further welcome features are that IW staff are all deployable (except some cyber staff) and some have been deployed abroad, and that the OAC actively looks to them and their unusual skills for guidance on future trends as technologies evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aviation&quot;&gt;Aviation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reformed in 1980, and now known as HMS Pegasus, the former RNR Air Branch has a mixture of pilots and other key aviation skills, although it currently has no remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) cadre or capability. It is entirely composed of ex-regulars. The organisation is commanded by a PTVR officer with full-time support and spends almost all its output on operations working in support of the fleet, rather than training itself. The unit operates as a pool providing personnel as needed by the Navy as individuals or small teams, but tasking is through its headquarters, rather than directly by the customer unit or organisation. This ensures that tasking is by people who understand the pressures of dual career service. Until the aircraft was retired, the air branch included Harrier pilots. By any standards, it offers access in peacetime and a surge capability in war for a range of expensive skills at very low cost, as it requires no training pipeline, just vastly cheaper routine training to maintain currency (or, where pilot skills are useful without current flying, none at all, such as inspection, classroom instruction and red teaming).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ever-increasing safety requirements, combined with tightening flying budgets, mean very few now actually fly. The earlier RUSI paper on Air Reserves highlighted the growing evidence that an over-cautious safety regime, introduced since the Haddon-Cave report, was both reducing the appetite for sensible risk-taking in that service and hampering the growth of reserve capability through unrealistic requirements. The availability of reservists to help in the RN’s helicopter pilot training pipeline appears to continue to give it a higher level of resilience than its RAF counterpart by assisting with instruction, red teaming on simulators and paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;royal-marines-reserves&quot;&gt;Royal Marines Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMR was established in 1948 with a limited role providing augmentees for the regular force. Today, the force is split into four units, each with an establishment of 155, spread over 22 locations. The regular RM are partially moving away from amphibious operations at scale towards a “future commando force”, capable of a range of “tier-two” special forces operations. A programme to bring reserve training in line with regular training was abandoned, presumably acknowledging the incompatibility of regular full-time training with demanding civilian employment. After a period of uncertainty over its future, it has continued to provide individual augmentees to regular units, both mainstream and those holding special skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the mainstream RMR has such a limited role, UK Special Forces have two reserve Special Air Service (SAS) regiments, a small (RMR) Reserve Special Boat Service (SBS) detachment and a signals squadron, all integrated in the Special Forces Group. 16 Airborne Assault Brigade has a reserve infantry battalion and engineer and medical squadrons and is growing a reserve artillery battery. Apart from the SBS detachment, all have roles as formed bodies, mostly up to sub-unit level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMR premises are well resourced for facilities and supporting permanent staff structures, with each (company-sized) unit headed by a regular lieutenant colonel. These units contain many talented potential officers who serve as junior ranks, because the RMR’s traditional role – producing individual augmentees – is unambitious and offers little opportunity for command to junior officers; it is only 65% recruited officers, and none of the officers are under 30, unlike Army reserve officers. In comparison, the Army Commando unit (131 Squadron RE) has both a formed unit capability in providing a wide range of outputs, such as heavy plant, bridge building and demolitions, and a healthy officer cadre because it offers command opportunities, including for its commanding officer, who is always a reserve major. Both the RMR and 131 Squadron are struggling because of the cuts in Reserve Service Day (RSD) budgets, which were recently reversed, but commando training is at last starting again after a whole year’s pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMR also contrasts sharply with its counterparts in the US and Australia. The US has a marine corps reserve division and Australia has a commando regiment (an amphibious unit in its army reserve). Both are constituted for use as formed bodies, as described in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruiting-and-training&quot;&gt;Recruiting and Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/irSze0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Maritime Reserves, Trained Strength 2014–23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-2023/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-1-april-2023&quot;&gt;MoD, “Quarterly Service Personnel Statistics, 1 April 2023”&lt;/a&gt;, updated 22 June 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years of steady progress, the coronavirus pandemic seriously hampered recruiting problems as the Army’s Defence Recruitment System bled across the other services in terms of public perceptions and Defence-wide mitigation measures. The 2021 training ban further worsened this for the MR. After protests in parliament and the media, training days specifically related to recruiting and basic training were restored, but the impact on trainees and potential recruits of discovering that their units had been suspended is not hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR training suffers from the same issues that were extensively explored in the earlier paper on Army Reserves, which stressed the tension between a commitment to achieve similar standards against the requirement to deliver training appropriate for people with full-time, and often relevant, civilian jobs and skills. In the case of the MR, two additional factors compounded this: the 30% cut imposed on training budgets in 2021 (now reversed) and calls to reduce the number of permanent staff instructors in the RNR which, unlike the RMR, has always been leaner than other reserve units. However, more positively, emphasis is now placed on improving phase-two training for reserve general warfare officers, with two-week courses delivered in Cyprus or Gibraltar. Nevertheless, as previously described, the vision remains limited in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Maritime Reserves Directive states that the MR should “review reserves training and delivery” and “explore regionalisation of training in waterfront units for seamanship, whilst exploiting distributed and virtual learning across the Branches”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, providing more training in RNR bases and regionally will help and is sensible, but it is difficult to see how it can work in practice with fewer permanent staff in those units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;terms-and-conditions-of-service-tacos&quot;&gt;Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the Army and RAF, MR suffer from anomalies in their TACOS. Both RF30 and the 2021 Council of RFCA’s External Scrutiny Team report highlight the complexity of the various structures under which reservists can be engaged, which was dealt with more fully in the Army Reserves paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparison-with-major-five-eyes-counterparts&quot;&gt;Comparison with Major Five Eyes Counterparts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK MR is significantly smaller in absolute terms and as a proportion of the whole force than its major Five Eyes comparators, all of which, arguably, also have greater role clarity than the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US:&lt;/strong&gt; The US Navy Reserve’s mission is clear: to provide strategic depth and deliver operational capabilities in times of peace or war, operating across all areas of the US Navy, as individuals and as units. These roles include flying, EOD, engineering, intelligence, logistics and medical. The US still has a significant fleet of retired vessels in reserve, but little is spent on maintaining them and working with them is not seen as a core function for the Navy Reserve. The US Coastguard Reserve has two main elements: pools of individuals operating in support of regular units; and self-contained port security units who are at 96 hours’ notice to defend US ports. They are also occasionally deployed abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada:&lt;/strong&gt; The Naval Reserve generates “trained individuals and teams for Canadian Forces operations, including domestic safety operations as well as security and defence missions, while at the same time supporting the Navy’s efforts in connecting with Canadians through the maintenance of a broad national presence”. The six (Kingston-class) maritime coastal defence vessels are mostly crewed by reservists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; The roles of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve (RANR) are: to support and sustain contemporary Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations in which the navy may be engaged; to deliver fundamental inputs to capability and workforce surge capacity; and to provide a strategic resource that can meet the navy’s capability needs when circumstances require its call out. The RANR workforce covers all the branches in the regular navy, and provides a surge capability that can be called on quickly. To that end, it is primarily composed of ex-regular personnel but also includes directly recruited individuals with specialist skills that would otherwise be costly to generate and develop as part of the usual force generation process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-historical-use-of-naval-reserves&quot;&gt;II. The Historical Use of Naval Reserves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-world-war-the-rnr-and-rnvrs-success-after-a-reluctant-start-by-the-admiralty&quot;&gt;First World War: The RNR and RNVR’s Success After a Reluctant Start by the Admiralty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the First World War, the RNR had 30,000 officers and men, drawn from the Merchant Navy and Britain’s fishing fleets. In addition, there was a substantial force in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) drawn from civilian life. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, was reluctant to use the RNR because of the importance of their civilian roles and the RNVR because of their lack of nautical training. However this was quickly overcome, and many RNR officers commanded destroyers and smaller vessels. Some went on to become pilots with the Royal Naval Air Service, but the bulk spent the war in small boat work, often in trawlers adapted for minesweeping and anti-submarine operations, and in motor torpedo boats. Some were involved in innovative roles, including the three Victoria Cross winners who served in Q-boats, the covertly armed merchantmen adapted to lure enemy submarines to destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RNVR officers seldom commanded ships, but officers and ratings served at sea in mixed crews. Many served in the Royal Naval Division which served with gallantry and took enormous casualties in Belgium and at Gallipoli. Yet, arriving in France for the Battle of the Somme, General Haig said that it “advanced further and took more prisoners than any other division”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between them, the RNR and RNVR won two-fifths of all the Victoria Crosses awarded to the senior service, and reservist intelligence staff and cryptographers set the foundation for enduring IW support from the RNVR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-world-war-the-rnr-and-rnvr-were-key-to-developing-small-boat-capability&quot;&gt;Second World War: The RNR and RNVR Were Key to Developing Small Boat Capability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Second World War, both reserve branches served alongside their regular counterparts, together with the Royal Naval Volunteer (Supplementary) Reserve, a small new organisation open to civilians with existing and proven experience at sea as ratings or officers and composed of experienced yachtsmen; selection was based on a single extended interview. Its 3,000 places were filled within months of its announcement in November 1936, despite offering no pay, uniforms or formal training. After the outbreak of war, such officers were deployed in a variety of seagoing roles with much shorter training than the three months for most wartime entry officers. Intriguingly, some were at the cutting edge of innovation in small boat work, where, as arguably is the case today, the regular service had little bandwidth to focus. They included Lieutenant Commander Robert Hichens, DSO &amp;amp; Bar, DSC &amp;amp; Two Bars, who played a critical role in developing motor torpedo boats as a new capability; an area in which Britain started far behind the German E-boats as its emphasis was on blue water capital ships. Again, the RNR took commands in smaller vessels and were at the forefront of innovation. The attack on St Nazaire was executed by an elderly destroyer and 18 small craft. It achieved its objective, wrecking the world’s largest dock, albeit with terrible casualties. The mission leader, Commander Ryder VC, was a regular officer but almost all the officers under him, including small boat commanders, were reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the RNR and RNVR served as pilots in the Fleet Air Arm, in bomb disposal, intelligence, espionage, and in the new Commando and Beach Signal Section&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Second World War, the RNR won four Victoria Crosses and an RNVR pilot a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contribution to IW continued with specialists in codebreaking and intelligence. Meanwhile civilian intelligence staff and cryptographers, many of them bringing key skills from their day jobs, set the foundations for what became the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park after the war. Among other writers, Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond books, was employed in writing stories to deceive enemy intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-pivotal-role-of-interwar-reserves-in-scaling-up-the-us-marines-and-the-development-of-british-commandos&quot;&gt;The Pivotal Role of Interwar Reserves in Scaling Up the US Marines and the Development of British Commandos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Marine Corps expanded more than 30-fold during the Second World War from 15,000 active-duty members to nearly half a million, while remaining an exceptionally high-quality force. These figures, focused on the immediate pre-war regular strength, disguise the work of successive commandants from 1925 onward to build capability and mass in their reserves, despite severely limited funding. The US Marine Corps Reserve was greatly expanded by the 1938 Naval Reserve Act (still two years ahead of funding and mobilisation measures across the US armed forces); 70% of all US Marines serving in the Second World War came through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Royal Marines had no reserve force for bringing mass and civilian talent and ideas. Although they expanded, it was by a much smaller factor than their US equivalents. Lacking mass, the first large-scale operations to destroy coastal infrastructure were carried out by a Territorial Army unit under Naval direction, and the commando force was then set up within the Army, rather than the Royal Marines, although the latter soon developed their own raiding force, led initially by Herbert “Blondie” Hasler. Many of the Army members of the commando force originated in the Territorials (including Shimi Lovat, who was a reservist before and after his regular service), and many were drawn from the 10 territorial independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMR was formed in 1948 as the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR). The pattern of reservist officers driving innovation, as outlined in the two earlier papers in this series, was absent by default in the wartime Royal Marines as they had no pre-war reserve, unlike the Royal Navy and the US Marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rnr-minesweeping-194698&quot;&gt;The RNR: Minesweeping, 1946–98&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNR was re-formed in 1946 with a primary role of operating minesweepers and small patrol boats – it absorbed the RNVR in 1958. There was no substantial reserve involvement in the Falklands War, but various ashore elements of the RNR were formed or expanded in the immediate aftermath, including the amphibious warfare and public affairs branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just months after that war, the Royal Navy accepted a batch of Merchant Navy officers to serve as regular officers, with only three weeks of phase-one training at BRNC Dartmouth. They went on to do full warfare courses at HMS Collingwood, however. This offers a parallel with the handling of RNR officers in both wars, although the officers concerned were accepted as career RN officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the last of the RNR minesweepers were decommissioned and reservists ceased to have their own vessels. Sweeping had been replaced by mine hunting, which was deemed too complex for reserve crews. Even the URNUs have much more recently lost most of their P2000 patrol boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-gulf-iraq-and-afghan-wars-parallels-with-the-us-navy&quot;&gt;The Gulf, Iraq and Afghan Wars: Parallels with the US Navy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1991 Gulf War, 21,000 US naval reservists were called out. The Naval Reserve provided the US Navy’s only capability in many areas, including dedicated combat search and rescue, mobile inshore undersea warfare and logistic air transport. Most reservists augmented their regular counterparts. They came from all parts of the country, representing many specialities: medical; naval construction; cargo handling; mine warfare; naval control of shipping; intelligence; public affairs; and the chaplain corps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar deployments took place in the operations in Iraq (from 2003) and Afghanistan (from 2001). Following 9/11, almost 7,000 US naval reservists were deployed in the first eight weeks alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much smaller, the RNR made significant contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and Sierra Leone. These included pilots, two EOD diving teams (whose branch was subsequently disbanded), medical, intelligence and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marines-and-commandos-the-uk-as-the-odd-one-out&quot;&gt;Marines and Commandos: the UK as the Odd One Out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1991 Gulf War, the US Marine Reserves deployed in formed units, sending out a higher proportion of their reserves than any other service. The highest-scoring tank unit across all the allied forces was the 4th US Marine Reserve Tank Battalion, outshooting all their US and UK regular counterparts, using homemade fire control systems (many members were Microsoft employees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, units across a full range of capabilities were deployed in the preparation for and during the Iraq War, with a larger percentage of US Marine Reserves committed than any other service. The most heavily used components were light armour, engineers, assault amphibious elements, air and land transport communications, medical and civil affairs. Reservist engineers built the longest bridge in the history of the Marine Corps, and reservist infantry and light armour units controlled whole provinces in the aftermath. The reserves were called out at the very beginning and took only five days to mobilise on average. They were crucial to the US contribution: “We could not have done what we did without the Reserves”, noted Lieutenant General James T Conway, Commanding General, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). In Afghanistan, the US Marine Reserves played a major role once again, operating as formed units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian 1 Commando Regiment, which is part of their Army Reserve but has an amphibious role similar to marines in the US and the UK, repeatedly sent formed companies to Afghanistan. Their missions were population centric on several occasions, which involved deploying in remote and hazardous parts of the country, at risk from insurgent influence, and working to build the support of local communities for the Afghan National Security Forces and supporting International Security Assistance Force efforts to maintain security in the province. In this respect, they were similar to roles reportedly adopted by the US Green Berets and Britain’s SAS reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMR sent a steady trickle of individual augmentees, almost all junior ranks, to Iraq and Afghanistan. They served bravely and one, Lance Corporal Croucher, won a George Cross. Nevertheless, no formed units, even at platoon level, were deployed. While there are always national differences, it might seem at first blush that the UK’s marine reserve deployment might be somewhere in the scale of ambition between the US Marine Reserves and Australian Commandos in terms of size. In fact, they operated at a level well below both, with no formed element of any kind – a de facto verdict on regular confidence in the RMR officer corps on military operations, in contrast to their counterparts in other Five Eyes countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-assistance-key-skills&quot;&gt;Civil Assistance: Key Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Operation Rescript, the British military operation to help tackle Covid-19, MR officers and ratings performed a range of useful and sometimes challenging roles, filling new posts, including assisting the Cabinet Office. Ministers repeatedly applauded the innovative ideas that reservists put forward. One example was RMR officer Carlo Contaldi, a professor of theoretical physics in his day job, who received an MBE for applying his civilian skills to tackling the pandemic. The additional capacity the reserves provided to the regular armed forces reduced the impact on regular personnel. The operation arguably illustrated that the regular services are stretched in coping with a major crisis well short of war. This includes the headquarters command functions which, along with shore billets, have been reduced even since the height of the pandemic to send more regular naval personnel to sea. Reserves could provide important crisis capacity that is otherwise lacking and ensure a better understanding of their contribution to naval activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-a-new-way-forward-findings-recommendations-and-concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;III. A New Way Forward: Findings, Recommendations and Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge the Naval Service faces in relation to the Reserves lies in setting out an ambitious and lucid vision as to what is needed. Until recently, there was a lack of clarity. While the “Maritime Reserves Orders 2023–24” goes some way to deal with this, it has done so at the cost of lowering the level of ambition. IW, where the RNR is arguably forging ahead of its sister services, is an important exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core element of general warfare has some plans to get more sailors to sea, including continuing with opportunities on offshore patrol vessels and RMR detachments on certain vessels (the latter will be section sized commanded by an NCO). But ideas for building up opportunities for officers are still at an early stage. Key watchkeeping qualifications are recognised across the naval/merchant marine divide, but the feeling remains that putting reservist officers into seagoing roles is hard. Yet, the RN took a large batch of Merchant Navy officers into seagoing ranks after the Falklands War, with only three weeks at Dartmouth. Officers are regularly employed in seagoing posts in the major Five Eyes countries and reservists command patrol vessels in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a depressing parallel between the loss of the diving branch in general warfare and the collapse in the number of pilots still flying in what is now HMS Pegasus, although that organisation remains a centre of excellence in many other ways. Yet, the UK has one of the world’s leading aviation sectors and a large civilian diving sector associated with the hydrocarbon industry and, more recently, offshore wind. Both losses reflect the ever-increasing restrictions imposed by the Defence Safety Authority since the Haddon-Cave Report, which led to its founding, posing the question as to whether compromise can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also found that there remains little evidence that provision is being made for the potential threats to Britain’s “non-strategic” ports (most of them), coastal infrastructure or vulnerable cables, perhaps because, beyond the occasional survey ship, any such provision would be very expensive if provided by regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper found an important, strong element in the newly constituted IW Capability Group, which forms one of four such groups under the new MR structure. With its PTVR leadership, both at OF5 overall and in of its branches, it is setting the pace. Having reservists with civilian professional expertise in its niche capabilities controlling the vital N1 aspects of the unit (assisting recruiting, selection, reporting, etc.) at a time when the other services have been slow to exploit IW opportunities from the civilian sector, is critical in explaining its healthy growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the RMR, where more than a year was lost on Commando recruit courses while options were considered, it has simply reverted to the unambitious vision of a source of mostly other rank augmentees, which dates back to 1948, with no collective role beyond NCO-led (section-sized) detachments on ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point must be a reassessment of the demand and where the MR can best contribute. While the Maritime Directive was developed “bottom-up”, a “top-down” demand signal is required. Central to this is that the Naval Service appears to be less reserve-aware than its sister services. To address this, evidence from other UK and allied services suggests the need to ensure the reserve voice is heard and understood throughout the RN’s structure. This requires an appropriately senior PTVR officer on the Navy Board so that a greater understanding of the MR and its relevant abilities/capabilities is not only readily available but always considered in the initial option mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Reserves also need to be seeded throughout the system (for example, 3 Commando Brigade could have a PTVR Colonel Deputy Commander [Reserve]), as is the case with almost every Army brigade that contains reservists. That would give the reserves a voice in the same way they have in UK Special Forces and airborne forces. These positions should be filled with bona fide reservists, not just ex-regulars on FTRS or equivalent part-time contracts. The US Marines have gone much further, with reservist brigades commanded by reservists, and the British Army has now also established something similar in its new PTVR-commanded 19 Light Brigade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these posts already exist in the RNR in the form of the three RNR Captains covering groups of capabilities, but such posts are all in COMMARRES’ chain of command instead of the relevant capability command or HQ. To support the focus on Reserve outputs, they need to be more closely connected to the Naval Service’s relevant commands. This would mean having reserve units and personnel working in and for capability pillars through the new policy posts and deputy commanders outlined above, while protection of the reserve identity and taking responsibility for crucial N1 issues, would come under the new board member and run horizontally across the model. This pattern exists in the Army and is developing steadily in the RAF and Strategic Command. While removing the capability strands from COMMARRES’ control, it would require strengthening the remaining command support function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the case for the Reserves is complicated in the Naval Service by the lack of a cost model. The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory’s model for cost comparison between regular and reserve Army sub-units could be applied to elements of the MR to enable decision-making on their roles, structure and resourcing. It would inform discussion about issues which default to a regular solution or, as may be the case of “non-strategic” ports, simply lead to avoiding the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-to-sea&quot;&gt;Back to Sea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without dedicated ships, a much larger component of reservists could ease peacetime pressures and ensure a modest degree of scalability in tension and war, when coastal vessels would need increased crew levels, all at low cost. And, while training from scratch may be too challenging, leveraging commercial sailing experience could reduce the training burden. Today’s Merchant Navy, although a tiny fraction of Britain’s fleet in the first half of the 20th century, is still significant, with predominantly British officers (although few British ratings). The UK also has a substantial ferry sector and offshore oil support vessels while the number of fishing vessels is expected to grow post-Brexit. While the merchant fishing command qualification (STCW-II/1 Skipper Unlimited [Fishing]) is more limited in scope than its worldwide ocean-going counterpart, it could be an appropriate way forward for offshore patrol vessel reserve officer watchkeeping and command appointments. However, the need to sustain seaborne traffic to support the UK even in times of war will mean many commercial sailors will be required to continue in their peacetime roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, the MR could provide commanding officers for coastal vessels including offshore patrol vessels, as in Canada. The main argument against the use of reservists at sea is the increased complexity of modern warships. However, much equipment, from radios to sensors, is easier to operate than before, and many of the skills are comparable to ones common in civilian life, if they can be mapped. Furthermore, simulators greatly expand the opportunities for training on land and in modular packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenges are for training and gaining experience in command and senior engineering roles. The US and Canadian experience, and the RN’s successful experiment in 1982, may offer lessons (especially as frigates and destroyers then were arguably more complex than offshore patrol vessels today). Adopting Merchant Navy approaches might also offer solutions; instead of regionally based reserve ships that sit alongside for most of the year, allowing assets to be “sweated” at sea. The modern approach to ship crewing (for example, waterfront “squads”, rotating crews) could lend itself to the introduction of (largely) reserve crews that take their place in the rota for manning offshore patrol vessels, and vessels in refit, and provide scalability in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a case for considering more sponsored reserves – not like the RFA, who work full-time for Defence, but like the contracts for use of roll-on/roll-off ferries and (in the case of the RAF) tanker aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aviation-1&quot;&gt;Aviation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Pegasus is arguably a jewel in the UK armed forces’ crown. Its wide pool of skills is maintained on a very small budget. It has never recruited civilians because it has been able to fill its establishment entirely from pre-trained ex-regulars. The advent of RPAS and civilian drones that can be adapted for war, as Ukraine has shown, points to an opportunity to expand and develop new capabilities at low cost. Recruiting civilians as RNR reservists to fly and counter a range of drones would make military and economic sense, and with its current lead in reservist pilots, the Navy is well qualified to show the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ever-increasing aviation safety burden, contributing to the severe reduction in the number of pilots actually flying, needs to be addressed. The Haddon-Cave report was a response to a tragic incident which many believe stemmed from the downgrading of the engineering function in the upper tiers of the RAF a few years earlier. As with many aspects of Defence, work is needed to ensure a balance between increasingly restrictive safety requirements and outputs. War is inherently risky, and trying to eliminate all risk from preparing for it will not end well. Perhaps the solution is to reopen the issues that Haddon-Cave studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coastal-and-littoral-security-and-port-protection&quot;&gt;Coastal and Littoral Security and Port Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the return of great power competition and war in Europe, threats to the UK’s ports and wider coastal CNI have increased along with increased Russian activity in the UK’s littoral. The regular RN is stretched even at peacetime use levels, so any further demands for protection will add additional pressure on the force. Moreover, with RN assets concentrated on very few bases, the need to disperse and defend those additional locations in periods of heightened tension, let alone war, would be difficult with the current numbers. Similarly, coastal CNI will need additional protection, and it can be expected that more suspicious activity will occur in waters affecting the UK. How the Naval Service might respond to that is worth considering, especially given the importance the IR23 has placed on the maritime domain and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should contingent mass be needed, reserves across Defence could offer a cost-effective solution, although this need not be RN reserves, with Coast Guard, Border Agency and Police as other options – or a new organisation perhaps along the lines of the old Royal Naval Auxiliary service. If the expertise needed is land-based (for example, defending the vulnerable and critical drainage systems of nuclear power stations), elements of the RNR or the RN ex-regular reserve could be placed under command of the Army, which has a regional command and control capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the threat to ports, infrastructure and underground cables, history suggests that sea lanes and port approaches are vulnerable to mines. Reserves could offer extra capacity for mine warfare, especially with the adoption of remotely operated systems and divers drawn from the oil industry. Such scalability, lacking today, may be needed at short notice in a crisis. In contrast, the Army provides an EOD surge capability in search through the reserves, while recognising that fewer reserves will be able to carry out the disable task. This is a cost-effective approach to scalability. As with flying reserves, this requires a re-examination of safety issues. Such roles could be given to the Army, Police or elements (such as intelligence) to the Coastguard but, to keep it affordable, the surge capability needs to come from part-time capability because it is not needed most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal National Lifeboat Institution provides a standing example in which, where simple vessels are involved, part-time volunteers can operate as crews that respond at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-warfare-1&quot;&gt;Information Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The establishment of the IW branch to unite a range of reserve IW capabilities under one command, including a fast-growing information element, is welcome. Moreover, PTVR leadership is key to ensuring that N1 issues such as support to recruiting, selection and assessing professional development are handled by people who understand the specialist skills involved. Closer links with universities that have strong maritime reputations, like Southampton and Liverpool, might assist capabilities like intelligence and maritime trade by further harnessing civilian expertise. An earlier Navy Board’s decision to close the URNU in Southampton, which was co-located with Europe’s top oceanographic department and elements of the Antarctic Survey, looks short-sighted. The case for transferring it back from Portsmouth Naval Base should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More widely, however, this expanding area would benefit from explicitly broadening the MR’s mission from generating individuals to routinely fielding capability in teams. It is important that the current healthy relationship between the OAC and IW does not become assimilation, with all the implications that has for loss of understanding of reservist working patterns and the importance of distinctive N1 practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government should consider relaunching an offshore coastal reserve to attract yacht operators, fishermen and others to provide human intelligence on coastal trafficking. This could either fall under MR or the Coastguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;royal-marines-reserve&quot;&gt;Royal Marines Reserve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (regular) Royal Marines are a high-quality force currently redefining their role. They enjoy a range of proprietary infrastructure (even separate officer training), going well beyond, for example, airborne forces, the bulk of whose training is at mainstream Army establishments. This makes them expensive, yet they lack scalability; the shortage of officers in the RMR and lack of a proper role means that even in extremis it can deliver little more than a pool of junior rank augmentees. If the regular Commando brigade requires rotation or regeneration, the RMR would be unable to deliver this at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in modern war with a near-peer enemy, equipped with armoured vehicles, large-scale minelaying capabilities and air assets, including drones, it is inevitable that there will be casualties at levels not experienced in the Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. In Ukraine, officers on both sides are being disproportionately killed and wounded, so battlefield replacements will have to include officers as well as enlisted personnel. The shortage of junior officers in the current RMR calls into question their ability to provide battle casualty replacements, even in small numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the RMR uses the same central infrastructure and has an expensive network of buildings and permanent staff (in the latter case in contrast to the RNR), it should be possible to produce fully-fledged reserve units at relatively low cost, drawing on the UK model provided by 131 Commando Squadron RE and 4 Para and looking to the Australian Commandos. This should entail structuring units to provide a second wave as formed bodies, initially at sub-unit level, but, if funds allowed growth, potentially developing to unit level at lower readiness. As the officer corps rebuilds, introducing reserve primacy for command, as happens today in the RNR – and Army Reserve – should be a priority. It is time for Defence to be clear about what it wants from the RMR and whether it needs scalability in a force whose forward role means that large elements could be lost in short order in heavy fighting. Defence’s needs may not match what is convenient for the (regular) Royal Marines in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruiting&quot;&gt;Recruiting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring the steady progress in MR growth in the five years since 2018 is crucial. The reserve estate, which is currently under another review, should also maintain a broad geographic spread of reserve training centres to maximise recruitment opportunities. The Maritime Reserve Centres also require realistic levels of permanent staff support to go alongside the commendable investments the Naval Service has made in its facilities. There must also be a sensible and ring-fenced recruiting budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delays in the Defence Recruitment System are problematic, but there is a danger that reserve recruitment takes second place to regulars, which does not work. And the local nature of reserves activity needs to be reflected in the new recruiting system, with arrangements in place to allow those with medical and dental issues to be addressed swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MR need reserve-friendly training with a higher proportion delivered either in-person in regional training centres or virtually as envisaged in the 2020 Directive. The new approach, involving more specialisation, should help, but two resourcing issues must be addressed: the requirement for adequate and prioritised permanent staff to provide local instruction and availability of individual equipment where training is to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tacos&quot;&gt;TACOS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MR should move in line with the other two services and extend reserve careers to age 60 with exemptions beyond that for those with key skills that do not require the same fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the UK is to call on reserves routinely, the question of TACOS must be addressed. This should be led in the MoD as all three services’ reservists face similar issues. The RFCA EST recommends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;that RF30 takes forward, as a priority, work to simplify the TACOS available and guidelines, or policy (rules) for the appropriate TACOS to meet a given situation, i.e., RSDs for routine training; enhanced RSDs for short operational deployments (maximum 28 days) whether homeland resilience or DAOTO; and full mobilisation for longer deployments and more kinetic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review must ensure the outcome works for reservists, and also their families and employers, which is more complex than for regulars, who have no civilian employers and do not have to balance their off-duty family time with work in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-reserves&quot;&gt;Strategic Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further point is that it seems anomalous that COMMARRES has no responsibility for the Strategic Reserve of ex-regular personnel. If reserves are to play a larger role in the warfighting space, as RF30 envisages, then that should surely change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;honorary-officers&quot;&gt;Honorary Officers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final proposal is that the MR consider inviting members of their pool of prestigious honorary officers who are not attached to ships to each become honorary commodores for a reserve unit. This may require also recruiting a few more. In the Army and RAuxAF unit, honorary colonels and honorary air commodores provide an extra voice for each unit, with informal access to higher levels. At a time when the MR voice is so small in the wider Naval Service, this modest reform would seem overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MR contain a great deal of talent, although, in the case of the RMR, much of it is in the lower ranks rather than the shrunken officer corps. The RNR’s new shape, especially in the IW domain, promises progress, but clear demand signals are needed for both the RNR and RMR to show how reserves can provide scalability at sea and on land as well as specialists. That will require reserve voices in the major centres of policy and command in the Naval Service, from the Navy Board down. Defence also needs to re-evaluate the balance between safety requirements and military needs across the armed forces. This would widen the range of options across the reserve forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to the UK is increasing, and growth in defence funding is unlikely to match it. Reserve forces offer a way of building extra capability at low cost. The UK is an island nation; reserve forces offer the naval service a critical link to the civilian world and the innovation it brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;annex-the-maritime-reserve-organisation&quot;&gt;Annex: The Maritime Reserve Organisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This annex shows the organisation of the MR, with four sets of grouped capabilities and command support. The latter is extremely lean and would need strengthening, especially in the N1 personnel area, where the elements are to be distributed across the regular commands, as envisaged in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

Stockpiles may not offer the best solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has exposed the poor state of Western stockpiles and the difficulties of sustaining high-intensity conflict, even if fought by others. The support provided to Ukraine, which has been essential, has been achieved by drawing on already small numbers of weapons systems and low ammunition stockpiles. Attention across NATO has turned to rearmament – not only to replace stocks given to Ukraine, but to grow stockpiles to levels more suited to the threats that NATO and national security strategies identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s refreshed Integrated Review and Defence Command Paper in 2023 stress the need to grow stockpiles and expand industrial capacity. In the 2023 Budget, the Ministry of Defence received an extra £1.9 billion to replace items given to Ukraine and to invest in munitions infrastructure. In addition, production capacity has to grow. Both are necessary, but neither provides the answer. A third avenue could be to adopt an idea of prototyping reversionary capabilities that are simple enough to produce at scale in the event of war using a non-specialist industrial base – a policy of dissimilar rearmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stockpiles-will-never-be-enough&quot;&gt;Stockpiles Will Never be Enough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracies rarely (if ever) go into a major war with the armed forces they need to win, especially if that war is protracted and attritional. While Adam Smith observes that the first duty of government is the protection of its people, he notes that investment in the armed forces cannot be larger than a nation can afford to maintain. Defence ministries will always compete with other priorities, such as health, education and social security. And money tied up in stock is often seen as wasteful against commercial accounting procedures. Consequently, budgeting processes can incentivise the reduction of stockpiles to lower book costs. Unless the incentives and accounting rules change, stockpile growth now is likely to result in reductions later on – the disposal by 2020 of PPE stocks bought after the 2010 National Security Strategy which identified pandemics as a Tier 1 risk is indicative of the challenge of maintaining stocks for contingencies. Covid also highlights how stocks have a shelf-life, so storing them could result in them expiring before they are needed. Moreover, uncertainty over the character of a future war can make investment in stocks of a singular capability meaningless – Mastiff, which was very effective against IEDs in Iraq, is less so in Ukraine against artillery or anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution could be to create more international stockpiles where countries pool their stocks and draw on the larger pool as required. NATO would be an obvious organisation for coordinating this, but it would require member states to go beyond interoperability and to do more to standardise their weapons, munitions and policies for storage, carriage and certification. Reinvigorating the NATO Standards Organisation is a start, but this will raise difficult questions regarding industrial sovereignty and it will take time to transition to the common standards, so it is not a quick fix. The Vilnius Summit offers some hope through the commitment to materiel standardisation and encouraging multinational cooperation, but whether this will be delivered remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If large stockpiles are not the sole answer, expanding production capacity to ensure replacement weapons and munitions can be produced quickly is logical. But industrial capacity that lies fallow most of the time is expensive, and industry would have to be compensated for its preservation. This would be a large bill for governments, and whether paid by defence or industry ministries, the taxpayer would ultimately fund it; Adam Smith’s affordability warning remains relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even allowing for faster production in wartime, it is implausible that combat losses of major equipment will be replaced at anything like a “speed of relevance”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While growth in defence industrial capacity is sensible, it is always likely to lag behind what is actually needed in a major war, and to be potentially focused on sophisticated capabilities for which workforce skills and supply chains may atrophy when production lines close – the US order for Stinger missiles to support Ukraine in May 2022 will probably see the first missiles roll off the production line in 2026, despite having brought back retired workers and needing to reengineer obsolete electronic components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An understanding of the supply chain and industrial ecosystem, including the skills base, is crucial; it is not enough to maintain capacity at the level of the defence prime if the suppliers do not exist or have capacity issues that will disrupt production flows. For example, there are very few steel mills in Europe capable of producing large quantities of armoured steel, and these rely on anthracite coal, the supply of which traditionally came from Donbas but has been disrupted by the war. Expanding production lines for tanks, therefore, is pointless if the armoured steel is not available. The same is true of stocks of long-lead items or the clamours for more additive manufacturing presses unless stocks of powders that the machines use to print are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costs and capacity issues can be mitigated through exports, but this requires UK manufacturers to produce things the rest of the world wants to buy – probably not exquisite capabilities, but affordable weapons designed for armed forces from Day 2 of a conflict onwards. It also requires government to take industrial engagement with partners more seriously and to take a longer-term view – closer to that of the French approach that uses persistent political engagement, rather than the UK’s tendency for high-level ministerial engagement only when large contracts are ready to sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limits-of-symmetrical-rearmament&quot;&gt;The Limits of Symmetrical Rearmament&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial capacity will never be enough, but even where capacity exists, it will take time to replace battlefield losses. Like-for-like replacement of sophisticated modern weapons systems will not be quick. Accepting that the timeline today is a peacetime one, the order for the second batch of Type 26 frigates was placed in late 2022, with construction of the last ship to be completed by the mid-2030s. Even simpler systems, like tanks, are too slow to deliver, with the upgrade of 148 Challenger 2 tanks to Challenger 3 taking over 6 years: Russia has allegedly lost over 4,000 tanks in the 18 months since invading Ukraine. So, even allowing for faster production in wartime – something defence, industry and the workforce are not practising – it is implausible that combat losses of major equipment will be replaced at anything like a “speed of relevance”. Given this reality, symmetrical rearmament is a chimera. And it is unlikely that networks of shadow factories can deliver modern platforms – this may have worked for Spitfires, but F35s will not be coming out of garages and coachbuilders because the production facilities, tools and skills are vastly different today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dissimilar-rearmament&quot;&gt;Dissimilar Rearmament&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissimilar rearmament envisages simpler weapons systems, perhaps made smarter with AI or more robust electronic components, that are mass-produced quickly at simple manufacturing sites and by lower-skilled workforces, or even additive manufacture. Individually less sophisticated than the weapons they replace, collectively they would provide the ability to sustain a fight until such time as better solutions can be found. The Ukraine war provides plenty of examples where dissimilar rearmament has given an advantage to Ukraine, and indeed Russia, that they would otherwise have lacked, such as uninhabited surface vessels, old tanks, cardboard drones and quadcopters able to carry RPGs and other explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While not a panacea, the idea of dissimilar rearmament is worthy of further exploration to test its viability, alongside replenishing depleted stockpiles and strengthening industrial capacity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be three levels of dissimilar capability. Level 1 would use pre-existing platforms for military roles, much as China is doing where new merchant vessels are built with the capacity for military use, or sensor/weapons pylons that can be fitted to commercial aircraft to provide standoff reconnaissance or strike capabilities in extremis. Level 3 would consist of commercial off-the-shelf capabilities with all of their frailties, but which could be manufactured rapidly. Level 2 would sit between these and would be based on either standard commercial products with some adaptation for defence purposes, or military-grade designs where the cost and complexity required remains favourable. Level 2 would therefore be a broad church, and there would be no single approach within – let alone across – domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissimilar rearmament could offer a systematic model that connects science and technology, innovation and defence-industrial partnerships though continuous prototyping of reversionary weapons. Companies would have responsibility for specific capabilities, for which they would develop and test prototypes that could be rapidly manufactured, including under licence – a sort of Defence analogy of the ventilator challenge during Covid, but taking place in advance, because the four ventilator types chosen for mass production were based on pre-existing designs. Defence would purchase the intellectual property and experiment with the capability to ensure appropriate tactics, techniques and procedures, but the reversionary capability would not go into full-scale production except in wartime. The design authority would iterate the design so that the blueprints always represented viable capabilities. They might even be paired with pre-identified licensees who could be remunerated for preserving capacity and skills to be activated in a time of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimentation units within the armed forces would work with the design authorities to ensure not only that the technology was ready, but that the military had a pre-prepared ability to rush such items into service, including training users and maintainers on the equipment. These experimentation units might be operated by the Reserves as a way of ensuring that first-echelon forces are able to focus on the primary equipment in the inventory, and to bring an openness to non-traditional uses of equipment – a form of organisational ambidexterity where the regular units represent conventional (or traditional) capabilities, and the Reserves the unconventional ones. It would also ensure that the equipment could be used by those with less formal military training, which is likely to be necessary in the event of a major war where the first echelon might be expected to suffer significant levels of casualties. The second echelon, therefore, might be designed, trained and equipped differently to the first echelon: the first echelon focusing on competitive advantage through premier capabilities, and the second echelon configured for fighting with what would realistically be available to it in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, problems with the notion of dissimilar rearmament. The nuclear deterrent seeks to avoid the need for the UK to field massed citizen armies; should its activation be necessary, deterrence will have failed, but it is uncertain whether the prime minister would resort to the use of nuclear weapons. Short of nuclear war, industrial incentives must still exist, and will therefore compete with funds for more capable weapons. Dissimilar rearmament also requires greater partnership between defence ministries and industry, and among companies who in other respects may see themselves as competitors. Finally, it does not solve the problem that defence will be paying for something that it may never need to use in anger, even if it is cheaper than the more traditional alternative of large stockpiles or preserving industrial capacity that lies dormant for much of the time. However, there is precedent: the Royal Aircraft Factories between 1911 and 1918 produced numerous designs, many of which were intended as research aircraft, to keep pace with the rapid developments in the emerging technology of powered flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a panacea, therefore, the idea of dissimilar rearmament is worthy of further exploration to test its viability, alongside replenishing depleted stockpiles and strengthening industrial capacity. There is a balance to be struck, but current plans appear to overly prioritise approaches that are unlikely to give the UK what it needs for a prolonged conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leadership in technology innovation is being challenged by China’s rise. Concerns over intellectual property (IP) rights protection in China continue to heighten as innovation increasingly becomes a key area of strategic competition. The United States needs to strengthen the development of nonlegal IP protection approaches so that U.S. firms are not vulnerable in relying on foreign legal systems to secure intellectual assets overseas. China’s role a strategic competitor should not deter the United States from harnessing Chinese talent, resources, and innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of losing U.S. IP and technology can be mitigated, as Taiwan’s experience demonstrates. This report lays the foundation for nonlegal measures structured on a practical checklist derived from Acer Group founder Stan Shih’s “Smiling Curve,” which charts the value added by each step along the production process. Mirroring the lip’s upward curl, Shih’s curve proposes that value is higher at the beginning and end of production. Specifically, product concept, research and development (R&amp;amp;D), prototype, at the start of production plus branding, sales and service at the end account for the majority of value production. The checklist focuses attention on four critical areas with high risk of unauthorized IP transfer: personnel, local partners, suppliers, and factories. The handful of actionable items for each category serves as the beginnings of a checklist that should be customized to fit unique companies and situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checklist of nonlegal courses of action can help U.S. firms operating in foreign jurisdictions preserve agency despite unfriendly legal or political environments. If, however, the United States continues to fixate on legal reforms abroad, U.S. firms will become increasingly fragile in expecting the same legal predictability in allied and rival countries. This path is counterproductive to maintaining the leading innovator position because developing markets with emerging opportunities in technologies are often weakly governed by the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the massacre in Tiananmen Square frightened Western investors in 1989, Taiwanese businesses and policymakers grasped the opportunity to gain market share and influence in China. Amid today’s tensions, Taiwan has continued to invest in China because they have built an IP approach that protects their interests, despite open hostility and little assurance of legal protection. The same approach is available to the United States once leaders acknowledge that learning self-protection via nonlegal means is equal in importance to influencing the international rule of law to meet the exceptional U.S. standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and technology innovation is a key area for strategic competition with China. As part of this, influence in the legal protection of intellectual property (IP) is a critical front of contestation. Although both U.S. and Chinese policymakers have tightened access to their technology assets via export bans, the respective markets remain attractive for the talent pool and consumer power. As a result, only one in five Western companies want complete decoupling from China. However, concerns over IP theft are widely publicized, as seen in statements by heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and MI5. In addition, Xi Jinping’s recent remarks were uncharacteristically direct in naming the United States as a hostile force that seeks to “contain, encircle and suppress” China. Therefore, escalating political tensions may heighten U.S. wariness toward Chinese courts, which are no longer reliable for protecting IP, despite continued efforts for judicial reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report draws on the Taiwanese experience and focuses on nonlegal measures for IP protection in light of declining predictability in the Chinese legal system. For U.S. small and medium businesses, the legal dimension of IP protection is accessible, and authoritative guidelines exist. However, if the legal system itself is unreliable, then more attention should be paid to practical tactics so as to avoid the use of Chinese courts. To fill the gap in understanding IP vulnerability in China, this paper highlights the IP protection practices of Taiwanese companies in a checklist format. Taiwanese businesses have long operated in China during political turmoil and have a strong record of safeguarding IP. Notable examples include Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), both of which own highly sensitive IP for secretive clients such as Apple. Therefore, Taiwanese businesses are a rich resource in formulating China-based operations that are effective against IP loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonlegal checklist of IP preventative measures is not limited to application in China. As experts such as Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani and businessmen such as TSMC founder Morris Chang brace for a multipolar world, the United States need to reassess the reliance on law for protecting its innovations overseas. Instead of urging foreign nations to improve their intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes, this may be a moment for the United States to retool and innovate by building expertise to protect IP outside of legal means. By taking important lessons from Taiwan on building internal systems to manage IP, U.S. firms can design their coupling with global markets to be selective and precise. This report leverages the Taiwanese conception of an interconnected value chain and highlights actionable measures in four areas critical to IP loss prevention: personnel, local partners, suppliers, and factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reorienting the focus on legal reform toward improving resilience among U.S. firms operating overseas improves the United States’ ability to engage diverse international markets and to continue being a global leader in innovation. Especially as reshoring proves to be more difficult than expected due to work culture differences, the ability to manage IP flows outside of the United States will shape the future of U.S. influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;untenable-reliance-on-law-in-global-innovation&quot;&gt;Untenable Reliance on Law in Global Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 3, 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the article “The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-Arm Jurisdiction and its Perils,” accusing the United States of enforcing its domestic law in extraterritorial jurisdictions. Less than a month later, the Wall Street Journal published “China’s Newest Weapon to Nab Western Technology—Its Courts,” detailing instances where the Chinese legal system coerced foreign companies to relinquish their technology. However, the debate around U.S. influence on global IP is not new, and U.S. legal scholars have challenged the claims of unfairness in Chinese courts meagerly substantiated by anecdotes. U.S. demands for legal reform as a method to protect U.S. IP is becoming increasingly untenable as Chinese leadership hardens its stance against U.S. influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report steps above the skirmish for legal influence to question the paradigm of reliance on the rule of law to secure U.S. innovation abroad. Recent research shows that U.S. federal and state courts struggle to understand the principles that guide illiberal legal systems, including in China. In addition, the rapid pace of technological development makes legal response a defensive reaction with lagging international reach. Therefore, it is questionable whether legal reform should be the primary focus of foreign policy to sustain the United States as the leading innovator globally. For IPR reform, the 2022 Special 301 Report released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is critical for establishing new rules to protect U.S. interests. Unfortunately, it relies on “voluntary” change from target countries, which leaves U.S. companies passive when U.S.-led change is rejected, as in the case of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Special 301’s aggressive unilateralism yielded moderate success in changing foreign markets—such as during Japan’s rise in the 1980s—China’s strategic challenge to U.S. global leadership should be treated differently. The Special 301 report identifies countries with IP protection or enforcement issues that are detrimental to innovation worldwide. Unsurprisingly, China was named in the Priority Watch List (along with 6 others), while close partners such as Canada and Mexico appeared on the Watch List with 18 others.14 According to this USTR perspective, IP appears to be under threat in many countries with substantial trade and manufacturing relations with the United States (Figure 1). However, unlike other countries on the list, China’s ambition to displace the United States is backed by long-term plans to (1) blunt U.S. power, (2) build Chinese regional power, and (3) expand Chinese reach globally.15 U.S. innovation globally may suffer as China presents an alternate market and partnership model for nations unable or unwilling to oblige U.S. demands, such as France.&lt;/p&gt;

Author’s own creation using mapchart.net.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has encouraged global markets to adopt U.S. domestic legal standards with some success; however, the high level of legal predictability does not exist in most of the world. U.S. firms should not be misled by the USTR to expect uniform legal enforcement globally. Instead, preventative IP protection measures should become common knowledge in order to circumvent the use of foreign legal systems. The advantages of a strong rule of law domestically that shelter U.S. firms should not translate into crippling naiveté in navigating diverse legal systems abroad. In fact, weaker IP regimes present opportunities to harness knowledge spillover that Taiwanese firms have maneuvered to their advantage, and partially (not universally) strong IPR can improve global welfare. Learning from the case of Taiwan, innovators can move past the reliance on law-anchored IP protection when manufacturing beyond U.S. shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taiwanese-experience&quot;&gt;The Taiwanese Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economy depends on safeguarding the IP of foreign partners, yet it continues to invest in risky markets such as China. Taiwanese firms are contracted as original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and original design manufacturers (ODM) by clients such as Apple, Tesla, Peloton, Microsoft, and Amazon. Notable examples of Taiwanese OEMs and ODMs include Foxconn, Wistron, Pegatron, and TSMC, all of which have operations in China. TSMC is often spotlighted for its global dominance in the semiconductor industry because 92 percent of advanced chips are manufactured in Taiwan. As a result, TSMC is a key partner for both the United States and China, as both seek to become self-sufficient for critical goods such as chips in order to lead in science and technology innovation. China announced the “National Semiconductor Industry Development Guidelines” in 2014 and Made in China 2025 in 2015. Despite the threat of competition, TSMC applied to the Taiwanese government in 2015 for permission to build a 12-inch wafer foundry in Nanjing, China, which would be cutting-edge by Chinese standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to manage risks allows Taiwanese firms to capture market advantages that contribute to its dominance. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and subsequent drop in foreign investment, Taiwanese businesses patched the gaping wound of China’s economy, and Taipei began to permit and document indirect investments into China. In 1991, Taiwan overtook the United States and Japan as the largest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) to China, surpassed only by Hong Kong (Figure 2). By 1992, foreign businesses returned and China’s GDP was revitalized from a growth rate of 4 percent in 1990 to 14 percent. On the one hand, Taiwan became adept at navigating precarious political environments, and on the other, it tightened its grip on advanced technology and manufacturing capabilities that forced others to be reliant. Similar to the post-Tiananmen response, Taiwanese companies post-Covid-19 continue to invest in the Chinese market, as discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dl3bRWd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report draws on the experiences and research of Taiwanese academics and businesses. Since the first direct presidential election in 1995, Taiwan has posed a threat to the Chinese Communist Party because it embodies an alternative governance model. As a result, the self-ruled island is subjected to elaborate disinformation campaigns and cyber warfare from China. Because of this, other countries have taken lessons from Taiwan on combating disinformation and cybersecurity. In the same vein, the Taiwanese experience of safeguarding IP in Chinese jurisdiction can offer insights and best practices for U.S. audiences. Due to the lack of stability and guarantee in cross-strait relations, Taiwanese firms have evolved to protect the IP entrusted to them by foreign partners through nonlegal measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nonlegal-approach-to-intellectual-property-protection&quot;&gt;Nonlegal Approach to Intellectual Property Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Covid-19 struck, the drawbacks of offshoring the manufacturing sector set off alarms for Western firms, but Taiwanese companies continued to enter the Chinese market. The pandemic highlighted the widening gap of manufacturing capabilities and supply chain control. Augmented by the Made in China 2025 strategic challenge, the vulnerability of global dependence on China prompted foreign policy analysts to take up concepts such as nearshoring, friend-shoring, reshoring, and decoupling. However, a 2020 survey showed that just under 20 percent of thought leaders from the United States, Europe, and Asia want complete decoupling. Echoing the sentiment, USTR Katherine Tai has explicitly opposed the use of “decoupling” and “deglobalization” and instead borrowed the European term “de-risking” as her preferred approach. Another survey focused on 525 Taiwanese executives found that among the 331 respondents with business in China, 31 percent planned to stay and 33 percent were considering moving. Notably, among the 177 Taiwanese firms with plans to relocate capacity out of Taiwan, mainland China was chosen as a destination by 21 percent of the respondents, even in the face of recent tumultuous market trends. Their willingness to move into China is aided by a familiar understanding that risk management and value creation go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese market remains attractive for both the size of its economy and its talented workforce, despite fears of dependence and the risks of losing cutting-edge technology. The Chinese policy of “trading market access for technology” began as early as the 1980s, and Taiwanese firms have learned to selectively utilize China’s strength in technological development while keeping critical IP safe. On the other hand, the United States continues to focus on legal measures. For example, the U.S.-China Business Council began its IP protection best practice guide by recommending that U.S. parties understand the legal landscape and register patents and trademarks as preventative measures. Although the advice is not wrong, the Taiwanese approach relies less on legal systems and instead focuses on securing key areas of value via nonlegal means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder of Taiwanese conglomerate Acer Group, Stan Shih, coined the “Smiling Curve,” which is the foundation for this report’s approach. Shih’s curve charted the value added by each step in the production process. Based on Shih’s concept, Shin-Horng Chen of the Taiwanese Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research expanded the curve to dispel the binary approach of “high-end” and “low-end” tasks in the production chain so that value added in the cross-strait production network can be viewed holistically. In an interview for this project, Chen noted that his newest research focuses on “market-centric segmentation of global value chains” to reflect the bifurcation of production processes that separately serve Chinese and U.S. markets. This report contends that IP protection can be similarly deconstructed across the production chain so that U.S. firms entering China can selectively engage and manage IP loss risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although IP protection has been negotiated between the United States and China since 1979, enforcement issues persist. Some scholars have attributed the issue to China’s inter-bureaucratic competition, while others have argued Confucian values “militated against thinking of the fruits of intellectual endeavor as private property.” Regardless of the origin of ineffective IPR enforcement, foreign businesses continue to focus on legal mechanisms for the protection of their IP. Unlike the United States, the consistent application of law is not found in most countries. However, legal unpredictability can be advantageous. Counterintuitively, Taiwanese firms prefer to set up research and development in countries with weak IPR protection because of benefits from knowledge spillover. Therefore, destinations for manufacturing partnerships should not be determined solely on the ability to defend IP through litigation, but instead nonlegal measures should receive more attention. In fact, TSMC’s portfolio of IP includes 90 percent trade secrets and 10 percent patents. A retired Acer R&amp;amp;D executive, Louis Lu, commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was at Acer for 18 years . . . we only considered filing patents if infringement is easy to prove in court, especially when infringement is visible and obvious. If not, the best way to keep the knowledge safe is as a trade secret. For example, our chemical processing method for a component is not conspicuous, so we keep it as a trade secret. Coca Cola’s recipe is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, IP enforcement must take the local market characteristics into account and supplement the use of publicly filed patents, along with privately secured trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the usefulness of trade secrets, the research on IP is skewed toward publicly filed patents, copyrights, and trademarks. The cause is multifaceted. Firstly, academic research on trade secrets is difficult because it requires industry experience to grasp the practical constraints of manufacturing. Conversely, publicly filed IP is innately accessible, and years of data can be used to characterize historical activity and forecast trends. Secondly, industry experience is difficult to come by, as employed personnel cannot divulge the protective measures used because it will be rendered less effective once revealed. Retired personnel may be interviewed, but the knowledge may be dated and will likely be protected by confidentiality agreements. Lastly, as the manufacturing sector moved abroad, factory operations became foreign and inaccessible to corporate managers based in the United States. This report aims to draw from Taiwanese expertise in protecting IP beyond conventional advice to counter legal unpredictability, diplomatic uncertainty, and apparent IP asset vulnerability outside U.S. jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off Shih’s “Smiling Curve,” the curve in this report traces the relative amount of value added through the same 10 steps, but instead of demarcating Taiwan, China, and foreign brands as the critical parties, this “Secret Smiling Curve” accounts for embedded trade secrets and disaggregates personnel, local partners, suppliers, and factories (Figure 4). The four categories are selected because they trigger critical “pause points” when hiring and firing personnel, surveying and enlisting local partners, sourcing and selecting suppliers, and designing and building factories. Rooted in the China context, the checklist aims to be useful in jurisdictions with “weak” IP protection from the legal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-checklist-manifesto&quot;&gt;The Checklist Manifesto&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP audits became a common practice in the 1990s as governments, corporations, and intergovernmental organizations such as the World Intellectual Property Organization published best practice guidelines. Large corporations may use IP audits to visualize “technology heat maps” to evaluate mergers and acquisitions for strategic decisions. However, for small and medium firms, comprehensive IP management tools and expensive lawyers may not be accessible, and guides with exhaustive lists of questions are inefficient. Due to the costly maintenance of systematic IP audits, this report proposes a checklist approach (see “The Checklist” section). Inspired by Atul Gawande’s The Checklist Manifesto, this report’s checklist is developed to be terse and focused on “pause points” before critical steps are taken. The condensed checklist is not a replacement for comprehensive surveys that should be conducted with lawyers, as legal professionals are better equipped to identify, classify, document, and validate a firm’s IP through exhaustive checklists. In addition, though the checklist focuses on the Taiwanese offshoring context in China, it can be expanded for use in other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atul Gawande, a surgeon and the assistant administrator for global health at the United States Agency for International Development, authored The Checklist Manifesto to build a system that addresses the gray area between ignorance and ineptitude in the healthcare sector. A checklist seems ill-suited to capture the overwhelming web of knowledge required to mitigate risks of IP loss. However, Gawande argues that checklists anchor routines to optimize the balance of “freedom and discipline, craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration.” A pilot’s engine failure checklist includes “Fly the Plane” to redirect attention back to the basics despite overwhelming distress from the threat of death. For companies on the brink of inking potentially momentous expansion plans, a similar rush of adrenaline may cloud judgment so that seemingly obvious steps to protect their IP are forgotten. Therefore, a checklist catches similar gaps between ignorance and ineptitude in IP protection abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike comprehensive reports and guidelines that require a break from normal routine, checklists are designed as a final inspection to catch common but critical lapses. As opposed to centralized knowledge and decisionmaking at headquarters, checklists facilitate standardization without removing power and responsibility at the periphery where managers are executing contracts and plans. The list is designed around four categories of “pause points” for foreign firms when key decisions are made along the “Secret Smiling Curve” (Figure 4) related to personnel, local partners, suppliers, and factories in China. Therefore, the manager with purview that encompasses all four functions should activate the checklist and track its progress. Typically, the most suitable candidate will be the country or regional director in a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personnel&quot;&gt;Personnel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, 87 percent of trade secret misappropriations are conducted by employees or ex- employees as opposed to external personnel. The trend is similar for most of the world, including the United States. Although noncompete clauses are being debated for their damage to employees and competition, the clauses are generally permitted in China. However, an interviewee remarked: “Employment contracts and confidentiality agreements are mostly deterrents—they are a necessary preventative measure. But in reality, enforcement is weak in China.” Therefore, Taiwanese firms have learned to leverage organization design, training, and task allocation as techniques to minimize IP leakage due to labor mobility. The pre-Covid-19 worldwide employee turnover rate was 10.9 percent across all industries, with technology (software) suffering the highest rate of employees voluntarily leaving, at 13.2 percent. For China, the average employee turnover rate across industries is 20.8 percent, while the technology (internet) sector sees nearly triple the global average, at 36.0 percent. In other words, you can expect one in 7.5 employees to leave each year at global technology companies, compared to one in 2.8 employees in China. Therefore, designing the organization to retain IP despite the mobile workforce is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a cleanroom design between teams.&lt;/strong&gt; The concept of cleanrooms is now part of popular consciousness due to Covid-19. For Taiwanese companies, cleanroom organization designs hamper IP theft and challenge claims of IP infringement from competitors. Taking software development as an example, instead of the incoming R&amp;amp;D requests going directly to the coding execution team, an added intermediary person creates a “cleanroom” so that the team physically and virtually keeps the inputs and outputs apart (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread key tasks across time and space.&lt;/strong&gt; Large corporations spread subsidiaries throughout China to avoid consolidated knowledge. For smaller companies with limited budgets, an accepted practice is to break up knowledge between day and night shift teams. In addition, newly established teams should be time tested by starting with nonsensitive tasks to build competence before proprietary projects should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xukCerI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Information Flow in Standard and Cleanroom Team Structures.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s own research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modularize product during conception.&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage the innate characteristics of products to modularize the product. For example, splitting hardware and software development enforces barriers to IP theft on two fronts so that one will not work without the other, effectively creating a lock and key system when taken as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct design and development (D&amp;amp;D), not R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwanese companies typically perform basic research on the island, while development work to bring the innovation to market can be performed within China. In addition to development, designs for the local market may be differentiated from international market products, as the Chinese market is typically sufficiently large to warrant a separate localized version. Some localization efforts have failed, but an added layer of product differentiation may shield the international market from copycats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disperse tasks to fragment knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; With the cleanroom design in mind, team leaders should allocate tasks so that knowledge around a key function or component is not aggregated within one employee. For example, if a commonly found equipment is used, the engineer inputting the parameters will aggregate significant know-how that should be fragmented. In the chipmaking context, ASML is the only equipment supplier for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography machines; therefore, experienced engineers are a storage of competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict access to prototypes and key components.&lt;/strong&gt; Many underestimate the speed of Chinese copycats that release new features and “good enough” innovations ahead of multinationals as shanzhai (guerilla) products. Accidental or intentional early access to a new product innovation may lose its value if nimble copycats release it before the original. Key components may be physically secured by suppliers, but employees with knowledge of where to procure them may create vulnerabilities if competitors buy off the proprietary information or hire away employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train all employees on IP and confidentiality and document the training.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the most important point in this section: employee awareness of what constitutes IP leak vulnerability should be continually reinforced. In addition, documentation of training and confidentiality agreements should be kept as future evidence if IP theft is suspected. Leverage the sales and marketing teams as competitor surveillance mechanisms to report potential IP infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company’s personnel represents the greatest vulnerability and is linked to local partner selection. Poor choice of partners may create future competitors that absorb sufficient know-how to displace and replace the original innovator. However, strong local partners can be pivotal. For example, even though TSMC is the key target for poaching talent for Chinese state-backed competitors such as Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Quanxin Integrated Circuit Manufacturing, it maintains a low total turnover rate of 4.9 percent. Even after TSMC’s former chief operating officer, Chiang Shang-yi, made the “foolish” mistake of joining Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, TSMC continued to be trusted by its clients for exceptional reliability and trustworthiness. Therefore, selecting a partner that can withstand the onslaught of competitors and temptation to take over the entire value chain is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-partners&quot;&gt;Local Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common partnership approaches include technology licensing, joint venture, product reseller, and contract manufacturer. In general, higher dependency on a local partner warrants more profit or technology sharing to ensure the agreement can be sustained (Figure 6). Depending on the specific design and sourcing of the final product, several subcategories of partnerships can be created. For example, tangible products manufactured outside of China can enter the market with reseller agreements that are subcategorized as exclusive or authorized resellers. Exclusive reseller agreements increase the profits gained by the sole local partner, as well as the dependency on their performance. However, the risk of high dependency is typically balanced by selecting a sizable partner that has market advantages in sales channels or brand recognition. On the other hand, nonexclusive authorized reseller agreements allow foreign brands to engage several resellers and mitigate dependency on a single partner. In another example, technology licensing can be subcategorized as cutting-edge or older-generation technology licenses. Although cutting-edge technology may confer first-mover advantages, older-generation technology often has a proven track record in sales and performance; therefore, local partners may be amenable to less profit in exchange for calculable returns on investment. For example, older-generation medical devices that are proven to work reliably will have more transparent pricing and therefore smaller margins. On the other hand, cutting-edge technology depends on the quality of the local partner to make inroads with new customers and use cases; therefore, more profits are shared with the local partner, but local market success will also depend heavily on the quality of the local partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Dependency-Profit Sharing Paradigm of Partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a large market such as China, partners are enticed to eventually cut out the foreign brand or technology licensor in order to retain more profit because marginal gains are enormous. Therefore, tension in the relationship increases as Chinese partners become more successful. Specifically, foreign partners increase dependency on Chinese partners because they hold growing shares of global profits. Smaller Chinese firms will perceive a risk of being replaced by larger or more notable local partners. On the other hand, larger Chinese firms have the capability to invest in developing their own product once the market opportunity is proven. The tension of successful partnerships is lessened in smaller markets, such as Taiwan or Singapore. The limits of the domestic market force companies to grow by trading with global partners via trust and reputation. Therefore, the risk-reward calculus difference in China inevitably increases the propensity for partners to seek larger rewards by breaking away from the foreign partner. Using the “Secret Smiling Curve” (Figure 4), the below items warrant dedicated attention to manage the risks associated with relying on local partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct product R&amp;amp;D with suitable partner type and size.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese firms that have exceptionally strong R&amp;amp;D capabilities have fewer barriers to reverse engineer products, which is legal. Other than visiting the facilities to meet the R&amp;amp;D team, their patent portfolio should also be examined to avoid nurturing potential competitors. Further, it is helpful to use enterprise databases such a Qi Cha Cha to review the shareholder structure, paying particular attention to competing companies holding shares. The National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System is also useful for providing a history of irregular activity or lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay sharing prototypes and process design.&lt;/strong&gt; Lead time to market is an advantage that can counter shanzhai copycats. An interviewee mentioned that they saw a competitor’s early prototype while passing through the facilities of a shared partner. Therefore, partners such as labs or contract manufacturers may inadvertently expose early designs to competitors out of negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclude details on key components and parts.&lt;/strong&gt; Local partners may request typically proprietary information, but there are usually workarounds available. For example, medical equipment certification requires submitting information to the governing body, and local partners may request more information than necessary, including details on key components. A workaround is to find a third-party agency that can complete the registration on behalf of both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Withhold global profit and sales data.&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain an information advantage in partnerships that expect renegotiation of terms by withholding profit and sales data. External parties have less ground to stand on to increase their share of profits without data. Data on profit margin and sales can be roughly derived from procurement or service orders, so the relative standing of a particular partner among other geographies should be occluded whenever possible. As the Chinese saying goes: “no comparison, no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer technology that is one or two generations behind.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, older technology can be positioned as a less risky option for partners. In addition, it provides valuable lead time for U.S. firms to establish a firm hold on global markets and prevents Chinese local partners with strong absorptive capacity from replacing the original U.S. innovator. This is particularly relevant for fast-evolving products, such as consumer goods and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suppliers&quot;&gt;Suppliers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this report, suppliers are companies and partners that provide intermediate goods, whereas contract manufacturers in the previous section produce finished or near-finished goods. Intermediate goods include physical products, such as phone casings or liquid preservatives, but may also include software. Although suppliers have the ability to move up or down the supply chain, the final product is difficult to innovate for parts suppliers, according to the Taiwanese experience. On the other hand, competitors present a threat if Chinese suppliers are willing to sell intermediate goods that have embedded IP, especially for key parts and components. Therefore, the critical items to account for in the checklist are deterrent measures to guard against the threat to IP from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set penalties for suppliers of proprietary parts.&lt;/strong&gt; Supplier agreements for key components and parts should include clear conditions to punish with penalties if proprietary products are sold to competitors. An interviewee mentioned that competitors may offer double the standard price to purchase cutting-edge parts; therefore, it is necessary to set strong deterrents, such as charging 100 times the product price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid sharing suppliers with key competitors for ordinary components and parts.&lt;/strong&gt; Check the client list of suppliers, even for commonly found parts or components. Although it may be difficult to avoid sharing suppliers—especially for commodified goods where economies of scale make the leading supplier an attractive choice—the execution of daily activities can be separated. For example, leading suppliers may have several factories, warehouses, and project management teams to choose from. An interviewee remarked that a factory visit revealed the next-generation product of a competitor because the shared supplier was not conscious of IP that can be gleaned visually, such as design and physical specification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preassemble imported key intermediate goods.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid disclosing raw materials to downstream suppliers by preassembling. For example, solvents used in medical devices may use specialized raw materials that can be proprietary knowledge. To prevent leaking the recipe for assembling the ingredients, the “half-baked” intermediate goods can be imported instead of the raw materials to protect not only the supplier list and ingredient list but also the method of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;factories&quot;&gt;Factories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical design of a factory managed by U.S. executives can integrate IP protection safeguards. To prove theft of trade secrets, observable steps need to be taken to show the courts that effort was made to preserve confidentiality. Examples of measures that Chinese courts use to judge sufficiency of protective action include password restricted access to information, confidential watermarks on documents, and confidentiality agreements with employees and partners. Therefore, factories should be set up to optimize the surveillance and documentation of personnel activities so as to deter and counter unwanted knowledge transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, healthy relationships should be maintained with local government officials because their incentives are not necessarily aligned with national plans for domestic innovation. Specifically, national efforts for technological self-sufficiency may be in tension with local government incentives focused on economic growth. For example, in 2010, the Taiwanese flat-panel technological resources were “conspicuously targeted” by the Chinese national central government due to fear of dependency, but local-level governments rely on exports to foreign markets, which will not accept inferior products made with locally sourced parts. Therefore, in practice, local governments need to maneuver between national plans and regional commercial interests by creating protection for foreign innovation suppliers to sustain economic growth. That said, recent expansions of China’s counterespionage law allow state officials to inspect and seize “electronic equipment, facilities, and related programs and tools of relevant individuals and organizations” that threaten national security. Precautionary measures below can be taken to preempt any internal or external threats to IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obscure equipment configuration in assembly lines and manufacturing processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Many industries rely on equipment that is manufactured by a handful of companies, which makes knowledge on equipment settings transferable to competitors. For example, the semiconductor industry relies on ASML, Applied Materials, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron as key equipment suppliers. In particular, cutting-edge EUV lithography systems are only produced by ASML. Therefore, equipment configuration should be protected because it can become sensitive proprietary information that engineers may leave with and bring to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document and mark confidential materials, even in transit.&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitive information and equipment should be marked confidential, and access should be restricted to select personnel. A timestamped record of who accessed sensitive material should be kept, even during logistical transitions between factory locations or teams. The record of activity will be valuable in court and is a physical reminder to personnel that they are accountable for confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demarcate restricted areas.&lt;/strong&gt; Proprietary materials (e.g., ingredients, parts, and documents) should be stored in areas with restricted access. Unintentional trespassing can be intercepted with clear signage and access checkpoints. Checkpoints may request guests or employees to leave electronics with cameras (e.g., phones and laptops) outside, which is a standard practice at TSMC facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checklist approach based on Taiwanese experience is a starting point for U.S. firms engaging with China and other markets with weaker IP protection enforcement. Taiwanese experiences show that weaker IP regimes can be an opportunity to enhance innovation potential by capturing knowledge spillover. In addition, critical IP can be protected through nonlegal measures that do not depend on the fairness of foreign courts and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focused on personnel, local partners, suppliers, and factories as critical “pause points” that have higher risk of IP and value loss. The foundation of the checklist is built on Stan Shih’s “Smiling Curve,” which was further developed by Shin-Horng Chen at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. Through a condensed list, the checklist aims to orient attention toward high-impact measures that are actionable. However, the checklist is not a substitute for legal counsel, and it can be further customized to fit each company and market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In starting this checklist, this report aims to draw more attention to nonlegal and practical approaches to IP protection that U.S. companies can implement globally. U.S. innovators need to exchange experience with Taiwanese partners that have familiarity with the Chinese landscape and beyond. This requires the cohesive efforts of researchers, company executives, and policymakers due to the proprietary nature of IP protection strategies. The United States needs to work transparently with its partners to frame the sharing of nonlegal best practices as a coordinated effort to jointly safeguard and capture the global innovation potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has potential weapons it can use in its competition with hostile states — and in building up its strategic partnerships — that it now badly undervalues. The U.S. government has a unique capability to generate official analyses and databases on threat countries, on cooperation with strategic partners, on key aspects of national security policy, and on a host of other areas where accurate and in-depth reporting, analysis, and data can become “weapons of influence” in shaping the views and analysis of foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, news media, and other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emeritus Chair in Strategy has prepared a brief analysis of the current strengths and weaknesses of the ways the U.S. government is now organized to use its unclassified intelligence reporting, national security reporting, and official reporting to counter threats like those posed by Russia and China, and to strengthen its relations with its strategic partners and other countries. It can be downloaded from the CSIS website here and a downloadable copy is attached at the bottom of this transmittal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals that there are major problems in the present coverage and quality of official reporting and that major changes need to be made if such reporting is to be used efficiently in artificial intelligence and “big data” comparisons and analysis. It shows that the U.S. government only makes sporadic use of most of such information in influence operations. The main focus of official U.S. public affairs reporting is on issuing daily or short-term statements about meetings, and on “spinning” daily events and issues to get favorable coverage and favorable political messaging. It focuses on having an ephemeral impact, rather than on providing the kind of reporting in depth and accurate data that can have a far more lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can deny the need for topical U.S. government public relations and information efforts that deal with daily events and issues, but the United States needs to take far more advantage of its capability for substantive data collection and the analysis it already carries out at both classified and unclassified levels. It needs to provide the kind of databases and analyses in depth that can serve as key sources of information and help shape longer-term perceptions and national security policy, and it needs to aggressively communicate the information at the departmental, agency, command, and embassy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now faces a mix of hostile powers and threats that carry out information warfare at both a civil and military level and on a global basis. There is no region in the world where it does not confront China and/or Russia on this basis, as well as lesser regional threats and terrorist and extremist movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States also needs to look beyond its present reports and databases to consider how it can generate more useful “big data” that will help shape both global use of the web and future U.S. and foreign use of artificial intelligence. The United States not only needs to improve its current “weapons of influence but to realize that its present reporting a databases will often need radical revisions and improvements in a world where the ability to use data retrieval and management to improve almost every aspect of policy formation and implementation, cooperation with strategic partners and other nations, and counter hostile information warfare will change radically over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;giving-the-proper-priority-to-shaping-us-official-reports-and-data-as-weapons-of-influence&quot;&gt;Giving the Proper Priority to Shaping U.S. Official Reports and Data as “Weapons of Influence”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power official U.S. reports can have in battles of influence is illustrated by both the impact of several past reports and by the contents of a number of ongoing reports and databases. At the most direct level, these include reports on key threats to the United States and reports and data that can have a major impact on strategic partnerships and in countering hostile information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;official-reporting-on-major-threats&quot;&gt;Official Reporting on Major Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to past reports, the United States used to issue several official annual analyses and databases and analyses that gained broad global attention and served as weapons of influence. Key examples of such past reports include the U.S. annual reports on Soviet Military Power and World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, these two reports served as key global references that media, policy analysis, and strategic partners used to deal with the main foreign threat to the United States and provided reliable data on the military spending and arms transfer activities of every country in the world that no other source could provide with equal accuracy and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of current official reports on the threat and military balance that have this kind of impact include the Department of Defense’s annual report on Chinese Military Power and the U.S. official estimates of national holdings of nuclear weapons provided in the Department of State reporting on arms control. These reports are examples of documents that draw on declassified intelligence reports to provide data and analysis that communicated the official U.S. view in detail and served as references for which there is no outside equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is striking, however, that Chinese Military Power is now the only regular annual report the United States now publishes on key threats. The U.S. has failed to provide the kind of similar annual reporting on other key threat countries and the patterns in new threats from terrorists and extremists. It has only published one issue of a report on the military forces of countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea, countries where no outside official source or NGO can create the kind of reference that is needed to properly characterize their evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three reports on these threats are now hopelessly out of date. The only unclassified report the Defense Intelligence Agency has issued on Russian Military Power dates back to 2017. The only report on Iran — Iran Military Power — dates back to 2019, and the only report on North Korean Military Power dates back to 2021. In each case, issuing one edition with minimal publicity produced a document that was more a draft than a finished report, and that failed to create the anything like audience and trust created by annual reports like Chinese Military Power, and the end result is to issue reports that have no real value as weapons of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a broader level, anyone who works with foreign NGOs and national security research centers becomes aware of how few foreign analysts are aware of the written version of the annual threat global assessment by the U.S. Office of National Intelligence that is provided along with the Directors testimony and provides a brief summary of official U.S. perceptions of the threats to U.S. and global security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report to Congress is now little more than the shell of a meaningful analysis of the trends in the threats to the United States and largely ignores the threats they pose to our strategic partners, other states, and the global economy and stability. It also is only one example of existing reporting that could easily be expanded to provide data on the security challenges that threaten other democratic and stable governments and in net assessments by both foreign governments and outside analysts. At present, however, it is little more than an outline, and only its identification of how the U.S. ranks major threats receives serious outside attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also reflects the fact that the United States has done remarkably little to develop unclassified reports that use net assessments to show the need for U.S. military and economic action to deal with the rising threats created by such countries and the value of U.S. strategic partners and alliances. It segregates its analyses of most civil and military issues, and it has failed to update its analyses of key shifts in the nuclear balance to look beyond the near collapse of most arms control efforts to key shifts in the balance and the rise of China and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turning-other-executive-branch-reports-into-weapons-of-influence&quot;&gt;Turning Other Executive Branch Reports into “Weapons of Influence”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues aside, there are many other current U.S. government reports and databases that could be exploited more effectively to serve as “weapons of influence.” One example is the annual Department of States’s Country Reports on Human Rights. These reports not only cover human rights but also provide unique analyses of the levels of repression within the internal security structures of many states. They are one of the few sources of reliable data on the abuses some governments commit against their own populations and the rise of legitimate political challenges versus the threat of terrorist and extremist groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the CIA World Factbook. It provides a summary of key data on every nation in the world and one that ties together the different aspects of governance, economics, trade, demographics, and ethnic and religious data in ways where there is no outside equivalent. In some cases, it also is a source of national ranking and trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA World Factbook is already used by some foreign analysts and government, although they cannot reference a CIA document, and it could also be easily expanded to provide a computerized quantitative database on national rankings and trends — a capability that many analytic and media centers in developing countries lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a very different level of analysis, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has developed a quadrennial report on how the world is estimated to evolve over the coming two decades entitled Global Trends. It is not a threat analysis per se, but it has evolved substantially into a useful overview of how the United States sees the key trends shaping the future since the first edition was issued in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest edition was issued in 2021 and is entitled Global Trends: A More Contested World. It looks beyond “spin” and short-term politics and presents a broad declassified forecast of the key trends that will shape the world over the next 20 years. While this document — and its wide range of supporting analyses — have so far gotten surprisingly little global attention, it is the kind of official analysis that shows how the United States sees the world and that provides a clear view of the key issues the United States is focused upon. Its mix of summaries, a main report, and supporting documents provide both good policy level summaries and analysis in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the U.S. government issues a wide range of more detailed reports on U.S. foreign aid, arms sales, security assistance, global demographic trends, trade policy and sanctions, energy data, narcotics, and other activities that the United States does little to publicize on a global level. Even many U.S. academics and think tanks seem to be unaware of many of these reports and databases, and there is no serious U.S. effort to catalog and publicize them to foreign governments or the growing number of foreign think tanks, experts, and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are too many examples of such reports to cite in-depth, but examples of underexploited databases include the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database on demographics and population growth — a database that complements and supplements UN efforts and warns how serious population growth is becoming in the developing world. It also is an example of the fact that a U.S. government database can be developed in a form that allows the user to make detailed country-by-country comparison and trend analyses in graphic and tabular form. As an increasing number of outside web reports show, the ability to automate comparative and parametric analysis eliminates barriers to time and work effort and presents a far more accurate picture of what the data mean. It is a key feature of the ability to use large databases and in supporting the effective use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other key examples include the reporting and databases provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). This EIA reporting includes annual estimates of U.S. energy imports and exports, key strategic and country issues affecting energy supplies, the risks created by strategic chokepoints, and the international energy outlook. If anything, EIA’s international coverage, and risk assessment efforts has been steadily cut back at a time when ciliate change, the global energy trade, and China and Russia’s energy policies and income have become steadily more critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, when one talks about “big data” in practical terms, the executive branch of the U.S. government already provides detailed databases and reports on subjects that could have a major cumulative impact in shaping foreign and domestic perceptions of the United States and its policies. They include subjects like trade, comparative research and development efforts, foreign aid, security assistance activities, U.S. power projection capabilities, and the actual levels of U.S. military personnel deployed to given countries. They also include detailed reports on U.S. arms sales to Congress that describe major requests to Congress for its approval of foreign arms sales by item and country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-beyond-the-executive-branch-making-effective-use-of-reports-to-congress-written-testimony-and-the-congressional-research-service&quot;&gt;Looking Beyond the Executive Branch: Making Effective Use of Reports to Congress, Written Testimony, and the Congressional Research Service&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive branch is only part of the story. The U.S. government also develops a wide range of additional departmental, congressional staff, and congressional committee reports on U.S. foreign policy, arms sales, security assistance, global demographic trends, energy data, and other activities that the U.S. does little to publicize on a global level. Even many U.S. academics and think tanks seem to be unaware of many of these reports and databases, and there is no serious U.S. effort to catalog and publicize them to foreign governments or the growing number of foreign think tanks, experts, and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has become a good example of such reporting. While the report draws largely on open sources rather than official reporting, it provides a book-length analysis of the key annual trends affecting the United States, China, and other states, and a U.S. view of the challenges China presents to both the United States and the world. It, too, deserves a far higher profile as a U.S. weapon of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, only one example of a wide range of written official testimony to Congress that covers many areas of major interest to other countries, and spotlights various aspects of U.S. progress in creating strategic partnerships at both a civil and military level. Today, most such efforts get little serious attention outside of Congress, and written testimony disappears into the Congressional Record almost instantly, although the distribution of reporting on China has improved steadily in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reporting by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) is a broad example of the kind of Congressional reporting that could have far more value as a weapon of influence if it was better exploited. The CRS generates a wide range of detailed reports on U.S. policy that are deliberately neutral and balanced in character and that summarize U.S. policy issues and debates in neutral terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRS does have a good central search site, and several NGOs like the Federation of American Scientists do publicize some CRS reports in ways that have an international impact. However, the work of the CRS is not actively publicized by the U.S. government, although the CRS often issues some of the best and most neutral summaries of U.S. political positions as well as the key facts and trends in U.S. policy and actions affecting foreign states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tying-us-budget-requests-to-us-strategy-on-a-global-level&quot;&gt;Tying U.S. Budget Requests to U.S. Strategy on A Global Level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also are areas where the U.S. government needs to consider how to reform some of its most basic reporting and database activities to provide more effective structures and content – reforms that are critical to making “big data” and the use of artificial intelligence more effective, and better planning and management of federal programs and funds, as well as communicating on a global level and provide weapons of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transforming-a-failed-approach-to-national-security-budgeting&quot;&gt;Transforming a Failed Approach to National Security Budgeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key example where the U.S. could use official reporting to create better weapons of influence is the range of U.S. defense budget justification and spending data provided by the Comptroller of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. These reports and databases could be far more useful in building and reinforcing U.S. strategic partnerships and shaping non-governmental and foreign perceptions and analyses of U.S. defense plans and military analyses, as well as really effective U.S. efforts in national security planning, programming, and budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the annual budget justification documents provided since the collapse of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) have ceased to provide serious data on U.S. strategy, particularly by plan, program, and budget. The documents do provide a massive amount of spending data, but most such data are little more than the individual military shopping lists of the four U.S. military services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. budget request overviews and summaries in recent annual defense budget requests are embarrassingly lacking in content and depth compared to the posture statements provided in the 1960s and 1970s. They also do less to present a clear picture of strategy, key aspects of the balance, and force modernization by mission than the best current annual white papers of other countries. These budget documents not only lack strategic depth, but they also fail to tie U.S. defense budgets to strategy and plans to present major program categories that have strategic meaning and to explain spending and planned progress in jointness and by major command. If one looks back to Department of Defense reporting from the early 1960s to mid-1970s, current defense budget requests are sharply inferior to the strategic posture statements, program budget data, and summary net assessments issued by the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their shortfalls are also compounded by the Executive Branch testimony to Congress and supporting written budget and posture statements that fail to provide adequate data on joint strategy and to address the importance of strategic partners. As a result, some recent budget documents and testimony have recently given the impression that the United States has become so focused on China that it no longer has a critical interest in areas like the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the annual defense white papers of partner countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and several other strategic partners now demonstrate, public defense white papers not only explain national military capabilities and modernization efforts, but they also present summary net assessments to explain the threat. They also show how official reports can provide explanations of the role and importance of strategic partners and stress the value of cooperative defense efforts to both the United States and key partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balanced in-depth reporting on America’s global defense posture can also avoid the problems created by the current U.S. emphasis on the Pacific and Taiwan at a time the United States and its allies face a war in Ukraine. They can explain that the United States and its partners now face the beginning of a confrontation with Russia that is almost certain to last as long as any leader like Vladimir Putin in power. It also can make it clear that the United States focusing on key threats does not mean it is not giving suitable priority to key challenges in the Middle East, Korea, and from violent extremist movements, and is not cutting capabilities critical to its allies and partners in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;addressing-civil-military-strategy-plans-programs-and-budgets&quot;&gt;Addressing Civil-Military Strategy, Plans, Programs, and Budgets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally striking that there is no U.S. official report that acts as a reference to the total levels of U.S. civil and military/security assistance strategy, plans and programs, and aid by country and region. The U.S. National Strategy and National Security Strategy documents are little more than outlines of U.S. goals with no real details and only the broadest focus on specific regions, threats, partners, and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when the United States clearly faces major civil-military challenges from China and Russia and must compete at a political, economic, and technological level with China and Russia and other regional threats and actors on a country-by-country basis throughout the world, the United States divides its strategy, PPBS, and other reports into a virtual morass of separate reporting streams and databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there is no official report on total U.S. military and civil national security spending. U.S. strategy and budget reporting that covers all elements of military and paramilitary activity is compartmented into separate reports on the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, intelligence agencies, and Veterans Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the reports on the civil side of U.S. strategy, policy, plans, programs, and budgets generally ignore national security expenditures and are stove-piped by department and agency and then by administrative function. For all the failings of the Department of Defense’s annual strategy and budget documents, the State Department and USAID reporting on its activities and foreign aid is more than 200 pages long, but it reports aid by bureaucratic element of the State Department, rather than by region, country, and strategic objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main State Department budget justification document begins with a brief five-page statement by the Secretary that does have some elements of strategy but consists largely of bureaucratic goals. The summary fiscal tables that follow only address broad global functions by total spending request, and the budget request then spends some eight pages on an FY2022-2026 Joint Strategic Plan Framework without presenting anything approaching a strategic plan or communicating U.S. goals and spending in a form that approaches a planning, programming, and budgeting effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document then proceeds to provide some 200 pages of bureaucratic line-item budget data that does little to explain the strategy and purpose behind the spending by region or country and tie U.S. civil strategy and spending to the military efforts of the Department of Defense and other paramilitary and counterterrorism efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department does issue a supporting document that provides total spending by region with some strategic justification, but it does little to explain U.S. civil efforts overseas and describe their purpose and impact and provides almost no data by country. Other Department of State reporting normally scatters regional and country spending into so many bits and pieces that they are little more than an incoherent mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-military-strategy-and-programs-interact-with-civil-strategy-and-programs&quot;&gt;How Military Strategy and Programs Interact with Civil Strategy and Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These limits to U.S. official reporting on strategy and programs, plans, and budgets are matched by other problems where the United States needs to sharply improve its reporting and databases. The United States needs to stop separating reporting on civil and security activities and explain the combined civil-military impact of U.S. strategy and national security spending. Official reporting needs to fully recognize that civil-military “jointness” is as important as the “jointness” of the U.S. military services and members of the U.S. intelligence community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States confronts a China and a Russia that each combine their civil and military efforts in their respective challenges to the United States, as well as are increasing cooperation with each other. In recent years, this confrontation has reached the point where the United States is engaged in something close to economic warfare with both China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States cannot continue to separate its own civil and military efforts when it faces a Russia that the war in Ukraine has pressured into far more efforts to integrate civil and military strategy and faces a China that has taken the lead in many areas of economic competition — areas which are critical to America’s current battles of influence on a global level. U.S. reporting and information warfare activities must address the fact that U.S. military efforts must be tied to U.S. economic policies, and that link civil and economic strategy to U.S. military strategy, as well as U.S. security assistance aid efforts, and other civil security programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reporting-on-arms-control-and-nuclear-modernization&quot;&gt;Reporting on Arms Control and Nuclear Modernization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a different level, the United States needs better unclassified reporting on the dangers involved in the near collapse of nuclear and other arms control efforts. It needs to clearly explain current developments and U.S. policies in detail, as well as the growing threat posed by the nuclear modernization efforts of Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to flag the threat posed by the potential deployment of active theater nuclear and dual-capable conventional and nuclear delivery systems. Once again, arms control is a critical aspect of both America’s civil and military battles of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official U.S. reporting needs to do a far better job of dealing with the fact that the United States cannot focus on the threat from China but must focus on major Russian threats the Europe and a wide range of regional threats, crises, and enduring problems on a global level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge Russia presents to the U.S. and NATO is a key case in point. At present, there is no public reporting on the limits each country faces in modernizing and standardizing its forces and the tangible progress it is making in dealing with these problems. The closest NATO comes is a meaningless report on whether countries spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense — a goal that only seven of 31 countries meet and where most nations that do meet that goal now have force plans and spending levels that fail to deal with their most serious military problems unless they make major changes in their forces plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of any meaningful set of public goals and progress in meeting them is compounded by a NATO goal of spending 20 percent of national defense budgets on procurement. This goal is even more meaningless than the 2 percent goal because it again says nothing about the value of such spending in military terms and ignores the fact that member countries have very different national definitions of procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible answer would be to issue an annual unclassified report on NATO that focuses on nation-by-nation progress in creating an effective level of extended deterrence by explaining how important tangible force improvements are now. Such a report could do what NATO cannot do since an international organization must consider the political sensitivity of each member country. NATO countries need to focus on tangible force improvement goals and ones that clearly show the value of standardization and common approaches to modernization and given aspects of extended deterrence — particularly at a time when so many changes are occurring in tactics, technology, and areas like integrated operations and new battle management and common and control systems. The United States is the only country that can provide an unclassified overview of such efforts, which can be encouraged rather than being critical, and help develop a public debate over NATO force improvements that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States needs to pay more attention to the instability and crisis in Latin America, Africa, the rest of Asia, and the Pacific. One of the few areas where almost all sources agree is that extremism, terrorism, and political instability pose global challenges. The same is true of population growth and migration, water issues, climate change, and failures in development, as well as the uncertainties shaping the current global economic system. The United States cannot focus on one threat at a time, or one major power or contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizing-to-make-us-official-reporting-more-effective&quot;&gt;Organizing to Make U.S. Official Reporting More Effective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking toward the future, there are a number of steps the United States could take to make its official reporting efforts more accessible to both U.S. and foreign users and allow them to make more effective use of their content. As noted earlier, such reforms will be vital in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-a-central-reference-center-catalog-or-library&quot;&gt;Creating a Central Reference Center, Catalog, or “Library”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key step forward would be to create computerized catalogs and download capabilities for all such reports and spotlight them by department, agency, major U.S. command, and U.S. embassy website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important as dealing with day-to-day issues may be in public affairs terms, creating a central point of reference for all relevant official reports and databases that foreign governments and outside experts could use to quickly find official U.S. reporting on key issues and data could play a major in shaping both foreign and U.S. analyses and viewpoints over time. It could serve as a potential counter to the ephemeral nature of most of the ephemeral analyses and half-truths on the web and the growing extent to which the web emphasizes controversy, political spin, partisan views, and opinion over facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort involved in creating such a resource to highlight such “weapons of influence” would also be simplified if a standard format for describing reports and databases could be developed for every department, agency, and key congressional staff. This would allow them to update their portion of a central catalog and maintain a detailed departmental or agency library that served as a historical record and reference central for the department of agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the same would be true of evolving a mix of user-friendly ways to develop tables, graphs, and maps out of the data provided. Some databases already have a few features of this kind, although most were clearly developed by internal experts and IT staff who have little experience in using the data parametrically and in analyses that are not part of their immediate operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of clear sources and uncertain information, poor ergonomics and descriptions of how to instruct the database, and the rigidities in making a wide range of even internal comparisons of trends compound the tendency to keep generating the same data in the same way despite changing user needs. Far too many reports and analyses reflect their evolution and history rather than focusing on current and future needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing “big data” requires more than web searches and AI routines that can find the data now on the web. It requires properly structured input data that is reliable, inclusive, and do not include a vast number of extraneous listings. It also requires the ability to assemble data from multiple databases quickly and in new and innovative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. embassies and major commands can also become far more effective tools in communicating such “weapons of influence” and altering other governments, academics, research centers, analysts, and media to the existence and value of U.S. government reports and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would benefit from taking a focused approach to circulating U.S. official reports and data that made the web pages of U.S. embassies and the U.S. major commands reference points for finding key data on U.S. efforts to build strategic partnerships, trade and aid data, and military and civil regional security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. government is simply too large and too complex for many foreign governments, researchers, analysts, and media to search its reporting and databases, and the U.S. efforts to communicate at a local and regional level have never fully integrated the efforts of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with those of the Department of State, and from abolishing the United States Information Agency in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The websites of most U.S. embassies and commands are not currently shaped to act as unclassified reference centers for U.S. official data that could have a major impact on a given country, region, or command function. Creating individual embassy and command websites that flagged key U.S. reports and statements that provide key reference data would not be a major effort, and it would be easy to tailor to meet local and regional interests in ways that would not commit an embassy or command to additional work efforts or taking controversial positions. It would also help to counter disinformation efforts with official U.S. data and information and stress strategic partnerships as well as key interests in aid, human rights, trade, and regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-us-embassy-websites-more-effective-weapons-of-influence&quot;&gt;Making U.S. Embassy Websites More Effective Weapons of Influence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each embassy could tailor its library to local needs and interests and focus on key U.S. policy initiatives in ways that would give foreign researchers access to official U.S. reports and data — cataloging official Department of State and other reports without committing the embassy to a given position. U.S. delegations to international organizations could take the same approach. This could not replace the need for ongoing information and public affairs efforts on a topical level, but it would help to give them continuity, credibility, and depth. It also would clearly distinguish what is really an official U.S. view from disinformation and views that are not official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an effort would allow the embassy to tie together all the key information and reporting on a country, including U.S. foreign civil and military aid, and key common activities and efforts. It could often allow the presentation of U.S. efforts to create strategic partnerships and encourage development and reform without having the embassy take a proactive position in controversial cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-major-command-websites-weapons-of-influence&quot;&gt;Making Major Command Websites Weapons of Influence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for making U.S. major command websites into weapons of influence is equally strong. The United States has 11 combatant commands that cover the entire world as well as specialized functions that are of wide global interest. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Africa Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Central Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyber Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;European Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indo-Pacific Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Northern Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Southern Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Space Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Special Operations Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategic Command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transportation Command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each command already must prepare annual testimony that few foreign readers — including many who focus on national security issues — are fully aware of. This includes annual testimony by major U.S. military commanders that usually explain that the United States is committed to competing with such threats on a global level and define the level of ongoing force changes in depth — material that could have a major impact on foreign studies and reporting if it was given suitable publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with embassies, creating command web sites that contained the full range of serious official U.S. reports and key databases would allow each command to fully publicize the unclassified aspects of strategic partnerships and present reports and studies that supported both U.S. security policy and the command’s efforts without committing it to taking a formal command position. Several commands, like the U.S. Central Command, Cyber Command, European Command, and Southern Command, have already taken major steps in this direction, although many still focus their web pages on topical events, public relations glitz, or internal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding such efforts would allow the command to fully explain its efforts to create strategic partnerships, explain joint exercises and training, stress U.S. power projection capabilities as well as foreign deployed forces, provide background on common threats, and show the United States was providing civil aid and support as well as military support. It could directly counter misinformation and deal with concerns like those of the Gulf states that limited U.S. cuts in foreign presence are driving factors despite the improvements taking place in U.S. power projection capabilities and force modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each command could work with both the Department of Defense and elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency, as well as State and local embassies, and could also help create the kind of focused analysis that could again counter disinformation and present declassified views in depth at a level are local users could access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compensating-for-the-limits-to-ngo-and-international-reporting&quot;&gt;Compensating for the Limits to NGO and International Reporting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States needs to make a more organized effort to deal with the limits of NGOs and other outside analyses and databases. There are many unofficial NGO and academic reports that try to provide data and analyses in areas that are critical to explaining U.S. policies and actions, explaining the role of strategic partners, and identifying key policy challenges. Many do act as weapons of influence in their own right, but such reports are limited by their lack of access to classified data and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good as the work of NGOs like the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), they cannot bring the same depth of information or present an authoritative U.S. view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting by international bodies like the UN and World Bank has its own problems. Much of their reporting is useful, but it relies on country inputs, many of which reflect national policy goals rather than accurate data. For example, UN data do not provide an accurate picture of the real levels of military spending by nations like Russia and China, or of the actual cost and destination of global arms transfers — data the U.S. government issued for decades until its annual updates to the WMEAT database were cancelled last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to ensure that international reports and data have valid inputs and are standardized to the point of being truly comparable have failed in many areas, particularly in the case of reporting by authoritarian and fragile/failed governments. The gaps in country reporting at least have a kind of honesty. Reporting politicized data and data that lack adequate collection efforts do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has triggered the worst security crisis facing Europe since the end of the Cold War. It brought a major conventional war of aggression to the European continent and enormous human suffering, but in doing so it has also unified and reenergized the NATO alliance and accelerated efforts to reconstitute transatlantic defense and deterrence. Assessing Russia’s performance in the war thus far, and how the Russian military is evolving as a result, is an important part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia demonstrated considerable military weaknesses after its full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and it faces equipment, ammunition, and manpower shortages. Moscow’s efforts to boost industrial production and circumvent Western sanctions and export controls have not brought as much success as intended. Building on two prior CSIS studies, Out of Stock? Assessing the Impact of Sanctions on Russia’s Defense Industry, and A War of Attrition: Assessing the Impact of Equipment Shortages on Russian Military Operations in Ukraine, this report first examines Russia’s residual military threat to NATO. It finds this threat is reduced in the near term, but that NATO must still grapple with Russia’s nuclear arsenal, the advanced systems it has not fully utilized, internal instability, and operations below the threshold of armed conflict. Moreover, Russia remains a learning adversary and its strategic objectives have not changed. Russia will adapt during the attritional war and the reconstitution period that will follow. Additionally, it has international partners — of greatest concern is the role of China — that may help it stagger through the war and recover its strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this report examines the opportunities and challenges facing the United States and its NATO allies and partners in Europe as they adapt their defense strategies, planning, and forces in response to the changing Russian military threat over the short term and the new security landscape in Europe. To date, U.S. and allied strategies have focused on supporting Ukraine as much as possible, preserving strength and unity in NATO while managing escalation risks, and leveraging economic tools to constrain Russia’s aggression and alter its political calculus. Russia’s near-term weakness offers the United States and NATO a window of opportunity to right the imbalances in their own defense strategies, capabilities, and capacity while continuing to support Ukraine. This window of opportunity will last so long as Russia is tied down in a war of attrition, managing internal instability, and struggling to ramp up domestic production and circumvent sanctions, and so long as China hesitates to pay the diplomatic and economic costs of fully or openly supporting Russia’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, this report argues that both the United States and its NATO allies ought to expand their understanding of Russia’s domestic political environment and international partnerships, especially Russia-China relations. Additionally, the United States should focus on forward-stationed enablers in Europe, augmenting European efforts to counter Russia, especially with stronger counter-uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), anti-armor, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, and cheaper, more ubiquitous air and missile defense capabilities. NATO, meanwhile, must grapple with Russia’s enduring nuclear capabilities and political instability, prepare for intensified Russian hybrid operations, strengthen undersea infrastructure defense capabilities, and invest in increased capacity that can be realized while Moscow reconstitutes. Finally, the entire transatlantic community should take steps now to strengthen Ukraine over the long run as a bulwark of Euro-Atlantic defense and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, Russia’s poor conventional performance during the first year of the war provides the United States and its NATO allies and partners with a window of opportunity to right the imbalances and shortcomings in their military capabilities and capacity. Clearly, the Russian military retains some strengths, which the alliance must continue to grapple with, but it has also demonstrated significant weaknesses. So long as Russia is bogged down in a war of attrition and focused on defending its front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, the West ought to strengthen its advantages and target Russia’s demonstrated weaknesses. Seizing the moment through agility and adaptation is key to securing the Euro-Atlantic region today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, now in its second year, has triggered the worst security crisis facing Europe since the end of the Cold War. It has also reenergized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), brought political unity to transatlantic relations, and accelerated efforts to reconstitute transatlantic defense and deterrence. The United States and its European allies and partners have supported Ukraine’s resistance by investing historic sums into humanitarian, financial, and military aid for Ukraine. Their strategies have focused on arming and training Ukrainian military forces, preserving strength and unity in NATO while managing escalation risks, and leveraging economic tools to shape the Kremlin’s calculus and constrain its aggression. These economic tools included unprecedented sanctions on Russian entities, export controls, efforts to cut dependence on Russian energy, and the imposition of a price cap on Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the war, U.S. officials presented these economic tools as a means of constraining Russia’s aggression and hastening its decline. This report is part of a series of CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program studies on this topic. The first report finds that Western sanctions have had some important impacts on Russia’s production of key weapons, especially those that require foreign-made technologies. It argues, however, that Russia has proven more resilient and adaptable than expected in the West. Moscow is modernizing older equipment, relying on prewar stockpiles, and circumventing sanctions through trade diversions and illegal activities. As a result, Western-origin products still find their way into Russian weapons, even as Moscow leans on lower-quality alternatives. The second report focuses on Russia’s efforts to mobilize defense production and argues that the Kremlin can replenish its forces at levels sufficient to continue the war. However, its manpower and equipment losses will limit Russia’s ability to engage in high-intensity, conventional operations in Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Caucasus, at least for the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the previous reports offer recommendations on how the United States and the European Union might strengthen sanctions, improve sanctions implementation, and curb illegal activities, this report focuses on Russia’s changing military threat to NATO as a result of losses in the war and its efforts to circumvent sanctions, and it asks how the United States and NATO might adapt their military approach toward Russia as a result. First, this study explores the implications of Russia’s performance in Ukraine and its sanctions evasion on Russia’s threat to the Euro-Atlantic region (over the next two to four years). Russia can still field tanks, missiles, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities effectively in Ukraine, though it struggles with cross-domain operations. Russia also holds some advanced systems in reserve, retains its nuclear stockpile, and is likely to lean on hybrid challenges to NATO while it reconstitutes its conventional military forces and attempts to restore its nuclear coercive reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Moscow has received some military support from partners, including Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and tacit political support from numerous nonaligned countries across the so-called Global South. Of greatest concern is the potential role the People’s Republic of China (PRC) could yet play in the conflict if it decides to supply Russia’s arms. Given the outlook for Russia’s military potential over the short term, this study explores whether, how, and to what extent the United States and its NATO allies in Europe ought to adjust key aspects of their strategies, operational planning, defense planning, force structure, and force posture in response. Two sections — the first on the U.S. approach to Russia, and the second on NATO’s approach — focus on how best to respond to the changing Russian military threat over the near term to bolster defense and deterrence for NATO while continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s military advantages on the battlefield. Each section includes practical policy recommendations for decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-short-term-military-potential&quot;&gt;Russia’s Short-Term Military Potential&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mutiny of Wagner forces against the Russian government potentially carries serious implications for the Russian military, its war effort in Ukraine, and the threat it poses to the West. In the short run, the fact that Wagner has essentially left the battlefield could lessen the disunity of command that has plagued Russian forces since the earliest weeks of the war. In theory, this development could strengthen the hand of the Kremlin as it directs the war effort. However, the withdrawal of most Wagner forces from the front — at this point, it remains unclear how many will take up the Kremlin’s offer of Defence Ministry contracts — means that Moscow could have 25,000 fewer experienced and capable fighters available for its war effort and who could theoretically be utilized against the West. This would aggravate the already challenging manpower situation that confronts the Russian military. Hence, drawing definitive conclusions regarding the mutiny’s short-term operational impact is still difficult at this early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, six other factors stand out as relevant for evaluating changes to Russia’s near-term military threat to NATO. First, sanctions have restricted the flow of some sensitive dual-use technologies into Russia, including technologies with U.S.-origin products, and they raised Russia’s costs for acquiring them. During the latter half of 2022 and throughout 2023, Russia struggled to find spare parts for tanks and satellites, and its defense industry proved unable to produce the arms necessary to meet basic needs on the battlefield. In particular, the restrictions constrained Russia’s access to high-quality optical systems, ball bearings, machine tools, engines, and microchips. Russia has been unsuccessful in pivoting to large-scale domestic production for these items, and that has imposed some limitations on its ability to field higher-end military capabilities in the war. For example, Russia’s ability to produce advanced Kinzhal hypersonic missiles has fallen from roughly 30 per month to about 10 per month. Therefore, because of sanctions, Russia’s doctrinal emphasis on indirect fires should continue, even as the quantity, quality, and accuracy of those fires diminishes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Kremlin’s attempts to circumvent sanctions and export controls;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s decision to keep some ground and air systems in reserve;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s limited ability to synchronize cross-domain operations;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;additional Russian capabilities generally underutilized in what is mostly a land war; and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the role of third-party suppliers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, despite the sanctions’ ability to achieve some success in limiting Russia’s industrial capacity, the Kremlin has “created new ways to circumvent export-control restrictions and secure much-needed foreign components to sustain and produce its weapons systems and wage war on Ukraine.” This has occurred through the “Eurasian roundabout” — patterns of trade diversion through the Caucasus and Central Asia. In particular, Russia has succeeded in routing sanctioned items and dual-use trade through the Balkans, Turkey, Iran, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and China. This has resulted in a continued supply of rudimentary drones, microchip components, aircraft engine parts, jamming technology, and navigation equipment, among others. Clearly, Moscow’s new sanctions-evading supply chain will not permit Russia to acquire or produce equipment at prewar levels of quality or quantity. Nonetheless, the limited but steady flow of sanctioned items indicates that Moscow could continue an attritional approach to the war. Russia assumes time is on its side vis-à-vis Ukraine’s manpower and the West’s ability and will to continue supplying Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the Kremlin has kept some of Russia’s ground and air systems in reserve, despite the ostensible utility such systems might have in its war against Ukraine. Russia is fielding older models of its tanks after taking heavy losses of T-72B3 MBTs, including some that predate Russia’s 2011-initiated modernization program. Meanwhile, its advanced tanks, including the T-14 Armata and the T-90M Proryv, have seen only limited use in the war. Similarly, Russia’s advanced Su-57 Felon aircraft — a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter — made only limited appearances in the war, and typically from outside Ukraine’s borders. There may not be enough of these systems for Moscow to make effective use of them in the war. However, there are other plausible reasons Moscow might limit the use of these systems in Ukraine: to reserve them for defense and deterrence against the perceived threat from NATO, to limit their exposure to Western intelligence gathering, or to prevent embarrassment — and lost foreign military sales revenue — if these systems fail to perform on the battlefield as advertised. Regardless, the United States and its NATO allies must prepare for their potential use in the Ukraine war or if Russia escalates horizontally elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Russia’s ability to synchronize cross-domain operations has proven low, and it is likely to remain very limited over the near term. Cross- or joint multi-domain operations entail the use of capabilities across all the warfighting domains — ground, air, sea, cyber, and space — to create and exploit relative advantages to defeat enemy forces or achieve other objectives. Russia’s military refers to this as “multi-sphere” warfare and treats it as more of a strategic concept than an operational one. Early in the war, Russian forces failed to effectively coordinate between land power, air power, and long-range fires, explaining at least in part Moscow’s inability to leverage military advances and retain seized territory. More recently, Russia’s inability to synchronize operations does not appear to have improved, reflecting the persistence of cross-domain shortcomings, long-standing organizational and leadership challenges, and the high casualty rate among Russia’s better-trained military personnel. Despite the removal of the Wagner organization from the battlefield, these weaknesses cannot likely be overcome in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, Russia has capabilities that appear to be of limited utility in the land war against Ukraine, but which remain potent and must be taken into consideration by the United States and NATO. This is especially the case for Russia’s undersea capabilities, cyber capabilities, anti-satellite capabilities, and its nuclear arsenal. Russia still holds significant undersea capabilities with which it can challenge NATO, including its Kilo-class attack submarines and its Borey-class ballistic missile submarines. Collectively, these subs can perform a wide array of military activities of concern for the alliance, including conventional cruise missile launches, undersea infrastructure attacks, nuclear deterrence, espionage, minelaying, or other attacks against adversary surface fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cyber domain, Western analysts disagree over whether Russia has fully exploited its cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine. Russia launched the ViaSat attack — aimed at impacting Ukraine’s communications systems — an hour prior to its full-scale invasion, and it launched other early attacks, but they were effectively countered. However, it can also be argued that Russia’s cyber capabilities can be diverse and creative. For instance, Russia’s APT28, a cyber spy group active since 2007 and also known as Fancy Bear, successfully targeted foreign government and military organizations, most notably the 2016 Democratic National Committee. Another hacker group known as APT29 or Cozy Bear, part of Russia’s foreign intelligence, previously breached the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce along with other government agencies. Western knowledge of Russia’s cyber capabilities tends to be more speculative than it is for other weapons systems. Some argue these groups are reinforced by a cadre of civilian engineers in service of the Kremlin, yet there are reasons to believe Moscow’s cyber capabilities are weaker than previously assumed because of organizational infighting, the number of those fleeing Russia, and other challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, the Russian military has also developed and tested anti-satellite weapons, including direct-ascent and on-orbit weapons. Experts argue that Russia seeks to exploit perceived U.S. reliance on a variety of satellites for navigation, targeting, and intelligence gathering. Developing and fielding anti-satellite capabilities is viewed within the Russian military as a key element in preventing an incapacitating first strike by U.S. hypersonic, cruise, and ballistic missiles, all of which are aided by satellite-enabled data. Although Moscow has certainly used its EW capabilities to jam satellite communications and has threatened to attack “quasi-civilian” satellites that it deems are aiding Kyiv’s efforts, Russia has yet to leverage its anti-satellite capabilities in the war. Regardless, they remain a significant threat to U.S. and allied systems that depend on satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the nuclear realm, Russia remains a superpower. As of early 2023, Russia is estimated to maintain a stockpile of approximately 4,489 nuclear warheads assigned for use by its long-range strategic launchers and shorter-range non-strategic nuclear forces. It is likely that Russia remained under the New START warhead limit through 2022, though Moscow’s suspension of the treaty will complicate any U.S. assessments of its warhead declarations in the future. Given the poor performance of Russia’s ground forces and long-range conventional capability in Ukraine, Russia is likely to enhance its reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence and defense going forward. Concretely, this will most likely manifest in Russia’s continued modernization of its nuclear forces, versatile efforts to restore the credibility of its nuclear coercive reputation, and adjustments to its deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the nuclear realm, Russia remains a superpower.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s process of nuclear modernization is set to continue in both the strategic and non-strategic domains, with a focus on enhanced defense penetration capabilities. For example, Russia is set to produce a new version of its RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a harder-to-intercept warhead configuration. Modernization efforts also extend to the missile defense domain, with new systems under development intended to supplement and in some cases replace older systems. It is possible that Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling — intended not only to deter NATO’s direct entry into the Ukraine war but also to slow or prevent Western military support for Ukraine — has worn itself out. If so, Russia may go beyond nuclear rhetoric to restore its coercive reputation. It could conceivably conduct a nuclear test. Its military may also be contemplating intermediate rungs on the escalation ladder, such as new ways to manipulate alert levels, or “strategic gestures” including demonstrative activities involving its nuclear forces. Some Russian intellectuals have moved to call more openly for reviving the fear of nuclear war in the West and for moving up the escalation ladder. While these voices do not officially represent the government, the Kremlin may be engaging in strategic messaging through the Moscow-based expert community. Moreover, Moscow is highly unlikely to resume full implementation of New START, and it may be less likely to agree to negotiated limits on its overall nuclear arsenal. Should Russia decide to exceed New START limits, before or after 2026, its capacity to increase deployed warheads without adding a single additional delivery system is estimated to be considerable, even though some posit Russia is economically ill-positioned to sustain a nuclear arms race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of doctrine, Russian military analysts have written a flurry of reflections over the past year on deterrence and escalation in an era of U.S. “prompt global strike,” betraying a continued concern with the U.S. ability to attack strategic or nuclear targets in Russia without resorting to nuclear use. It remains conceivable that Russia will consider limited nuclear use if faced with what it deems to be threats to regime survival. It maintains a formidable and diverse set of theater-range nuclear weapons, and understandings of what it considers existential threats to the Russian Federation per its nuclear doctrine may well expand as its leaders’ sense of conventional weakness and vulnerability increases. Russia’s pursuit of a wide range of nuclear weapons suited for both deterrence and regional war fighting reinforces this threat, as does its purported/announced deployment of short-range nuclear weapons to Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in addition to these Russia-centric factors that help elucidate Moscow’s changing military potential over the near term, the role of third-party suppliers is very significant. With loitering munitions from Iran, artillery shells from North Korea, and arms and ammunition from South Africa, Moscow is leveraging relationships with other regimes to address what even Putin acknowledges as shortcomings in capacity. These suppliers could play a role in helping Russia endure Ukraine’s counteroffensives and solidify its battlefield gains. Of potentially greater significance, though, is the role that the PRC might play. It is possible the PRC will continue to eschew becoming (or being seen to become) an explicit source of arms and militarily relevant technology for Russia to avoid the resulting costs to its economy. The PRC may, however, continue to facilitate or quietly acquiesce to trade diversions and the illegal activities Russia is exploiting, including trade through Hong Kong. Judging by official statements, as well as by Beijing’s apparent desire to position itself as a peacemaker, this may remain the extent of its involvement. On the other hand, if Beijing fails to maintain its balancing act — supporting Russia while trying to avoid Western sanctions — the PRC could become a more explicit facilitator of Russia’s war effort. Its rise as an “arsenal of authoritarianism” would have profound effects on the West’s efforts to deter Russia in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these six factors and Russia’s near-term threat to the Euro-Atlantic region in mind, the rest of this report will examine the military implications for the United States and its NATO allies. Specifically, it will address whether, how, and to what extent the transatlantic community should adjust key aspects of its strategies, operational plans, defense plans, force structure, and force posture over the near term to strengthen defense and deterrence vis-à-vis Russia while continuing to support Ukraine and strengthen other vulnerable partners. To accomplish this, the report will first examine how the United States might adapt its approach to Russia’s military threat to Europe, given Washington’s focus on its pacing challenge in the Indo-Pacific theater. Second, it will examine how NATO as a whole might alter its strategy, planning, and posture to reflect the changing Russian threat over the next two to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reassessing-the-us-national-approach-to-russia&quot;&gt;Reassessing the U.S. National Approach to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. approach to Russia is driven by the Biden administration’s 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which was released to the public in October of last year and woven together with two other important defense strategy documents — the Missile Defense Review and the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) — to achieve a coherent approach across the Department of Defense. Though the complete versions of all three documents remain classified, the 80-page unclassified compilation paints a clear picture of the administration’s strategic approach toward Russia. The following section analyzes its strengths and weaknesses over the near term, given preliminary lessons learned during the war in Ukraine and the failure of Western sanctions and export controls to radically reshape the Kremlin’s political calculus or thwart Russia’s aggression. It asks whether the U.S. approach is fit for purpose as Washington seeks to parry Russia’s efforts to threaten U.S. vital interests in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 NDS characterizes Russia as an “acute threat,” and it commits the United States to providing leadership, enabling capabilities, and deepening interoperability with its NATO allies and partners to deter Russia’s aggression against U.S. interests and treaty allies and to strengthen vulnerable partners. Russia’s acute threat is not on the same level of what the same strategy identifies as the “pacing challenge” posed to U.S. interests by the PRC. This prioritization in the 2022 NDS has reignited robust debate in Washington about the relationship between the PRC and Russia, important linkages between the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, and the trade-offs that may be required to deter both adversaries sequentially or simultaneously across these theaters. The prioritization makes sense given several factors: Russia’s demonstrated military weaknesses; evidence of fissures within its political and military elites (as borne out by the Wagner mutiny); the size of the PRC’s economy and population; the growing capacity and capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army; and the NDS’s assessments of Beijing’s “coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war shows that the European and Indo-Pacific theaters are in fact more closely connected than described in the NDS. This is not only because of uncertainty about the PRC’s intentions and its potential role as an arms supplier for Russia; it is also about the potential, persistent synergies Moscow and Beijing might realize from increased cooperation, and even coordination, in exploiting U.S. and allied vulnerabilities and in weakening Washington’s ability to safeguard its vital interests in both theaters. Somewhat ironically, Taiwan recently urged Washington to stay the course in Ukraine, in part because its leaders recognize the interconnectedness of the threats in the two theaters. And yet, the unclassified version of the NDS devotes a single line to the PRC-Russia relationship, noting that while its depth may remain limited due to mistrust, its breadth appears to be growing. Even if the depth of the relationship remains constrained, the negative implications for Beijing if Russia experiences a strategic defeat in Ukraine are difficult to overstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nuclear realm, the 2022 NPR reflects a thorough understanding of Russia’s threat. Appropriately, it retains a high bar for U.S. nuclear employment, and it affirms the U.S. nuclear modernization effort (while canceling unnecessarily redundant components, like nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles). It also commits the United States to strengthened, regionally tailored extended deterrence and allied assurance, while preserving nuclear arms control and risk reduction strategies to reduce the dangers of miscalculation. Since Russia’s suspension of its participation in New START in February 2023, the Biden administration has left the door open for Russia’s return to the treaty and publicly countered Russian disinformation about the causes of suspension. The United States has also committed to abiding by the central limits of New START for as long as Russia does so and has professed a willingness to engage Russia without preconditions on a post-2026 arms control framework. That willingness may well go unanswered: Russia is unlikely to return to compartmentalizing nuclear arms control for as long as it is waging war against Ukraine. Still, the United States should continue to present itself as a responsible nuclear actor in order to rally international opinion against Russia’s rogue behavior. In response to Russia’s announced nuclear deployment in Belarus and insinuations about nuclear testing, Washington should try to anticipate further steps Russia might take to raise the credibility of its nuclear coercion and continuously share its assessments with allies and partners to enhance assurance. Finally, it is worth continuously reassessing whether the modernization of the U.S. nuclear triad sufficiently addresses not just Russia’s modernization in strategic offensive arms but also its versatile arsenal of theatre-range nuclear systems and prospective Russian missile defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the strategic level, Russia’s changing military threat to Europe over the near term holds implications for how the United States operationalizes the NDS in Europe, especially in terms of refining U.S. force structure, posture, and security cooperation with allies and partners. After Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine, Washington responded to the crisis by surging 20,000 service members to Europe, bringing the total to more than 100,000 U.S. troops on the continent. It also sent additional warships to Spain, deployed jet squadrons to the United Kingdom, moved additional troops to Romania, shifted air defense units to Germany and Italy, and sent a range of assets to the Baltic states. These decisions reflected a sense of crisis early in the conflict, as well as some uncertainty about Putin’s unpredictable decisionmaking in the wake of his full-scale invasion. Now that the war has entered its second year and Russia’s military potential has evolved as a result, the United States might consider refining its forward-stationed and rotationally deployed capabilities as well as their specific locations. Broadly, Washington should focus on augmenting capabilities or capacities that counter residual Russian conventional strengths, but which are in short supply among European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Washington should focus on augmenting capabilities or capacities that counter residual Russian conventional strengths, but which are in short supply among European allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes prioritizing the recapitalization of allied militaries and working to strengthen counter-UAV, anti-armor, and EW capabilities for the alliance and, also, for Ukraine. EW remains an integral and growing part of Russia’s demonstrated way of war. Despite some operational limitations, Russia has effectively used EW to down Ukrainian UAVs in high numbers, intercept and decrypt Ukrainian communications, and create fake UAV targets to consume Ukrainian supplies. Significantly bolstered counter-EW capabilities in Europe are necessary given Russia’s heavy reliance on jamming networks and systems, both military and commercial. Meanwhile, effective U.S. and allied offensive EW could dramatically worsen Russia’s already poor cross-domain command and control, inhibiting its ability to coordinate, especially between air and ground assets. This could be achieved through more rapid fielding of the U.S. Army’s most advanced EW tactical platforms — like the Terrestrial Layer System-Brigade Combat Team — as well as by making those platforms available to key European allies, including in northeastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington should also look to bolster its air and missile defense capabilities in Europe. While residual Russian long-range fires may lack precision and ubiquity given the challenges posed to Moscow by sanctions and export controls, Russia maintains some capacity for missile launches — including hypersonic missiles — and loitering uncrewed airborne munitions. The key will be to field relatively cheap air and missile defense capabilities in Europe — such as directed energy weapons — versus more high-demand, low-density assets like Patriot units. European programs such as the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative are focused on filling some of these gaps with off-the-shelf solutions from outside the European Union. Ubiquitous, effective, and relatively cheap air and missile defense capabilities could help keep the long-range threat at bay, frustrate Russian intentions, and support allied efforts to acquire interoperable systems in a critical capability area. Such short-term planning must be balanced, however, by efforts at the European level to foster more EU cooperative development of such systems and strengthen and consolidate the European industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of U.S. force posture, frontline allies — especially the Baltic states, Romania, and Poland — are eager to retain continuous U.S. military presence on their territory. For some capabilities, this makes sense operationally. For instance, establishing a forward-stationed U.S. corps headquarters is necessary for command and control of Europe-based U.S. assets and deployed Europe-bound assets, as well as for allied leadership. Similarly, returning at least one armored brigade to Europe permanently would likely prove less costly than rotating a similar unit from the continental United States, necessary in any case for countering Russian armor. Additional capabilities that might be forward-stationed include enablers such as air and missile defense units, long-range fires resident in multi-domain task forces, corps-level ISR and logistics capabilities, and combat aviation units — all capabilities that Europeans lack, or at least lack enough of. From a fiscal perspective, the expenses associated with transoceanic movement of these equipment-intensive units as well as the necessity of specialized regional knowledge and relationships make forward stationing a preferable alternative to rotational stationing. Moreover, given the willingness of Poland, the Baltic states, and Romania to host U.S. forces, cost-sharing arrangements make one-time infrastructure expenses relatively low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States should accelerate plans to strengthen Ukraine’s military and turn it into a bulwark of qualitative advantage relative to Russia over the longer term. Given Russia’s challenges on the battlefield in 2022 and its lackluster offensive in early 2023, it is appealing to think that Ukraine might achieve a strategic victory, bringing about a quick end to the conflict. However, there is still the potential for a protracted stalemate across eastern and southeast Ukraine with sporadic violence. In this regard, the recently announced commitment to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16s is a step in the right direction. Beyond this and over the medium term, Washington should consider transferring to Ukraine more border monitoring capabilities that could strengthen defenses against and canalize overt or covert invasion forces; static and mobile ground- and air-domain awareness capabilities to strengthen border control; and offensive cyber and EW capabilities to exploit poor Russian cross-domain command and control. Washington should focus on building Ukraine’s edge as quickly as possible while exploiting Russia’s weaknesses, especially its access to advanced Western technology, which is currently limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reassessing-natos-approach-to-russia&quot;&gt;Reassessing NATO’s Approach to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s approach to Russia is guided by the North Atlantic Council, the alliance’s main decisionmaking body, and by the interests of its 31 independent member states. NATO’s approach is then expressed in its Strategic Concept, an overarching strategy document which has been updated approximately once per decade since the end of the Cold War. NATO’s new 2022 Strategic Concept marked a dramatic shift in the alliance’s overall approach to Russia. The previous strategy, adopted in 2010, sought a strategic partnership with Russia. It described the Euro-Atlantic region as “at peace” and NATO’s purpose as safeguarding freedom and security for its members. In contrast, the 2022 Strategic Concept acknowledged Europe is not at peace and it declared Russia to be the “most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic.” The new strategy updated NATO’s purpose — collective defense — and its three core tasks — defense and deterrence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security — to reflect this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept prioritizes Russia as the central, direct threat to the Euro-Atlantic region, followed by the continuing threat of terrorism, which is especially important for allies across NATO’s southern borders; however, it identifies the PRC as a mere “challenge” to NATO’s interests, security, and values. Much like the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy, NATO’s Strategic Concept commits only a single line to cooperation or the synergies between Russia and the PRC, and it suggests allies need to improve their shared awareness and build resilience against PRC attempts to divide NATO and undermine the rules-based order. Though European assessments of the threat posed by China are rapidly moving closer to the U.S. view, some European allies still hesitate to consider the PRC a security threat to the Euro-Atlantic region. This divides the transatlantic community, and it weakens NATO’s ability to address the problems Beijing poses today in Europe, as well as the potential synergistic impact of Sino-Russian cooperation on Russia’s military threat to the Euro-Atlantic over the next two to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the release of NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, Russia has demonstrated considerable weaknesses and poor performance on the battlefield in Ukraine, especially its inability to leverage its substantial quantitative advantages in manpower and in nearly every capability area. Moreover, the Wagner mutiny of June 2023 potentially cast into doubt perceptions of Russia as a unitary adversary. These weaknesses have prompted some allies, especially those in southern Europe who are more focused on terrorism and other challenges emanating from the Middle East or North Africa, to question the centrality of the Russian threat in NATO’s new strategy. There are also voices in the United States and in Western European capitals that express the same concerns. They recognize the need to respond to Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine, but they want to ensure that NATO retains its other core tasks and its ability to address very different security challenges in southern Europe. Nonetheless, given Russia’s residual military potential over the short run as outlined previously, NATO’s decision to place strategic focus on Russia — while preserving and updating its other core tasks — is appropriate and prudent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nuclear realm, NATO’s Strategic Concept downgrades arms control as a tool for managing conflict, instead opening the aperture wide on ways to prevent unintentional conflict through nuclear risk reduction, transparency, conflict management, and confidence-building measures. NATO might continue to hone its focus on strategic risk reduction with Russia, taking unilateral steps that reduce the risk of nuclear war without compromising allied defense and deterrence. While NATO should factor Russia’s announced deployment of nuclear weapons to Belarus into its future posture planning, the alliance should resist the urge to abandon its “three nos” — no intention, no plan, and no reason — to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members. During the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review cycle, the allies might also consider adopting a more forward-leaning approach in discussing their nuclear-sharing arrangements to counter misinformation, including among nonaligned states — not only regarding Russia’s planned nuclear deployments to Belarus, but also regarding the U.S. trilateral security pact with the United Kingdom and Australia (AUKUS) and the nature of the U.S. alliance with the Republic of Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding conventional forces, NATO has finalized its new regional and domain-specific operational plans based on the threats posed by Russia as well as by other state and potential non-state actors considered important by the 31 NATO allies. These plans mark a new direction for the alliance, and they reflect the fact that collective defense and deterrence has, once again, become NATO’s top priority, just as it was during the Cold War. The plans also reflect a relatively new approach to defense and deterrence; previously, the alliance based its operational planning on somewhat more vague operational typologies. Given developments on the battlefield in Ukraine, the Wagner mutiny, and the war’s short-term impact on the Russian military, however, the assumptions underpinning NATO’s new plans should not be based on a static picture of Russia’s military potential. The alliance needs to ensure that its plans are not only credible but that they are agile, and that they can evolve, especially in the short term. To do this, NATO should routinely exercise its plans in tabletop training events; frequently incorporate intelligence on Russian capabilities and capacity, military morale, and cohesion; and fold the lessons learned back into plan refinement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to testing, exercising, and regularly refining its operational plans with updated assessments of Russia’s changing military potential, NATO should recalibrate its defense planning efforts to prioritize the acquisition of the capabilities and capacities best suited to leverage Russia’s demonstrated weaknesses in the Ukraine war and account for its residual strengths. For example, given Moscow’s undersea capabilities and its likely increased willingness to engage in hybrid operations against the alliance, NATO member states should strengthen subsurface situational awareness, particularly when it comes to critical undersea communications and energy linkages. This is especially true in the Black Sea given European interests in extending ties to the South Caucasus. NATO’s new undersea infrastructure coordination cell should help in this regard, but beyond information sharing it remains to be seen whether NATO’s littoral states will or can acquire the capabilities to deter and defend against Russian vessels conducting hybrid operations in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, NATO might focus on efforts to counter other Russian tools of hybrid warfare, including those related to media control or manipulation and information warfare, not only in allied territory but among vulnerable partners in the post-Soviet space. This might include media literacy support, efforts to boost transparency in ownership, or efforts to replicate the role that Starlink has played in facilitating access to the internet and other media in authoritarian states or regions occupied by authoritarian states. Beyond this, however, allies are likely to remain reluctant to agree on a more forward-leaning or offensive operational approach to hybrid warfare outside the context of a crisis or conflict. Although NATO adopted a counter-hybrid strategy in 2015, its toolbox for countering hybrid threats is almost exclusively defensive — and, ultimately, the allied nations still have primary responsibility for addressing these threats. It is more likely that those allies with offensive hybrid capabilities might take responsibility for conducting such operations individually or in coordination with other like-minded allies. NATO might provide a venue for the coordination or deconfliction of such activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, given the role sanctions evasion plays in facilitating Russia’s production or acquisition of tanks, missiles, UAVs, aircraft, and EW capabilities, NATO defense planning should prioritize capabilities to counter conventional Russian military strengths at scale. Allies have increased their defense spending since 2014 primarily to modernize their national forces, not necessarily to build additional capacity. The legacies of low investment, diverging national interests, and the sheer number of systems produced to different national specifications all combine to prevent the European allies from achieving economies of scale or surge capacity. NATO should be the primary standards setter and a catalyst (alongside the European Union) for more multinational and multiyear procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges associated with force projection and the weakness Russia continues to evince in command and control of multi-domain operations suggest that the most significant threats are to those allies contiguous to Russian territory — especially Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Given the difficulty of reinforcing these states from the Atlantic during a crisis or heightened tensions, in-place sustainment capabilities — including resupply of ammunition, spare parts, and fuel, as well as combat support capabilities such as communications, EW, and intelligence-collecting platforms — should be ranked especially high on NATO’s capabilities target list for the near term. NATO might also support stronger border security, particularly for allies that border Russia (and Belarus) as a means of repelling small-scale incursions by Russian special forces, especially those that might ostensibly begin as exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving these defense planning objectives at scale is particularly important given the possibility of a contingency in the Indo-Pacific theater. In such a scenario, the United States might need to shift some assets from Europe to the Indo-Pacific, not unlike it did during the Vietnam War era. As was the case then, the United States would expect European allies to fill any gaps, and it might expect certain allies — such as the United Kingdom and France — to make some contributions to military efforts in the Indo-Pacific. The gaps in Europe could be acute in terms of air and missile defense, long-range fires, medium and heavy airlift, combat aircraft, command and control, ammunition, and spare parts for a wide variety of systems and platforms. NATO might leverage its defense planning process now to build up large-scale hardened stores of critical supplies and equipment, as well as to plan for the larger European troop formations necessary to achieve deterrence by denial in the Baltic region and to respond to a large-scale conventional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how and where NATO arrays its capabilities, as foreshadowed above, the alliance would be better prepared to counter Russia’s changing military potential in the next two to four years if it embraced a true deterrence-by-denial force posture along the eastern flank — especially in the Baltic states, by stationing full brigades in each. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lack the strategic depth of Poland or Finland, and therefore their defense and reinforcement is inherently more challenging, especially in a crisis’s early stages when key alliance members may still be reluctant to engage in a large-scale reinforcement effort for fear of it being perceived as escalatory. In-place forces are therefore critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO must also preserve political unity, so efforts to assist Ukraine through NATO structures and processes will likely remain limited. This means that, aside from consistent messaging of long-term political support for Ukraine, the Comprehensive Assistance Package, and potentially more support for resilience and capacity building, NATO will continue to play a limited role in the war. For some observers, it might appear as if the alliance is hamstrung, and to some degree this may be a valid criticism. Nonetheless, NATO functions as the critical framework within which mini-lateral or ad hoc coalitions among like-minded allies can occur. It is partly because of the day-to-day experience of working together that the allies have been able to orchestrate such significant assistance to Ukraine through the U.S.-led Ramstein Group. NATO’s limited formal role also protects it from fulfilling the Kremlin’s false narrative, which frames the war as a conflict between Russia and NATO, rather than as Moscow’s effort to destroy Ukrainian statehood and national identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has already had devastating consequences for the Ukrainian state, its economy, and its people; it will take generations to recover from this war. The war is also completely transforming the European security landscape, upending nearly all of the assumptions that previously guided U.S. and European — particularly Western European — strategies and policies toward Russia and eastern Europe. The war in Ukraine is now at the center of what is likely to be a long-term political confrontation pitting Russia against the United States and its allies and partners. Because battlefield circumstances are changing rapidly and the war’s outcome is still unpredictable, it is critical that the United States and NATO continuously reassess the conflict’s impact on Russia’s military potential and its evolving military threat to the Euro-Atlantic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict when or how the war in Ukraine might end, so trying to gauge Russia’s evolving military potential over the next two to four years with any precision is very challenging. Ukraine could break through Russia’s defenses; a war of attrition could continue for the foreseeable future; Russia could bow out due to political divisions exemplified by the Wagner mutiny; or the conflict could freeze along the front lines, which would enable Russia to rearm, regroup, and try again to achieve its strategic objectives in the future. What is certain, though, is that the challenges that Russia’s military presents to the Euro-Atlantic region are changing because of developments in the war, Russia’s growing experience with the conflict and its own learning processes, and its ability to circumvent some U.S. and EU sanctions and export controls. Russia’s military has demonstrated operational weaknesses and it has lost manpower and equipment; still, Moscow retains important capabilities — some of which have not been touched by the war — and it is finding ways to field older equipment effectively. Russia’s military threat to the West is reduced in the short run, but to be sure, it is neither minimal nor one-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Russia’s nuclear arsenal; the advanced air and ground systems it holds in reserve; and its significant EW, undersea, anti-satellite, cyber, and information warfare capabilities all still pose major challenges to the United States and its NATO allies. Meanwhile, given where Western sanctions have had some impact, it seems likely Russia will continue to pursue a strategy of attrition, leveraging its limited precision or advanced weaponry and its ubiquitous older, lower-quality weapon systems. Russia is a learning adversary, however, and it will likely devote significant resources to adaptation and to its military reconstitution. The United States and its European allies have also struggled to ramp up their own domestic industrial production, and they are facing urgent needs to fill gaps, replenish stockpiles, and make good on their promises to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. As a result, the short-term military challenge that Russia poses to the West is much different than it appeared in late 2021 or in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some degree, the 2022 U.S. and NATO strategies account for the dramatic changes in the European security environment — but implementing them will require agility and adaptation. Broadly, the United States and the NATO alliance should adapt their short-term approaches in ways that target Russia’s weaknesses and offer defense and deterrence against Russia’s remaining strengths, especially in the EW, cyber, and nuclear realms. The U.S. strategy could better account for the interconnectedness of the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, recognize potential debilitating fissures in Russian society, and focus on augmenting capabilities and capacities to counter Russian strengths, especially those that are in short supply in Europe. NATO allies, on the other hand, should also collectively grapple with the Russia-China relationship in their strategies, acknowledge the potential for divisions within Russia to destabilize Europe, and adapt their defense and operational planning to acquire and exercise the capabilities and capacities that are best suited to leverage Russia’s short-term weaknesses and account for its residual strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The short-term military challenge that Russia poses to the West is much different than it appeared in late 2021 or early 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long run, the United States and its NATO allies and partners in Europe hold significant structural advantages over Russia. They have much larger and more dynamic economies. They have much larger populations and more favorable demographic trends, and, perhaps most importantly, they are united by principles and values — such as individual liberty, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. These values may be the West’s most powerful tools; authoritarian leaders are having to take increasingly draconian measures to control and suppress their populations. The longer-term balance of power favors the West, but Washington and its NATO allies and partners cannot be complacent vis-à-vis a changing Russian military threat to the Euro-Atlantic region, especially while such a brutal and consequential war is underway in the heart of Europe. Understanding and responding to the evolving nature of Russia’s military potential is critical to transatlantic security both today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines European defense over a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves throughout the world. The destructive reality of conventional war on the European continent transformed perceptions of risk. Historically, with the prospect of war unlikely, European states made relatively small investments in their defense capabilities and remained content with the United States serving as the continent’s guarantor of security especially after the end of the Cold War. As a result, capability gaps began to emerge in European militaries that remained largely unaddressed for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s collective response to send robust security assistance packages to Kyiv exposed the magnitude and scale of several of Europe’s capability gaps. Europe’s collective shock from Russia’s invasion has prompted European decisionmakers to pursue rearmament on a national and multinational basis with an unprecedent political zeal for the post-Cold War era. This report seeks to capture the progress made in European defense over the past few years and provide actionable insights to guide European and transatlantic decisionmakers forward as they continue to work to preserve continental peace and support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Vilnius summit this past July, the transatlantic alliance requires long-term defense industrial investments to sustain the collective defense of all member-states. The summit’s official communique outlines the need for a stronger European defense industrial base that facilitates cooperation within the continent and across the Atlantic. The communique also articulates NATO’s commitment to serving as a “standard setter” and a “requirement setter and aggregator.” The document further hails the progress NATO has made in cooperating with the European Union in an array of fields — including defense industrial and research cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a diverse range of views concerning European defense both among analysts and decision makers on either side of the Atlantic. On April 5, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened top practitioners and scholars at the 2023 Global Security Forum to address the topic transatlantic defense. This report aims to capture multiple of perspectives surrounding European defense in a bid to provide readers an understanding of the complexities that have long frustrated European decisionmakers aiming to rationalize the continent’s collective defense. These complexities range from granular regulations to strategic concerns decades in the making. Furthermore, this report aims to unravel the interplay between the European Union, NATO, and the United States in advancing collective security in Europe amidst the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outline-of-the-report&quot;&gt;Outline of the Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first introductory chapter provides an overview of the report. This body of report offers three distinct perspectives on key issues for the new European defense. The second chapter, “Europe’s Defense Outlook 2030: Implications of An Increasingly Aligned Europe,” explores how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed European threat perceptions and strategic outlooks before forecasting how these changes will shape European states for the remainder of the decade. The third chapter, “NATO’s Evolving Threat Landscape and Ability to Respond,” focuses on the role of NATO in European security and the intra-alliance dynamics that enable or impede a robust transatlantic response to Russian aggression. The fourth chapter, “Pivoting to Production? Europe’s Defense Industrial Opportunities,” analyzes the factors driving European defense integration, the tools needed to expand European defense collaboration, and the roles and responsibilities between European defense institutions in delivering capabilities to European warfighters. The concluding chapter summarizes and reflects on the discussions in the earlier chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 set off a chain of events that has reverberated far beyond the borders of the conflict. Across Europe, a historic effort to rethink defense posture is underway as European states grapple with the implications of the conflict for their own security. In a consequence clearly unforeseen by President Vladimir Putin, the invasion has undermined Russia’s efforts to divide the collective West and has instead led to the expansion of NATO. Additionally, the invasion has weakened the Russian Armed Forces, as mounting setbacks continue to degrade the Kremlin’s conventional capabilities. As a result, the West has gradually unified and strengthened while Russian power has diminished. This moment in European defense represents a critical juncture for the continent wherein European nations can, individually and collectively, rethink their continent’s security architecture. To support deeper discussions and analysis into the topic of transatlantic defense, the 2023 Global Security Forum, the flagship annual event of CSIS’s International Security Program, featured senior leaders from Europe and the United States who analyzed the threat landscape and identified challenges in defense, as well as opportunities for transatlantic cooperation. This companion volume includes essays on those topics as well as material covered during the discussion by the expert participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, European security exited an era defined by East-West division and began an era focused on economic development that has characterized the past 30 years. During this period, Europe enjoyed the so-called “peace dividend.” Without a unified adversary threatening their sovereign borders, European nations were able to allocate resources away from their defense capabilities and toward developing dynamic economies supported by social safety nets. Where Europe did invest in its defensive capabilities, a focus on out of area operations lead to the development of expeditionary forces that are not designed for a conventional conflict with a near-peer adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a unifying threat led European nations to refocus their investments, as varying threat perceptions drove different levels of defense spending within individual European states and led them to invest according to their disparate national interests. Across all elements of Europe’s security architecture, this contributed to redundancies in capabilities and a lack of efficiency across national borders. Throughout this era, Europe was able to rely on the United States as a backup external security provider — a security insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the challenges of sustaining Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion have demonstrated, the U.S. defense industry would struggle if it tried to sustain a major war without support from allies. Fortunately, the United States is not alone in its support of Ukraine, as European allies have made significant contributions to the fight against the Russian invasion. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that the European allies could have provided the full range of necessary support without the United States. The clear conclusion is that the United States and its European allies will need to cooperate to preserve European security, especially as the United States shifts its strategic gaze to the Pacific. Reaching an equitable and sustainable agreement on burden sharing within Europe and across the Atlantic will continue to be the primary challenge for European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not U.S. versus Western Europe. It’s an alliance. We all come together in the ways that we can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europes-defense-era&quot;&gt;Europe’s Defense Era&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion is leading to a historic reset of the strategic picture and increasing alignment in the threat perceptions of Russia among European states. As a result, Finland and Sweden’s historic policies of neutrality ended with the former’s accession to NATO on April 4, 2023, and the latter’s planned entry into the alliance; Germany is reinvesting in its armed forces, the Bundeswehr; and the European Union is organizing joint procurement among its member-states to refill stockpiles spent in Ukraine. Most of these developments were unthinkable before February 24, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think that the work that the alliance is doing, the United States is doing, to provide the capabilities and add capacity that the Ukrainians need has been pretty spectacular, frankly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European defense has a rare opportunity to rethink continental defense and deepen institutional cooperation among European states. Because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European states now have the political will to invest in defense and increasingly also the resources to do so, with European decisionmakers pursuing unprecedented investments in defense capabilities. The full potential of this moment requires increased cooperation and investment, especially for the ongoing evolution of continental defense to represent a new era rather than a short-lived phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, questions concerning the future of European defense loom large in the minds of transatlantic policymakers and analysts alike. Questions concerning European defense integration, the division of labor between the European Union and NATO, and the role of the United States remain unanswered. Answers to these questions will define Europe’s security architecture for decades. This report aims to advance the conversation surrounding these questions in a bid to bring the transatlantic community closer to actionable policy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think theater missile defense is something that Ukraine has shown us is important, another one of those elements that is perhaps reemphasized as opposed to learned or relearned. And so moving together with our allies and partners on the appropriate architecture and capability/capacity to execute theater missile defense will be absolutely critical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implications of an Increasingly Aligned Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max Bergmann, Sissy Martinez, and Otto Svendsen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has put defense and security front and center on Europe’s political agenda. Europe was shocked by Russia’s invasion, and there is a renewed sense of urgency and purpose to strengthen European defense as a result. The war has also reinvigorated NATO alliance, refocusing its attention on the threat posed by Russia and the need to prepare for conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of European responses to the war across the continent shows the emergence of a shared European perception of threat and general alignment on the need for greater action. It finds that there are indeed varying perceptions of threats across Europe. For example, states bordering Russia will be consumed with the threat posed by Russia, while states bordering the Mediterranean may share the concern about Russia but will also be focused on security to the south. Yet there is also an underlying shared solidarity formed both through the European Union and NATO that has a unifying effect inside of Europe. The war in Ukraine has reinforced what it means to be European as well as the need to protect Europe. This was borne out by states across the continent, as well as the European Union itself, taking unprecedented steps to support Ukraine and bolster European security. Thus, while Europe may not have a singular strategic culture or share precisely the same view on how to prioritize the challenges it faces, it does generally share a common strategic outlook of the threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the question remains as to whether a shared sense of threat and purpose will translate into European military capabilities. The war has cast a spotlight on European militaries and revealed many forces to be hollow. While there has been an awakening across the continent to the importance of defense and the need to rebuild European capabilities, there are also tremendous gaps after decades of neglect. Europe has surprised many by its firmness and unity throughout the war, exemplified by 11 rounds of EU sanctions packages and unprecedented military assistance. But as the war grinds on and as the Russian military is severely weakened, the sense of urgency to address Europe’s many defense gaps is diminishing, especially the further a state is from the front line in Ukraine. There is a danger that Europe may struggle to turn this increasingly shared strategic outlook into military capabilities to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter discusses how the war in Ukraine has impacted European threat perceptions and strategic outlooks. It assesses how the shift in threat perceptions will impact Europe’s ability to expand defense cooperation and improve the interoperability of European forces. The lack of a common strategic culture is thought to be a major challenge to Europe cooperating and operating more closely. This chapter asks whether Europe can have such a culture and whether it has moved toward a common European set of shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;European Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe is united in its perception of Russia as a threat, there are varying interpretations across the continent regarding its severity. Likewise, there are regional differences in threat perceptions and focus. For instance, France is still concerned about Africa, while the Baltics are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and NATO both play critically important roles in helping to harmonize threat perceptions across Europe. Both address urgent security priorities, with NATO focused more on the hard security dimension and the European Union focused more on the economic and social dimensions (e.g., sanctions, assistance, and refugees). Together, this prompts EU and NATO member states to not just align their views but to do so across government ministries. It is not simply that foreign and defense ministers at NATO discuss the war in Ukraine, for instance, but that these same ministers, along with finance, energy, and interior ministers, also hold discussions at the EU level. The NATO secretary general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council also play an essential role in synthesizing and harmonizing views to create alignment within Europe. For instance, granting Ukraine EU candidate status was an issue on which not all EU member states agreed. However, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen prioritized and elevated the issue, declaring that Ukraine’s future belonged in the European Union. Thus, EU members that were not enthusiastic about Ukraine’s membership would have had to publicly object to offering Ukraine status; those EU members ended up relenting. EU and NATO heads therefore have an important agenda-setting role and can help elevate a topic through their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both NATO and the European Union help foster shared outlooks through efforts to formulate comprehensive strategy documents. NATO’s Strategic Concept, which provides strategic direction for the alliance, is a critical exercise that involves intensive efforts by member states. Additionally, the European Union last year also released its own national security strategy equivalent, called the Strategic Compass. Although the language of these documents often represents the least common denominator of what member states can agree to publish, they are useful frameworks for assessing Europe-wide policy — and the process of developing them is itself a helpful forcing function that makes members sit down with one another and debate security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cooperation is the only way forward . . . there’s only one way forward, and that’s a common one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most dramatic change in national-level threat perceptions toward Russia has transpired in the German public and political establishment. Since the end of the Cold War, Berlin’s approach to Russia had been based on the assumption that increasing trade would induce political change and incentivize the Kremlin to adopt Western ideals of democracy and the rule of law. Known as the Wandel durch Handel policy, this notion was most clearly reflected in Berlin’s growing reliance on inexpensive Russian gas and the development of the Nord Stream pipelines despite repeated warnings from Washington and Eastern European capitals. Russia had also become closely embedded in the German political elite, which contributed to a more accommodating policy toward Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s invasion shocked the German public and political establishment. Germany rapidly revised its security and defense policy and embraced a more assertive position in Europe’s security order. In a speech to parliament mere days into the war, German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced his country’s Zeitenwende, a new era characterized by a major transformation of Berlin’s defense planning policy. Scholz emphasized that Germany would permanently commit to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense, buoyed by an extraordinary €100 billion emergency fund to enhance the Bundeswehr — Germany’s armed forces. Additionally, Germany upended its policy on refraining from sending lethal aid directly into conflict zones, thus shedding its long-standing pacifist foreign policy. From its own stockpiles, Germany initially delivered 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft defense systems to Kyiv; as the war has progressed, this aid has steadily expanded into more advanced weapons systems, such as the Leopard main battle tank. Germany has also been a significant contributor to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which has funneled €3.1 billion into arming Ukraine and has helped finance at least 325 tanks, 36 attack helicopters, and more than 200 Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems. Germany’s direct military aid to Ukraine totals €7.5 billion as of May 31, 2023, making it the second-largest national contributor, and its total bilateral support, including EU commitments, totals €18.1 billion, ranking only behind the United States. Berlin has also taken steps to rapidly diversify its energy imports away from Russian supplies, which previously accounted for more than half of Germany’s gas and around a third of its oil imports. However, Germany has also had significant struggles. While Berlin has earmarked at least €30 billion of the 100 billion emergency fund to major weapons purchases, none of the funds have actually been spent. There are immense bureaucratic issues within the German Ministry of Defense, and the governing coalition’s first defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, was widely criticized and removed from her position in January 2023. Moreover, German reluctance to provide Leopard tanks to Ukraine and its insistence that the United States also provide Abrams tanks has roiled many allies, although Berlin eventually relented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a year into the war, the most recent Munich Security Index reflects that German respondents remain extremely concerned about Russia, attributing a higher risk score to the Russian threat than any other country surveyed except Ukraine. A year prior, Russia ranked 18th among 32 potential risks; today, it is firmly considered the most pressing threat. Furthermore, 67 percent of German respondents feel the risk from Russia is imminent and 45 percent feel unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany is beginning the process of a massive defense transformation. This will be a long and challenging effort, as the Bundeswehr is in a decrepit state after decades of underinvestment and poor management. Fortunately, this has become a national embarrassment, with considerable press attention and growing demands for faster action. There remain questions of how much Germany will actually invest in defense in the years ahead and whether it will reach the 2 percent target. Regardless, Germany will increase its defense spending and likely increase the readiness of its forces, as well as acquire significant military capabilities, whether in the form of F-35 fighter jets or air defense capabilities under the Sky Shield Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2030, the German military will be more capable as a result. However, because Germany is the largest and wealthiest country in Europe, it sets the tone for much of Western Europe, shielding others from scrutiny. There is therefore concern that the depletion of the Russian military in Ukraine will decrease the urgency and the investment needed to truly turn the Bundeswehr around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has long maintained a very professional military at a high state of readiness, matched with a political will to deploy. It has, for instance, maintained a substantial military presence in Africa, with several operations in the Sahel to counter rising Islamic terrorism. Although its defense spending has declined since the end of the Cold War, France has spent close to 2 percent of GDP on defense during the past two decades and maintained the European Union’s sole nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine has exposed France’s lack of readiness for a major conventional war. France has provided significant assistance to Ukraine, including CAESAR artillery, SAMP/T air defense systems, and AMX-10 RC infantry fighting vehicles. The provision of equipment to Ukraine has therefore created new acquisition requirements for the French military. France has also deployed brigades to Romania to lead this year’s highest-readiness element of the NATO Response Force, a multinational force of 40,000 land, air, maritime, and special operations personnel that can be deployed at very short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of depleting artillery and equipment stocks, Paris has taken steps to improve France’s readiness. In 2023, French president Emmanuel Macron announced a new budget plan for the French military that would boost military spending by one-third between 2024 and 2030 and include €400 billion to modernize French forces. By 2030, France’s annual defense spending is expected to total €60 billion, nearly doubling from the €32 billion allocated in 2017. These investments intend to provide both additional munitions and weaponry following the return of high-intensity conflict to Europe as well as increased tensions in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France shares the concerns of its European allies about the Russian conventional military threat. French officials note that this will require a significant shift, as the French military was focused on out-of-area crisis management, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism operations for much of the past two decades, not on the need to prepare itself for conventional warfare. Yet France will not fully pivot away from out-of-area operations. While it will seek to bolster its conventional defense capabilities, it will have to maintain a balance. France will remain focused on the challenges of the Sahel and Middle East. It also maintains the largest exclusive economic zone in the world and will seek to strengthen its Indo-Pacific presence in French territories. Therefore, France faces a similar dilemma as the United Kingdom and will have to make hard trade-offs regarding defense planning while also balancing different geopolitical priorities. President Macron hinted as much on a recent state visit to China where he noted that Europe’s policy toward Taiwan should be formed independent of China and the United States to avoid accelerating a crisis over the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional defense investments will maintain France’s status as an elite European military. France will likely seek to increase investments, especially with European partners, in critical enabling capabilities to reduce dependence on the United States for tasks such as air lift and refueling. France will also likely bolster its maritime assets, making it the most important European partner, along with the United Kingdom, in the Indo-Pacific theater. While France will bolster its conventional capabilities and stockpiles and maintain a presence on NATO’s eastern flank, its most significant added value to European security will continue to be its nuclear deterrent and its ability and willingness to deploy forces for missions across Europe’s periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We [the European Union] need to be much more agile, flexible, and a quick responder to any strategic surprise. We have seen last year it happened. It would happen again, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;vice-admiral-hervé-bléjean-director-general-of-the-european-union-military-staff-panel-2&quot;&gt;Vice Admiral Hervé Bléjean, Director General of the European Union Military Staff, Panel 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;united-kingdom&quot;&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a year of tumultuous domestic politics, the United Kingdom has responded robustly to the war. Polling indicates that the British public are more likely than any other country to express the belief that doing nothing will encourage Russia to take future military action against other European countries in the future, with 79 percent saying so. They are also the most likely population in the world to support the “most stringent” possible economic sanctions against Russia (70 percent). This has led to an abrupt shift in the United Kingdom, which had become a major hub for Russian money and influence. Public support has prompted and then empowered successive prime ministers — Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and now Rishi Sunak — to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the United Kingdom has provided the third-most absolute aid to Ukraine, behind the United States and EU institutions (although when measured as a share of GDP, the United Kingdom only ranks 16th). According to an August 2023 report from UK House of Commons, the country has provided £2.3 billion in military assistance in 2022 and indicated it will do the same in 2023/2024. It is also hosting an infantry training course for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, which has reportedly trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops as of March, 2023. The United Kingdom has played important roles in aid coordination bodies such as the International Donor Coordination Center and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. It has also largely moved in lockstep with the United States and European Union on sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to its own defense and contributions to NATO, the United Kingdom has been active. In early 2023, the Sunak government released its “refresh” of the 2021 Integrated Review — an update, in other words, of the country’s national defense strategy to account for the war. The document announced a commitment to boost the defense budget by £5 billion for the next two years (not counting aid to Ukraine). The government’s overall spending goal is to allocate 2.25 percent of GDP toward defense by 2025 and 2.5 percent within an unspecified time frame. This is actually a step backward in ambition from the prior government: former prime minister Liz Truss had committed during her brief tenure to reaching 3 percent by 2030. Analysts note that there is a disconnect between the ambition of the “refresh” and what the budget will actually allow the British Armed Forces to deliver. With the new £5 billion in funding going toward the nuclear program and munitions stocks, there will need to be trade-offs in other areas of procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the document emphasizes a prioritization of the Euro-Atlantic area. This includes many references to cooperation with European allies and partners, including the European Union. With respect to NATO, the United Kingdom is already the framework nation for the Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup in Estonia. When the new NATO Force Model is unveiled, presumably at the summit in Vilnius in July, the future scope of the United Kingdom’s contributions on NATO’s eastern flank should be clarified. Overall, the United Kingdom has demonstrated strong political will, but its rhetoric and ambition has somewhat outpaced its action. Nonetheless, in terms of its threat perception and strategic priorities, it is conceptually in harmony with the Baltic-Polish bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Kingdom faces the challenge of rebuilding its military capacity after a decade of austerity and with an economy that is struggling post-Brexit. The United Kingdom is struggling to match the demands of its global outlook with its present economic means and is strategically pulled in varying directions. On the one hand, the war has demonstrated the importance of European security and the United Kingdom has led in providing support to Ukraine as well as in the development of the Joint Expeditionary Force with Northern European countries. On the other hand, the United Kingdom is playing a pivotal role in AUKUS and wants to develop its presence in the Indo-Pacific. Thus, the challenge for the United Kingdom will be maintaining the significant increase in defense spending in order to meet its defense ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-baltics-and-poland&quot;&gt;The Baltics and Poland&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike some Western, Southern, or Nordic European allies, Poland and the three Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — did not need to dramatically rethink their strategic outlooks or threat perceptions vis-à-vis Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In fact, these Eastern European countries have seen Russia’s invasion as validating years of warnings. As a result, there has been no significant political handwringing regarding whether to respond robustly. Long wary of their large eastern neighbor, these countries have in fact responded more strongly relative to their smaller size than all other European countries — including by being outspoken publicly and behind closed doors to urge the European Union, NATO, and their member states to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, the Baltics and Poland have been generous in their provision of lethal and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine. Estonia, for example, has given the equivalent of half of its defense budget in aid. It has sent an array of weaponry, including anti-tank missiles, mortars and ammunition, vehicles, and other battlefield necessities such as helmets and food rations. Lithuania was the first country to send the Stinger surface-to-air missile, which proved crucial to halting Russia’s push toward Kyiv in initial phase of the conflict. Poland has allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for military equipment headed for Ukraine. Altogether, these countries are the top four for government support to Ukraine when measured by share of GDP. The provision of aid extends even to civil society actors in these countries, demonstrating the strong solidarity their citizens feel toward the Ukrainian cause. The countries have also been willing recipients of Ukrainian refugees — Poland in particular has taken in 974,060 Ukrainian refugees since the war began, the most in Europe as of March, 2023. The Baltic states have also received 141,775 refugees, by the European Council’s latest count, a disproportionate number relative to their small populations. To date, there have been no significant debates in these countries’ domestic political arenas regarding the sustainability of this policy. Finally, they have led the debate in the halls of Brussels’ institutions. Estonian and Lithuanian foreign ministers were vocal, for example, in pushing their EU counterparts earlier in 2023 to endorse harsher sanctions against Russia and to continue pouring money into the European Peace Facility to aid Ukraine militarily. Polish leaders have likewise played a role in pressuring Germany to approve the provision of German-made Polish tanks and also to provide their own. However, Poland’s support has not been unlimited, exemplified by Warsaw’s decision to temporarily block imports of Ukrainian grain against EU rules to protect domestic producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to broader NATO efforts, these countries are significant. The Baltic countries, and Poland to a somewhat lesser extent, perceive that a more bellicose Russia may well turn its sights on their own countries next. NATO force planners seem to agree — these countries have already been playing host to NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups, which were reinforced after the war and will likely further be strengthened to brigade size when NATO rolls out its new NATO Force Model sometime this year. In addition to welcoming new NATO forces soon, these countries have also ramped up their own procurement and defense spending. Estonia, for example, intends to spend 3 percent of its GDP on defense for 2023 and has ordered six M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. Poland intends to increase defense spending to 4 percent of GDP and recently announced that it will purchase 1,400 Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles; this is in addition to a $4.75 billion agreement in 2022 to procure 250 U.S.-made M1A2 Abrams tanks. Shortly after the war began, Lithuania allocated extra funds to its defense budget; later in the year, it signed a $495 million deal for eight HIMARS of its own. The deal also included long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). For its part, Latvia has ordered new Black Hawk helicopters and uncrewed aerial vehicles for reconnaissance. Latvia’s defense minister has also indicated that her country plans to purchase six HIMARS and the Naval Strike Missile, a long-range anti-ship missile, in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; Poland and the Baltic states are making major investments in their defense forces. Given the threat posed by Russia, these investments will prove durable over the longer term. All four countries will have to replace significant stocks of equipment that have been provided to Ukraine and are using this as an opportunity to modernize their military forces. These states will also likely invest significantly in their ability to host NATO forces. By 2030, these countries will likely possess some of the most capable militaries in Europe, with Poland likely having a military capacity among the strongest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hungary-slovakia-romania-the-czech-republic-slovenia-and-bulgaria&quot;&gt;Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Bulgaria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Poland and the Baltic states, many Central and Eastern European countries, have previously perceived Russia in less hostile terms. With the exception of Hungary, this no longer remains the case. Support for Ukraine is strong, and there is agreement on the need to focus on the conventional challenge posed by Russia. With Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania sharing borders with Ukraine, the worry of war spreading further into Europe’s borders remains real. NATO has reinforced multinational battlegroups already stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland with more troops and has created four more battlegroups, stationed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Additionally, President Biden announced last June at NATO’s summit in Madrid that a new U.S. Army rotational brigade combat team would be headquartered in Romania. Such efforts have required significant investment by these states toward improving and expanding facilities and bases to host NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has also clarified a common threat. For instance, Slovakia has historically held a delicate strategic relationship with Russia built on the basis of a “Slavic brotherhood.” It was viewed as one of the most pro-Russia countries in the European Union. But since the war, Bratislava has provided substantial support to Ukraine and has had to actively counter hybrid threats. The Czech Republic, similarly, has also had a mixed stance toward Russia, with former president Miloš Zeman adopting a softer line toward the Kremlin. However, the election in January of Petr Pavel, a former Czech army general who served in NATO, to be the next president, and his resounding defeat of former prime minister Andrej Babiš, who campaigned on decreasing support to Ukraine, is indicative of the shifting landscape. This trend is seen across Central Europe. (Even militarily neutral Austria has provided non-lethal aid through helmets, army stocks, and other gear.) Collectively, Central European countries have allowed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees across their borders to escape the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Poland, many former Warsaw Pact states have divested considerable quantities of their old Soviet-era equipment by sending it to Ukraine. Since 2014, considerable attention has been paid to the problem of how several NATO countries have been reliant on maintaining Soviet-era equipment and therefore have been forced to do business with Russian defense industry, often potentially in violation of U.S. sanctions. Despite the urgency to rid their militaries of Soviet-era equipment, the cost of replacing this equipment has created a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing both lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine has been a central component in demonstrating Europe’s solidarity with Ukraine — and Central European states have certainly played their part in Europe’s strong response. For example, Romania has become a transit country for delivering Western aid to Ukraine. Additionally, Slovakia has given Ukraine its fleet of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets and donated its S-300 air defense system — something once thought unthinkable. Slovenia has given 35 Yugoslav-era combat vehicles as well as 28 Soviet-era M-55S tanks under Germany’s Ringtausch program, which encourages countries to shift older equipment to Ukraine in exchange for newer equipment from Germany. As of late February 2023, the Czech Republic had provided T-72A main battle tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles as well as 38 howitzers, 33 multiple rocket launchers, 4 helicopters, 6 air defense systems, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, in addition to agreeing to repair battle-weakened armored vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has also prompted many of these states to significantly increase defense investments. Slovenia — a country that has historically had very low defense spending — is increasing both its overall defense spending and the percentage of defense funds spent on investment, going from spending 5 percent in 2020 to 17 percent in 2021 and 23 percent in 2023. Romania has announced that it will increase its defense budget from 2 percent to 2.5 percent of GDP and has bolstered its armed forces with recent procurements of F-16s and Bayraktar TB2 drones. Furthermore, Bucharest has demonstrated its willingness to modernize its forces and a willingness to work with neighbors in bolstering its presence in the Black Sea. Notably, Bulgaria initially refrained from sending lethal aid to Ukraine due to its lack in capabilities and instead opted to upgrade its underfunded military through the procurement of new weapons, such as F-16s to replace Soviet MiG-29s. Sofia has also committed to upgrading the avionics of its L-39 Albatros jet trainers, which once was the standard Soviet jet trainer, with Western technology. Elsewhere, despite the Czech defense spending totaling only 1.52 percent of GDP in 2023, the country remains on track to reach NATO’s 2 percent target by next year, thanks to a bill approved by the government in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exception to the united European front with regards to Ukraine is Hungary. Budapest has refused to send military aid or allow weapons to transit its territory to Ukraine, isolating itself from a Europe that has remained united in supporting Ukraine throughout the war. Hungary has remained an irritant at the EU level, especially in relation to passing EU sanctions against Russia and vetoing EU aid to Ukraine. As a result of the European Union withholding funds for Hungary over rule of law concerns in December, Hungary vetoed an €18 billion aid package for Ukraine, causing a back and forth until the country finally relinquished its veto in exchange for some EU funding. Additionally, Viktor Orbán’s government has publicly denounced providing weapons to Ukraine on the argument that it will prolong or escalate the war. Hungary has ultimately not stood in the way of EU action, knowing it would face tremendous blowback. However, it is modernizing its military, aiming to increase defense spending from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2022 to 2.4 percent in 2023. At the same time, it has become more isolated at NATO and has begun purging many of its professional NATO officers. While Hungary remains the primary outlier among former Warsaw Pact states, the robust support for Ukraine shown by these countries is not without limits. Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia also joined Poland in temporarily blocking imports of Ukrainian grain, highlighting the economic costs incurred by these countries. Following Russia’s decision to abandon a deal allowing Ukrainian grain to flow through the Black Sea, these countries have called for an extension to the ban on Ukrainian imports until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Poland, the rest of the former Warsaw Pact states have divested considerable stocks of Soviet-era equipment to Ukraine. They have also committed to increasing defense spending significantly, but their acquisition needs will be significant, as they will have to replace significant equipment stocks with more expensive, NATO-compatible equipment. While there has been a clear shift against Russia, that shift is not as significant as in the Baltics and Poland, though the investment needs are similar. A number of these countries will likely turn to the United States and European Union for financial support to make acquisitions and would benefit from joint acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nordics&quot;&gt;Nordics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a more unified security threat perception among Nordic countries. Despite close cultural and economic ties, the region’s security infrastructure has been loosely integrated and coordinated with regards to hard security issues. Following World War II, Finland and Sweden maintained their neutrality, while the remaining Nordic states actively pursued defense integration with like-minded Western states. These differences have partly been reflected in different institutional affiliations, with Finland and Sweden outside of NATO but part of the European Union, Norway outside the European Union but part of NATO, and Denmark a member of both organizations but outside of EU defense efforts. Denmark maintained an opt-out of the European Union’s Security and Defense Policy as part of four exceptions to EU policies granted to Copenhagen to facilitate the ratification of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, hard defense and security issues were not heavily featured on the agenda in debates over Nordic cooperation during the Cold War. This is highlighted by the fact that the Helsinki Treaty, the basic charter for Nordic cooperation signed in 1962 and last amended in 1995, does not mention foreign and security policy. For example, this means that neither the Nordic Council nor the Nordic Council of Ministers, founded in 1952 and 1972, respectively, have a mandate to discuss security matters. Cooperation in the security and defense realm increased moderately in the 1990s as various collaborative fora were formalized, for example, in the areas of military peace support and acquisition of material. This development culminated in 2009 with the establishment of NORDEFCO, which aimed to consolidate a number of these fora in order to explore synergies and facilitate efficient common solutions. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, security cooperation slowly deepened further through a number of minilateral fora such as the Northern Group, the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force, and NORDEFCO. In general, threat perceptions in the Nordics were shaped by a broad concept of security that included civil security, terror, cyber threats, climate change, and the Arctic region. Although a changing threat perception manifested into incrementally closer defense cooperation over the past decade, Russia’s full-scale invasion has brought a narrower hard security concept back to the forefront of Scandinavian defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion thus upended decades of conventional strategic thinking at both the national and regional levels. Sweden and Finland shed their long-standing neutrality and military non-alignment as the two applied jointly to NATO in May 2022. Although Helsinki and Stockholm have maintained strong ties to NATO, enabling them to participate in NATO-led exercises, exchange information, and develop certain military capabilities, both countries are excluded from NATO’s Article 5 security guarantee. While the two countries pledged to enter the alliance jointly, both Hungary and Turkey have hesitated to ratify their applications. Only Finland has formally joined the alliance, while Stockholm continues bilateral negotiations with Budapest and Ankara to secure its accession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark has similarly undertaken a reassessment of its security and defense policy. Long staunchly committed to NATO and fairly skeptical of the European Union, Russia’s invasion spurred Copenhagen to bolster its armed forces and embrace closer European defense integration. On March 6, 2022, a broad coalition of political parties announced a national agreement on Danish security policy which included an increase in defense spending to reach 2 percent of GDP, proposed ending the EU defense opt-out via referendum, and sought energy dependence from Russian gas. In a referendum in June 2022, Danish voters abolished the opt-out, thus paving the way for Copenhagen to participate in the European Union’s Common Security and Defense Policy. Denmark has also delivered a significant amount of military aid to Ukraine and an advocate for transferring advanced systems, totaling kr.6.2 billion as of March 2023, making it a leading contributor in both per capita terms and relative to GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway’s unique position as a major energy supplier to Europe has influenced its reaction to the invasion. Norway has profited tremendously from Europe’s energy decoupling from Russia, becoming the continent’s largest gas supplier, with inflows to the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund increasing by $108 billion in 2022 (nearly three times the previous record increase set in 2008). This has made Norwegian energy infrastructure a potential target of Russian sabotage, especially following the explosions that damaged the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. In October 2022, Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere noted that the increased tensions made his country more exposed to threats, intelligence operations, and influence campaigns from Russia. As a result, Norway’s military has been put on heightened alert, focusing less on training and spending more time on active duty. Shortly after a number of prominent Norwegians urged the government to reallocate some of its energy profits to support Ukraine, Oslo committed to donating $7.4 billion, split evenly between humanitarian and military assistance, as part of a five-year package, making Norway one of the largest contributors of aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Nordic level, the five NORDEFCO countries have also signaled their intention to cooperate more closely following the invasion. In a joint statement, the Nordic defense ministers stated that the NORDEDCO Vision 2025 will be updated to reflect the new strategic reality of NATO covering the entire Nordic region. The NORDEFCO Vision 2025 was agreed to in 2018 and aims to make the forum “a platform for close political dialogue, information sharing, and, if possible, coordination of common Nordic positions on possible crisis situations.” Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland have also agreed to significantly deepen cooperation between their air forces, which have a combined 250 fighter jets, in order to develop a strong regional air defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; The most transformative impact of the war in terms of European defense is likely in the Nordic region of Europe. The war has created significant alignment, with Finland and Sweden applying to join NATO and Denmark joining EU military efforts. This will allow for greater defense planning and integration. The announcement that Nordic countries will operate a joint air force, bringing together 250 modern, frontline combat aircraft together, is very significant and likely a prelude of greater regional cooperation. Increasingly, the Nordic states may operate as one, cooperating seamlessly between and across nations. Additionally, given the financial strength of these countries, additional investments will also result in significant military capacity. Greater defense coordination by 2030 will likely also lead to greater defense industrial cooperation as well and efforts to align procurements and create more economies of scale, which will further increase interoperability. The greater focus on defense is also likely durable, as each of the Nordic countries is concerned about the threat posed by Russia. Even so, Spain’s the uncertainty surrounding Spain’s recent elections is not expected to have an effect on defense policy nor undermine Spain’s very robust support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spain&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the NATO alliance, Spain is at the bottom of the table in terms of its defense spending, with a little over 1 percent of its GDP spent on defense, and next to Luxembourg, which is aiming to increase its spending to 0.72 percent by 2024. Announced last June at NATO’s Madrid summit, the country pledged to boost its spending to hit the 2 percent benchmark by 2029 to manage the continent’s higher threat perception vis-à-vis Russia. Shortly after, the Spanish government approved almost €1 billion in defense spending for 2022. To reach NATO’s desired spending target of 2 percent of GDP by 2029, Spain — which has a GDP of a little over €1.7 trillion — would have to double its defense budget from the current €13 billion to €26 billion within the next six years. The announcement sparked a heated debate between the current government’s coalition partners, with the coalition’s junior party, far-left Unidas Podemos, opposing increased defense spending. This led to a delay in approving the country’s 2023 budget, which caused the ruling Socialist Workers Party to concede to their junior partner and add a variety of social benefits alongside the increase in defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Spain’s low defense spending and tensions among the current coalition, the government remains committed to affirming Ukraine in its fight against Russia and championing its future within the European community. The country’s military support to Ukraine has included committing to send 10 Leopard 2A4 tanks following their refurbishment, 20 M113 armored personnel carriers, and 6 HAWK surface-to-air missile launchers. Since the beginning of the invasion, Spain has been actively involved in NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence through the increase in Spanish troops to Ādaži Military Base in Latvia, in addition to its participation in the Baltic Air Policing mission and deployment of several Eurofighter Typhoons to Bulgaria as part of reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically, Spain remains most concerned about the stability of North Africa and security in the Mediterranean. Yet Spanish participation in deterrence and reassurance missions on the eastern flank demonstrates its commitment to the alliance and European security. The question is resources: Spain suffered a deep recession following the 2008 economic crisis and the Greek debt crisis, which took a toll on defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; With economic growth returning to Spain and with the government’s commitment to double defense spending by 2030 and reach the 2 percent goal, Spain’s military will likely be significantly stronger by the end of the decade. However, as with Germany, there are concerns that if attention shifts from the war, political momentum to reach the 2 percent target will diminish. Spain is the fourth-largest economy in the European Union, meaning a doubling of defense spending will significantly strengthen NATO, though Spain will face challenges between investing in readiness and making longer-term acquisitions. Even so, Spain’s the uncertainty surrounding Spain’s recent elections is not expected to have an effect on defense policy nor undermine Spain’s very robust support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy’s robust support for Ukraine reflects that Europe’s broader change in threat perception vis-à-vis Russia has dampened the country’s otherwise powerful pro-Russian voices. The past year of Italian politics has seen the formation of a new government, as Georgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy party, which has its roots in Italy’s far-right movement, rose to power and became prime minister. After former prime minister Mario Draghi’s forceful condemnation of Russia’s aggression and alignment with EU and NATO partners, there were worries within NATO that Meloni, like other Italian far-right voices, could strike an accommodating tone toward the Kremlin that could destabilize the West’s unity and resolve. But Meloni’s stance toward Russia has been surprisingly robust in emphasizing Italy’s commitment to NATO, facilitating substantial military and financial aid to Ukraine, and defanging the most ardent anti-EU voices in her coalition. Rome has thus interpreted the invasion similarly to most of its European peers — as a direct threat to its core security interests — and acted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Draghi and Meloni’s governments have followed through on their tough rhetoric, including through six significant military aid packages to Kyiv. In the months after Russia’s invasion, the previous Draghi administration announced its intention to boost defense spending from the current 1.4 percent of GDP to at least 2.0 percent by 2028, following a trend of growing defense budgets during Draghi’s reign. Spending grew from €26.0 billion in 2020 to €28.3 billion in 2021, while procurement spending grew from €5.5 billion to €6.8 billion during the same period. While not among the leading contributors of military aid to Ukraine, Italy has pledged €700 million through bilateral and EU aid, including the delivery of its SAMP/T air defense system, in collaboration with France. Rome has also allocated over €800 million to take in approximately 168,000 Ukrainian refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recent polls have shown that backing Ukraine is increasingly unpopular among Italians, Meloni has emphasized that she is committed to supporting Kyiv regardless of the negative effects on her government’s approval rating. On the international stage, Meloni has also taken a more assertive diplomatic role in pushing back against Russia, exemplified by recently urging her Indian counterpart to pressure Putin’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy, like Spain, has faced major economic challenges since 2008. There remain concerns about the strength of the Italian economy and Italy’s large debt burden. However, EU investments and positive economic growth will enable Italy to sustain growing defense investments. Italy, with the third-largest economy in the European Union, could therefore significantly bolster the alliance if it makes additional investments. Italy’s strategic focus, like Spain, will often be southward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-union&quot;&gt;The European Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the war has reinvigorated NATO, it has also stimulated EU defense efforts. NATO has played a critical role in deterring Russia and reassuring frontline states. But its role has been more curtailed when it comes to directly aiding Ukraine, in part to avoid playing into the Russian narrative that this is a war between Russia and NATO. This, however, has created space for the European Union to step up in providing substantial military aid to Ukraine. The European Union has spent more than €3.5 billion from the European Peace Facility, a new EU fund for providing security assistance to partners, to backfill member states providing military equipment to Ukraine. The European Union has trained 16,000 Ukrainians on Western equipment and is pushing forward new initiatives such as the European Defense Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act (EDIRPA) to incentivize EU member states to make joint procurements. Likewise, it is also moving forward on an Estonian proposal to make a €1 billion joint procurement of 155-mm ammunition, which would be the first time the European Union has procured military equipment. These actions demonstrate the unity of effort within Europe and the potential ability for the European Union to access funding to incentivize collaboration, support partner countries, and help fill gaps in European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Outlook 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; The European Union has made major advances in defense over the last decade. The history of European integration has shown that once the European Union enters a sector, its role tends to grow. It will likely play an increasing role in joint procurements, research and development, and filling gaps in European defense. The next few years will be key, as the European Union begins to negotiate a new budget for 2027 to 2033. There will likely be significant efforts to increase the budget for EU security assistance (the European Peace Facility), EU training and security missions, and EU defense investment efforts. These efforts are exemplified by the recent proposal to provide an addition €20 billion in military assistance to Ukraine over 4 years via an expanded the European Peace Facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe increasingly has a common outlook. While there are clear differences, especially in the intensity of concern about Russia or security challenges near Europe’s southern flank, there is also a shared sense of solidarity. This has been formed both by working together in NATO and in the European Union, where there is often a shared concern about taking action to protect Europe, whether from Covid-19, a financial crisis, or a security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, what Europe lacks is not so much a unified perspective or strategic outlook — Europe can indeed agree on what amounts to a collective threat to NATO and the European Union. Instead, it lacks the intensity of domestic effort needed to address these challenges. As a result, it suffers from a classic collective-action problem whereby there may be general agreement on a problem but a lack of political drive to take concerted action. For instance, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there was renewed commitment to defense and the goal of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. But the effort and time needed to reach this target varies greatly across Europe. Many Eastern European countries have already surpassed the 2 percent goal, while Spain and Denmark have committed to doing so by 2029 and 2030, respectively. Currently, just 7 of NATO’s 30 members meet the 2 percent target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Europe has significantly increased its defense spending. While it is unlikely that every NATO member will follow through with their defense spending commitments, the shock caused by the war does make it likely that considerable investment will be made over the next few years. As the shock fades, however, and as new challenges and economic issues develop, there will inevitably be competing demands. The key variable is less threat perception and more likely economic growth. This is unlikely to be an era where countries seek a peace dividend. As such, as long as there is economic stability and growth, European defense spending increases will likely prove sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge will be to maximize additional spending to strengthen the alliance. The disaggregated nature of European defense procurement and capability development means that European forces amount to less than the sum of their parts. Lack of coordination in procurement also means that European forces tend to operate different types of equipment, making it more difficult to deploy, operate, and fight together. This makes operating together difficult. Thus, the United States and NATO should make a major effort to encourage greater European defense cooperation and integration. European defense ministries struggle to work together when it comes to procurement and force integration, as there are strong vested and parochial interests involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and the European Union have increasingly helped forge a common strategic outlook and shared threat perceptions. The next step is using that shared outlook and framework to overcome bureaucratic barriers to increase defense cooperation. The Nordic countries will likely lead the way in demonstrating the benefits of cooperation, especially regionally. The European Union will likely provide significant funding and attention for integrating defense industrial efforts that enhance interoperability and create greater economies of scale. This will hopefully mean the increase in defense investment will also give Europeans greater value for their defense spending, which should, by 2030, lead to a dramatically strengthened NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing in the context of the war against Ukraine is that we could have seen the temptation of most of the EU member states to focus on only their immediate neighborhood . . . [but] we have all those which are feeling the immediate danger from Russia — Baltic states, Poland, and so on — they are telling us also where we should not underestimate what’s happening in the Global South.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natos-evolving-threat-landscape-and-ability-to-respond&quot;&gt;NATO’s Evolving Threat Landscape and Ability to Respond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark F. Cancian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has profoundly shaken European views of their security and engendered a series of evaluations regarding European defense capabilities. This paper explores five questions that drive these revised views and re-evaluations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected the threat landscape in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will NATO sustain a strengthened defense effort?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the main capability gaps for European militaries?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What types of military operations are European states able (and unable) to perform effectively independent of the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should the United States balance its interests in Europe with those in other regions, including the Indo-Pacific?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conducting this assessment, the paper focuses on NATO, including prospective member state Sweden, since NATO now comprises nearly all of Europe outside the Russian Federation and its allies. Thus, except in specialized circumstances, non-NATO European countries can be excluded, being either neutral (Switzerland, Austria, and Ireland), weak and internally focused (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, and Kosovo), incompatible with NATO security policies (Belarus and Serbia), or at war (Ukraine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-how-has-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-affected-the-threat-landscape-in-europe&quot;&gt;1. How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected the threat landscape in Europe?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has produced three changes in the threat landscape in Europe: (1) a psychological shock that war in Europe is possible, (2) a near-term scramble to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank against possible Russian moves, and (3) a long-term effort to rebuild defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Only the dead have seen the end of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;plato&quot;&gt;Plato&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been over 70 years since European powers have fought each other. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was thus a profound shock to a Europe that had come to believe that war was obsolete, irrational, and economically unsustainable. As Dakota Wood, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and scholar at the Heritage Foundation put it, “In a violent refutation of aphorisms such as ‘modern states don’t make war on each other,’ ‘major countries are too economically interdependent to risk going to war,’ and ‘the costs of becoming an international pariah state are too high,’ Russian president Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dismissals of war have deep roots. For example, Norman Angell, an English journalist, argued before World War I that “War belongs to a stage of development out of which we have passed; that the commerce and industry of the people no longer depend upon the expansion of its political frontiers. . . . In short, war, even when victorious, can no longer achieve those aims for which people strive.” Many have picked up this theme more recently. For example, President Obama often referred to the arc of history bending toward peace: “The trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence, more tolerance, less strife, less poverty.” The 2022 invasion of Ukraine reminded the world that states rarely go to war based solely on rational calculations of gain and loss. Instead, as Thucydides observed 2,500 years ago, they are driven by fear, honor, and interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the end of the Cold War and the resulting Pax Americana produced great benefits for democratic governance and economic prosperity but dulled alertness about threats to peace. The stable national security environment seemed destined to continue indefinitely. However, as prolific scholar Richard Betts noted in his analysis of surprise attacks: “War involves discontinuity — an aberration or divergence from normal,” so it is hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEAR-TERM REINFORCEMENT OF EUROPE’S EASTERN FLANK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war loomed, the Baltic and Eastern European countries were terrified that the Russians would roll through Ukraine and into their homelands. It had happened before — to Poland in 1920–1921 and to Poland, Romania, and the Baltic countries in 1939 and again in 1944. The United States and other NATO countries rushed 32,000 troops to the east in response. Of these, the United States sent about 24,000 troops. These reinforcements added to U.S. forces already in Europe, bringing the total to 100,000 permanently stationed and rotational. Though that number has declined over time, their presence continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deployments have strengthened intentions to establish a permanent U.S. presence in Eastern Europe. A permanent presence would signal a long-term commitment, though the upfront costs of building a major base are high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other NATO countries have also reinforced the Eastern European members. The United Kingdom sent forces to Estonia and Poland, the French and Belgians sent forces to Romania, and the Germans sent a small force to Lithuania. Collectively, 22 NATO nations have sent 10,232 troops. NATO activated defense plans for the NATO response force, but it did not deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONG-TERM STRENGTHENING OF EUROPEAN DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the war in Ukraine turns out, Russia’s military forces have been badly damaged. Rebuilding this capability will take many years. As the annual threat assessment of Office of the Director of National Intelligence concludes, “Moscow’s military forces have suffered losses during the Ukraine conflict that will require years of rebuilding and leave them less capable of posing a conventional military threat to European security, and operating as assertively in Eurasia and on the global stage.” This gives Europe a window of opportunity for making defense investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Central and Eastern European countries have begun rebuilding by shipping their old Soviet-era equipment to Ukraine and arranging to buy NATO-standard equipment as a replacement. This has been a win-win: Ukraine gets equipment it is familiar with, and the Eastern Europeans get equipment that is more capable and integrates them more fully into NATO. The United States is helping with the financing of this action. Although the new equipment will take years to arrive off production lines, the result will substantially modernize the Central and Eastern members of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-will-nato-sustain-a-strengthened-defense-effort&quot;&gt;2. Will NATO sustain a strengthened defense effort?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense rebuilding process is well underway but will need to be sustained for many years. That rebuilding began at the 2014 Wales summit, where NATO, impelled by Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine, set a goal of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. The declaration has had an effect, with overall alliance spending increasing steadily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ii5pNhH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten states now meet the 2 percent target goal. Member states on NATO’s eastern flank, in particular — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia — have been aggressive in meeting and, in some cases, exceeding the goal. The United States, United Kingdom, Croatia, and Greece also meet the goal. Secretary General Stoltenberg has expressed confidence about future gains: “Nineteen allies have clear plans to reach it by 2024, and an additional five have concrete commitments to meet it, thereafter.” Still, two thirds of NATO members, 21 states, fall short of the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QPhXlep.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that not all countries are equal in terms of military spending. As Figure 3 illustrates, the top three — the United Kingdom, Germany, and France — account for 52 percent of all non-U.S. NATO spending, so examining these three countries is key. All three have pledged to improve their military capabilities, though some of these improved capabilities will not appear until the 2030s or even the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G7NGeSK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom has announced a large budget increase of £5–6 billion over two years and an aspiration to spend 2.5 percent of GDP on defense. This pledge falls under the Integrated Review Refresh 2023, a national defense strategy update commissioned to incorporate lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, revitalize security relations with Europe, and redefine how the United Kingdom should deal with the threat of China. However, military budgets will need to compete with other UK priorities, such as climate change and international development, and the forces will get smaller, with the army declining to 72,500, according to the 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s defense effort has lagged since the end of the Cold War, amounting to about 1.2 percent of GDP during most of that period. In recent years, it has increased that percentage to 1.4 percent and its defense budget by 25 percent. Although 1.4 percent of GDP is low compared with other major NATO countries, the large size of Germany’s economy means that this effort produces Europe’s second-largest military budget. Thus, despite frustrations with perceived inadequacies of Germany’s military efforts, Germany’s national security policy matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, Germany announced that it would increase military spending to 2 percent of GDP, including creation of a €100 billion investment fund. Although there is little change in the FY 2023 budget, the FY 2024 budget will reportedly include a €10 billion increase — a 20 percent jump, if implemented. However, turning dramatic announcements into budget realities is difficult in an environment of expensive domestic programs and after half a century of Ostpolitik — Germany’s long-standing outreach to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France completed its Strategic Update 2021, which identifies three continuing threats: jihadist terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, and the return of strategic competition between great powers. It pledges continued increases in its defense budget consistent with the 2019–2025 Military Planning Law and scolds other nations for not spending enough on defense: “Were Europeans to make further major cutbacks in their budgets, they would deal a fatal blow to the most fragile militaries and to Europe’s capacity for collective action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending has been fairly criticized as an inadequate indicator, leaving out important qualitative indicators such as military readiness and force deployability. Nevertheless, military capabilities ultimately depend on resources and, hence, adequate budgets. With militaries, as with many other things in life, you get what you pay for, so discussion about capability must begin with resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We backed ourselves into something that’s a numerical target [spending 2 percent of GDP on defense] that I think is becoming increasingly weaponized as a way to say allies aren’t worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-what-are-the-main-capability-gaps-for-european-militaries&quot;&gt;3. What are the main capability gaps for European militaries?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Europe has all the military forces that it needs to provide for its own security, even without the United States. The challenge is low readiness and lagging modernization. As a result, European military capabilities are less than sheer numbers might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENERATING MILITARY CAPABILITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 lays out the basic elements of military capability: force structure, modernization, and readiness. Effective militaries need to maintain all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force structure is the size and composition of forces. Larger forces can handle more operations but are expensive to maintain because of personnel and operational costs. Readiness determines whether units can do what they were designed to do. For example, can artillery units move, shoot, and communicate? Readiness allows rapid and effective operations but is highly perishable because of troop turnover. Readiness must thus be rebuilt every year. Sustainability — the ability to operate effectively over a length of time — is typically rolled into readiness, though some analysts consider it separate. Modernization is the development and procurement of new equipment, which provides increased capabilities. It is easy to defer when money is tight, but doing so eventually results in an obsolescent military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fdk5Zeg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

Bond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Table 2 compares (1) European NATO, (2) European NATO plus members of the European Union who are not members of NATO, and (3) Russia, Europe’s primary security challenge. The table uses personnel as an overall measure and one key measure for ground (tanks), air (fighter-attack aircraft), and naval forces (battle force ships). In every category, European NATO has overwhelming advantages compared to Russia, which has suffered large equipment losses in the last year. Adding the non-NATO EU members provides a small amount of additional capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hcTVkeH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Illustrative Comparison of European NATO, NATO and European Union, and Russian Forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: International Institute for Security Studies (IISS), Military Balance 2023 (London: IISS, 2023).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the 40 percent decline in NATO forces after the Cold War is not the primary impediment to European military operations. Europe has enough force size to provide substantial security if those forces were ready, modernized, and deployable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readiness:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Kingdom and France maintain forces with relatively high readiness because of their global interests. Other NATO countries have maintained at least some force elements at relatively high readiness. Janes highlights the four Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden — as “well-equipped, highly professional, and [having] trained citizen reserve forces that are capable of short-notice mobilization and integration with regular forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key problem is that readiness is difficult to measure. Experts in the United States have debated for decades about whether to take a resources approach (e.g., do units have all the equipment and personnel they need?) or a capability approach (e.g., can the unit do its wartime mission?). In theory, capability is best since it captures output, but it is difficult to measure consistently, continuously, and across the entire institution. As a result, the U.S. readiness measurement system, called the Defense Readiness Reporting System, focuses on resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike for budgets and modernization, NATO has no formal system for measuring readiness either by resources or by mission capability. Nevertheless, various studies and analyses have provided important insights. For example, FOI, a Swedish think tank, assessed the readiness of NATO forces and found deficiencies in command relationships, transportation, and strategic mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased spending might ease some of the problems identified in the Swedish report, but others are less susceptible to financial fixes. For example, physically moving forces around Europe is difficult: existing road and rail infrastructure is not sufficient to support the weight of heavy military equipment, and there are legal and bureaucratic impediments to moving military equipment with respect to diplomatic clearance, transportation safety regulations, and differing ammunition transport standards between countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 US Army study lamented that the “reality is that it is extremely difficult to provide sustainment to exercises and forces deployed into Eastern Europe and the Baltic regions due to cumbersome and time-consuming requirements to gain diplomatic and security clearances for convoys.” The report estimates that it takes two months for deployment from Fort Riley, Kansas, to Zagan, Poland, and five weeks for equipment to travel from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotes abound about the readiness, frequently the low readiness, of NATO military forces. For example, in 2001, the EU Court of Justice ruled that militaries must abide by civilian workforce rules that limit workweeks to 35 hours when conducting peacetime training. Some countries, such as Germany, already apply such rules. While such rules may enhance servicemember protection, they reflect a lack of urgency and constitute major barriers to achieving high readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s problems are particularly severe. Helmut Kohl captured the national mood in 1997 when he said, “For the first time, Germany is surrounded only by friends and partners at all its borders. The peace of our country is more secure than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Germany has in effect built a mobilization military that requires 6 to 12 months to be ready for any major operation. For example, only 130 of its 300 Leopard tanks are operational. Its army chief of staff complained publicly about the lack of readiness when Germany had to deploy forces at the beginning of the war. The report by FOI noted that Germany suffers from a lack of equipment. Its capability to “marshal and deploy heavy . . . formations of brigade size is low.” Movement of the German Very High-Readiness Joint Task Force brigade from Munster to Zagan, Poland, takes approximately 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s readiness challenges are not the most serious in NATO, as many other countries have severe readiness problems. However, because Germany’s forces are the third-largest (behind France and Turkey), the unreadiness of its armed forces is a major challenge for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernization:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO has taken a budget approach to measuring modernization, setting a goal at the 2014 Wales summit that modernization spending should be at least 20 percent of a nation’s military budget. The idea is that personnel and operations costs should not squeeze out modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four European NATO countries now meet this goal, up from seven in 2014. Eastern European countries in particular have been on a procurement binge. Poland has signed billions of dollars’ worth of contracts for tanks, fighters, artillery, munitions, and air defense from the United States and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are many challenges for European defense industry, including small production lots and inefficiency, the increased spending is a positive step that, over time, will ease the problem of obsolescence in European NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-what-types-of-military-operations-are-european-states-able-and-unable-to-perform-effectively-independently-of-the-united-states&quot;&gt;4. What types of military operations are European states able (and unable) to perform effectively independently of the United States?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, non-U.S. NATO countries have enough forces to conduct independent operations, and though budgets are still recovering from post-Cold War lows, they are nevertheless substantial. The challenges are leadership and capability. The bottom line is that Europeans are severely constrained without the United States but can do a lot with U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the beginning of the alliance, there has been tension between the United States, the largest and most powerful NATO member, and the Europeans, who collectively are as wealthy and field large military forces. The compromise has been that a U.S. officer commands NATO forces as the supreme allied commander, while a European heads the political side as secretary general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French, in particular, have never been comfortable with this arrangement, constantly looking for structures that would exclude the United States and give Europeans, especially France, a larger role. However, the Europeans have never been able to step up to major combat operations without U.S. leadership. Operations such as support to Libyan rebels (Unified Protector) offered an opportunity for the Europeans to lead. The level of combat was low, the adversary was weak, and the area of operations was nearby, yet this still required U.S. and NATO leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS scholar Max Bergmann argues that the war in Ukraine should be Europe’s moment to come together on defense, but he concludes, “The United States has demonstrated its indispensability to European security and confirmed Europe’s dependence on Washington. European leaders have seemingly accepted this as the natural state of affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, then, a fact of life: the United States, alone or through NATO, will lead any major military operation. The good news is that with that leadership, Europe can execute a wide variety of operations, such as counterinsurgency and peacekeeping in Iraq and Afghanistan; peace support operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, and Kosovo; counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean; counterterrorism in the Mediterranean; operations to protect civilians and counter the Ghaddafi regime in Libya; and, recently, the wide variety of deterrence measures in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; The second problem is a lack of relevant military capabilities. The non-U.S. NATO members produce good capabilities for crisis response, small contingencies, and security cooperation, conducting many such missions since the end of the Cold War. Many countries sent forces to Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan for peacekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, capabilities are severely limited for large-scale operations. One limitation comes from the low level of past modernization. The United States has forces that are survivable in high-threat environments and the command-and-control mechanisms to lead complex, multi-domain, and widely dispersed operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has recognized these limitations and sought to overcome them, for example, with the NATO Readiness Initiative, which sets a goal of “four 30s” — 30 infantry battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval ships, all available in 30 days. In June 2022, NATO laid out a new force model, over 100,000 troops in up to 10 days, 200,000 troops in 10 to 30 days, and at least 500,000 troops between 30 and 180 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for many years NATO has had difficulty deploying even small forces. For example, NATO, which fielded 40 divisions (about 360 combat battalions) in Northern Europe during the Cold War, strained to stand up four battlegroups in the Baltic states. As a CSIS study on NATO concluded, “We assess that European states are likely to face significant challenges conducting large-scale combat missions, particularly in such areas as heavy maneuver forces, naval combatants, and support capabilities like logistics and fire support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related problem is that more distant occur from NATO territory, the more difficult they are. The United Kingdom and France maintain some expeditionary capabilities because of their continuing global interests. However, the United States’ capability for expeditionary operations dwarfs those of non-U.S. NATO members. Table 3 compares airlift capabilities, which is a useful indicator of the ability to deploy and sustain forces for expeditionary operations. The systems counted are heavy and medium cargo aircraft that can transport troops and matériel over long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ substantial advantage here is not surprising given that it must cross oceans and typically travel thousands of miles to reach areas of operations. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the United States will have major capabilities in an area where Europeans will struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the United States has used these strategic mobility capabilities to support other NATO countries when needed. Thus, U.S. aircraft have moved allied troops to participate in operations in places from Bosnia to Afghanistan. While Europe’s capabilities may be severely limited without the United States, they can bring substantial capabilities to bear with U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 illustrates the bad news. The Europeans might have as much funding collectively as the United States, but no state individually can come close to the U.S. budget and all the different capabilities that budget can buy. Unless the Europeans fully integrate their defense effort and operate as a single entity, they will never be able to match the breadth and depth of U.S. capabilities. Although operating as a single entity sounds attractive in theory, it means that each country’s military will be unsuited for national policy purposes and only viable in the context of international operations. That represents a loss of sovereignty that few countries will be willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-how-should-the-united-states-balance-its-interests-in-europe-and-those-in-other-regions-including-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;5. How should the United States balance its interests in Europe and those in other regions, including the Indo-Pacific?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a major strategic debate in the United States. On the one hand, the National Security Strategy (NSS) and National Defense Strategy (NDS) seek to focus U.S. attention on the Pacific. They identify China as the “pacing” challenge, which implies prioritization over other regions. As the 2022 NDS says, “the most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region in the international system to suit its interests in authoritarian preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, these same documents recognize broader challenges. The NSS states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia poses an immediate and ongoing threat to the regional security order in Europe, and it is a source of disruption and instability globally. . . . Iran interferes in the internal affairs of neighbors, proliferates missiles and drones through proxies, is plotting to harm Americans, including former officials. . . . The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to expand its illicit nuclear weapons and missile programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both documents link U.S. security to allies and partners. The NDS is emphatic, “Close collaboration with Allies and partners is foundational for U.S. security interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rising defense budget might accomplish both goals — a focus on China and global commitments — but neither the Trump administration in its later years nor the Biden administration have been willing to make that commitment. In every year since 2018, including the recently released FY 2024 budget proposal, administrations have projected flat constant dollar budgets into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That forces trade-offs, as illustrated in Figure 6. A force focused on a great power conflict with China will have different characteristics than one focused on global commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rE3TgXW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Characteristics of China-Focused and Global-Focused Forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Trump and Biden administrations have ignored this tension. They have articulated robust strategies without the resources to fully implement them and thus allowed a strategy-resources gap to open up — “a troubling disconnect between the administration’s stated priorities and its conduct,” argues Kori Schake, a director at the American Enterprise Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some strategists, such as Elbridge Colby, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, would shrink the strategy to fit the resources. He unabashedly calls for focus on the Pacific and leaving Europe, including Ukraine, to the Europeans. Others, particularly conservative commentators, would increase resources to meet the strategy. Thus, John Ferrari, Elaine McCusker, and Mackenzie Eaglen from the American Enterprise Institute and Tom Spoehr from the Heritage Foundation call for higher defense budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense hawks have been winning the budget battle for the last several years. In the FY 2023 budget, they added $45 billion above what the administration requested. There were similarly large congressional increases in FY 2020 to FY 2022. Whether this will continue is unclear. Deficit hawks in the Republican Party have regained strength and, with the Republicans now a majority in the House, may be able to push budget policy in that direction. This would return the national security budget environment to the days of sequestration, where efforts by deficit hawks to cut government spending entailed deep defense cuts as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also fundamental disagreements about strategy. the progressive left and populist right have embraced versions of a national security concept called “restraint.” As Professor Barry Posen of MIT describes it in his seminal book, Restraint, the United States should “focus on a small number of threats and approach these threats with subtlety and moderation. . . . The United States will need to give up some objectives. The relationship with Europe must be transformed entirely.” Posen concludes that, after decades of “cheap riding,” the Europeans should take charge of their own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These differing viewpoints will play out in the FY 2024 budget deliberations. If defense hawks can continue their large defense budget increases, then the strategy-resources gap will shrink and the U.S. role in the world will continue. However, if populist forces in the House can use the unstable Republican majority to their advantage, then the current strategy may become untenable. In this case, many strategists would likely push to cut forces and resources dedicated to Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere in order to focus on the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pivoting-to-production-europes-defense-industrial-opportunity&quot;&gt;Pivoting to Production? Europe’s Defense Industrial Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg Sanders and Nicholas Velazquez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent transfers of a variety of military capabilities in support of Ukraine’s defense have severely taxed the inventories of the transatlantic alliance. The need to recapitalize inventories has presented challenges in the United States, with the munitions supply chain challenge being identified as a concern even before the start of the war. For European NATO countries, this challenge is compounded by the difficulty of giving a clear demand signal to a fragmented industrial base as well as disagreements between major producers and frontline states. However, the legacy of fragmentation also provides an opportunity. The European industrial base has suffered from underinvestment but does have slack capacity that, if faced with a clear demand signal and if resilience can be added to supply chains, could increase alliance production capacity. This potential leads to an important policy question: to what extent are EU institutions and coordination efforts a desirable and viable way to increase production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has sought to increase the capability European NATO members can contribute by promoting greater spending by European powers, building interoperability through NATO, expanding arms exports, and encouraging bilateral or multilateral collaboration. EU policies toward the United States are informed by concerns of ensuring strategic autonomy as an alliance, which can mean that close allies such as the United States, Norway, and a post-Brexit United Kingdom are excluded from institutional initiatives. To cast light on these issues, this chapter examines data on defense production budgets, collaboration, and arms trade among EU and European NATO members to address the following questions about whether the EU pivot to production may provide a useful, complementary role to NATO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To what extent did EU countries build production capability after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and what limitations did European defense integration still face at the onset of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To what extent have EU institutions, in cooperation with NATO, overcome these limitations?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In what sectors are EU and European NATO countries capable of producing exports today and to what extent is the trade within the European Union and NATO?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would a greater EU role in production be a desirable and viable way to support transatlantic security needs?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the U.S. role in European security factor into European defense integration?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are salient because Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent war have strengthened concerns about supply chain health and production capacity. For the European Union, pivoting to a growing emphasis on collaborative production will be politically challenging. However, the necessary work to overcome these challenges is justified by the need to defend against a diminished but still dangerous Russia that has exacerbated legitimate security concerns across the continent. A long-term agenda of collaborative projects will take decades to deliver and must be balanced against cooperative efforts that address near-term security gaps collectively identified by EU and NATO nations, which further complicates cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several NATO member states are seeking to recapitalize all manner of military platforms donated to Ukraine. Answering this demand signal will be difficult because the production timeline for new systems can be more than a year. European NATO members are seeking to rebuild arsenals with interoperable systems to deter or effectively handle future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on these time frames, building additional capacity is expensive, especially for an industrial base, such as in the United States, where slack has been squeezed out of the system to save costs. Europe’s industrial base is robust enough to produce capabilities in a variety of sectors for the export market. However, this often results in skipping past the expanding needs of the European market. At the margins, the most affordable place to bolster production capacity for meeting the range of transatlantic needs will often be beyond U.S. borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the European Defense Agency (EDA) has identified industrial fragmentation as a major problem in European defense, shown by a proliferation in the number of systems. A 2017 McKinsey analysis based on reporting from the International Institute for Strategic Studies found that in selected categories EDA members had 178 different versions of weapons systems, compared to only 30 variations in the United States. This trend is consistent when applied to main battle tanks, destroyers and frigates, and fighter planes, where the duplication of EU systems is far more prevalent than in the United States. Such variation poses a variety of logistics, industrial, and operational challenges for both European governments and industry. Speaking at the 2023 Global Security Conference at CSIS, Vice Admiral Hervé Bléjean, director general of the EU Military Staff, referenced the diverse nature of EU systems, stating “it’s not a good business model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within systems compatible with NATO standardization agreements, this leads to logistic and sustainment costs and challenges and can pose interoperability burdens. A key factor behind this variety is that the European defense industrial base has a significant role for firms that serve as “national champions” — a prime firm with significant market share and that is central to that nation’s defense industrial base. These national champions produce distinct product lines for their respective states for similar capabilities. The home markets for these national champions, even when augmented by exports, are shaped by national defense budgets that often order insufficient unit counts to move down the learning curve and achieve the economies of scale seen in the integrated United States. Collaborative programs offer a possible solution to this problem by pooling resources for larger orders but are often stymied when workshare is primarily allotted by national cost share and not industrial efficiency considerations. However, consortiums such as Airbus and MBDA Incorporated can mitigate these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European integration is required to achieve efficiencies in developing economies of scale in defense industrial production as well as addressing the challenges of supporting Ukraine, which has developed a force with a variety of platforms where interchangeability is a challenge for both former Soviet and Western equipment. The importance of production is by no means exclusive to the European theater. The vision of production diplomacy put forward by U.S. DOD under secretary for defense acquisition and sustainment Bill LaPlante encompasses the occasionally competing needs of the Indo-Pacific region raised in Figure 6. However, U.S. policy has been ambiguous toward EU ambitions to become a locus of production and interchangeability, and skeptics raise reasonable questions about the feasibility of further progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter will explore the potential for greater EU-NATO complementarity as a partial answer to these problems and to address where a pivot to production could have the necessary preconditions. This chapter’s analysis will largely focus on the interplay between the EU and NATO on revitalizing Europe’s defense industrial base through an exploration of the EU’s efforts to develop European defense industrial collaboration through several union-level initiatives. As a result, this analysis will not deeply discuss the role of non-EU European states such as the United Kingdom or Norway. Within the context of EU initiatives, these states are treated on a case-by-case basis owing to these states’ relations with Brussels. The United Kingdom, second only to the United States in its security assistance to Ukraine, remains an important pillar of European security whose role in European defense integration merits unique analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of recapitalization that is necessary puts an emphasis on ensuring that funds expended yield the greatest payoff possible. Increased integration of requirements and production would mean that learning-curve efficiencies in manufacturing would yield greater outputs for investments than separate requirements and production approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time of rising budgets, what European national champions and multinational consortiums can achieve within Europe or with the United States drives the politics behind European defense integration. A simple comparison of U.S. defense research and development (R&amp;amp;D) spending, approaching €90 billion, with EDA members’ cumulative R&amp;amp;D spending, €9 billion, demonstrates that Europe will have to strategically allocate resources to keep pace with the United States. For example, Europe is more focused on investing in production; EDA members spent little over €39 billion in procurement, compared to €119.0 billion for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-how-and-to-what-extent-did-eu-countries-build-defense-capability-after-russias-annexation-of-crimea-and-what-limitations-did-european-defense-integration-still-face-at-the-onset-of-russias-2022-invasion-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;1. How and to what extent did EU countries build defense capability after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and what limitations did European defense integration still face at the onset of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clearest source of evidence for Europe’s increased contribution to alliance production is the rising defense spending seen in the period after Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, as shown in Figure 7. Every country in the EDA increased its spending from 2014 to 2021 in real terms (Figures 7, 8, and 11 are in 2015 constant euros). Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, and Slovakia grew by double-digit compound annual growth rates (CAGRs). The largest gains in constant 2015 absolute spending were in Germany (€11.2 billion), Italy (€7.2 billion), France (€4.9 billion), and Poland (€4.3 billion). Baltic nations and Central and Eastern Europe grew fastest, with CAGRs of 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively. However, while those countries closer to Russia were the biggest drivers of new spending, it was a notable shift that all of Europe was now moving in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by the cessation of reporting for the United Kingdom in Figure 2, Brexit, which was formally completed in 2020, was a complicating factor in the post-2014 period. The United Kingdom remains a central player in NATO but has exited the key EU institutions discussed below and has yet to complete a larger agreement on security with the European Union that will shape its future cooperation. Although it has left the European Union, the United Kingdom remains a force for transatlantic cooperation (see Figure 9) and has further expanded its relationship with the United States by entering the AUKUS treaty, which includes Australia. While Brexit resulted in the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union Common Security and Defence Policy, it has also meant that European defense does not have to contend with UK vetoes on institutional initiatives. This departure may have contributed to the flurry of institutional activity described below. According to NATO data, in constant 2015 pounds, UK defense spending grew from £40.1 billion in 2014 to an estimated £46 billion in 2021, a CAGR of 2.0 percent. This growth in constant pounds continued to an estimated nearly £46.8 billion in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increase in EDA member spending was accompanied by EU members building institutions to encourage greater collaboration. The EU processes at the forefront of European defense integration are the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) program and the European Defence Fund (EDF). These programs made considerable progress in the post-2014 period but have not yet bent the curve on procurement collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PESCO: BINDING DEFENSE COOPERATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PESCO is a framework that was formed in December 2017 to foster defense cooperation among participating EU member states and further Europe’s strategic autonomy. Though EU member states can either opt in or out of PESCO, the states which signed onto the framework are bound to the institution’s commitments. PESCO’s ratification in 2017 followed concern in Europe, specifically in France and Germany, that the United States’ consistency as a security guarantor may be shaken due to domestic U.S. politics. As a result, PESCO reflects Europe’s drive to pursue strategic autonomy by spending more and with fewer redundancies. The 2008 Treaty on European Union legally enshrined permanent structured cooperation for European defense, with the vision for each member state to “proceed more intensively to develop its defense capacities” and demonstrate the ability to sustain armed forces which can act on a national or a multinational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these objectives, the 2008 Treaty on European Union urged member states to “bring their defense apparatus into line with each other,” to “take concrete measures to enhance the availability, interoperability, flexibility and deployability of their forces,” and to participate in the “development of major bilateral or European equipment programmes.” These goals would eventually form the basis of PESCO nearly a decade after the objectives were legally articulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PESCO’s authorities have been expanded to include non-EU members due to the transatlantic implications of PESCO’s military mobility project. Interest from Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States eventually culminated in the European Union amending PESCO’s regulations to allow non-EU states to participate in select projects. Gradually, these non-EU states were admitted into the military mobility project, with the United Kingdom’s inclusion announced in November 2022. The participation of the United States in this PESCO project was a victory for EU-NATO cooperation, but it also introduced delays due to the challenges of an internal framework being applied to outsiders, especially the United States, which required an administrative agreement. Furthermore, Washington’s alliances across EU member states did not negate concerns that an increase in U.S. involvement could lead to U.S. defense industry prime contractors playing a dominant role later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, PESCO pursues its objectives and mandates by managing joint European defense projects that complement existing efforts across the European defense ecosystem, including the EDF and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence. Specifically, PESCO projects are financed by the EDF, whose FY 2021–FY 2027 budget amounts to €7.9 billion. Though PESCO predates the EDF, its projects were always meant to be funded by the EDF. However, member states also play a significant role in financing these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The European Defence Fund: Mitigating Risk in Collaborative European R&amp;amp;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fostering and sustaining an indigenous defense innovation ecosystem in Europe is a strategic imperative for the European Union. The European Commission established the EDF on April 29, 2021, to integrate Europe’s defense market by financing investments in the joint R&amp;amp;D of defense products. In its establishment of the EDF, the European Commission argued that the rising costs of defense products should be addressed at the EU level to increase defense cooperation between member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EDF is backed by an €8 billion budget from 2021 to 2027 and is explicitly meant to support select multinational European programs through the R&amp;amp;D phase of defense contracting. In parallel, the current focus of NATO collaborative efforts is the Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) initiative, which was founded in 2021 to help the alliance solve emerging technology challenges through alliance-wide competition programs. DIANA declared its initial operating capability at NATO’s Vilnius summit in July 2023. However, the focus of DIANA is developing emerging technologies, ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum-enabled technology, that will lay the groundwork for future innovation but that are less relevant to the present procurement problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While focused on R&amp;amp;D, the EDF supports later stages of development than DIANA and has greater funding than the NATO-managed $1 billion innovation fund. Within this €8 billion budget, the EDF spent €1.2 billion and €924 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The EDF will finance up to 80 percent of R&amp;amp;D and technology finalization expenses for select European defense programs as well as maintain flexibility to finance indirect costs. This financing mechanism is aimed at minimizing contractor risk and addressing suboptimal investment challenges within the European defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualifying for the EDF requires applicants to meet specific requirements. The most important disclaimer is that the EDF will only finance consortiums consisting of at least three independent European defense firms operating in at least three different member states. As a result, the EDF is intended to encourage competition within the European defense industrial base — but also may deter consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically, the European Commission argues that the EDF will “contribute to the Union’s strategic autonomy by supporting cross-border cooperation between Member-States.” As a result, in the legislation establishing the EDF, there are provisions to restrict the financing of projects which fall under foreign export controls in a bid to maintain Brussels’ fiscal control over these projects. The EDF will only finance actions where information “needed to carry out the action is not subject to any restriction by a non-associated third country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a strategic challenge for several EU member states that are attempting to align their national defense industrial needs with the U.S. defense industrial base or other non-EU states such as Norway and the United Kingdom. Eastern European member states remain interested in divesting legacy Soviet-era equipment by transferring it to Ukraine. The United States has offered some aid for countries replacing such equipment with U.S. systems, and countries on NATO’s eastern flank are highly motivated to reinforce U.S. engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE DIFFICULTY OF TRANSLATING FUNDING INTO COLLABORATIVE OUTCOMES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s “2022 Coordinated Annual Review on Defence” acknowledged that only “modest” progress on defense collaboration has been observed. The bigger picture for budgets within EDA nations has been one of growth since 2014 for procurement spending but stagnation for R&amp;amp;D when considered in constant euros. The EDA’s focus has traditionally been on the early stages of projects, in part because collaboration is easier to initiate at the front end and can have spending implications for many years thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mXCIcV2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: Procurement Spending and Collaboration of European Defense Agency Members, 2005–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Polish reporting of 100 percent collaborative procurement in 2017–2020 is treated as unlabeled. Source: “DataWeb,” EDA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 8, procurement spending by EDA nations grew dramatically from 2014 to 2021, increasing in 2015 constant euros from €26.9 billion to €39.4 billion, a CAGR of 5.6 percent. The CAGR increases to 11 percent if it excludes the departing United Kingdom. Across the seven years, all countries in the EDA increased their individual procurement spending, with France responsible for the smallest increase, only 0.3 percent CAGR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characterizing the change in collaborative spending is a more difficult endeavor due to data quality challenges. Only 17 of the 27 EDA countries engaged in collaborative spending that they reported from 2005 to 2021. Furthermore, from 2018 to 2021, EDA data on procurement spending does not include the United Kingdom, following their departure from the European Union. Missing data on collaboration, shown in the gray bars in Figure 8, has been a widespread problem, although one that was ameliorated as four major procurement spenders began reporting again in 2021. Starting in 2011, before the gap in German reporting, total EDA collaborative spending in constant 2015 euros grew from €8.8 billion to €9.0 billion, a 0.3 percent CAGR or a 4 percent CAGR if excluding the United Kingdom. Spain, Belgium, Italy, and France had the largest growth in collaborative spending in absolute terms, and with the exception of France, much of this growth occurred in non-EU nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration within the European Union fell slightly between 2011 and 2021, decreasing by a 1.2 percent CAGR, though this rises to an increasing 2.0 percent CAGR if one excludes the United Kingdom. This fall may be reversed as EDF programs make their way into procurement. However, it is a disappointing outcome, as even with PESCO’s encouragement, collaborative spending did not keep up with overall procurement and in some cases sunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For R&amp;amp;D, France and the United Kingdom were the two highest spenders between 2005 and 2017, but their spending on collaborative programs was vastly different. In constant 2015 euros, France spent €110.8 million on collaborative research and technology (R&amp;amp;T) in 2017, while the United Kingdom only spent €0.5 million. The EDA only tracks collaboration spending within R&amp;amp;T, which for France and the United Kingdom only includes 20.1 and 17.1 percent of their R&amp;amp;D spending, respectively. When excluding the United Kingdom and Germany for inconsistent data, total EDA collaborative R&amp;amp;T spending in constant 2015 euros rose from €185 million in 2014 to €224 million in 2021, a CAGR of 2.8 percent, which is a steady pace of growth but slower than the 10.3 percent CAGR for R&amp;amp;T overall. Unlike procurement, less than 10 percent of this collaboration takes place with countries outside of Europe. For comparison, the CAGR for all R&amp;amp;T spending for 2014 to 2021 was 3.9 percent, excluding Germany and the United Kingdom. Beyond the top spending nations, Poland, whose growing defense capabilities have been a focus of this paper, experienced a 30 percent CAGR in R&amp;amp;T collaboration between 2014 and 2021. Estonia increased its spending on collaborative R&amp;amp;T in constant 2015 euros from €180,000 in 2014 to €580,000 in 2021, a 17 percent CAGR, though from an admittedly low baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to R&amp;amp;T collaboration, European states further cooperate through arms sales. As a result, imports, shown in Figure 9, can be an important signal of the shape and level of cooperation and can be used to identify opportunities for industrial integration. Importing from the United States can be a sign of transatlantic cooperation, while importing from the European Union can be a step toward closer European integration. Other NATO members include the United Kingdom (post-Brexit), Norway, Turkey, and Canada, though the first two have a notable but complicated role in European industrial integration discussions. Europe also buys from international producers, which complicates painting a simple picture of competition between U.S.-led and European-led efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As depicted in Figure 9, since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, buying from the United States has become increasingly popular in Europe as countries seek to build their military capacities and bind themselves closer to the United States. For Poland, for example, purchasing high-tech and expensive U.S. equipment also reinforces the security relationship with the United States. Polish officials have defended this choice by arguing “Europe didn’t have what we need. There is an absolute shortage of spare parts for the systems we do have.” As Figure 9 shows, the United States’ share of EU and European NATO arms imports has risen over the past two decades. From 2015 to 2022, the U.S. defense industry was the source of 53 percent of total EU or European NATO arms imports. In contrast, the U.S. share of arms sales to Europe was 46 percent between 2008 and 2015 and 40 percent from 2001 to 2008. The data demonstrate that Poland is not alone in its strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the growing export success of Switzerland, Israel, and South Korea shows that European arms imports are not solely based on existing security relationships but also on the cost and speed of arms sales. The above countries generally have the capacity to sell arms at a lower price and on a faster timeline than the United States. As shown in Figure 9, the share of arms sales for Switzerland, Israel, and South Korea as a group has risen to 8 percent between 2015 and 2022 from 4 percent between 2001 and 2008, though this is slightly lower than the 9 percent seen from 2008 to 2014. Much of the growth of these non-NATO countries’ exports is in their sales to Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic states. Poland and the Nordic states have been especially motivated to buy from non-NATO countries such as South Korea to fill capability gaps quickly and relatively cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries, such as France, have followed a deliberate policy of buying domestically, which has resulted in stronger domestic arms industries. These countries will likely continue to maintain their own industries by buying domestically and will endeavor to advocate for their domestic industries on the international market and within multinational initiatives. French proposals for greater European integration are linked with the country’s advocacy for French defense exports. Toward this end, countries such as France must offer a good bargain for other countries with defense industries that would assume a lower tier or supportive role in a more integrated European defense industrial base. This can be difficult, as all countries would naturally like to see their defense spending bear fruit within their own countries. There are also inherent challenges to coordinating defense policy as a larger bloc. Reflecting its own strategic considerations, the United Kingdom has become even more U.S. focused following Brexit, purchasing 80 percent of its arms imports from the United States between 2015 and 2022, compared to 70 percent between 2008 and 2015 and 65 percent between 2001 and 2008. These kinds of diverging national interests offer a persistent challenge to cooperation and the integration of Europe’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, in the post-2014 period, defense budgets and procurement spending specifically increased across the EDA, even when accounting for the loss of the United Kingdom’s participation. However, collaborative projects have not kept pace with this growth despite the introduction of EU institutions and funding to support greater collaboration. Instead, European states chose to import platforms from the United States or from their respective defense industries as opposed to pursuing intra-EU collaboration. This analysis confirms the 2022 EDA’s self-critique that “no improved coherence of the EU defence landscape has yet been observed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-to-what-extent-have-eu-institutions-in-cooperation-with-nato-overcome-these-challenges&quot;&gt;2. To what extent have EU institutions, in cooperation with NATO, overcome these challenges?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia’s February 2022 attempt to conquer Ukraine, concrete steps to deepen defense-industrial collaboration proved immediately relevant to the crisis. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes aid provided to Ukraine by other nations, with a close focus on the United States and European Union and offers useful insight. Per their data as of January 2023, the European Union — including member states, the European Commission, and the European Council — promised approximately €55 billion to Ukraine over the course of 2022, while the United States made a separate commitment of €73 billion to Ukraine. Aid was committed in three forms: financial, military, and humanitarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these figures show that the United States is the largest individual military and financial contributor to Ukraine, other nations also made very substantial contributions. National aid figures do not include the resources provided by the European Union as a collective organization, nor do they include the costs paid to host and support refugees. The data show that Poland and Germany have spent the most in managing the influx of Ukrainians taken in as refugees, while Poland and the Czech Republic have faced the highest costs in relation to their GDP. Poland’s overall bilateral commitments of financial, humanitarian, and military aid, in addition to the costs its undertaken in hosting refugees, totals €11.9 billion, which constitutes 2.1 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key opportunity and test for NATO and the European Union will be whether they can channel diverse national investments toward a Europe capable of meeting its security needs. The European Peace Facility (EPF) has been a crucial indicator of Europe’s potential to rise to this test in a unified manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The European Peace Facility: The Potential Future of European Power Projection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key opportunity and test for NATO and the European Union will be whether they can channel diverse national investments toward a Europe capable of meeting its security needs. The EPF has been a crucial indicator of Europe’s potential to rise to this test in a unified manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPF is an off-budget joint procurement and financing mechanism meant to purchase military equipment for states partnered with the European Union. The EPF’s status as an “off-budget” tool allows Brussels to retain flexibility in refreshing the fund without having to go through the European Parliament. The EPF, at the time of its ratification in March 2021, was meant to strengthen support for African partners and develop capabilities to respond to crises in Europe’s strategic south. The EPF was able to provide a critical service by funding support for Ukraine without involving NATO in the conflict in a potentially escalatory manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the EPF in 2021 and urged that the mechanism complement existing transatlantic institutions and processes. The EPF has provided over €2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. The EPF is now evolving, as the mechanism will begin replenishing member states’ stocks of select munitions sent to Ukraine — effectively organizing a multinational procurement effort valued at €1 billion. That said, as the EPF evolves it will feel the pressure of its original mission especially as Brussels considers investing €20 billion into the fund over the next four years to support Ukraine in the long-term. Vice Admiral Hervé Bléjean, director general of the EU Military Staff, states “the challenge with this use of the EPF, which is exploding towards a focus on Ukraine, is that the member states are remembering why it’s a global instrument.” Part of the EPF’s strategic value is aiding European partners to meet their security needs and, in turn, supporting European defense exports, which serves as a return on investment for R&amp;amp;D efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging mechanism focused on addressing shared European defense needs and addressing critical defense industrial base gaps is the European Defence Industry Reinforcement Through Common Procurement Act (EDIRPA). The act was proposed on July 19, 2022, as a short-term European procurement mechanism valued at €500 million that would address “the most urgent and critical defence capability gaps” and “incentivise the EU Member States to procure defence products jointly.” The EPF evolved through improvisation to address the present moment, and EDIRPA is a purpose-built tool, though still far too small for the magnitude of Europe’s need. However, taken together, both institutions have the chance to support a pivot to production that is relevant to Europe’s near-term security needs. Collaboration on R&amp;amp;D is valuable, especially over longer time scales, but common production that advances interchangeability is key to the present moment of recapitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant differences between all of the defense collaboration mechanisms discussed, the principal driver of successful European defense collaboration and integration is a shared need and sufficient incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-what-sectors-are-most-promising-for-greater-collaboration-and-integration-for-eu-and-european-nato-nations&quot;&gt;3. What sectors are most promising for greater collaboration and integration for EU and European NATO nations?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of supporting Ukraine and recapitalizing requires attention because scaling up production is a historically difficult problem. As Adam Saxton and Mark Cancian note, “The experiences of mobilization in World War I and World War II do not provide reasons for optimism. U.S. industrial mobilization in World War I generally began at the onset of the war and was unable to produce sufficient equipment until the very last months of the conflict.” Under most acquisition systems, potential surge capacity will lose out to considerations about cost, driven by government, and profitability, driven by shareholders. Industry is clear that an explicit and steady demand signal is the most powerful incentive to build more capacity, but there is a range of practical constraints even in the presence of a demand signal. Adding shifts and improving processes is often possible using existing factories but may run up against workforce limitations, especially in a competitive job market. However, for a factory already running three shifts at maximum efficiency, significantly increasing throughput may require expanded or even new facilities. For munitions in particular, the nature of the chemicals and final products employed can raise environmental and safety concerns for the surrounding area. As an added complication, production facilities are dependent on key inputs, and the lower rungs of the supply chain may have choke points that can prevent taking advantage of existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of the European industrial base also provides an opportunity. In favoring national production, Europe built an industrial base with a very different set of incentives than the lean U.S. industrial base, where unit cost considerations incentivized running three shifts where possible and minimizing slack capacity. However, exploiting that potential in greater production using existing facilities will require a clear demand signal, cross-border coordination, and significant investments. This section looks at existing trade and transfer data to assess this and shows that there is some existing European defense coordination. It also seeks to help identify which sectors may be ripe for greater cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking down trade by sector, as shown in Figure 10, reveals that the disproportionate growth in European arms imports from the United States since 2014 has been driven by the aircraft sector. Between 2015 and 2022, the European Union and European NATO imported approximately 12 billion trend-indicator value (TIV) of U.S. aircraft, double the 6 billion TIV of imports of U.S. aircraft between 2008 and 2015, with much of this increase driven by the F-35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ effort to include international partners in the F-35 program, the country’s premier cooperative program, led to significant export success within Europe between 2015 and 2022. Indicated in gray in Figure 10, sales of the F-35 were a major driver of the increase in the value of European imports of aircraft. F-35 imports constituted 42 percent of total European aircraft imports, weighted by TIV, between 2015 and 2022, demonstrating U.S. growth in Europe’s aerospace sector. Especially notable buyers of the F-35 include Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy. An F-35 final assembly facility, one of only three worldwide, is located in Italy. This may help explain the high level of Italian spending on collaborative procurement with countries beyond the European Union, shown in Figure 6. Additionally, France’s low level of imports reflects its preference to leverage its national defense industrial base across nearly all sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European fighter jets, such as the Rafale, Eurofighter, and Gripen, face a powerful system competitor in the F-35. That said, when looking at European exports, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom have all experienced growth in their own aircraft exports, rising from a collective 1.7 billion to 2.7 billion average annual TIV between 2015 and 2022. This growth is all the more remarkable for Italy and the United Kingdom, as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) exclusively credits the F-35 to the United States. This contributed to an overall growth in EU and European NATO exports from 7.5 billion to 8.1 billion average annual TIV between the 2008–2015 period and the 2015–2022 period. France has been the largest source of export growth, with its average annual exports increasing by 67 percent. As this and other sectors show, countries have reason to consider prioritizing selling to the larger world rather than focusing on the needs of the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European missile exports remain strong abroad, though European purchases of European-made missiles have fallen from 1.3 billion TIV between 2008 and 2015 to 440 million TIV between 2015 and 2022, largely giving way to growth in U.S. missile exports to the continent. Europe’s shipbuilding industry is a standout sector for the continent and also features extensive collaboration. In total, 70 percent of European ship imports came from within the European Union between 2015 and 2022. Europe exported 17.3 billion TIV of ships over the same period, up from 12.5 billion TIV between 2008 and 2015. Armored vehicles have also been a European export success story, as the European Union and European NATO exported 502 million annual average TIV of armored vehicles between 2015 and 2022, consistent with the 515 million annual average TIV exported outside of Europe from 2008 to 2015. Intra-European imports of armored vehicles have also remained strong, as 61 percent of EU and European NATO armored vehicle imports came from within the European Union between 2015 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data can provide a more complete picture of defense industrial base integration, help identify transfers within consortiums, and unpack the complexities hidden when a collaborative project, such as the F-35, is attributed to only a single nation. Eurostat data tracks imports to and exports from EU members and can supplement SIPRI reporting. While Eurostat data does not reliably differentiate between civilian and military platforms in major sectors such as aerospace, it is useful for trends in those sectors it does cover. In addition to European shipbuilding success, the Eurostat data shows the growth of intra-European arms imports after the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Figure 7 shows that as overall European defense spending rose after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, imports from within Europe rose as well, with munitions accounting for a sizable portion of European imports and exports. Between 2008 and 2015, the eurozone, composed of 20 European states that use the euro as either their primary or sole currency, imported €105.3 million (denoted in 2015 constant euros) worth of arms of the above categories from within the European Union. Between 2015 and 2022, eurozone imports of EU arms in the labeled categories rose to €130.1 million (denoted in 2015 constant euros). Even as the amount of intra-European arms sales grew, however, the eurozone’s imports of EU arms fell as a share of overall imports, from 62 percent between 2008 and 2015 to 59 percent between 2015 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the data suggest that the plausibility and form of progress on European collaboration is not an “all or nothing” proposition but will instead vary based on sector. The F-35 does indeed have a dominant role in European aerospace imports and has shaped the overall arms trade. This is a success for the collaborative fifth-generation industrial base strategy behind the fighter. (The situation for 4.5-generation fighters and the remainder of aerospace is more complicated and beyond the scope of this report.) In other sectors, including ships and armored vehicles, Europe has successfully pursued collaboration and intra-European purchases. To build more integrated sectors, European institutions and major arms producers may need to take further steps to incentivize collaboration among states that feel a sense of acquisition urgency or develop a short list of common European systems. In those sectors where imports from beyond the continent are more prominent, such as aerospace and artillery, there may also be interesting opportunities for collaboration that leverage comparative advantages across the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The munition and missile sectors are especially urgent priorities for current production. Europe’s ability to coordinate a sustained demand signal to help industry understand the extent of the market even after the Russo-Ukrainian War ends will be pivotal to the continent’s long-term security. Deborah Rosenblum, assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs, explains that the investment in munitions needs to be understood as a long-term shift, stating “I think the feast and famine approach that we’ve taken historically to munitions or other key elements . . . is not an approach that is going to serve us well over the longer term.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, the EDA announced a 23-country initiative on March 20, 2023, to pursue common procurement of munitions, with a focus on fast-tracking 155-milimeter procurement through the auspices of the EPF. The EDA indicated that the multilateral effort would aggregate demand, quickly move to 155-milimeter collaborative procurement, and ramp up the manufacturing capacity of the European munitions industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-would-a-greater-eu-role-in-production-be-a-viable-way-to-support-transatlantic-security-needs&quot;&gt;4. Would a greater EU role in production be a viable way to support transatlantic security needs?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic desirability of a more self-reliant EU role in European defense is a longstanding topic of debate that involves a range of considerations and priorities beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, this paper will focus on whether a greater EU role in defense industrial integration is like to develop at the present moment. The first differentiator from the past is that the substantial shifts taken after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine have offered a much firmer foundation for cooperation. While the eastern frontline states feel the threat most acutely and have been leading aid in proportional terms, support from France, Germany, and other Western European states to Ukraine has been critical to its self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second promising shift is that EU institutions have begun to pivot from an excessive focus on collaboration to a broader concept of cooperation that includes production directly and not as the eventual consequence of collaborative programs. The use of the EPF and EDIRPA are timely precedents indicating the direction European nations should move to be better able to meet their own collective needs. Figure 8 shows the slow pace of collaboration initiatives, but that must be balanced with the fact that buying off the shelf is often a more affordable and faster way to address pressing security needs. If EU cross-subsidization or addressing supply chain obstacles causes multiple countries to place matching orders with minimal customization, that serves operational concerns and interchangeability just as surely as those countries engaging in a co-development project. Efforts such as EDIRPA are still inadequately sized but are focused on the right problem and should be further encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 10 shows, EU and European NATO countries are already effectively responding to the continent’s demand in some sectors. The extent of EU and European NATO exports of missiles suggests that Europe faces an opportunity to build collective capacity for the transatlantic alliance in this sector at a time when U.S. supply chains are strained. Though Eastern European states have historically been skeptical of EU approaches to defense due to strategic differences between it and its Western counterparts, there are signs that these differences can be addressed. On May 31, 2023, French president Emmanuel Macron admitted that France “lost opportunities to listen to” Central and Eastern European countries regarding the threat that Russia poses, as well as that Europe should not be divided over these issues. EU common procurement efforts will need to negotiate to include the concerns of frontline states, but the United States should welcome these initiatives and push for greater funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in the future of European defense is a long-term endeavor that requires more than the difficult steps European nations have already taken to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Given the challenges with readiness and modernization identified in Chapter 3 of this report, pivoting to production while political will is present offers a valuable opportunity. European defense historically has been largely fragmented. For the best chance of meeting current needs, European and transatlantic processes must work in tandem to leverage their resources to cover identified capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, a clearer division of labor between the institutional functions of the European Union and NATO could make progress against inefficiencies within the European defense ecosystem. EU funding mechanisms are a contribution to the NATO alliance if they address critical gaps identified by transatlantic institutions. These gaps are identified in the NATO Defence Planning Process, which could provide valuable direction to expanded versions of EDIRPA and build trust in Eastern European states that their concerns about collective security threats are respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premises of EU efforts to encourage cooperation and collaboration among its members focus on the presence of European capability gaps, an aversion to redundancy in capability, and a desire for strategic autonomy. There is an inherent conflict between these premises and the nature of NATO, a military alliance dominated by the United States. However, as an institution, the European Union is better suited to financing European production initiatives than NATO. Additionally, EU member states comprise the majority of NATO’s members. The current strategic environment requires both institutions to complement each other in the short and long term in a bid to maximize resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a beauty contest between NATO and EU. It’s a joint venture. And it’s the interest of NATO to have as many of the allied nations being part of the EU, and vice versa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For a European pillar of NATO to really come into its own, Europe has to have a bigger chunk of enablers so they’re doing this by themselves. It does not require the United States to be that framing logistics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-how-does-the-us-role-in-european-security-factor-into-european-defense-integration&quot;&gt;5. How does the U.S. role in European security factor into European defense integration?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the United States has harbored skepticism concerning EU-led European defense integration and prefers for its European allies to integrate through the auspices of NATO. Conversely, EU-led defense initiatives often have an aspect of “strategic autonomy” for Europe and are skeptical of affording NATO a monopoly on European defense integration due to the United States’ leading role in the transatlantic organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if the United States became more comfortable with EU defense mechanisms or expanded bilateral transatlantic licensing or coproduction, U.S. regulations could make greater European integration in production difficult. In a report for the Armament Industry European Research Group titled Defense Industrial Links Between the EU and the US, Jean Belin and his coauthors critique the way that U.S. bilateral cooperation can undermine partnerships with third countries in Europe: “Often, these specific bilateral collaborations subsequently prevent the Europeans from cooperating among themselves the fields of cooperation that are becoming “US eyes only.” Though Washington has several reasons to not treat all EU countries equally, the steady addition of new F-35 partners shows that the United States can construct collaborative programs involving industrial contributions from multiple European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States’ export control systems create substantial friction that can challenge partner nations’ abilities to collaborate with the United States and each other. As a result, EU decisionmakers will likely continue to develop their defense cooperation mechanisms and institutions with safeguards to protect against EU-financed projects falling to third-party states’ regulations. Steps that would grant regulatory relief, such as open general licenses for selected technologies and trusted companies within the European Union or moving arms that no longer have sensitive technology to the Commerce Control List, would help the United States nurture rather than inhibit integrated European production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European decisionmakers harbor a range of views on the United States’ role in integrating European defense. For example, states such as Poland are interested in deepening U.S. involvement in a bid to secure deeper security guarantees. On the opposite end of the spectrum, France would prefer to strengthen EU approaches in R&amp;amp;D and in procurement to pursue the goal of “strategic autonomy” as well as to support the commercial interests of its domestic defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, the goals of achieving interchangeability and furthering production diplomacy would benefit from better leveraging EU capacities in those sectors where European nations have existing strengths, including in export markets. The missile sector may require the strongest push, as transfers within Europe have faltered, according to SIPRI data, and as the United States has been greatly concerned about its own industrial base. A buildup of licensed, coproduced, and purely European models would be beneficial but require the leaders of the European Union and major weapons-producing states to increase their focus on European markets. European defense officials will need to make sure that U.S. export control and defense industry promotion efforts do not get in the way of Europe revitalizing an independent capability that can complement U.S. production and address supply chain chokepoints that have been an obstacle to full-rate production in multiple countries at once. European nations have invested in production capacity in ways that are not always sufficient, but providing a consistent demand signal could go a long way to rationalizing this capacity and building up Europe’s ability to act as its own arsenal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicholas Velazquez and Cynthia R. Cook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European decisionmakers can pursue several avenues to rethink their continent’s security architecture. National and regional industrial and political interests in the European Union and in NATO have historically been a barrier to European defense integration. However, the uniqueness of the present moment, with threat perceptions largely aligned regarding Russia, presents European states with several opportunities. Beyond improving readiness and aligning threat perceptions, a clear articulation of the roles and responsibilities between the European Union and NATO can further the process of rethinking and reconstructing European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CSIS Global Security Forum, two senior European military officers, German general Chris Badia, NATO’s deputy supreme allied commander for transformation, and vice admiral Hervé Bléjean, director general of the EU Military Staff, respectively argued respectively that NATO’s defense planning process should identify capability gaps and that the European Union should incentivize European industry to meet those demands. A promising means of synthesizing these two perspective would be for Brussels to seek to address NATO identified capability gaps by investing more in a way that improves incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the need for action in both institutions, the alignment of threat perceptions and strategic outlooks across Europe becomes a prerequisite for continental action and autonomy. Among the European NATO members, only 10 states meet the 2 percent goal. 7 of these states are located in Eastern Europe. The Poland and the Baltic States are now working to exceed this goal due to threat perceptions that exceed those in Western Europe. On April 5, 2023, Poland’s ambassador to the United States, Marek Magierowski, said that Poland was going to increase its military budget to upward of 4 percent of GDP in a “few years’ time” to eventually transition to “a new role as a net provider of security” for Europe. Given the proximity of Europe’s eastern states to Russia, their defense investments largely reflect seeing their long-standing fears made concrete by Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge for European defense rationalization is the need to identify and agree on strategic challenges and develop a strategy for confronting them. European threat perceptions regarding Russia are increasingly aligned. Nonetheless, differences in strategic outlook and culture largely drive the intensity of their response. European nations face a complex collective-action problem where they generally identify Russia as the continent’s primary threat but lack consensus on how to act and which states should do what. Historically, this challenge can largely be traced to the distance between Western Europe’s cities and where the front line would be in a hypothetical conflict with Russia. Specifically, it is highly unlikely Russia could ever drive to Berlin or Paris, so those states’ invest relatively less are understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Europe’s opportunity to rethink its security architecture has the potential to be transformative, the moment is not permanent. It is unlikely that Western Europeans will begin developing their national armed forces with the same zeal as Poland or other Eastern European states. The threat perceptions of these states, though aligned now, will continue to change due to different strategic priorities, as outlined in Chapter 2 of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s collective-action problem plays out across all levels of the European security space, from the continent’s fragmented defense industry to its commitments in Ukraine. For example, as of May 2023, Poland’s €2.4 billion military commitments to Ukraine exceed France’s €0.45 billion, despite France having a GDP more than €2 trillion higher than Poland. This gap can at least in part be explained by the differences in threat perceptions between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the European Union, even the desire for European strategic autonomy will likely divide the continent. While all nations want their defense investments to benefit domestic industry, France’s “buy European” approach may ring hollow in eastern states who either want to procure capabilities quickly or desire a deepened relationship with the United States. For example, France recently criticized Germany’s Sky Shield Initiative, a joint procurement effort comprised of 14 European states aiming to acquire U.S. and Israeli air defense systems, on the basis that Europeans should not rely on the United States for its air defense platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a European perspective, the ability of Europe’s defense industrial base to meet Europe’s demand for defense products during the ongoing crisis will be a key metric to assess the continent’s strategic autonomy. As Assistant Secretary of Defense Deborah Rosenblum said on April 5, 2023, we are “in a period with our allies of getting back to basics.” As she highlighted, both the United States and its allies are working on the fundamentals of understanding their supply bases and what it takes to boost production. As a result, Europe faces a critical juncture that could serve to reframe European and transatlantic defense cooperation. This reframing could seize on ideas such as former under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment Ellen Lord’s suggestion that the United States and Europe “pick a couple things and have a clear demand signal and get contracts flowing” in order to drive meaningful cooperation. European defense leaders can identify and address certain European capability gaps on a continental basis while cooperating with the United States in other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s collective action problem is not insurmountable. Historically, NATO and the European Union, two consensus-based institutions, have served as the main avenues to strengthen European defense collaboration. Within the European Union, there are promising legislative and budgetary developments that herald a new era of deepened European defense collaboration, outlined in Chapter 4 of this report. These developments are largely tied to Europe’s collective shock regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The sustainability of this progress will be proportionate to the degree that European leaders mitigate Europe’s historic collective action problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European decisionmakers can begin this process by evolving the roles of NATO and the European Union in fostering defense collaboration within Europe and across the Atlantic while minimizing unnecessary redundancies in those respective institutions. Additionally, while European political will is strong, European decisionmakers should allocate their respective national resources now for the future. The allocation of resources, contracts, and commitments is essential to establishing a clear demand signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States’ commitment to Europe and NATO is “rock solid,” in the words of the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Christopher W. Grady, the future of European security will be strengthened if European states can undertake consistent investment in their own defense. To this end, European decisionmakers should leverage the current moment to overcome long-standing obstacles and pursue emerging opportunities to strengthen Europe’s defensive capabilities and readiness. Europe’s current progress on these issues provides good reason for national governments, international institutions, and defense industry strive to achieve a new era for European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan at the hands of the Taliban in August 2021 marked a turning point for the operational activities of transnational terrorist organisations that have found refuge in the country. For Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISKP, the Islamic State’s franchise in Afghanistan), the withdrawal of foreign armed forces provided an opportunity for it to reassert itself as a rival to the Taliban in its new role as the de facto government. Yet, as an important node in a global network, ISKP has grander ambitions than merely upsetting the new Taliban regime. In March 2023, US Army General Michael Kurilla, who oversees US operations in Afghanistan, warned that ISKP could conduct an external operation against a European target in less than six months, speaking to an upward trajectory in ISKP’s capabilities. Kurilla’s estimation concurs with leaked US intelligence that ended up on the Discord messaging platform a month later, which determined that the Islamic State “has been developing a cost-effective model for external operations that relies on resources from outside Afghanistan, operatives in target countries, and extensive facilitation networks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US’s threat assessment is reflected in the Islamic State’s own financial situation. By all accounts, ISKP is a net beneficiary of its global financial network, although the ongoing gradual collapse of its central command in Syria means ISKP will be unable to rely on these handouts going forward. Nonetheless, this shows confidence held in the affiliate’s potential to deliver on the movement’s core objectives, which makes understanding and targeting financial flows bound for ISKP’s war chest a top priority, particularly given the risk of an external jihadist threat capability emerging from within Afghanistan once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-mine-is-ours&quot;&gt;What’s Mine is Ours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a trend seen across the Islamic State’s other franchises, particularly since the peak of the group’s territorial holdings in Iraq and Syria, ISKP is encouraged to reduce its financial dependency on central Islamic State leadership (IS-Core). A regional hub-and-spoke system shares revenue-generation and other responsibilities with regional offices in the Islamic State network, towards a strategy of “regionally pooled funding”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As an important node in a global network, Islamic State – Khorasan Province has grander ambitions than merely upsetting the new Taliban regime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UN Sanctions Monitoring Team highlights the role of the Al-Karrar office based in Puntland, northern Somalia, as not only a coordinating base for Islamic State activity in Africa, but as being involved in transferring funds outside its jurisdiction, to ISKP (via Kenya and Yemen, but possibly via a cell in the UK as well). Indeed, a US special operation in Somalia to kill Bilal Al-Sudani, a prominent Islamic State financial facilitator, revealed the relevance of the Al-Karrar office for ISKP financing, including a direct link between the office and the facets of ISKP responsible for the August 2021 bombing of Kabul airport. Further, UN-provided intelligence states that the Al-Karrar office was sending $25,000 to ISKP every month through cryptocurrency transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From late 2021, it is likely that tens of thousands of dollars had been moved to the Al-Siddiq office based in Afghanistan, which has jurisdiction over all Islamic State franchises in Asia, including ISKP. Different estimates put the number closer to $500,000 being made available to ISKP in the same period, with the US Defense Intelligence Agency assessing that in the last quarter of 2022, ISKP “almost certainly” received financial support from IS-Core, some of it earmarked for external operations in Europe and Russia. Indeed, funds do not come without strings attached. IS-Core will have a degree of control over ISKP through such financial support as well as through leadership appointments, although ISKP remains autonomous in planning and orchestrating attacks in Afghanistan and the region. Even though the members of the Islamic State family are requested to develop a more self-reliant financing regime, the architecture of this global financial network endures, with ISKP deemed the worthiest recipient of diminished reserves so long as it remains “one of [Islamic State’s] highest performing branches”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blow to the Al-Karrar office’s functioning brought on by the removal of Al-Sudani, alongside dwindling reserves held by IS-Core, suggests financial facilitation networks may become less lucrative for ISKP in the future, or at the very least, a less reliable source of funds. To maintain its tempo of operations, recruitment and propaganda production, ISKP will need to diversity its portfolio of revenue streams, and already has fingers in several pies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-it-yourself-financing&quot;&gt;Do-It-Yourself Financing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look after its own financial needs, ISKP very likely has dedicated financial facilitators based in Gulf countries, with the mission of soliciting and transmitting donations back to Afghanistan, as has occurred in the past. In mid-2016, ISKP facilitators utilised a non-profit organisation, Nejaat Social Welfare Organization, to collect funds from individual donors in Qatar, the UAE, Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries, and to distribute these to ISKP commanders through its offices in Kabul and Jalalabad. The Taliban’s heavy-handed counterterrorism response in eastern Afghanistan has very likely prompted private donors in the Gulf to financially support ISKP as a means of countering threats to their own interests. Chief among these are Taliban operations against Salafi mosques and madrasas in eastern Afghanistan, which also financially support ISKP and receive some funding from Gulf donors as well. Extracting financial support from these communities (mostly in inaccessible valleys in Nangarhar province) is crucial for the group’s self-financing efforts, whether they are called “donations” or, more accurately, “extortion”. For instance, after losing most of its territorial holdings in Kunar province in 2020, tribal elders, journalists, civil society activists and government officials reported how all farmers and businesspeople were obliged to pay taxes on their income during ISKP’s occupation. The group is known to extort trade and transportation companies as well, occasionally acting under the Taliban “brand” as a means of discrediting their enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;around-the-world&quot;&gt;Around the World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State’s global hub-and-spoke system depends on reliable methods of moving funds throughout the network. Above all, tried and tested methods of moving terrorist funds are employed, including the use of unregistered money service businesses, cash couriers and established hawala networks (a centuries-old value transfer system). Cash couriers – some intimately affiliated with ISKP and others employed episodically – are likely to be used to move cash across Afghanistan and regionally. The group’s operatives based in Jalalabad and Kabul make use of hawaladars in these cities to receive (and possibly also send) funds throughout the global network, and to help store tens of thousands of dollars for the group. These hawala networks will be linked up with broader IS financial networks such as the so-called Al-Rawi Network, whose money service businesses and money-laundering expertise aided Saddam Hussein in evading sanctions back in the 1990s, and which now supports Islamic State financial facilitation through operations in Iraq, Turkey, Belgium, Kenya, Russia, China and elsewhere. The network relies on established money-laundering techniques including the use of proxies, layering and cash smuggling to hide the origin of the Islamic State’s funds, with the gold trade being a favourite method. As of December 2018, the network’s leader Mushtaq Al-Rawi was living in Belgium and operating money exchange businesses in Syria, Turkey, Sudan and the Gulf countries, alongside front companies and an unidentified charitable organisation based in the West Bank to generate, launder and move funds on behalf of the Islamic State. The diffuse and covert nature of networks such as Al-Rawi makes them a reliable asset for the Islamic State, being resilient to countermeasures and capitalising on gaps within the global counterterrorism financing regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Islamic State’s global hub-and-spoke system depends on reliable methods of moving funds throughout the network&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the success of such established transfer methods, recent evidence indicates that cryptocurrencies have become a more important element of the Islamic State’s overall financial tradecraft. Blockchain analytics firms have independently reported donations being made to ISKP’s media unit in Bitcoin, Ethereum and TRX (Tron), very likely in response to propaganda and recruitment efforts, and to an ISKP recruitment campaign in Tajikistan to the tune of approximately $2 million in USDT (Tron). Yet, the greater utility for cryptocurrency lies in its use for international funds transfer, though what remains unseen is how cryptocurrencies held by ISKP may be “cashed-out”, or converted to fiat currencies, a necessary step towards eventually spending these funds. A rapid uptick in cryptocurrency adoption by Afghans followed the collapse of the Islamic Republic, with emergency aid being sent in cryptocurrency and cashed-out by local money exchangers or hawaladars, a vital economic lifeline as bank transfers became next to impossible. A nation-wide ban on cryptocurrencies imposed by the Taliban in the summer of 2022 will have increased the risk of cashing-out cryptocurrency in Afghanistan, but is unlikely to have completely eradicated the trade. Further, for ISKP, similar methods could easily be employed across the border in Pakistan, or anywhere else its financial facilitators may be based and where hawaladars or money exchanges accept cryptocurrencies. Once in cash, ISKP can utilise couriers to run the money wherever it needs to go, to pay for goods or services rendered or to cover other costs such as salaries. Otherwise, hawaladars can hold funds in cryptocurrencies in-trust for an intended beneficiary or transfer to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-after-the-money&quot;&gt;Going After the Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISKP’s favoured position within the global Islamic State network offers the affiliate access to financial resources (and thus, capabilities) it could not be expected to acquire through self-financing alone. Yet, these financial connections also offer access points for mapping and ultimately disrupting the network, having an impact not only on ISKP, but all Islamic State affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refocusing domestic and UN-level sanctions tools on the Islamic State’s financial facilitators outside Afghanistan would be a good place to start. Individuals with freedom to manoeuvre in, say, Turkey, Pakistan, the Gulf or even in Europe or North America stand to suffer more from targeted financial sanctions than ISKP leaders in eastern Afghanistan, which almost certainly do not bank with sanctions-implementing financial institutions. Asset freezes and listings for such financial facilitators would at the very least make their lives more onerous and render them less useful for raising and moving of funds for ISKP. Beginning with some of the most understood parts of the structure, arrests or targeted financial sanctions against Al-Rawi members would help in diminishing the Islamic State’s transnational financing networks overall, thus helping to stem the flow of funds towards ISKP specifically, or at least raise the costs of moving funds to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses must also keep up with, if not keep ahead of, terrorists’ adoption of new technologies for raising and moving funds. States’ blockchain analysis capabilities should be pooled and marshalled towards identifying and corroborating financial linkages with ISKP seen on the blockchain. Here, financial intelligence officials could collaborate to identify crypto-accepting hawaladars and other money service businesses that, by cashing-out cryptocurrencies, act as peer-to-peer or unlicensed/unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Whether these are based in Afghanistan or elsewhere, tracing transactions back to a regulated exchange or hosted wallet could help disruption operations against ISKP’s cryptocurrency use, by limiting opportunities for the group or its financiers to cash-out funds in cryptocurrency sent to them by IS-Core or individual donors. Indeed, notifying a Turkish exchange that was used to cash-out proceeds of the Tajik recruitment campaign mentioned above resulted in the June 2023 arrest of Shamil Hukumatov, an important ISKP financial facilitator based in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the Islamic State into a relatively loose, transnational jihadist movement has complicated the mission of interrupting its financing, with industrial natural resources exploitation and sophisticated taxation of civilians in Iraq and Syria giving way to a diffuse fundraising structure. With less money to go around, and alleviated of the overhead costs in running a quasi-state, IS-Core is left with more flexibility in allocating remaining reserves among affiliates. Here, value for money is crucial. So while ISKP remains under pressure from Taliban counterterrorism operations, it can count on a formidable support network to ride out the tough times for as long as it can deliver the best return on investment for the Islamic State movement. If the affiliate cannot seize its golden opportunity, we can expect IS-Core to pick a new favourite before too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There have been various reports over recent weeks indicating that Saudi Arabia and Israel might be close to normalisation, with the Biden administration actively pushing for a deal by the end of the year. The Wall Street Journal even claimed that the Saudis had agreed with the Biden administration on a normalisation path, while Israeli normalisation with other Arab states has met with dramatic consequences, such as in Libya. Jonathan Eyal (&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;) asked our Senior Associate Fellow, H A Hellyer (&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;), about the significance of these events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; Are the two countries indeed close to normalisation? If so, why would it matter? If not, why not?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; Saudi-Israeli normalisation is not a Saudi-Israeli story – it is a Saudi-Israeli-US story. Each of the three would be deeply involved in any such endeavour, and without the active participation of all three, the entirety of the undertaking fails. So, it is important to see how it squares up in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s start with Saudi Arabia, in that case. There were suggestions that previously, Riyadh was looking to build a broader “anti-Iran” front, and that this was energising the possibility of Saudi-Israeli normalisation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; Any such suggestion no longer holds water, following the de-escalation between Riyadh and Tehran that resulted in the restoration of diplomatic ties in March of this year. Indeed, across a number of files, the mood in Riyadh appears to be one of de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this desire for de-escalation does not extend to an automatic desire to widen engagement with the Israelis. The current Israeli government is one that is deeply controversial within the wider Israeli establishment itself, let alone across the region, for its empowering of the Israeli far right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saudis are probably looking at the United Arab Emirates, which normalised with Israel in the Abraham Accords, and seeing prominent Emirati figures express exasperation at how the Israeli political scene currently looks – one announced publicly during an Israeli conference that further Arab-Israeli normalisation was unlikely, and that the Netanyahu government “embarrassed” the UAE. Indeed, last week, Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, met with the Emirati foreign minister, with Lapid announcing this publicly on his social media feeds – a clear message for Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So, the Saudis would need a pretty big reason, then, to normalise with the Israelis right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; I think a rather massive one. From the Saudi regime’s perspective, which is cognisant of its own reputation across the Muslim world, as well as among its own domestic constituents, it would be rather awkward to normalise with this particular Israeli government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riyadh’s reservations would have been confirmed by the response to the recent suggestion that Libya and Israel were drawing closer to normalisation; the domestic response in Libya to the very notion was robust and uncompromising, leading Libyan officials to publicly denounce the contacts that had clearly been underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s thus not surprising that Riyadh is signalling a lot of disquiet with the current media discourse around normalisation between it and a Netanyahu-led Israel. Perhaps in response, Saudi Arabia decided to commit to a rather symbolic move: the accreditation of a Saudi diplomat to the Palestinian Authority, and a consul-general for Jerusalem (although non-resident).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli response was to insist there would be no opening of a consulate in Jerusalem– even though the Saudis had never suggested they would open one in the first place. However, a message was delivered and received, in all directions: that Riyadh is not keen on the present Israeli government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Saudis may well assess that they stand a chance of a much better deal with the next US administration, and without the Netanyahu obstacle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the Israelis continue to openly reject any idea of concessions on the Palestinian file, such as insisting that there would be no settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank irrespective of any deal with Saudi Arabia, will have only served to buttress Riyadh’s position. Indeed, Palestinian officials themselves identify in Riyadh a willingness to listen to their concerns, and have already given Riyadh a list of items they want to see reflected in any Israeli-Saudi peace deal. These items are fairly minimalist compared to public rhetoric and discussions, which means the Palestinians are probably trying to strategise about what they can genuinely get at this stage – but it’s rather unlikely that the current Israeli government would make any gesture of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; One begins to suspect Riyadh is thinking less about the Israeli government, and more about Washington?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, certainly, Saudi moves vis-à-vis Israel have perhaps as much to do with the US as they do with the Israelis. There might well be dividends for the Saudis, particularly in terms of tech, from a normalisation deal with the Israelis. But the real “asks” are going to be vis-à-vis the US, and there are massive challenges here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Riyadh is looking for a US commitment to a security umbrella architecture, something as close to Article 5 of the NATO charter as it can get – and that is not terribly likely at present. There is also a desire to get support for a civilian nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is tremendous opposition to a deal especially among Democrats, so it would be difficult to get any such agreement past the Senate; and more widely in the Beltway, there is antipathy vis-à-vis Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) himself. As the Democratic Party inches more and more towards the progressive left, that antipathy is only empowered further; it may not be a complete dealbreaker, but it does raise the price, so to speak, for the hassle in Washington. Considering both the Democrats and the Republicans will be focusing on the next electoral cycle pretty soon, all that needs to happen is for people to kick up a fuss about a prospective deal for a few weeks, or even a couple of months, and the whole discussion will get thrown into the long grass as people gear up for the election instead. The Saudis know all of this – and they’re not going to put in a massive amount of investment until the situation changes. This is especially true after the withdrawal from Afghanistan – which Riyadh, and much of the wider Middle East, would have seen as evidence of a desire in Washington to wind down the US footprint abroad, and to not commit to protecting existing security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as previously noted, there is still the “Palestine Question” to consider. Riyadh has made it clear that there has to be movement on the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in order for movement to take place, and the Biden administration seems to be rationalising that such a movement would make it easier to get US Democrat support for the deal. And that kind of support is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have senior Biden administration officials shuttling to the Arab world to engage directly with Saudi and Palestinian officials, precisely to discuss “realistic understandings” with the Palestinians on this point. But even if Washington gets expectations down to a bare minimum, it still runs into the obstacle that is Netanyahu, who recognises that taking steps towards the Palestinians “would likely anger the extreme-right parties that are part of [Netanyahu] coalition and risk bringing down his government”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, frankly, from the Saudi perspective, it probably means this is the worst possible time to invest in a deal. If they wait a while, they may have less to worry about in terms of the Biden administration and obstacles among Democrats, and in terms of an Israeli government led by Netanyahu, with so much far-right representation therein. The Saudis may well assess that they stand a chance of a much better deal with the next US administration, and without the Netanyahu obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So, for Riyadh, the factors are pretty clear. When it comes to the Israelis, would normalisation be a proverbial “win”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to the Israelis, any normalisation with any Arab state is a win. If it were to be achieved with Saudi Arabia, this would be a massive win, as far as the Israelis are concerned – the Israeli prime minister sent no less than his close advisor and minister for strategic affairs to Washington mainly for the purpose of working on such a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There might be a great deal of activity and shuttle diplomacy underway – but sometimes, even if there is a “will”, there isn’t always a “way”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the calculus seems to be a bit oddly placed, the assumption appears to be that because Mecca and Medina are in Saudi Arabia, normalisation with Riyadh would suddenly fling open the doors to the entire Muslim world. But Riyadh is not the Vatican, and this is not the 12th century when the Catholic papacy was at its strongest point of power. Riyadh’s foreign policy changes in the past have not made a massive difference to most Muslim states, beyond the GCC; one can see, for example, how Saudi allies in different parts of Asia still developed and maintained links with Tehran at the height of Saudi-Iranian tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So, what would normalisation achieve, in that case?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; What is true is that those states which want to normalise would have more to work with in terms of arguing the case domestically for normalisation, especially if they can find dividends, at least with their own stakeholders and constituents. But the Palestinian issue is still a pretty live one – even if symbolically – in a lot of the Muslim world, and if it is not addressed in some way, most states that don’t already want relations to be developed are unlikely to change their minds. It would represent a cost in terms of their own domestic politics, and would not provide sufficient payoffs. Indeed, the Biden administration has already told the Israelis that any successful deal with Riyadh would have to include some kind of concessions with regards to the Palestinians. So, if the Israelis are imagining a massive change in their political positioning in the Muslim world, they probably ought to consider the main reasons why normalisation has escaped them for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; That all accounts for the Saudis and the Israelis. But as we’ve already seen, this is a tripartite issue. What is the situation in Washington?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the Israelis aren’t exactly doing wonders with the Biden administration at the moment more generally, including on the normalisation file. Washington was not impressed by Israel’s publicising of the Libyan-Israeli track, and made it clear as such, and the Biden administration was direct about the need for Netanyahu’s government to make some kind of concessions vis-à-vis the Palestinians in order to get a deal with Saudi Arabia, which has already been rejected by Israel’s far-right finance minister; not to mention that Netanyahu is asking for more security arrangements between the US and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a lot of concern in Washington about the nature of Israeli democracy itself (and the much more widespread accusation that Israel is guilty of apartheid against the Palestinians); writ large, the Israelis aren’t making a deal any easier to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the Beltway, with all its policy establishments – governmental and otherwise – Israeli normalisation is a bipartisan issue, there is massive support for it as a principle across the aisle. Indeed, the Abraham Accords were met with huge exuberance and enthusiasm, which perhaps explains why there has been a lot of media reportage that seems incredibly keen to put the best possible face on the likelihood of Saudi-Israeli normalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wishful thinking is not sufficient. As mentioned above, security guarantees for other countries are not the easiest things to get through the Senate, and Saudi Arabia seems to have made it clear that this is what would get a deal across the finish line. And the media coverage that seemed to indicate there was an imminent deal in the offing provoked, rather uncharacteristically for Washington, a pretty blunt and public put-down by the administration, saying that no framework had been agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the administration wants it – that is clear, and it has expended a lot of energy and visits from US officials to investigate the potential for a deal, as well as engaging with Israeli officials on the subject. It was also reported that Biden may engage in bilateral personal meetings with MBS this month at the G20, and with Netanyahu in the US, to discuss possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the administration also knows that in a few months, its bandwidth will be focused on the election cycle and domestic considerations, and it is equally aware that Saudi Arabia is not about to give Biden a massive foreign policy “win” without something equally massive in return. There might be a great deal of activity and shuttle diplomacy underway – but sometimes, even if there is a “will”, there isn’t always a “way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might well be that the Saudis and Israelis normalise in our lifetimes – but probably not in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the progress made during Ukraine’s counteroffensive, subsequent offensives will be necessary to achieve the liberation of Ukrainian territory. It is therefore important to assess the tactics employed and training provided during the Ukrainian offensive to inform force generation over the coming months. This report scrutinises tactical actions to identify challenges that need solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prerequisite condition for any offensive action is fires dominance. This has been achieved through blinding the counterbattery capability of Russian guns and the availability of precise and long-range artillery systems. Ensuring the sustainability of this advantage by properly resourcing ammunition production and spares for a consolidated artillery park is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is suffering from heavy rates of equipment loss, but the design of armoured fighting vehicles supplied by its international partners is preventing this from converting into a high number of killed personnel. It is vital that Ukrainian protected mobility fleets can be recovered, repaired and sustained. This also demands a focus on industrial capacity and fleet consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts at rapid breakthrough have resulted in an unsustainable rate of equipment loss. Deliberately planned tactical actions have seen Ukrainian forces take Russian positions with small numbers of casualties. However, this approach is slow, with approximately 700–1,200 metres of progress every five days, allowing Russian forces to reset. One key limitation on the ability to exploit or maintain momentum is mine reconnaissance in depth. The exploration of technological tools for conducting standoff mine reconnaissance would be of considerable benefit to Ukrainian units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another limiting factor in Ukrainian tactical operations is staff capacity at battalion and brigade level. Training of staff would significantly assist Ukrainian forces. This will only be helpful, however, if training is built around the tools and structure that Ukraine employs, rather than teaching NATO methods that are designed for differently configured forces. There is also a critical requirement to refine collective training provided to Ukrainian units outside Ukraine so that Ukrainian units can train in a manner closer to how they fight. This requires regulatory adjustment to allow for the combination of tools that are highly restricted on many European training areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have continued to adapt their methods. Some of these adaptations are context specific, such as the increased density of minefields, from a doctrinal assumption of 120 metres to a practical aim to make them 500 metres deep. Other adaptations are systemic and will likely have a sustained impact on Russian doctrine and capability development. The foremost of these is the dispersal of electronic warfare systems rather than their concentration on major platforms, a shift to application-based command and control tools that are agnostic of bearer, and a transition to a dependence on more precise fires owing to the recognised inability to achieve the previously doctrinally mandated weight of imprecise fire given the threat to the logistics sustaining Russian guns. It is vital that Ukraine’s partners assist the country’s preparations for winter fighting, and subsequent campaign seasons now, if initiative is to be retained into 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces suffered major setbacks in autumn 2022 with the collapse of the Western Group of Forces in Kharkiv and a compelled withdrawal from Kherson. In response to these setbacks, General Sergei Surovikin, then commanding Russian forces in Ukraine, adopted a new strategy. First, Russia would use long-range precision strikes to wage an attritional campaign against Ukraine’s electricity and reticulation infrastructure with the aim of making Ukraine’s cities uninhabitable during the winter. Second, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation would build a series of defence lines across the occupied territories in a bid to blunt further Ukrainian advances and protract the conflict by exhausting Ukrainian troops. The extensive preparation for defensive operations – compared with the aggressive war aims of the Kremlin – contributed to Surovikin being removed in January, with General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, launching an ill-prepared and costly series of offensive thrusts in January 2023. Nevertheless, the defence lines were completed, and Russia has been able to fall back on these defences after the failure of its offensive actions. The Surovikin Line now poses a major barrier to Ukrainian troops seeking to liberate the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the preparation of Ukraine’s offensive, various concepts of operation were examined. Much of the data supporting the tactics that Ukraine’s international partners sought to train Ukrainian forces to adopt was based on operational analysis from the 20th century that did not contend with a range of technologies employed in Ukraine. Understanding how effective these tactics have been, therefore, is important for refining both the tactics of Ukraine’s international partners, and improving the training provided to Ukrainian forces for subsequent operations. This report seeks to explore a set of tactical actions fought by the Ukrainian military in the opening phases of the counteroffensive and how both Ukrainian and Russian sides have refined their approach in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall plan for the offensive is highly sensitive. Detailed accounts of aggregate losses and other data are also sensitive because they would provide Russia with information about the extent to which they have written down Ukrainian units. Therefore, instead of trying to summarise progress throughout the offensive, this report presents a case study of a series of tactical actions, fought over a two-week period over the villages of Novodarivka and Rivnopil, straddling the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The series of tactical actions is chosen because it is representative of wider trends, and informative as to how Russian forces manage different tactical challenges, and the various approaches employed by Ukrainian troops. The overview is based on accounts of the operations by participants, captured documents from Russian command posts, open-source material including satellite imagery of the engagements, and a review of non-public videos of the relevant tactical actions. This report was presented to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) prior to publication to ensure that its release would not compromise any ongoing operations or tactics. The report remains solely the work of the authors named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-taking-novodarivka-and-rivnopil&quot;&gt;I. Taking Novodarivka and Rivnopil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line of contact between Ukrainian and Russian forces along the boundary between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts had been relatively static over the months preceding Ukraine’s offensive. Russian offensive operations in early 2023 had focused on Vulhedar, some 40–50 kilometres to the east, and Bakhmut. Ukrainian troops remained dug into tree lines around a kilometre to the north of Novodarivka, around the village of Novopil. A brigade of the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces (TDF) had been holding the line for some time, reinforced in May by a mechanised brigade and another line brigade in anticipation of the offensive. The mechanised brigade would spearhead the breakthrough. The Russians had a company in Novodarivka and another in Rivnopil, with a third holding a series of fighting positions between the two settlements. Behind this were additional reserves including armour. The approaches to the settlements were heavily mined. To begin advancing south towards the Surovikin Line, Ukrainian forces needed to break through these villages, and thereafter through Priyutne, approximately 6 kilometres to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian offensive began in late May with a protracted period of preparatory artillery fires. For the Rivnopil sector, batteries of M777 155-mm howitzers had been assigned to support the effort, setting up their firing positions to the northwest. Usually, Ukrainian howitzers would have to displace 2–15 minutes from opening fire, depending on their distance from different threat systems. This time it was clear that Ukrainian intelligence had accurately marked down Russian firing positions, and with the greater range afforded by 155-mm guns, the Ukrainian gunners quickly caused Russian artillery to be pulled back. Since the targets in this phase were largely in the close, the Ukrainian artillery established a steady rhythm of strikes with little need to displace. There was a sense of elation among the crews and the infantry watching the fire. For months each gun was strictly limited in the number of rounds available. Ukraine had been trying to conserve its ammunition to stockpile for the offensive. Now there was freedom to fire and when calls for resupply were made, additional rounds were promptly delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainians also worked to degrade Russian tactical reserves using UAVs. Reconnaissance by day would locate Russian positions, which would be attacked at night using converted agricultural UAVs dropping RPGs. These tactics were fairly binary in their viability. If Russian electronic warfare (EW) was active, the UAVs could not get in and usually were not committed. If there was a relaxation in electronic protection, the effects could be dramatic. In one incident, a company of Russian tanks had taken up position in a woodblock behind the front. Five UAVs, each carrying four RPGs, were dispatched, destroying or seriously damaging seven of the tanks, although all of the UAVs were lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to attempt a breach of the initial Russian fighting positions was taken on the evening of 3 June, with mechanised troops assigned the task. There was a debate within the command group over the bogginess of the ground after recent rainfall. Nevertheless, the decision was to proceed. The initial attack was to aim to breach an area where the minefields were less dense, because of the short distance between the lines, and to break into the village of Novodarivka. The village had been almost entirely destroyed by Russian shelling when originally taken and was now simply a set of fighting positions for a Russian infantry company. Long and thin, running east to west, the village provided the Russians with covered positions that overlooked most approaches to their company positions to the east and west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After identifying the points for the breach, the offensive started early in the morning of 4 June. Two UR-77 Meteorit charges were fired across the narrowest part of the minefield, blowing two 6-metre-wide channels from the treeline to the north to the edge of Novodarivka. Under covering fire from artillery, the first column advanced along the eastern breach. The column was led by a pair of tanks, followed by MaxxPro MRAPs carrying the infantry. Unfortunately, the MRAPs struggled in the boggy ground, especially in the wake of the tanks. Several of the MRAPs bogged in, while the cleared lane was insufficiently wide for other vehicles to pass. It was at this point, with the column fully committed to the breach, that a pair of Russian tanks unmasked and began to engage the column. The Ukrainian tanks fired back at a range of around 800 metres. Nevertheless, the vehicles in the column were knocked out in succession. Infantry disembarking either turned back, or pressed forwards along the cleared lane, trying to find shelter. Some infantry sections made it to the edge of the village, but the open ground behind them, now scoured by fire, was perilous to traverse, risking this force’s isolation. Too small to take the village, the Ukrainian military now had to press ahead or risk the destruction of the platoon that had made it to Novodarivka. The threat to those suppressed in the minefield eased after SPG-9 recoilless guns managed to engage the Russian tanks from the flank, knocking them out. This allowed casualties to be extracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of the second company to the western breach was necessitated both by the requirement to make progress against the objective and to reinforce the troops in Novodarivka. The ground proved firmer along this lane. However, when the column was fully committed to the breach, two more Russian tanks emerged, moving at pace towards the column and firing. Via UAV feeds, the command post watched the emergence of the enemy, and fires were brought down to try and disrupt the action. Exposed, the breaching company attempted to accelerate through the breach, but deviated from course. All vehicles in the company were then immobilised by mine strike in succession. Russian fires then began to range on the column. The dismounts once again bifurcated, some reaching the outskirts of the village and others withdrawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian defenders inside the village displaced to account for the positions that had now been occupied, falling back to strongpoints in a farm to the east of the village, and to several fighting positions along the central road. Recognising the importance of expanding the ground held to disperse the force from Russian fires, the Ukrainian commander deployed two assault groups to reinforce. One group in platoon strength worked its way along the breach, using the immobilised vehicles as cover, while fires suppressed the Russian positions. Another platoon situated to the west noted that a fold of dead ground had become viable as the repositioning of Russian forces in the village removed it from view, while dense foliage prevented overhead observation by UAS. These troops advanced cautiously to the western end of Novodarivka and began to assault Russian positions to secure the crossroads that bifurcated the settlement. After some fierce fighting, the Russian troops withdrew eastwards to prevent their positions from becoming isolated. Fighting inside Novodarivka would continue for a further week with Russian firing positions in the eastern farmstead holding out until isolated by another Ukrainian action towards Rivnopil. Despite the Russians holding some positions, these no longer overlooked the approaches to other Russian units, opening up additional avenues of attack. The first new position to be assaulted was the elevated ground to the west of Novodarivka. Previously, Russian positions in the settlement had denied the approaches to the hill, but with these firing posts removed, Ukrainian infantry were able to contest the position from which Russian artillery spotters had previously directed fire against Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before any further advances could be taken, it was necessary to deal with the Russian company in front of the village of Rivnopil to the east. This position controlled access to a series of woodblocks that ran semi-contiguously north to south. Ukrainian commanders were concerned that if they attempted to press ahead, Russian anti-tank guided weapons (ATGW) teams and other troops would work their way around the flank and cause significant damage to critical equipment. The position therefore needed to be taken. At the same time, however, Ukrainian commanders were wary. They had lost two companies of equipment to take Novodarivka. Such a loss rate was not sustainable if they were to eventually breach the Surovikin Line. It was therefore essential that the assault on the Rivnopil positions was accomplished without similar setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack on the Russian company position in front of Rivnopil would be led by TDF troops. In order to carry out the operation, the attacking force was augmented with two tanks from a neighbouring brigade and a battery of artillery. The attack began with artillery preparation of the Russian lines. Thereafter, the two tanks moved into positions where they had line of sight to the objective and began to deliver fire. The tanks, moving in and out of cover, engaged the Russian firing positions to draw the attention of and suppress the defenders. Shortly thereafter, artillery strikes on the fighting positions were combined with the delivery of smoke in front of the tanks. The tanks worked forwards, giving the impression that smoke was being used to cover the advance of infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the tanks fixed the attention of the defence, a platoon multiple of Ukrainian assault troops moved along the treeline to the east of the Russian fighting positions. From there, it began to lay down suppressing fire and advance in pairs. The action drew the attention of the defence, which now recognised a clear tactical play, with a fixing action to its front, and a major assault about to be launched against its flank. The Russian unit began to reposition to prepare for this attack and attempted to win the firefight to the east. Reinforcing the perception that it was about to be assaulted, the Ukrainian artillery then delivered a heavy salvo against the positions, signposting an imminent assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assault when it came did not materialise as the Russian defenders had envisaged. Instead, a platoon of assault troops, having infiltrated forwards along the western flank of the position then advanced rapidly, reaching the defensive positions that had been thinned out in anticipation of the assault to the east. Disorientated and fearing encirclement, the Russian troops began to withdraw towards Rivnopil, abandoning their communications equipment, and leaving five troops behind who were taken prisoner. Ukrainian forces had to exploit the attack quickly, advancing beyond the company position, because its coordinates were pre-registered with Russian artillery which delivered strikes on the trenches. Nevertheless, the rapid collapse of this position forced a redistribution of forces in Rivnopil itself, allowing another brigade to launch an attack on the village and, over several days, drive the Russians to fall back to the tree lines beyond the village. Eventually, Russian troops withdrew across a water obstacle behind the village and blew several agricultural dams to flood the area, establishing a string of ATGW firing posts in the tree lines beyond. The density of the ATGW screen was significant, with approximately four launchers per treeline with 50 missiles. These ATGW teams allow advances to be made past them and then conduct anti-tank ambushes from the flank before attempting to withdraw. They therefore had to be cleared deliberately before any armour could be pushed forwards. With only one obstacle-crossing vehicle available, the Ukrainian units had to pause to consolidate their gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BGdchQT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capture of Novodarivka and Rivnopil took two weeks, with the need to secure flank positions being a prerequisite to further advances. Thus, the rate of advance during this period was one tactical advance for three days of fighting, with each advance moving the line of control approximately 700–1,200 metres forwards. The difference in methods for the various advances produced starkly contrasting results in terms of the level of expenditure for the gains made. Whereas the first tactical advance against Novodarivka cost two companies worth of equipment, losses throughout the attack on Rivnopil were light. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces made adaptations to their methods after these initial exchanges. The emphasis for Ukrainian troops moved to taking ground while conserving equipment and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-russian-lessons-and-adaptation&quot;&gt;II. Russian Lessons and Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical actions around Novodarivka and Rivnopil were largely seen as successes by Russian forces insofar as they inflicted sufficient equipment losses in the early phases so as to degrade the reach of Ukrainian manoeuvre units assuming a consistent rate of loss through the depth of Russia’s defensive positions. At the same time Russian losses in artillery and tanks were high, with the former being more concerning for the Russian command. Russian troop losses, while acceptable for the 58th Combined Arms Army as regards the level of attrition inflicted, were nevertheless unsustainable in the context of a protracted assault unless reinforcement was delivered. In short, Russia achieved tactical success in preventing a breakthrough, and could achieve operational success if it continued to inflict comparable equipment loss on the enemy. Attrition of personnel, however, if it remained consistent into the autumn, posed a risk of operational defeat, while loss of artillery systems threatened a reduction in capacity to attrit Ukrainian troops. Given this dynamic, several adaptations were made to Russian defensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first adaptation was to increase the depth of minefields. Russian minefields had been doctrinally set down as 120-metres deep prior to the offensive. Following the early clashes, it was noted that this depth of mines was breachable by MICLIC and UR-77 to a sufficient depth to enable infantry to get into Russian defensive positions. The aim, therefore, has been to increase the depth of minefields to up to 500 metres, well beyond any rapid breaching capability. This has had a series of secondary implications. First, the Russian logistics systems were organised to equip brigades with sufficient mines to comply with doctrinal templates. The increased depth of the fields means that Russian forces have had insufficient mines to consistently meet this lay down with a density of mines consistent with doctrine. The result has been improvisation of explosive devices, the diversification of the range of mines ceded, and the decreasing regularity of minefields. Other common adaptations have included the laying of two anti-tank mines together – one atop the other – compensating for reduced density by ensuring that vehicles are immobilised by single mine-strikes, even when vehicles are equipped with dozer blades. Prior to this it was not unusual for a tank equipped with a dozer blade to survive three mine strikes before being immobilised by the fourth. Although the consistency of the minefields is now diminished, this has significantly complicated Ukrainian planning and minefield reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have also assessed that the practice of setting pre-registered fires to engage their own positions once they are lost is inefficient and dangerous when the enemy has an artillery advantage in terms of counterbattery detection, range and accuracy. The problems with this method have included the exposure of friendly guns, reduced effectiveness because of the Ukrainian tendency to displace from the fighting positions as soon as possible, and a dependency on communications. To solve these problems the Russians have resorted to preparing their fighting positions for reserve demolition. This is often done with improvised charges. The template is to detonate the first line once Ukrainian troops enter the fighting positions, while Russian forces withdraw through the rear of the trenches. The Russians assess this to be more responsive and assured than the application of artillery fire, and to threaten the boldest and most capable assault troops in Ukrainian formations, deterring attacks on firing posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the increased complexity and extent of the minefields imposes constraints on adversary tempo, and reserve demolition of fighting positions deters the rapid clearing of positions, this fixing of the enemy requires that the Russians have a means to inflict damage on advancing troops. Artillery remains the primary method, but with fewer guns and a requirement to protect them, there is now a greater emphasis placed on other means. One of the foremost methods adopted by the AFRF is the emplacement of ATGW teams to the flanks of their positions, prioritising better trained and motivated troops to conduct anti-tank ambushes. Although there are limited personnel capable and willing to fight forward in this way, there appears to be no shortage of Russian ATGWs, with Ukrainian troops noting that these teams are well stocked with recently manufactured munitions. These troops are also prioritised for directing fire from standoff aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of attack aviation has posed a consistent challenge for Ukrainian forces throughout the counteroffensive. The foremost threat comes from Ka-52 Alligators firing Vikhr and Ataka ATGMs. However, the Russians have also begun mounting Ataka on Mi-35Ms, which also engage in area-effect strikes utilising salvos of lofted S-8 rockets. Aviation strikes are launched from a depth of approximately 8–10 kilometres from the target. Ukrainian forces note that the presence of attack aviation is often heralded by the lifting of GPS jamming among Russian formations, reflecting the need for precise navigation in order to coordinate strikes, given that both armies are using many of the same platforms. Russian helicopter groups are also often flying with an EW-equipped helicopter for defensive purposes, equipped with directional pods aimed at targeting radar. The Russians are having to keep helicopters relatively close to the front, making their forward arming and refuelling points and other infrastructure vulnerable. Nevertheless, shortage of Ukrainian tactical air defence, the low altitude maintained by these assets, and the limited period during which they are in the hover to deliver effects all make countering attack aviation difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military has also determined to tactically exploit opportunities when Ukrainian forces have become bogged down by aggressive flanking with armour to knock out Ukrainian systems. It is worth noting that Russia often loses the tanks used for these counterattacks but they inflict disproportionate damage because the mines constrain Ukrainian vehicles in their ability to manoeuvre or respond. This willingness to counterattack and a decision to defend forwards highlight how training for Russian tank crews and other specialisms has continued to function, generating new crews with some tactical competence compared with the disruption in collective training that has hampered Russian infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also areas of adaptation that reflect a significant improvement in practice and are not specific to the current context. One area of continued Russian adaptation but also improvement is EW. Russian EW has been a major area of investment and Russian EW operators tend to be technically competent. Nevertheless, Russian EW platforms have largely comprised modernised versions of Soviet equipment, which placed each type of effector on a single large platform, with formations of platforms providing a range of EW effects. The vulnerability of this approach has been recognised by the AFRF given the targeting of specific emitters. This has, in the first instance, led to the much more subtle employment of large platforms such as Zhitel R330-Zh. It has also driven a preference for the mounting of antenna on light platforms, or the dismounting and distribution of antenna that can be placed to cover tactical positions. The channelling of effects through antenna can therefore be carried out by EW suites that are not tied to the emitting signature. The loss of antenna when they are targeted is a cost that the Russian military feels it can bear. This is a transition in progress and so is not a uniform approach. Nevertheless, the preference to use systems such as Pole-21 and to treat them as disposable systems in order to provide wide-area protection from UAV strikes reflects a change in mindset, and how the Russian EW branch is learning from the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting area of conceptual innovation – underway before Ukraine’s offensive but accelerated by the dynamics at play today – is a transition of Russian fires doctrine. Based on statistics gathered during the Second World War, Russian artillery had established levels of fire that were assessed to deliver specified effects against defined targets. For example, 720 rounds were assessed to be necessary to achieve the suppression of a platoon fighting position. This is the basis on which Russian fires operated in the opening phases of their invasion of Ukraine. It is an approach that the Russians now assess to be non-viable. First, the Russian forces lack the ammunition to sustain this volume of fire. Second, the logistics enabling such a volume of fire is too vulnerable to detection and long-range precision strike. Third, the loss of counterbattery radar and barrel wear have meant that this mass approach to fire suppression is of diminishing effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general conclusion that Russian fires doctrine is non-viable has caused a doubling down on the concept of the Reconnaissance Fires Complex (RFC) with effect being prioritised over volume. While manufacture of a range of Russian munitions has become constrained, production of Krasnopol 152-mm laser-guided shells has been prioritised, with newly manufactured shells being widely available across the front. The use of UAVs to designate for Krasnopol has also been increased. Lancet has also been used extensively, along with FPV UAVs, to strike lead elements of Ukrainian units. Flown in complexes with ISR UAVs, these effects provide precision. The Russian military is, of course, continuing to rely heavily on MLRS, 120-mm mortars and other imprecise systems, while corner-cutting in the production of its munitions is becoming apparent. Nevertheless, the trend appears to be towards maximising accuracy and reducing the number of rounds necessary to achieve the desired outcome rather than resorting to saturation fire. This is a concerning trend, as over time it will likely significantly improve Russian artillery. The growth in the complexity, diversity and density of Russian UAVs is concerning. The gains in both effect of the warhead and the economy of its design between Lancet-3 and Lancet-3M demonstrate how the Russians are actively improving their fielded equipment. Modifications to loitering munitions to achieve noise reduction on Shahed-136 and to harden navigation are also notable. Here, it is clear that the AFRF are actively learning from Ukrainian forces, and in doing so, reducing the extent of some Ukrainian advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling the RFC depends on communications. Here too, the Russian military is making important progress. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russian forces depended heavily on bespoke military radios. In the scramble for equipment late last year, a wide array of civilian systems was employed. Conceptually, however, the Russians now appear to have moved on, increasingly relying on military bearer networks but app-based services for encoding and accessing data. The result is that a system such as Strelets can provide a 3G connection to multiple devices operating applications that are intuitive for civilian users. This separation of bearers and services is nascent and the security and robustness of the systems being tested must be doubted. Nevertheless, the reduced training burden of this approach and the improvements in fire direction already achieved mean that the AFRF are likely to continue to push in this direction and increasingly systematise their communications architecture around these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-ukrainian-challenges-and-requirements&quot;&gt;III. Ukrainian Challenges and Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian adaptation to overcome these challenges is sensitive. Instead, therefore, this report will outline several areas of persistent challenge that Ukraine’s international partners could focus on to refine the support they offer to the AFU. Given the trajectory of the offensive it is now clear that major ground combat operations will continue in 2024 and so improving support to Ukraine’s force generation process now is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as Ukrainian forces have been able to make progress during the offensive it has been dependent on fires superiority. Outranging the Russians, combined with having better means for detecting enemy artillery and carrying out counterbattery fires, is an essential Ukrainian advantage. This advantage is limited in its duration by the serviceability of Ukrainian artillery pieces, the availability of replacement barrels, and the continued supply of 155-mm ammunition. With 17 artillery systems in operation, it is evident that replacement barrels cannot be produced for all systems, because of the shortage of barrel machines across NATO. It is therefore vital that Ukraine’s international partners invest to ensure that there is a sustainable supply for a consolidated artillery park, focusing on maintaining a more limited range of guns at greater scale. If this is not achieved, it will undermine the preconditions for Ukraine to continue to make progress next year. The protection of guns from Lancet-3M and other loitering munitions is also becoming a critical priority and research into methods of force protection should be accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of sustaining combat platforms provided by Ukraine’s international partners is also important for protected mobility. There is a diverse range of vehicles that have been donated, from MRAPs to IFVs. Some are no longer in production, while others are still in widespread service. Ukrainian troops note that Western-provided platforms are vastly superior to their Soviet-legacy protected mobility platforms for one fundamental reason: crew survivability. Whereas for a Soviet mechanised section, its BMP was its primary weapons system, and so Soviet planners treated as synonymous the loss of the BMP with the loss of the section, Western armies treat mechanisation as an addition to basic infanteering. Protected mobility is aimed at delivering infantry to their objective, which the infantry then assault. This difference in mindset, combined with a different approach to losses, means that there is a heavy emphasis in Western platforms on the survivability of dismounts even if the vehicle is mission killed. By contrast with Soviet-legacy platforms, the compromise of the vehicle’s armour is also usually catastrophic for those inside it. Life support systems are a secondary consideration. Given that Russia has greater mass than Ukraine, the accumulation of experience and longevity of troops is strategically vital for the AFU. But while Western-supplied protected mobility may be doing a good job at enabling their dismounts to survive – as demonstrated by the infantry still making it to Novodarivka despite their vehicles falling victim to mines and enemy fires – there is still a high loss rate of platforms. These platforms are often mobility killed rather than destroyed. But rebuilding them demands a consistent provision of spare parts. That is challenging for vehicles that are no longer in production. Again, therefore, Ukraine’s international partners need to ensure that the industrial support is available to make the Ukrainian military sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth of exploitation of the conditions created by fires superiority is significantly limited by the capacity for minefield reconnaissance. At present, Ukrainian operations are inherently limited in their tempo by the fact that as Russian minelaying becomes less and less uniform and omnipresent, it is necessary to thoroughly recce ahead of any major push lest equipment loss becomes unacceptable. This cannot be carried out in depth and often relies on dismounted engineers. It is therefore very difficult to plan operations beyond the defences immediately in front of Ukrainian positions, meaning that breaches forwards are difficult to exploit. A note of caution is that because of the deviation from doctrine, minefields differ in their actual contours from what is shown on Russian plans. Assistance, therefore, should focus on equipment and techniques for detecting mines. One critical area that could assist is the use of algorithmic image analysis that could be conducted using UAVs to map minefields more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning remains a significant challenge for Ukrainian units because of the limited availability of trained staff officers. The rapid expansion of the AFU with the mobilisation of civilians means that there are many more units than staffs. Although brigades have technical specialists able to run the communications and support systems they need, and often have skilled commanders, planning shops and experienced G3 staff are scarce. This limits the scale at which brigades can combine arms, especially during offensive operations where planning times are compressed. This was an area of support identified as a requirement as early as June 2022 but Ukraine’s partners have not effectively provided it. It is vital that any staff training that is offered is not premised on putting Ukrainian staff through academic courses aimed at creating NATO staff officers. A relatively small number of staff applying NATO processes will have to revert to the mean once they are back in Ukraine and working with the bulk of a staff who has not received training on the same procedures. Instead, training should be based on observation of how Ukrainian brigade staffs operate and the tools they depend on and then offering training on techniques that maximise the efficiency of how those staffs function within this context. The training must be bespoke. Ideally, it would be of a whole staff. It must also accurately represent the communications and ISR tools employed by Ukrainian brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of critical priority is training junior leaders to conduct tactical battle drills. Again, attrition and the expansion of the Ukrainian military mean that junior leaders with deep expertise in offensive operations are not universally available across Ukraine’s formations. This manifests in referring of combat management to higher echelons, where there are more experienced officers. This drives the continuation of combat management at higher echelon and limits mission command. Additional pressure is placed on the brigade, limiting the scale and complexity at which it can operate. This was demonstrated during the attack on Rivnopil. Only 3% of Ukrainian artillery-fire missions are smoke missions. As demonstrated during the assault on the company position north of Rivnopil, smoke can be extremely useful in confusing the enemy ground force and obscuring assault actions. But smoke also has the effect of obscuring the view from UAVs which higher Ukrainian echelons and command posts use to coordinate activity and conduct combat management. Commanders persistently prioritise maintaining their own understanding of the battlefield over laying down smoke and concealing their personnel’s movements. Given the criticality of rapid application of artillery to support movement, this prioritisation is understandable, but it also reflects limitations in the ability of the brigade to trust tactical commanders to execute actions when not directed by high headquarters with greater situational awareness. Given the saturation of the headquarters that results, it is vital to train junior leaders, in combination with expanding staff capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where training needs to be refined is in gearing the support provided outside Ukraine with the AFU’s training structure inside Ukraine. At present, individual training conducted outside of Ukraine builds upwards from individual skills. There is not enough time in the course to move on to collective training at the company, while the safety cases on Western ranges require certification of individual skills before more complex activities can be trained. This approach to safety may make sense in peacetime for Western armies. For Ukraine, it simply transfers risk from training to operations. The reality is that individual training can be delivered by the AFU in Ukraine. What cannot easily be delivered is collective training. This is because the AFU does collective training “in the unit”. Soldiers who are certified in their individual skills by training centres are assigned to units and it is up to the brigade commander to carry out training activities. If a brigade is fighting a sector of the front, it must establish a training area behind the frontline and rotate troops back to exercise. This limits the scale of training to company-sized activities at maximum, with the level of training undertaken entirely dependent on the intensity of operational activity at the front. This approach to force generation means that most Ukrainian battalions are generating approximately two platoons of troops which are considered fully capable of leading assault actions. While the rest of the battalion provides reinforcement, and the ability to hold ground, the size at which formations can conduct offensive action is severely constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collective training outside Ukraine is hampered by the fact that because of the safety culture in NATO, Ukrainian troops cannot train as they fight. Moreover, many NATO tactics either require a level of training that is not feasible within the timeframe available, or are not validated in the modern threat environment. A good example here is that Ukrainian training emphasises the threat from artillery even when teaching squad tactics. For Western armies that build skills incrementally, artillery is introduced into training after basic infantry tactics are mastered. More complex training involving artillery cannot be conducted until troops are certified in their basic skills to be able to exercise safely. For Ukraine, however, troops who are not prepared to deal with artillery are not prepared for the fight. Another example is the shaping effect of UAVs. Most NATO training areas are severely restricted in the types of UAVs that can be flown and how they can be used. This is because of fears that UAVs will malfunction and fly into controlled airspace, such as the area around civilian airports. The problem is that for collective training above company, Ukrainian troops need to be prepared for and practise tactics in an environment where there are up to 25 UAVs observing their movements, while UAVs are also critical to their own combat management. Thus, on partner training grounds where they could conduct collective training that is hard to carry out in Ukraine, they are prevented by regulation from either actually practising and refining their own command and control procedures, or exercising tactics that realistically represent the threat. This gearing of training to meet Ukraine’s needs is critical if future rounds of mobilised Ukrainian troops are to be properly prepared to continue the liberation of their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational analysis of tactical actions during Ukraine’s summer offensive reveals a range of important areas where Ukraine’s international partners can refine their support. Improvements in international training and other assistance will not have an impact on the current offensive. They will be critical however for Ukraine next year in its next round of force generation. Confidence that forces can be regenerated and that equipment can be repaired and sustained is also important for the AFU in shaping its planning for the current phases of operations. Delays in improvements to training or the industrial investment in making Ukrainian capabilities sustainable will similarly not have an immediate effect, but will impose a considerable cost on Ukraine next year. Some of the challenges currently limiting Ukrainian operations are a direct consequence of the failure to address identified requirements with sufficient alacrity in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to recognise that Russian forces are fighting more competently and with reasonable tenacity in the defence. Although they are losing ground, Russian forces are largely conducting orderly withdrawals from positions and are effectively slowing down and thereby managing Ukrainian advances while imposing a considerable cost in equipment. Another important point is that scarcity of systems that Russia had previously depended on to offer advantages are causing significant adaptation in the Russian armed forces and some of the solutions arrived at are likely to be continued and built on after the war. Most consequential of these are the move to application-based command and control services, agnostic of military bearers, and the shift in fires to emphasise effect for rounds fired rather than volume of rounds delivered on the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military has learned from initial setbacks during its summer offensive. Even if a rapid breakthrough has proven difficult, the attrition being afflicted on Russian forces will see a degradation in the defence over time, and once a critical mass of losses is reached, that degradation may become non-linear. Given that it is unlikely, however, that this offensive will deliver a decisive liberation of ground, both Russia and Ukraine now face the question of how to regenerate combat power for the next round of fighting, into 2024 and beyond. For Russia, mobilising people is simple, but providing trainers and equipment for them remains a bottleneck. The conditions under which mobilisation is conducted are also constrained by Russian political considerations. Although it would make most sense to mobilise personnel before they are needed, Moscow consistently defers taking critical decisions until there is an immediate need. For Ukraine, there is first the question of how to retain as much of its experienced forces as possible, and second how to expand the scale at which its forces can operate by working with its international partners to improve collective training. Whether Ukraine’s partners can overcome their habitual sluggishness in doing what they have identified as necessary will be critical in determining whether Ukraine can maintain the initiative into the next fighting season in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the lead-times involved, one question that should dominate the thinking of Ukraine’s international partners today is the dynamics of winter warfare. Last year, Russia prepared its troops poorly for winter conditions and suffered disproportionately as a result. Ukraine’s current offensive operations are likely to continue into the autumn, but the question should be asked whether actions can be taken now to maintain the pressure through the winter. It is highly likely that Russia will hope that the winter will cause Ukraine to pause its offensive efforts, while Moscow will likely return to the attempted destruction of energy and reticulation infrastructure across Ukraine. It is now clear that the conflict will protract. It is therefore important that Ukraine’s international partners invest now to give Ukraine protracted advantages. Failure to make timely adjustment to support will come at a heavy price in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;invisible-to-the-digital-eye&quot;&gt;Invisible to the digital eye&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an underground command centre, an intelligence analyst sits at a computer terminal. The analyst is presented with a series of aerial photographs taken by uncrewed air systems and satellites of potential targets – ammunition dumps, vehicle parks, and defensive positions. Due to the huge volume of imagery and videos being produced by the suite of aerial sensors, target recognition software sifts through the millions of frames searching for objects of potential interest. The software has been trained to identify armoured vehicles, aircraft, and command posts. The analyst then works through the pile of indications and passes them to targeting specialists to decide on further action. However, the software fails to flag a squadron of enemy fighter aircraft sitting on a rural airfield, which continue to target friendly troops and destroy vehicles and equipment. Coloured patches designed to trick target recognition software and present false negatives have been attached to the jets. Consequently, they are not flagged to the analyst and remain hidden among the noise of the gigabytes of aerial footage. This is one potential threat which is raised by the spectre of adversarial AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems are becoming increasingly critical assets in commerce, transportation, and the military. As the role of military AI increases to manage ever-growing volumes of data, a potential vulnerability presents itself. Instead of targeting physical infrastructure with missiles and bombs, it is possible to attack the algorithms, machine learning models and networks which support the military decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-security-concerns&quot;&gt;AI security concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversarial attacks are a class of techniques that analyse the parameters of a machine learning model (such as a neural network) to calculate a series of changes to an input that causes a misclassification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, they are attacks which are designed to lead the model to make a mistake. Some have argued that the secret to winning the AI war might rest not in making the most impressive weapons but in “mastering the disquieting treachery of the software.” The proliferation of defence and security AI use cases has garnered much more attention than the potential vulnerabilities in the software. Developers are prioritising getting their AI systems to work in the first place, with security and adversarial activity taking a back seat. This is not an advisable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversarial AI was first discussed and identified as a threat in 2004. At this time, the focus was not on the defence or security realm, but the more innocuous subject of email spam. In this case, a machine learning algorithm was pitted against a spam filter and was able to learn how to write spam emails which would get through the filter by using identified “good words.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first conference on AI security followed in 2007. There was a dearth of activity between 2008 and 2014 with a spike of research papers published on the subject, ostensibly because of the first successful attacks on deep learning algorithms. Since 2015, research into adversarial AI has risen substantially, with more than 1000 papers published in 2019 and more than 1500 published in 2020. Multiple papers are being published almost every day on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the worst cases, AI systems may be tricked into targeting the wrong people, or causing uncrewed systems to malfunction and stop dead in their tracks. More widely, artificial intelligence is being used for administrative and organisational tasks within the national security apparatus as well as in cyber security. These are all areas where if a machine learning model learns the wrong thing, does the wrong thing, or reveals the wrong thing, there may be very damaging consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-vectors&quot;&gt;Attack vectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems that process images are the most commonly attacked, although others such as speech recognition, malware detection, and sentiment analysis have also been victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways machine learning models can be attacked. These attacks may be designed with intimate knowledge of a system, which are known as white-box attacks. Attacks designed without knowledge of the internal workings of the systems are black-box attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;poisoning&quot;&gt;Poisoning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poisoning attacks see intentionally malicious training data fed into machine learning models ahead of deployment. Only a very small amount of data needs to be affected to influence the whole model, making this a significant threat. An example of poisoning would be mislabelling a series of harmful images as benign whilst adding a physical identifier such as a small red square in one corner.The model then learns that images with a red square are safe, and they will make it through the filter even if they are not safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evasion&quot;&gt;Evasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evasion attacks are similar to poisoning attacks but take place after deployment at test time. Neural networks have been shown time and again to be easily fooled by changes to images that are often imperceptible to the human eye, but will mean that the AI system classifies objects incorrectly. This may be changing a few pixels in an image resulting in a system classifying a cat as a dog. In a defence context, an armoured vehicle being classified as a civilian car, or vice versa, may have catastrophic ramifications if a targeting decision is made without meaningful human input. Another well-known example is researchers at McAfee putting a small sticker on a 35mph speed limit sign which tricked a Tesla into believing the limit was 85mph and accelerating to 50mph above the speed limit. A similar experiment where two bits of tape were put onto a stop sign led the autonomous driving software to read it as a 45mph road sign instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extraction-and-inference-attacks&quot;&gt;Extraction and inference attacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extraction attacks seek to replicate a machine learning model by feeding it inputs and logging the outputs. In other words, malicious queries will be used to expose details of the model’s internal details. Attackers may be targeting the model itself, or the data on which it has been trained – allowing sensitive information to be extracted. In the case of businesses this may be proprietary information and in the security sphere, it may be classified or otherwise sensitive information. Successful extraction attacks may then lead to carefully crafted evasion attacks, moving from a black box to a white box scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-worried-should-we-be&quot;&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing focus on the subject of adversarial AI with many publications highlighting particular vulnerabilities with machine vision, large language models, and neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the move from laboratory setting to deploying AAI in the real world (especially a battlefield) is very difficult. Most research to date on the topic of adversarial camouflage, such as the colourful patches mentioned in the introductory vignette, has taken place in a sterile environment. AI has been fed static images with the patches pasted on top – they have not been placed on real aircraft and tested, as the authors themselves admit. Patches would need to be effective whilst the airborne sensor flies all the way over, which means it gets a view of the target at numerous angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real world research has been more problematic, for both “friendly” and “enemy” forces. Some image recognition models failed when presented with a desert environment. Equally, the altitude and standoff distance of the sensor and the size of the target vehicle in the camera’s aperture also affected how effective adversarial patches were. One experiment found that even with adversarial patches woven into camouflage paint, AI models would be able to correctly identify a mobile vehicle every 3.3 seconds in full-motion video, enough to track it accurately. Indeed, the same research concluded that the adversary would need to print or paint adversarial patches the size of football fields to be truly deceptive, which limits the tactic to stationary high-value targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Models can be tricked by feeding them minutely perturbed static images and audio, but this becomes much more difficult in the real world where changing perspectives and different types of noise make it difficult to keep up a ruse. It is not practical for an adversary to inject noise directly into a sensor. Indeed, adversarial attacks appear to be much more suited to disguising a static object, rather than one that is moving, like a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of adversarial examples requires overcoming several other challenges. There is difficulty in developing a generalisable model that will work on numerous vectors. It is not economical to make bespoke solutions every single time, unless a target is particularly valuable. Controlling the size of perturbations can be difficult as it is not known how large the aperture is. If the perturbation is too small it will not work, and if it is too large it may get spotted. Nevertheless, these adversarial examples could present a significant vulnerability to future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-focus-and-regulation&quot;&gt;Lack of focus and regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI developers are striving to get their models to simply work, with little consideration for the robustness of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are no agreed standards for the robustness or security of machine learning models. There are several private endeavours such as the Microsoft and Mitre Adversarial ML Threat Matrix and the “Cleverhans” Python library on GitHub used to benchmark the robustness of ML models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, agreed standards and regulations for AI security will help shape the research field, allow best practices to be shared, and give users peace of mind and trust in the systems. The UK Government’s AI White Paper notes the importance of systems functioning in a robust and secure way throughout their lifecycle. The International Organisation for Standardisation is also developing a series of standards for the safety, transparency, and robustness of ML models. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has also published guidance on the security of ML, offering a number of principles for practitioners, decision makers and IT security professionals. In the US, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) programme which aims to create broad-based defences that work against numerous attack vectors. Previous defences were designed for specific, pre-defined attacks which limits their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-be-done&quot;&gt;What can be done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might governments and militaries look to prevent adversarial attacks and mitigate their effects should they take place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional cybersecurity, vulnerabilities can be patched and continue to be used by customers. This approach does not work for machine learning models. If a model is poisoned, it will have to be retrained from an earlier untainted version which can be very costly. Equally, hosting the model on an encrypted cloud is no use if the model has been poisoned during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversarial robustness is the term used to describe a model’s ability to resist being tricked or exploited. When models move from using training data to new data, the model’s performance can change. As such, exposing models to adversarial examples when they are being developed can allow them to be strengthened against such attacks. One difficulty is trying to conceive of every different type of attack. AI models are coded by humans who define their parameters. If the attack is something that has not been foreseen, the ML model will struggle to reconcile this with what it knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training data might also be sanitised. Ensuring that the collection and labelling of data is thorough and accurate is a way to prevent the insertion of poisoned data. However, many larger models rely on massive scale data scraping from the internet. Ensuring that models contain no bad data is a huge ask and may undermine the point of training the model in the first place if it becomes a very human-centric and analogue endeavour. In some cases, another AI system might be used as a filter. Moreover, extensive testing on a series of discrete datasets can help make a model more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resource cost of attacks should also be considered. A white box attack is less costly for an adversary than a black box attack. Without prior knowledge of the system, an adversary must develop its own version of the model which takes time, effort, and money. Time conducting reconnaissance on another party’s model also increases the chance of such efforts being noticed, which will cause a defensive reaction. However, it is likely that the adversary will be part way between the two. There is value in trying to make attacks uneconomical to the adversary, by denying them information about systems. Actively looking for adversarial attacks by monitoring models for failure patterns can also be a productive route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, research has found that there is no defence that cannot be overcome by a specialised attack. The field is moving quickly so keeping abreast of developments is important and will give situational awareness to developers and users. However, adversarial attacks are inherently brittle and appropriate pre-processing and well-designed models can effectively mitigate most effects. A growing library of resources to counter adversarial attacks can be found on GitHub. The Alan Turing Institute has also published guidance on responsible design for AI systems in the public sector which remains relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still time to address the risks posed by adversarial AI. As is often the case, most progress is being made in the private sector, but it is government who will need to legislate or mandate appropriate standards – in close partnership with industry and academia. Defence and security professionals should be alive to the threats posed by adversarial AI, and the responsibility of mitigating those risks should not rest with developers alone.&lt;/p&gt;

In early 2023, BuzzFeed rolled out ChatGPT-fueled quizzes, travel articles, and a recipe recommendation chatbot named Botatouille. Many others are scoping longer-term strategies, like the Washington Post, which announced the creation of two internal teams in May 2023 to explore future uses for AI. Writers, on the other hand, have generally been more cautious: both the Writers Guild of America, East and the Gizmodo Media Group Union condemned G/O Media in July 2023 for publishing AI-generated articles without first consulting editorial staffers, warning “unreliable AI programs notorious for creating falsehoods and plagiarizing the work of real writers” were “an existential threat to journalism.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some AI developers are attempting to get ahead of the controversy by framing their chatbots as value-added features for the news industry — in other words, helpers, not displacers, of human journalists. Over the past few months, Google has reportedly met with both national and local news outlets to pitch Genesis, a generative AI chatbot that can draft headlines, social media posts, and articles, framed as a productivity booster. In July 2023, OpenAI partnered with the American Journalism Project to provide $5 million in direct grants to enable local newsrooms to test-drive AI. The same month, it struck an agreement with the Associated Press to access archived articles through 1985 to train large language models (LLMs) in exchange for both licensing fees and experimental use of OpenAI software. But these limited partnerships gloss over technology’s strained history with newsrooms, one where most journalists have received no compensation for the use of their work to train algorithms even as digital ad-tech monopolies have contributed to their long-term decline in marketing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common refrain has been that newsrooms must evolve to accommodate technological advancements, but this characterization is neither accurate nor fair. Even publishers that have adapted to the whims of powerful technology corporations have faced repercussions for doing so. For example, some digital news outlets redesigned their distribution strategies to capitalize on social media’s peak growth in the early 2010s, allowing individual users to view and share article links on decentralized channels in exchange for a steady stream of clicks. BuzzFeed, which initially gained traction through social media virality instead of traditional print subscriptions, epitomized this novel business model. But when Facebook unilaterally modified its content ranking algorithm in January 2018 to prioritize advertiser and connection-based engagement, which reduced visibility to external news websites, early movers like BuzzFeed were hit the hardest. BuzzFeed abruptly closed its Pulitzer-winning news division in April 2023 citing revenue shortfalls, while outlets like the New York Times, which had diversified its income stream with traditional subscriptions, were less vulnerable to opaque decisions by large technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sustainability of news cannot fall on publishers alone; large digital platforms must share responsibility to understand and address their sizable impacts on society. Yet search engine and social media companies operate with relatively few U.S. legal requirements to build fairness and transparency into algorithms, protect sensitive personal information when serving personalized advertisements, engage in ad-tech practices that promote fair competition with news publishers, and mitigate the spread of harmful content online. Without bright-line U.S. regulations for technology companies, the recent acceleration in AI adoption presents at least four major risks that could severely undermine both news availability and public access to information in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The sustainability of news cannot fall on publishers alone; large digital platforms must share responsibility to understand and address their sizable impacts on society.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-search-engines-may-adopt-ai-to-answer-user-queries-which-would-significantly-decrease-web-traffic-to-external-news-websites&quot;&gt;(1) Search engines may adopt AI to answer user queries, which would significantly decrease web traffic to external news websites.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspapers are in a reciprocal but largely unequal relationship with search engines. Google, which controls approximately 92 percent of the search engine market worldwide, sends news websites approximately 24 billion views per month. This may account for over one-third of publishers’ online traffic, which is a critical metric for digital advertisements. Shortly after the research release of ChatGPT, Google and Microsoft both announced plans to harness generative AI to directly answer user queries in the form of paragraphs. Unlike the current version of ChatGPT, which is not connected to the internet and only reflects historical training data prior to 2021, Microsoft’s Bing (which incorporates ChatGPT) and Google’s Bard both intend to derive responses from real-time data across the internet ecosystem, which could enable them to analyze breaking news. In this manner, LLMs could increase the gatekeeper power of dominant search engines that aim to maximize user engagement or screen time on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should LLMs direct fewer readers to click through Google to external websites, digital news organizations risk losing a major source of online visibility, audience engagement, and advertising revenue. Going forward, if news publishers cannot reliably count on search engine traffic in the long term, websites may increasingly depend on paywalls to draw revenue independent of large technology corporations. In 2019, 76 percent of U.S. newspapers employed paywalls, compared to 60 percent in 2017. Many substantially hiked subscription rates during this time frame as their advertising revenues simultaneously faltered. Paid subscriptions can help some news organizations build around loyal reader bases, especially if their content is specialized or exclusive. But the subscription pot is not large enough to sustain all publications, and smaller or more niche publications are disproportionately more likely to fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also negative societal externalities to walling off access to accurate and relevant information on topics including climate change, public health, and civil rights. Stephen Bates, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, warns that the rising prevalence of paywalls could create “income rather than geographic news deserts.” In other words, individuals who cannot afford multiple newspaper subscriptions may be more likely to believe misinformation and lower-quality content — whether human- or AI-generated — that they view on social media or search engines for free. In a more fragmented internet, people are more likely to exist within their ideological bubbles, as chatbots cannot offer diverse perspectives like a human journalist can. Social media algorithms, which typically recommend or promote content based on past browsing activity or personal interests, further reinforce echo chambers based on user engagement and not the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-social-media-platforms-are-using-ai-to-automatically-rank-posts-which-enables-the-mass-de-prioritization-of-legitimate-news-outlets-in-favor-of-fake-spammy-or-manipulative-user-uploaded-content&quot;&gt;(2) Social media platforms are using AI to automatically rank posts, which enables the mass de-prioritization of legitimate news outlets in favor of fake, spammy, or manipulative user-uploaded content.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the internet age, news outlets controlled public attention in centralized destinations, effectively serving as the primary window for mass audiences to understand current events. But social media platforms democratized publishing in the past two decades by allowing anyone to gain international virality, transforming content-ranking algorithms into the new gatekeepers of attention and relevance. Newspapers face legal liability for publishing defamatory or false claims, but social media platforms generally do not. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act allows “online computer services” immunity over most types of content that third-party users upload. Subsequently, many social media platforms employ AI recommendation systems that automatically rank content based on users’ predicted interests or personal connections, with the goal of maximizing screen time instead of collective public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Facebook chose to algorithmically de-prioritize public news content in January 2018, external news websites lost visitors. Within six months of that algorithmic change, BuzzFeed’s traffic decreased by 13 percent and ABC News’s by 12 percent, according to the analytics firm Comscore. The Pew Research Center found that only 31 percent of U.S. adults reported consuming news on Facebook by 2022, compared to 66 percent in 2016. Facebook’s power to singlehandedly decrease automated referrals to news websites, coupled with the platform’s first-ever decrease in U.S. users in 2022, had the indirect effect of deepening many publishers’ reliance on Google for web visitors and their ensuing digital advertising dollars. Furthermore, as Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed in 2021, the 2018 algorithmic policy shift may have harmed not only the bottom line of newspapers but also their perceived legitimacy within the social media ecosystem itself. In a leaked internal memo, company data scientists discovered the decision “had unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news,” since the algorithm frequently ranked user-generated misinformation higher than trustworthy publisher-generated news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to text, the widespread availability of generative AI tools allows any internet user to easily post doctored images, video, and audio online, which could facilitate the impersonation of newsrooms or even threaten the safety of individual journalists. In 2022, Graphika detected AI-generated videos on Facebook simulating a nonexistent news agency called Wolf News, which appeared to broadcast messaging supporting the Chinese Communist Party. In 2018, far-right groups spread deepfake pornography videos containing journalist Rana Ayyub’s manipulated image in retaliation for her investigative reporting, subjecting her to years-long harassment, doxxing, and death threats. There are no U.S. federal laws that specifically regulate deepfake AI technologies, so every social media platform, app store, search engine, and online forum treats this content differently. Meta’s policy is to remove synthetic media that “would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not” or that “merges, replaces, or superimposes content on a video, making it appear to be authentic.” However, the company exempts “parody or satire.” Furthermore, as deepfake imagery becomes more realistic and commonplace, synthetic media policies will likely become progressively difficult to enforce. Content detection algorithms must continuously advance, too; otherwise, the internet ecosystem may become a more perilous space for public-facing journalists, with audiences who are less receptive to the information they convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-chatbots-cannot-perform-the-same-functions-as-a-human-journalist-but-news-executives-may-still-leverage-ai-to-streamline-operations-or-justify-workforce-reductions-in-the-short-term&quot;&gt;(3) Chatbots cannot perform the same functions as a human journalist, but news executives may still leverage AI to streamline operations or justify workforce reductions in the short term.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, artificial general intelligence cannot match human writers and editors in technical capability. LLMs like ChatGPT are best equipped to automate specific functions like summarizing documents — but not advanced editorial skills like relationship building with sources, original analytical thinking, contextual understanding, or long-form creative writing. LLMs predict patterns and word associations based on their training datasets but, during large-scale deployments, are known to contain factual inaccuracies or even generate fake stories altogether. In February 2023, Penn State researchers also found that LLMs can spit out plagiarized text, whether by inadequately paraphrasing or copying training material verbatim. Such behavior is doubly problematic for some models, like ChatGPT, which do not attribute or cite sources by default. In addition, since many LLMs build upon text from online websites and forums — many of which have historically excluded or exhibited hostility toward individuals based on factors like gender identity, race, or sexual orientation — their automated outputs can reproduce broader societal biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The internet ecosystem may become a more perilous space for public-facing journalists, with audiences who are less receptive to the information they convey.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, some corporate news executives may leverage LLMs to cut expenditures in the short term and not simply to boost productivity or create new value in the long term. When G/O Media, the parent company of Gizmodo and Deadspin, published AI-generated entertainment articles in July 2023, it attracted high public backlash over their many factual errors, lack of human editorial oversight, and overall substandard quality of writing. CNET paused its use of LLMs in January 2023 after a significant number of errors and plagiarized language were detected within its AI-generated articles, which the outlet admitted to having “quietly” published for months without clear disclosures. As historian David Walsh puts it, “The issue with AI is not that it will actually replace us, but that it will be used to justify catastrophic business decisions that will destroy entire industries precisely because AI cannot actually replace us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, OpenAI, OpenResearch, and University of Pennsylvania researchers estimated that LLMs could affect job functions for 80 percent of the U.S. workforce — with writers, reporters, and journalists among the most vulnerable. Moreover, MIT, London School of Economics, and Boston University researchers detected a negative correlation between AI adoption and job recruitment between 2010 and 2018: for every 1 percent increase in AI deployment, companies cut hiring by approximately 1 percent. It is hardly surprising that CNET staffers cited long-term uncertainty from AI as one reason for unionizing in May 2023 or that the Writers’ Guild of America (WGA) proposed banning AI in screenwriting and prohibiting creative material from training algorithms when striking the same month. (A later proposal from the WGA contemplated allowing studios to use AI to craft screenplays but with human employees retaining full economic residuals and credits.) The impact of AI on the workforce is not simply a long-term issue; many writers and journalists are already facing a significant amount of labor uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-generative-ai-can-increase-the-prevalence-of-spammy-or-false-content-online-which-obscures-legitimate-news-and-funnels-advertising-dollars-away-from-traditional-publishers&quot;&gt;(4) Generative AI can increase the prevalence of spammy or false content online, which obscures legitimate news and funnels advertising dollars away from traditional publishers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While present-day LLMs cannot compose original prose comparable to that of a highly skilled journalist, they are well suited to churning out low-cost, low-quality, and high-volume clickbait. While clickbait production does not help most traditional newsrooms, it benefits made-for-advertising (MFA) websites, which are spammy, traffic-driven sites designed solely to maximize page views and advertising dollars. As of August 2023, analytics firm NewsGuard discovered at least 437 websites that deployed generative AI to churn out large quantities of fictitious articles — many containing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, unreliable medical advice, or fabricated product reviews. These sites draw clicks with headlines ranging from “Can lemon cure skin allergy?” to “I’m sorry for the confusion, as an AI language model I don’t have access to external information or news updates beyond my knowledge cutoff data. However, based on the given article title, an eye-catching news headline could be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The impact of AI on the workforce is not simply a long-term issue; many writers and journalists are already facing a significant amount of labor uncertainty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MFA websites provide no material public benefits but, without proper safeguards, could create significant negative externalities in an AI era. LLMs are designed to generate outcomes at scale — a perfect fit for content farms whose sole purpose is search engine optimization (SEO) through nonsensical keywords, summarized or verbatim text from news sources, and highly repetitive spam. These articles often list fake authors or anonymous bylines and appear to lack human oversight. The rising prevalence of AI-generated spam could decrease public trust and understanding of critical current events, especially if it distorts the market for real news and obscures legitimate newsrooms as centralized sources of information. It will become exponentially harder for human journalists to disseminate trustworthy information when the internet ecosystem is stuffed with bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content farms divert more than user attention away from legitimate news websites; they also cost valuable digital advertising dollars. The AI-generated websites that NewsGuard detected were stuffed with programmatic advertisements, including from major brands like Subaru and Citigroup — almost all of which were automatically routed through Google’s Ad Exchange. Google Ads maintains policies against servicing “spammy automatically-generated content” but does not publicly reveal the results of its placement algorithm or content review outcomes. In June 2023, an Adalytics study showed that Google frequently served video ads on lower-quality clickbait or junk websites without the awareness of its buy-side advertising clients. The same month, the Association of National Advertisers estimated that about $13 billion in digital advertising revenue is algorithmically funneled into clickbait MFA websites, which amounts to approximately 15 percent of the total $88 billion pie that marketers spend on automated ad exchanges every year. If not for the proliferation of AI-generated MFA content, those funds could otherwise provide a much-needed lifeline for legitimate news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-of-policy-approaches&quot;&gt;Analysis of Policy Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive legislative push to compel large technology platforms that host news content to pay publishers is playing out all over the world. In June 2023, the Canadian Parliament enacted the Online News Act, which requires designated search engines and social media platforms to pay news publishers for any external article links or quotes their users view or share. Australia and the European Union respectively passed the News Media Bargaining Code (NMBC) and Copyright Directive in 2021, and legislators in Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and California have either proposed or are actively considering similar measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s parliamentary budget officer predicts that news organizations could share an additional $329 million in annual revenue after the Online News Act becomes effective. However, this figure is a small fraction of the estimated $4.9 billion that Canadian news outlets lost from 2010 to 2022, and it will never be realized if Google and Meta choose to boycott the law altogether. Just hours after the passage of the Online News Act, Meta announced plans to permanently shut down news access for Canadian users. Shortly after, Google stated it too would block all Canadian news links on its search engine. Their responses should not come as a surprise: directly prior to Australia’s passage of the NMBC in 2021, Meta abruptly cut off users from viewing news pages, and Google announced it might have “no real choice” but to withdraw search services within the country. Faced with those ultimatums, Australian lawmakers soon amended the NMBC’s final text in a manner that exempted Meta and Google from any binding actions. And after France began enforcing the Copyright Directive in 2021, Google throttled users from seeing article previews in France, which drastically decreased click-throughs. Their actions underscore the problem with forced negotiation: it is very difficult to enforce payment schemes when digital gatekeepers can simply choke off access to the news content internet users see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These legislative measures, sometimes referred to as “link taxes,” create the wrong incentives. In the past, they have discouraged Google and Meta from displaying news content on their platforms, which decreases critical streams of traffic to external news websites. In the future, such policies may even motivate search engines to accelerate the adoption of generative AI to answer user queries instead of displaying external links. Forced payment measures also seek to reinforce newspapers’ dependency on large technology companies, as they do not address the structural reasons for Google and Meta’s market dominance. For these reasons, U.S. technology companies need bright-line rules that meaningfully prevent harmful ad-tech, data collection, and AI practices. Such rules, in turn, can foster a healthier and more sustainable online environment in which newsrooms can evolve in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-dominant-technology-platforms-need-clear-ex-ante-rules-to-prevent-anticompetitive-practices-that-reinforce-their-gatekeeper-power-over-news-publishers&quot;&gt;(1) Dominant technology platforms need clear ex ante rules to prevent anticompetitive practices that reinforce their gatekeeper power over news publishers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-party negotiations cannot work if the playing field is not level. Because Google and Meta have taken steps to lock in gatekeeper power over digital advertising and content distribution in recent years, they basically own the league newspapers operate in. For example, Google’s 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick enabled it to effectively monopolize all three stages of the ad-tech process: the buy-side advertiser network, sell-side publisher tools, and the ad exchange through which most news websites auction online advertising spots. In turn, market dominance enables the search giant to demand up to 35 percent of proceeds that would otherwise flow to publishers. It also provides Google with ample means to compel news websites to adopt Accelerated Mobile Pages formatting and control their ability to engage in header bidding, among other actions. Similarly, Meta also increased its gatekeeper power by acquiring nascent competitors like Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), which allowed it to combine user data across multiple subsidiaries to curate personalized advertisements much more granularly than traditional newspapers can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These behaviors have raised alarm bells in numerous jurisdictions. In June 2023, the European Commission filed a formal statement of objection to Google’s ad-tech practices, arguing that the company’s control over all stages of the digital advertising process allows it to illegally disadvantage website publishers. In January 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice similarly sued Google over alleged anticompetitive actions that distort free competition in the ad-tech space, seeking to split up its Ad Manager suite. In November 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) challenged Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, seeking a possible divestiture of both platforms. Also in 2021, an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) investigation found that Google had engaged in “systemic competition concerns” like blocking ad-tech competitors from placing ads on YouTube and other subsidiaries. Further, ACCC chair Rod Sims noted at the time, “Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented.” The ACCC report summarizes a widespread issue: enforcement actions occur after the fact and are not guaranteed to undo the years of consolidation that have helped Google and Meta lock in market power and divert advertising revenue from news organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional antitrust law requires a modernized approach in the digital age — one that implements forward-looking guardrails to prevent dominant technology companies from harming nascent rivals, news publishers, and society at large. The European Union recently put new ex ante rules into place with its Digital Markets Act, which aims to prohibit gatekeeper technology platforms from abusing their control over multiple sides of a market. Members of the U.S. Congress have floated several bills containing similar proposals to limit practices like self-prioritization and acquisitions, but their momentum stalled following debates over their possible effects on malware prevention, content moderation, and other issues. In March 2023, Canada’s Competition Bureau put forward over 50 recommendations to modernize its antitrust legal framework, which has not undergone significant updates since the 1980s. Comprehensive antitrust reform is never quick or straightforward to implement, but it is essential to preventing anticompetitive acquisitions, growing news websites’ ad-tech options and revenue, and fostering a more diverse and sustainable news ecosystem overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-both-technology-platforms-and-newsrooms-need-formal-guardrails-to-promote-ethics-fairness-and-transparency-in-any-development-and-deployment-of-ai&quot;&gt;(2) Both technology platforms and newsrooms need formal guardrails to promote ethics, fairness, and transparency in any development and deployment of AI.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 100 million entities registered for ChatGPT within two months of its release, meaning numerous companies, including search engines and newsrooms, are deploying LLMs before direct legal safeguards are in place. The United States has existing federal and state privacy, copyright, consumer protection, and civil rights laws that apply to some aspects of the digital space, but there are broad legal uncertainties about how to interpret them in the context of generative AI (see sections 3 and 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, the White House announced voluntary commitments from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and four other AI developers to invest in algorithms to “address society’s greatest challenges” and create “robust technical mechanisms to ensure that users know when content is AI generated.” This announcement follows previous nonbinding strategies like the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (2022) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework (2023), which both call upon companies to prioritize transparency, accountability, fairness, and privacy in AI development. Broad voluntary principles, like these, are the first steps in the absence of a mandatory legal framework that directly regulates generative AI, but LLM developers will need to take significant strides to meet them. For example, OpenAI released a tool in January 2023 to help identify AI-generated text but withdrew it six months later due to high error rates. Furthermore, generative AI as an industry largely continues to obscure how it collects data, assesses and mitigates risk, and promotes internal accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As politicians additionally debate mandatory safeguards to mitigate the risks of AI, it is important to consider how any forthcoming laws could better support journalism and trustworthy information-sharing online. In 2022, Congress introduced the draft American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA), which contains provisions for large companies to publicly explain how high-risk AI systems make decisions, incorporate training data, and generate output. In April 2023, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration at the Department of Commerce issued a request for comment on AI accountability measures like audits and certifications. Transparency measures, such as these, could help news readers evaluate the credibility and fairness of the AI-generated text they view. They could also assist marketers in contesting automated advertisement placement with MFA websites instead of traditional news publishers. Both internet users and news publishers could benefit from increased public visibility into all AI development, regardless of the algorithm’s perceived level of risk of any given algorithm, which could include high-level statistics into methodology, specific sources of training data, generalized outcomes, and error rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, the European Parliament passed the draft AI Act, which could require developers to proactively mitigate automated output that perpetuates existing societal inequities. Under the act, “general purpose” algorithms (which would likely include LLMs like ChatGPT) would be required to identify “reasonably foreseeable risks” in their design and test training datasets for bias. Furthermore, “high-risk systems” (which would include social media ranking algorithms with over 45 million users) would be subject to more intensive standards like human oversight, assessments of an algorithm’s potential impact in specific contexts, and documentation of training datasets. Going further, evaluations for high-risk AI use by large search engines and social media companies should also include their potential impacts on journalism and information-sharing, including the spread of harmful content or burying of legitimate news online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As politicians additionally debate mandatory safeguards to mitigate the risks of AI, it is important to consider how any forthcoming laws could better support journalism and trustworthy information-sharing online.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technology platforms need legal responsibilities to ensure fairness and accountability in AI development, any newsrooms that choose to deploy LLMs must also develop clear and transparent processes when doing so. Some news organizations have already published initial principles for generative AI. For example, the Guardian and the News/Media Alliance (NMA) both recommend public disclosures of any AI-generated output. The Guardian additionally pledges to retain human oversight over generative AI deployment, while the NMA also states that publishers who use LLMs should continue to bear responsibility for any false or discriminatory outcomes. However, there is a clear gap in the development and publication of formal standards: according to a May 2023 World Association of News Publishers survey, 49 percent of newsroom respondents had deployed LLMs, but only 20 percent had implemented formal guidelines. As a baseline, newsrooms need to identify clear purposes or contexts in which they might deploy LLMs, including conditions, safeguards, and limitations. Going further, newsrooms also need to strengthen labor protections for positions that AI deployment might substantially affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI developers have trained LLMs by scraping billions of written articles, images, audio, and lines of software code from humans, typically without compensating, citing, obtaining permission from, or even informing the original creators. A wide range of professionals, ranging from the NMA to comedian Sarah Silverman to computer programmers, are asking — or, in some cases, suing — AI developers to pay their training data sources, stating their unlicensed use of content violates IP rights. Days after the Associated Press reached a licensing deal with OpenAI in July 2023, thousands of authors signed an open letter to urge LLM developers to both obtain consent from and compensate writers in order to scrape their work. In January 2023, a group of software developers sued OpenAI and GitHub for building the code-generating algorithm Copilot based on their licensed work. That same month, several artists filed a class action lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for processing their copyrighted material to train algorithms that generated images in their unique styles. Shortly after, Getty Images sued Stability AI in the United Kingdom and the United States for training algorithms based on 12 million copyrighted images. In addition, the Daily Mail is reportedly considering legal action against Google for scraping hundreds of thousands of copyrighted articles to develop Bard without permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cases could take years to resolve in court, and their outcomes are uncertain. Generative AI has created novel questions over the interpretation of existing IP rights, particularly whether algorithms fall under the fair use exception in the Copyright Act. Although AI developers have acknowledged their history of scraping copyrighted material without consent, they have also argued that generative AI qualifies as fair use because the output is sufficiently “transformative” in nature compared to the original input. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits disagree, arguing that fair use does not protect the exploitation of copyrighted material in highly commercial contexts where AI developers benefit financially at the expense of human creators. Furthermore, generative AI tools reproduce copyrighted text or images in many cases, sometimes even quoting source text verbatim, which possibly contradicts the transformative use argument. Going forward, the definitions of “fair use” and “derivative works” will be critical for Congress or the courts to clarify to help writers and other content creators exercise their IP rights in the production of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if some copyright holders manage to successfully negotiate or sue for compensation from AI developers, one-time payments are a narrow solution that will not prevent more seismic long-term impacts on journalism and other professional careers. ChatGPT is estimated to require trillions of data points, while OpenAI is currently valued at up to $29 billion. In other words, the sheer scale of training datasets alone means that most creators will not receive substantial payments. Better-known creators might wield more power to negotiate payouts compared to smaller or lesser-known ones, but technology corporations would likely retain disproportionate power to decide. Moreover, the licensing agreements would likely be short term or otherwise limited, while the disruption to writers’ jobs and living wages would be permanent. Since algorithms continually generate inferences based on past outputs, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to engineer a long-term residual payment system that both quantifies the monetary value of original data points and tracks subsequent usage in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Generative AI has created novel questions over the interpretation of existing IP rights, particularly whether algorithms fall under the fair use exception in the Copyright Act.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although copyright infringement lawsuits, if successful, are unlikely to lead to a long-term residual solution, they could drastically slow or even pause commercial sales of LLMs. Some image hosting websites, such as Getty Images, have already banned AI-generated images to prevent exposure to litigation. Stability AI, alternatively, has announced future plans to allow content creators to opt out of the processing of their work. In the case of generative AI, a more cautious and gradual pace of adoption could perhaps benefit the field in the long term. AI developers need time to devise creative ways to work collaboratively with copyright holders, increase the integrity of their training data, and mitigate the overall pitfalls of their algorithms on journalism. They should not commercially deploy these tools without a solid understanding of the legal and ethical IP risks they raise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-modernized-data-privacy-regulations-are-necessary-to-curb-surveillance-based-advertising-and-in-turn-return-some-market-power-from-large-technology-companies-to-news-publishers&quot;&gt;(4) Modernized data privacy regulations are necessary to curb surveillance-based advertising and, in turn, return some market power from large technology companies to news publishers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because LLMs are built upon billions of news articles, social media posts, online forums, and other text-based conversations from across the web, they inevitably sweep up sensitive personal information. In turn, their automated outputs could reveal personal details related to specific individuals, whether accurate or fabricated, which carries privacy and reputational risks. In March 2023, the Italian Data Protection Authority temporarily banned ChatGPT from processing local users’ data but restored access weeks later after OpenAI agreed to allow EU individuals to exclude their personal information from training data sets and delete inaccuracies. In April 2023, the European Data Protection Board formed an ongoing task force to coordinate potential enforcement actions against ChatGPT amid investigations by data protection authorities in France, Spain, Germany, and other member countries. In May 2023, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, along with three provincial authorities, opened probes into OpenAI’s collection, processing, and disclosure of personal information without sufficient consent, transparency, or accountability mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, the FTC requested information on OpenAI’s training data sources, risk mitigation measures, and automated outputs that reveal details about specific people. However, the consumer protection agency primarily acts against companies that engage in “unfair or deceptive” practices, as the United States lacks a comprehensive federal privacy law that directly regulates how LLMs collect and process personal information. Dozens of privacy bills were introduced in the 116th and 117th Congresses that would have modernized U.S. privacy protections, most prominently the ADPPA in 2022, but none were enacted into law. Many of these proposals, including the ADPPA, shared a similar framework that would (a) allow individuals to access, modify, and delete personal information that companies hold; (b) restrict companies to processing personal information only as necessary to provide an initial service that users request; and (c) require minimum transparency standards in data usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these U.S. bills were introduced before the public release of ChatGPT and entirely exempted publicly available information — a significant omission that could allow many LLMs, which are often trained based on data scanned from public-facing web pages, to avoid any forthcoming privacy legal restrictions. Even so, systemic boundaries on how all technology platforms process even nonpublic personal information could still significantly help shift some digital advertising dollars away from Google and Meta and back to news websites. With a more limited capability to algorithmically track and microtarget ads based on individuals’ browsing behavior or other personal attributes, marketers might increasingly favor contextual ads based on the content of a webpage. In other words, marketers might place protein bar ads in the sports section of a local newspaper instead of targeting Facebook users who browse health-related posts, or they might place diaper ads in a parenting magazine instead of identifying shoppers between the ages of 25 and 45 who recently purchased a pregnancy test. Because contextual advertising does not depend on granular data analytics about individual website visitors, it can better support the news publishers that produce content instead of the social media platforms and search engines that track and distribute it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-large-technology-platforms-need-robust-content-moderation-policies-that-promote-a-safe-and-healthy-information-ecosystem-for-news-organizations-to-thrive-in&quot;&gt;(5) Large technology platforms need robust content moderation policies that promote a safe and healthy information ecosystem for news organizations to thrive in.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act indirectly reinforces the gatekeeper power of large social media platforms and search engines. With the legal power to independently choose which content to promote, demote, host, or block, technology platforms exercise substantial control over the distribution and visibility of news content, even as they directly compete with external websites for traffic and screen time. Gatekeepers have economic incentives to keep users hooked on their platforms, which sometimes means algorithmically promoting scandalous or enraging clickbait that captures the most user attention while de-ranking news reporting that benefits the public interest. In turn, a higher influx of false or toxic posts simultaneously subjects journalists to increased hostility and impedes readers’ ability to parse online junk to identify real news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite legitimate concerns about Section 230, a complete repeal of the statute could negatively impact both the news industry and internet users. Section 230 protects the free exchange of information and allows technology platforms to host news content without fear of frivolous litigation from right-wing extremists. For example, it shields technology platforms that host news articles about abortion access, even as some states like Texas have tried to block people from obtaining reproductive health information in the aftermath of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022). As seen from the unintended consequences of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), a Section 230 repeal would likely lead technology platforms to drastically reduce the availability of third-party content. In turn, journalists would likely lose social media users as a diverse resource for leads and article ideas. Independent or freelance journalists might have difficulty maintaining their online audiences or public brands, and smaller news start-ups could disproportionately struggle to get off the ground, especially if technology platforms face legal pressure to exclusively work with well-known incumbent entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, many researchers — including some news publishers — have supported middle-ground approaches to amend Section 230 or otherwise enact reasonable guardrails for technology platforms to address harmful or illegal content. The European Union will begin to enforce the Digital Services Act (DSA) in 2024, which could provide one possible model for the United States. The DSA requires technology platforms to adhere to minimum transparency standards like publishing content takedown statistics and explaining recommendation algorithms. Furthermore, it requires them to maintain user controls like opt-outs of personalized content ranking algorithms and notice-and-action systems to flag illegal material. The DSA prevents technology platforms from targeting paid advertisements based on a person’s sexual orientation or political affiliation and prohibits behavioral ads toward children, which could reduce their edge over newspapers in digital marketing. The law also requires larger digital platforms — including Facebook and Google — to assess the “systemic” and “societal or economic” risks of their services, share publicly available data with approved researchers, and allow external compliance audits. While the DSA is one of the first major laws to require external transparency and user controls over ranking algorithms, U.S. and global legislators have also proposed numerous other frameworks. Each raises its own set of debates, but it is important to weigh how any potential measure can better foster a healthy ecosystem for journalism to thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-governments-should-promote-policies-that-recognize-the-value-of-journalism-as-a-public-good&quot;&gt;(6) Governments should promote policies that recognize the value of journalism as a public good.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news industry creates positive externalities that benefit far more than direct subscribers or readers. Newsrooms dedicate substantial resources to sourcing, fact-checking, and disseminating information in the public interest, and journalists serve as independent mechanisms to hold powerful institutions accountable. However, their immense societal value does not suit the system of free market capitalism in which it exists. Newsrooms earn income based on advertisements and subscriptions and not the public benefit of the information they communicate, leaving their overall bottom line vulnerable to ranking algorithms, reader or marketer demand, and even macroeconomic fluctuations. Some venture capitalist firms or wealthy individuals have attempted to invest in newsrooms, but their goals can be misaligned. Andreessen Horowitz invested $50 million in BuzzFeed News in 2014, but its constant pressure for perpetual growth, high returns, and profitability ultimately did not fit the company’s journalistic mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the civic value of journalism, some governments have considered direct or indirect public funding for journalism. In 2018, Canada established a pot of C$50 million (around $39 million) to support local newsrooms, dispensed by a third-party intermediary to preserve press independence from the government. However, public funding may not work in every country, especially given differing legal, cultural, and political norms around press independence. U.S. politicians have a particularly tumultuous relationship with both the mainstream media and technology companies, evident in their lackluster support for public news systems. The United States spent just $3.16 per capita on public broadcasting in 2019, barely a fraction of France’s $75.89, Australia’s $35.78, and Canada’s $26.51. As Politico’s Jack Shafer points out, even this sparse amount has been highly controversial: “Politicians — usually Republicans like President Donald Trump — routinely issue threats to defund NPR and PBS every time they object to the outlets’ coverage. Do we really want to make the print press beholden to such political whims?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;. . . journalists serve as independent mechanisms to hold powerful institutions accountable. However, their immense societal value does not suit the system of free market capitalism in which it exists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from public funding, governments could consider other avenues to help newspapers diversify revenue sources, which, in turn, could reduce reliance on volatile traffic streams. For example, both France and Canada offer tax credits to incentivize individuals to subscribe to newspapers, and Canada amended its tax laws in 2020 to permit newsrooms to seek charitable donations. U.S. legislators could take a similar route. Some pitched tax deductions for newspaper subscribers, advertisers, and employers in the Local Journalism Sustainability Act in 2020 and 2021, though these measures did not reach a vote. Congress could also consider mechanisms to help newsrooms function as nonprofit or hybrid organizations — for example, by changing rules that prevent nonprofit editorial boards from endorsing candidates. In March 2023, the nonprofit Texas Observer reversed its closure decision after crowdfunding over $300,000, demonstrating the potential for newsrooms to tap into alternative support like philanthropic donations or grants. That said, nonprofit status alone is not a one-track solution; there is a limited pool of foundation grants, and the relatively low rates of existing news subscribers suggest the onus cannot fall on grassroots donors to sustain the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more ubiquitous, the news industry will need to carve out space in a more crowded, more chaotic, and less original information ecosystem. The relationship between technology platforms and newsrooms will continue to evolve in both the short and long terms, but robust data governance frameworks are necessary now to support the financial viability of newspapers and cultivate a diverse and trustworthy online sphere. Large search engines and social media platforms need clear boundaries around their monetization of personal information to target advertisements, acquisitions of nascent competitors, exclusionary actions like self-prioritization, use of copyrighted material, and amplification or de-amplification of online traffic. In turn, both technology platforms and newsrooms require bright-line responsibilities to promote ethical and human-centered standards at every stage in the AI development and deployment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As AI becomes more ubiquitous, the news industry will need to carve out space in a more crowded, more chaotic, and less original information ecosystem.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policies are not exhaustive. The long-term health and sustainability of the news industry will require more than technological solutions alone. Direct financial support for newsrooms is critical — whether through nonprofit models, direct or indirect government funding, or even nontraditional monetization methods. For example, some newsrooms have embraced side ventures like consulting or hosting events to raise income. But neither the production requirements nor the societal benefits of journalism alone can translate into dollars and cents. To succeed, news outlets also require a civically engaged society — one bound by critical thinking and collective interest in the community. In addition, corporate executives will need to urgently prioritize the input and well-being of human writers, including through job protections and union contracts, in order to sustain journalism as a stable and accessible career option. Ultimately, the actions that technology platforms, newsrooms, governments, and individuals take today will shape the long-term trajectory of the news industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have sought to emphasise that a post-Brexit UK would be outward looking, collaborative and influential. A series of speeches and policy statements stressed that the UK would pursue future prosperity through overseas engagements built upon investments in diplomacy, trade, defence and development aid. In March 2021, the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, reiterating these themes and referencing Eastern Africa as a part of the world where the UK would increase its engagement, with explicit references to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI research project, “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa”, has examined whether, and how, the UK has leveraged international development, defence and diplomatic investments as envisaged. For the four above-mentioned countries, the project analysed the UK’s core engagements from 2015 to 2022. Through key informant interviews and literature analysis, it identified factors that helped or hindered the UK in pursuing an integrated and collaborative foreign policy approach, and tested perceptions of the UK. The effects of major structural changes to UK foreign policy since 2015 were also studied, notably reducing the overseas aid budget, merging two ministries to create the new Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO), and leaving the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides background on recent UK policy towards the region, summarising the project’s research findings, and offers recommendations for the UK government with relevance both to the region and to an integrated foreign policy globally. The key findings are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the face of volatility, the UK has had to adapt its approach towards the region numerous times since 2015. Actions include reallocating funding towards drought relief, suspending cooperation during conflict and political upheaval (Sudan), condemning reported war crimes (Ethiopia), bolstering stabilisation efforts in the wake of new military offensives (Somalia) and providing support to mitigate electoral instability (Kenya and Somalia).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite inconsistent levels of political leadership, the UK contributed to relatively successful outcomes across the four case study countries. However, these are not sufficient (or necessarily sustainable) in isolation and continue to face important constraints and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attempts by UK officials to better integrate defence, international development and diplomatic work have made progress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the abolition of the UK Department for International Development (DFID) is regretted by some UK regional partners, the unplanned creation of the FCDO shows early promise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK retains a good reputation in the region for the calibre of its diplomats and development and defence experts, and has broadly maintained staffing levels in the region, despite budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK is reasonably well regarded as a development, defence and diplomatic actor across the region. However, despite this, a range of middle and great powers increasingly offer alternative forms of support to East African governments, which contributes to perceptions of declining UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK has established relationships and partnerships with a variety of actors. It often operates effectively through ad hoc groupings of bilateral and multilateral networks in the region and globally, bolstered by envoys and technical specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, the UK bilateral aid budget was reduced by around 50% across the region. External relationships suffered, as funding decisions were arrived at iteratively and were not always well communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brexit did not significantly impair the UK’s operational effectiveness in the region, but alongside other factors it probably contributed to a perception of declining influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK strategies at the country level were sometimes unclear, overly broad or outpaced by contextual changes. The lack of a regional strategy also remains a significant gap, given the transnational nature of the opportunities and challenges facing Eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research raises important questions concerning the nature of UK–Africa relations and the role of aid, development and defence engagement within an integrated foreign policy. Various recommendations are offered in this paper, spanning operational and strategic levels. These include building on lessons from the DFID–Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office merger to ensure the FCDO’s capabilities fully support integrated ways of working; better aligning mission priorities across the Gulf and Eastern Africa; and bolstering cooperation between special envoys and embassy-level staff. Explicit change management processes must be used to guide further organisational reform. More broadly, the UK should advocate for a clearer mandate when it comes to ad hoc groups such as the Quint and the Quad; centre long-term, sustainable engagement; and communicate the scope, scale and mechanics of continuing UK–EU cooperation to help defuse perceptions of an isolated, post-Brexit foreign policy, particularly to local audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly in a world of increased geopolitical rivalry, the UK needs to clarify its positioning towards Africa. Policy statements in favour of “integration” or “partnerships”, while useful, do not in themselves constitute effective strategy. With a contracting resource base, positive results may become harder to demonstrate in an increasingly competitive, transactional environment. African governments also now have a wider array of potential partners and greater leverage in shaping foreign engagement. As a result, the UK will need to market its added value towards Africa very clearly. As a first step, a two-way dialogue should be established with African partners at government and societal level to discuss shared priorities and ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have emphasised that a post-Brexit UK would be outward looking, collaborative and influential. They portrayed the UK as pursuing future prosperity through overseas engagements built upon investments in diplomacy, trade, defence and development aid. Following this trend, the UK government published an ambitious policy document, the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR21) in March 2021, expressing similar sentiments about the UK’s role in the world while pointing to the challenge of increased geopolitical competition. Greater connectivity was promised between UK diplomacy, defence, trade and international development, alongside the UK working with like-minded governments towards shared goals of prosperity, democracy and security. East Africa, an area of longstanding UK interest, was among the regions prioritised for engagement, with explicit references to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI research project “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa” has examined whether, and how, the UK has leveraged international development, defence and diplomatic investments as envisaged. For the four above-mentioned countries, the project analysed the UK’s core engagements from 2015 to 2022, identifying factors that helped or hindered its pursuit of an integrated and collaborative foreign policy approach, as well as testing perceptions of the UK. The effects of major structural changes to UK foreign policy since 2015 were also studied, notably reducing the overseas aid budget, merging two ministries to create the new Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO), and leaving the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides background on recent UK policy towards the region, summarising the project’s research findings, and offers recommendations for the UK government with relevance both to East Africa and to an integrated foreign policy globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research methodology consisted of a review of selected policy literature and 182 semi-structured expert interviews carried out from mid-2021 to early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review was undertaken of official data and policy documents from government departments (principally the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the FCDO and the now-defunct Department for International Development (DFID)); parliamentary committees and regulatory bodies (for example, the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee); associated funding platforms (for example, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF), the Prosperity Fund, the Newton Fund and the Global Challenges Research Fund); and public entities such as the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI). Papers were analysed for key themes, sectoral engagement and expenditure that the UK continually or repeatedly adopted in its engagement in Eastern Africa. Data on UK aid, defence and diplomatic engagement in the four focal countries from 2015 to 2022 was used as a reference point to identify UK policy objectives and trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through semi-structured interviews, the team identified a number of key outcomes that the UK has sought to achieve in each of the focus countries, and which were informative in terms of the overarching research objectives. A range of actors who are familiar with UK engagement were then interviewed to understand the nature and significance of the UK contribution and the factors that had enabled or constrained engagement. A total of 182 interviews were carried out between September 2021 and January 2023, with a substantial number of them based in Eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final paper in a series of publications stemming from this project, which includes a paper that lays out the project methodology and greater detail on UK investments across the region, and four country case studies focusing on the UK’s work in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-background&quot;&gt;I. Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-context&quot;&gt;Policy Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “Global Britain” was first used by Prime Minister Theresa May as shorthand for an outward-looking, collaborative and influential agenda. Dramatic events and policy changes were to follow. Under the subsequent leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a new government department, the FCDO, was announced in June 2020, merging the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) and DFID. Declared without prior planning, the process led to substantial and repeated rounds of restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2020, the UK official development assistance (ODA) budget was also cut, from 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) to 0.5%: a significant shift given that the UK had acquired a reputation overseas as a strong and generous aid donor since the 1990s. Some commentators lamented the end of the UK’s role as a global “development superpower”, claiming a loss of status and damage to partnerships and British influence. This stood in contrast to a well-publicised increase in the national defence budget. The government subsequently set out the conditions (fiscal tests) under which it intended to return the budget to 0.7% GNI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the UK government published the IR21. The document recognised a more competitive global context than in 2016 but reiterated now-familiar “Global Britain” themes. It signalled a wish to play a proactive role in global affairs, to work in cooperation with others, particularly “like-minded bilateral and multilateral partners”, and to better integrate foreign policy, defence, trade and international development efforts. Africa was referenced in terms of forging problem-solving partnerships and the pursuit of prosperity, democracy and security. The policy spoke of maintaining commitments to Africa with respect to ODA, but leaned strongly towards promoting trade, economic resilience and the alignment of international development with wider foreign policy. In this context, East Africa was pegged as a specific region for continued, and in some cases increased, engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defence matters, it included a commitment to “persistent engagement”, for example, placing UK armed forces overseas for longer periods in a more proactive posture. A series of sub-strategies were subsequently released, including the 2021 Defence Command Paper and the 2022 International Development Strategy. Highly pertinent for Africa, the latter situated international development as part of a broader effort to build a network of like-minded partners with “all our capabilities – our diplomatic influence, trade policy, defence, intelligence, business partnerships and development expertise”. In doing so, it signalled an intention to use aid for both poverty reduction and wider development and foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “refreshed” version of IR21 was released – IR23 – in March 2023. Africa was again identified as a region where the UK government should deepen relationships: “The UK’s approach in Africa will continue to be defined by a greater appreciation of the needs and perspectives of key partners across the continent, focusing on mutually beneficial development, security and defence partnerships, and support for clean infrastructure and climate adaptation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IR23 also stated that the UK would “work to reinvigorate its position as a global leader on international development, pursuing patient, long-term partnerships tailored to the needs of the countries we work with, going beyond our Official Development Assistance (ODA) offer to draw on the full range of UK strengths and expertise”. Specific commitments included placing the Minister of State for Africa and International Development on the UK National Security Council (NSC), creating a new second permanent secretary role in the FCDO to oversee all UK development priorities, and establishing a new FCDO–Treasury governance structure to supervise all aid spending. The minister would subsequently clarify his own agenda for the future of UK international development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, the UK policy context has evolved considerably over the research period. Transitions between prime ministers Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, and foreign secretaries Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and James Cleverly, linked to the politics of Brexit and Covid-19, and sometimes accompanied by claims of incompetence or corruption, have also brought shifting priorities and tone. Prolonged Brexit negotiations, the Covid-19 pandemic, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have also reshaped geopolitics and economics, with significant knock-on implications for UK spending plans as political attention and increasingly scarce resources were either diverted away from East Africa or towards more short-term crisis management. With already reduced levels of UK ODA diverted towards meeting refugee assistance costs domestically, aid spending in Eastern Africa is much lower than anticipated, despite the region facing severe drought and significant political, security and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-regional-policy-priorities-and-engagements&quot;&gt;UK Regional Policy Priorities and Engagements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK engagement with Eastern Africa is multifaceted, with a long history. A non-exhaustive list of topics of concern include security and counterterrorism (Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and previously Ethiopia), migration (especially Sudan), humanitarian relief, stabilisation and conflict resolution (Sudan, Somalia), international development, climate and environment and trade (especially Kenya). This paper is informed by five preceding research papers. Taken together these provide details on country contexts, UK investments, objectives and selective outcomes across the region. A brief overview of the UK’s key interests, policy priorities and engagements in each country from 2015 to 2022 is also provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government considers Ethiopia one of a handful of high-priority countries for UK engagement in Africa due to its size, influence and strategic location. Successive UK governments have sought a stable Ethiopia that is supportive of their foreign policy priorities both globally, especially the international development agenda, but also in the Horn of Africa, for example, with regard to the War on Terror and migration and in relation to the stability of Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan. Given that it is one of the largest refugee-hosting countries in Africa and the world, the UK sees Ethiopia as a key country for stemming onward migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registering an annual growth rate of over 10% between 2004 and 2009, in the mid-2000s Ethiopia acted as a cheerleader for international development in global forums. Seeing Ethiopia as a quintessential “developmental state”, the UK became a staunch partner. Via the now-defunct DFID, the UK aligned strongly with the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front’s (EPRDF) development agenda. Ethiopia at times became the largest single recipient of UK bilateral aid globally, much of it channelled via the government in support of service delivery. Expenditure averaged around £220 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. This made the UK the second-largest donor after the US, contributing around 11% of Ethiopia’s recorded aid income as reported via the OECD–Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Alongside investments in areas ranging from human rights to economic development and drought response, approximately 60% of the UK’s bilateral aid budget has typically been channelled via central government programmes, the bulk allocated to multi-donor, multi-year funds that supported delivery of basic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IR21, the UK planned to work in partnership with Ethiopia “to further our shared prosperity goals, our democratic values and our security interests” and to invest in “regional stability, moving towards closer defence cooperation”. But cuts to the UK aid budget and the changing context in Ethiopia dictated otherwise. By 2021, UK bilateral spend had roughly halved compared to 2019. The remaining (£120-million) UK bilateral aid allocation to Ethiopia in 2021 was £134 million lower than the year before. This was the largest cut – in absolute, though not proportional terms – of any country budget worldwide. Reductions were accompanied by reallocations to different sectors in light of a series of natural disasters, shifting ministerial priorities, Covid-19 and the Tigray War. In 2020, the UK spent £254 million in bilateral ODA in Ethiopia. Humanitarian aid (£103 million) accounted for approximately 40% of the budget as compared to 15% in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some criticism, the UK has attempted to position itself as constructively critical of Ethiopian government actions during its war in Tigray, while continuing with reduced aid programming via government channels. Meanwhile, it has lobbied the federal government repeatedly for humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law, and provided humanitarian funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence for over two decades and has a permanent defence attaché in-country. Defence-related expenditure typically runs at under £1 million per annum, mostly drawn from regional budgets with competing priorities, including the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Ethiopia’s support to AMISOM was the UK’s principal focus – many AMISOM troops have received training from the UK. Levels of UK ambition on security and defence issues have, however, declined over time. Ethiopia and the UK cooperated on counterterrorism issues, but the focus has mainly been on education and training in non-combat areas linked to the Ethiopian Peace Support Training Centre since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting international development work, UK diplomatic interest has historically focused on issues above, ranging from trade promotion to migration, counterterrorism cooperation and Ethiopian involvement in peacekeeping. Considerable energy has also been absorbed on consular cases involving dual nationals. Diplomatic relations were tested in early to mid-2021, as Western criticisms of the Ethiopian government blockade of Tigray and reported human rights abuses led to recriminations. The UK has pursued a lower-profile approach to the Tigray War compared with more prominent critics (for example, the EU, Ireland and the US), who briskly paused aid packages and publicly condemned Ethiopian government actions. It has attempted to position itself as constructively critical while continuing to send aid via government. Amid a turbulent context that included war in Tigray and an intense government counterinsurgency campaign in Oromia, the UK has sought diplomatic engagement with the Ethiopian federal government at the highest level. With respect to Tigray, it lobbied for improved humanitarian access, ceasefires and talks. It has not invested high levels of political capital, however, with infrequent senior ministerial visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somalia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was the second-largest DAC donor country to Somalia after the US between 2011 and 2020. A significant proportion of this bilateral aid has been channelled towards government assistance and structural reform, public financial management and support for subnational administration. This includes strengthening the building blocks of the Federal Government of Somalia’s (FGS) legitimacy and accountability, from funding judicial development and service provision to supporting inclusive commercial growth. Given the ongoing threat of Al-Shabaab and jihadist militancy, long-running investments were also allocated to security sector reform and law enforcement, with UK personnel leading the policing strand of Somalia’s Comprehensive Approach to Security framework and supporting projects on stabilisation and countering violent extremism/deradicalisation. Efforts were likewise made to facilitate a political settlement at the federal level and to bolster humanitarian assistance. Resources peaked in famine or near-famine years (2011/12 and 2017/18), with food security (as a sub-stream of “humanitarian preparedness and response”) emphasised as a thematic priority in IR21, supplementing resilience programmes to improve early-warning systems, coping mechanisms, local self-reliance and access to healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-country budgets saw a 56% contraction between 2020 and 2021. Although Somalia is still one of the top 10 recipients of British ODA, this put the UK below Germany’s bilateral aid spending level for the first time. The cuts came alongside a depreciating exchange rate and reallocations driven by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Although funding for famine relief remains comparatively high, only £61 million in humanitarian aid, healthcare and nutritional resourcing was provided in FY2022/23. This reflected a sharp decrease from the £170-million package offered in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK diplomacy has focused on “supporting and occasionally steering multilateral efforts to build up the FGS’s political anatomy, authority and capacity”. Having co-hosted or facilitated several international conferences to formalise the federal structure and provisional constitution, from 2017 UK attention increasingly shifted towards developing a basic security framework and delivering the 2018–22 Somalia Transition Plan (STP). In tandem with the US, London backed the World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief process (2016), and – alongside other donors – helped the FGS satisfy the “Decision Point” benchmarks by 2020. As UN Security Council (UNSC) penholder, the UK also facilitated debate over the structuring, resourcing and timing of AMISOM (now the African Transition Mission – ATMIS), and contributed significant funding to the UN Office for Project Services and the AMISOM Trust Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to develop a self-sufficient security apparatus capable of degrading Al-Shabaab was referenced in both the UK’s 2015 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review and the 2021 Defence Command Paper. In recent years, the British Army has supplied infrastructural projects and training, stipends and equipment to the Somali National Army (SNA) under Operation Tangham, primarily for Sector 60 of the army, based around Baidoa. UK-funded advisers remain embedded across federal institutions, including in the ministries of defence and internal security. The focus continues to be on reforming and capacitating national forces so that they can assume security responsibilities from ATMIS as the mission sets to conclude in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sudan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has longstanding ties with the Republic of Sudan, previously a colonial condominium, and considers it one of a few high-priority countries on the continent. The view has been that worsening political and economic situations in Sudan would impact the Horn of Africa and North Africa and negatively affect the UK’s vital interests. The IR21 specifically mentioned the UK’s commitment to “continue to support conflict resolution and stabilisation efforts in … Sudan”. Outward migration has also been a concern. The UK is home to a significant and longstanding Sudanese diaspora (around 20,000 people). The UK Home Office has led efforts to curtail migration from Sudan through strengthened border management and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK bilateral aid commitments to Sudan averaged around £93 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. Recent ODA-funded programmes have contributed on issues from humanitarian relief and humanitarian system reform to economic reform, reducing female genital mutilation and child marriage, to water and sanitation, civil society, and supporting the Juba Peace Agreement (2020). The highest-expenditure items have been humanitarian relief and economic reform, and social safety net support. As UK aid contributions to neighbouring countries declined, the Sudan aid budget temporarily rose from £93 million in 2019 to £139 million in 2020. This was due to a one-off increase for a new “Sudan Family Support Programme”, the UK contribution to a World Bank-run programme designed to cushion the needy from economic reforms. Alongside this, the UK campaigned hard at the World Bank and the IMF for Sudanese debt relief. Aid contributions were halted following the October 2021 coup. The UK, together with the US, World Bank and other major donors, suspended non-humanitarian aid. UK bilateral ODA funding dropped back to £93 million by the end of 2021. This still left Sudan as the fifth-largest recipient of UK bilateral ODA worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Sudan’s long period of military rule and the existence of UK, UN and EU sanctions regimes, opportunities for defence engagement have been few. UK–Sudan defence engagement was completely suspended following the October 2021 coup, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) withdrew its defence attaché from Khartoum in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Sudan diplomacy has focused over time on issues ranging from peace negotiations to migration, counterterrorism and humanitarian access, to the imposition of sanctions and the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC). As a follow-on to involvement in the negotiations for the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the UK acted as “penholder” for the UN hybrid mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and its successor, the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS). In March 2016, a UK–Sudan Strategic Dialogue was set up – a formalised contact forum in which senior officials from the two countries met under the shadow of UK and multilateral sanctions. Economic sanctions under UN and EU auspices were central to UK policy in the hope of incentivising reduced conflict, given previous allegations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the early 2000s. The UK was also involved in establishing the Khartoum Process, a controversial intergovernmental dialogue platform to facilitate cooperation on migration. Particularly since the ousting of President Omar Al-Bashir, UK ambassadors have been prominent voices in support of democratic transition, often working with the US and Norway “Troika”. UK diplomacy also played an important role in the June–July 2019 “Quartet” negotiations that produced a civilian-led, transitional government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to facilitate an agreement between key political and security factions after the 2021 military coup culminated in the December 2022 “Framework Agreement”, a deal brokered by UNITAMS, the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union (AU) and backed by, among others, the UK. Despite these efforts, fighting again broke out in Khartoum on 15 April 2023. Violence subsequently spread, leading to reports of war crimes and mass displacement, especially in Darfur. While the UK and other foreign governments initially focused on evacuating nationals and calling for ceasefires and restraint, competing diplomatic tracks have gradually coalesced over time. The US and Saudi Arabia, for instance, convened talks in Jeddah but were criticised for failing to coordinate with other Quad members (including the UK) or regional organisations such as the AU. Although a temporary truce was brokered in late May, the deal – like many others before and since – collapsed under repeated violations. Separately, an IGAD summit was hosted in July, rivalling AU leadership claims over any mediation process, and bilateral and multilateral arrangements fronted by Chad and Egypt started pushing their own initiatives. The result has been “disarray” and confusion, “posing the risk that opportunities [for peace-making] will slip away unexplored”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kenya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has been an enduring priority for UK engagement in Africa since the country’s independence in 1963, reflecting a relationship grounded on shared history, language, economic ties, diasporic networks and security needs. Name-checked in IR21 and the International Development Strategy, these linkages were formalised by the 2020–25 Strategic Partnership, with bilateral interests spanning mutual prosperity; regional stability; sustainable development and reduction of extreme poverty; collaborative leadership on climate and environmental issues; peer learning, knowledge sharing and research; and the expansion of individual and institutional networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipsed by the US in the mid-1970s, the UK’s bilateral ODA contributions to Kenya averaged around £117 million between 2016 and 2020, peaking at £152.8 million in 2017 before falling below those of Japan in 2018, and France and EU institutions in 2020, and Germany a year later. Partially tied to the drop from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI, the government’s in-country budget reduced from £134 million (2019) to £72 million (2021) – roughly 46% over two years – slightly exceeding the 42% cut across Africa as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of coverage and content, social infrastructure has regularly consumed the largest proportion of UK ODA funding, although the specific distribution has varied over time. Support for social protection and education, for instance, diminished in 2013/14, while investment in health systems grew steadily from 2017 and extended further as part of the COVAX vaccine rollout. Attention has likewise been paid to multi-sector work – particularly environmental protections, policies and administrative management – and humanitarian aid, including emergency (drought and flood) relief, and refugee support and empowerment. After the outbreak of electoral (and state) violence in 2007/8, the UK increased its focus on governance, peace and security issues. Additional resourcing was also channelled towards improving the accountability of public institutions, anti-corruption efforts, conflict mitigation and reducing the risk of radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History has proven both a “benefit and burden” for diplomatic engagement. The UK retains close ties to Kenya’s political, military and economic elite, but has often been scapegoated when politically expedient. Following then-candidate Uhuru Kenyatta’s indictment by the ICC in 2013, for example, elements of Kenyatta’s Jubilee party were able to dismiss Western criticism as “neo-colonial”, refusing any renewal of UK defence cooperation and accelerating his predecessor’s “look east” strategy. While relations gradually improved, culminating in a prime ministerial visit by Theresa May in 2018, similar issues emerged over successive electoral cycles (2017 and 2022), revealing the difficult dynamics that UK officials continue to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary relations with Nairobi are also wrapped up in UK commercial interests. Kenya is the largest African recipient of British “aid-for-trade” programming, and significant efforts are being made to boost environmental, social and corporate standards. In 2020, an Economic Partnership Agreement pledged funds to boost trade and granted Kenyans “duty and quota free” access to UK markets, although there were concerns such bilateral arrangements could disrupt regional integration within the East Africa Community, or saturate local markets with cheap imports. In 2021, Kenya was considered a priority country in British International Investment (BII)’s $1-billion pan-African suite of infrastructure, finance and climate projects, supplementing assistance to 30 regional funds and more than 80 local finance, tech and green enterprises. Later that year, then foreign secretary Dominic Raab declared a further £132 million in public and private funding aligned with Kenyatta’s “Big Four Agenda”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has long considered Kenya an “essential” defence partner, as the country hosts significant British military assets and infrastructure, adjoins Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia, and offers a logistical corridor to central Africa. Much of this relationship is framed by the Security Compact, an arrangement approved in 2015 (and episodically updated) covering countering violent extremism, border and aviation policing, and criminal justice cooperation, alongside efforts to tackle instability and conflict. Defence Cooperation Agreements were also signed in 2016 and 2021, renewing the legal instruments that maintain BATUK (the British Army Training Unit Kenya, host of the multinational Askari Storm exercises) and allow capacity building with the Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF). In addition, BPST-A (the British Peace Support Team) advises and assists African militaries, supporting peacekeeping operations such as AMISOM and ATMIS, and working with partners including the International Peace Support Training Centre to strengthen institutional learning and regional responses to complex emergencies. In recent years, Kenya was designated a “regional hub” in the MoD’s “persistent engagement strategy”, with the 2021 Defence Command Paper prescribing a further expansion of UK commitments and the continuation of joint training and readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-research-findings&quot;&gt;II. Research Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project’s most prominent findings from all source data across the four case studies – including secondary source and interview data – are provided below. Where relevant, recommendations are offered for UK policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the face of volatility, the UK has had to adapt its approach towards the region numerous times since 2015. Actions include reallocating funding towards drought relief, suspending cooperation during conflict and political upheaval (Sudan), condemning reported war crimes (Ethiopia), bolstering stabilisation efforts (Somalia), and providing support to mitigate electoral instability (Kenya and Somalia).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya offers relative stability, commercial opportunities and a good degree of judicial independence. But the economy has struggled to recover from Covid-19-era restrictions and global price increases. Political and ethnic divisions persist, and state systems are not meeting public expectations amid corruption, inequality and the high cost of living. Against this backdrop, the UK has dedicated significant time, diplomatic capital and financial resources to electoral support and institution building to help consolidate reforms prescribed in Kenya’s 2010 Constitution. With contested polls (and an eventual re-run) in 2017, the British High Commission (BHC) doubled down on its supply of technical assistance across various regulatory bodies such as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, despite increasing contextual difficulties. Crucially, early engagement in the electoral cycle bought time for participatory planning and networking, enabling British stakeholders to better navigate the stringent restrictions imposed on donors by Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, the BHC assumed an influential role in coordinating external engagement, partially facilitated by its unusual levels of access to local institutions; the longevity and depth of bilateral UK ties to Kenya; the coincidental absence of a US ambassador; and the High Commissioner’s personal clout. Much of this leadership was “behind the scenes”, with the UK contributing towards the donor agenda while reportedly sharing or ceding ownership to mitigate the political sensitivities previously disrupting British interventions in 2013 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visible changes to Ethiopia’s existing political settlement began in 2018 with the dissolution of the ruling EPRDF. The UK enjoyed a close working relationship with the Ethiopian government until 2019, cooperating and financing significant poverty reduction efforts and pursuing shared counterterrorism objectives, despite worsening political divisions and insecurity. This began to change following the November 2020 Tigray War and subsequent security and economic crisis. The UK attempted to maintain access to newly installed prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s government at the highest level while being critical of the conduct of the war. It continued to provide financial aid and technical assistance to government departments for socioeconomic development but at lower levels than before, while lobbying for humanitarian access to Tigray. Defence cooperation outside peacekeeping training was stopped. Yet by attempting to keep all options and channels open, the UK attracted criticism from both the Ethiopian federal government and pro-Tigrayan voices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somalia remains poor and insecure, with much of the country inaccessible to governmental and international actors. In working to support a “good enough” state capable of out-competing Al-Shabaab, the UK developed new (experimental) approaches to stabilisation in support of Operation Badbaado, an SNA-led offensive focused on the liberation of several “bridge-towns” across Lower Shabelle between 2019 and 2020. By shifting towards a more politically sensitive methodology based on grassroot reconciliation, dialogue and community buy-in – fronted in large part by the Early Recovery Initiative – the UK was able to build momentum for peace committees and recovery operations. Although primarily confined to the tactical level given a lack of follow-up funding and police coverage, these inputs were nevertheless considered “significant and influential” on their own terms, while plugging a gap in international programming. British engagement also proved flexible in reallocating resources to help avert the risk of famine in 2017, marking a substantial (if imperfect) improvement on similar interventions in 2011/12. Subsequent efforts in 2022 were, however, criticised as insufficient and under-financed, leveraging technical expertise and convening power in an enabler role, rather than exercising the leadership and multiplier effects evident five years previously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Sudan, the UK acquired a reputation over many years for careful diplomacy, even-handed dealings around the north–south conflict, and ongoing support for humanitarian relief. Under President Omar Al-Bashir, relations were highly challenging. The situation pivoted to a close working relationship with the brief hybrid transitional government of 2019–21. While ending cooperation on security and development matters, the UK maintained contact with key political and military figures even after the October 2021 coup. This caused some pro-democracy actors to criticise the UK’s support for “hybrid” or compromise agreements that featured the security services. While events have moved on with the outbreak of violence in April 2023, there is still a reservoir of goodwill towards the UK in Sudan and an appetite for increased engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapidly changing context points to the importance of up-to-date multi-disciplinary analysis to inform decisions on strategy, action and difficult trade-offs. It also underscores that peace, adequate governance and security are fundamental for progress on other agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Make use of the combined skills and levers that exist across government – from trade-related to cultural, diplomatic and security – to develop and periodically update internal analysis of the political, security and economic situation in the region, and identify any levers for change that will permit effective UK action at country level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that future UK international development strategies and white papers recognise the importance of addressing security, conflict and governance challenges to enable progress on development and prosperity objectives in East Africa and other fragile environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite inconsistent levels of political leadership, the UK contributed to relatively successful outcomes across the four case study countries. However, these are not sufficient (or necessarily sustainable) in isolation and continue to face important constraints and challenges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviewees’ assessments of UK inputs and successes, several example focus areas emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, the UK displayed flexibility, contextual awareness and diplomatic influence in delivering well-timed, long-running electoral support (and subsequent crisis management). Together with other international partners and endogenous factors, these efforts helped strengthen trust and public safety during the largely peaceful 2022 election. Similarly, defence engagement fed into tactical, doctrinal and possibly operational improvements in the KDF, and ensured a persistent, close working relationship with Nairobi. UK programming was likewise able to draw on its networking and technical expertise to contribute to a boost in Kenyan literacy rates, academic performance and girls’ progression to secondary-level education. However, such experiences also reflect the inherent difficulty of engendering sustainable change across institutional cultures, especially when navigating political sensitivities and elite interests, leaving the longer-term and higher-level impact of UK interventions (often) unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incremental progress was made in Ethiopia, with the UK feeding into (and funding) plans to liberalise the agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and information and communications sectors, backed by international financial institution (IFI) loans. Partly as a result of embassy efforts and relationships, a consortium including UK firm Vodafone won a licence to operate in Ethiopia in a deal that aimed to catalyse investment and jobs in 2021, although wider liberalisation plans have since faltered. More fruitfully, the UK supported a peace initiative in Ethiopia’s Somali Region, with marginalised and aggrieved populations able to participate. Despite problems with implementation, the Asmara agreement of 2018 may have contributed for a time to reduced violence and improved stability, and facilitated the movement of goods into northern Kenya and Somaliland. This demonstrates how long-term, low-key investments, when combined with political savvy and a trusted implementing partner, can generate results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Somalia, the UK remained an important international stakeholder, leveraging its financial sway in the World Bank’s Multi-Partner Fund, diplomatic capital as UNSC Penholder, and existing relationships with federal member states (FMS) authorities to help push through support for revenue generation, financial management and debt relief via the HIPC process. While donors may have downplayed or deferred corruption and accountability issues along the way, the effort to create administrative structures commensurate with the ambition of Somalia’s transition plans may be an important foundation. Programmes like the Early Recovery Initiative also appeared promising, providing innovative, dialogue-based stabilisation models to better address community needs and bolster FGS–FMS relations. Although experiencing a significant drop in resourcing compared to 2017, UK technical expertise and convening power likewise fed into ongoing efforts to supply famine relief – albeit not on the scale required. Nevertheless, the pernicious impact of economic extraversion and foreign dependency, and a lack of political unanimity among Somalis themselves, continue to hamper higher-level UK objectives, namely the development a durable federal state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite a chequered past, the UK has displayed significant leverage at key moments in Sudan, building on a long history of engagement. Supporting good practice around conflict sensitivity, localisation, transparency and resilience-building allowed British aid to assist more than two million people with food, cash, education, healthcare and water access between 2017 and 2022. Even by linking emergency relief and high-level diplomacy, the UK – alongside other donors – nevertheless failed to win sustainable openings in the humanitarian space before the military reclaimed power. Similarly, British officials proved crucial in backing IFI efforts to cut subsidies, increase public sector wages and establish social safety nets during the political transition, enabling Sudan to eventually satisfy IMF requirements and unlock concessional finance worth $2.5 billion for the first time in 30 years. Nonetheless, limited relief payments, declining living standards, rampant inflation and food shortages all heightened political and social divisions in the lead up to the October 2021 coup, suggesting the strategy framing UK and Western approaches may have ultimately been counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing difficult contextual conditions, resource limitations, uncertainties over critical assumptions and persistent ministerial upheaval in London, these interventions capture important elements of the contemporary UK “offer”. While claims of progress should not be overstated, the examples above provide useful insights into how the UK might continue to advance key elements of its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the relatively small sample of outcomes, interventions and focus areas covered by this project, further research should be conducted into how the UK can pursue (and sustain) its goals, informed by an analysis of UK comparative advantages and limitations across the diplomatic, defence and developmental fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-3&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Attempts by UK officials to better integrate defence, international development and diplomatic (3Ds) work have made progress.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK policy has long emphasised the importance of joined-up action across the “3Ds” and to varying degrees – as per IR21 – have tried to incorporate questions of trade, economic resilience and even science and technology. The research showed clear examples of integrated thinking and action, tying together development, diplomacy and defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK diplomatic, defence and developmental inputs appear, for the most part, mutually reinforcing in Kenya, with high-level engagement from Whitehall combining well with the influence, capabilities and sensitivity of country-based teams. For example, girls’ education has been a UK priority for many years, and coordination across the different sections of BHC was said to have accelerated progress on project delivery. Diplomatic outreach likewise complemented long-term electoral reforms, helping mitigate the risk of local spoilers by ensuring capacity-building efforts were palatable to Kenyan elites. There were also various cases of trade and UK private sector investment becoming better linked with development work, and progress synthesising defence coverage with other strands of UK engagement via frameworks such as CSSF (and specific units like BPST-A). Nevertheless, some respondents felt that the drive for integration may have contributed to deprioritisation of human development agendas in favour of commercial and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Somalia, integration across different government workstreams has long been pursued. Good examples include active diplomatic support for debt relief alongside technical work by development staff. This apparently helped with anti-corruption efforts in the security sector, though there was said to be room for improvement in linking up legacy DFID development work, military inputs and Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)-funded projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sudan has provided fewer opportunities to pursue defence engagement or promote trade, but use of development aid and diplomacy has become more integrated over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the telecoms sector, Ethiopia provided an example of joined-up working across diplomacy, trade promotion and economic development. But outside peacekeeping work, there have been few opportunities for defence engagement in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; To support more coherent, joined-up UK policy towards Africa using the International Development/Africa ministerial NSC seat that was announced in IR23 to put key topics (for example, development, migration, debt) regularly and proactively in front of senior and mid-level decision-makers from across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Improve cross-governmental understanding of integrated working across defence, diplomacy and development issues. Measures could include objective-setting, training (for example, the FCDO diplomatic academy), work shadowing or issuing good practice guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-4&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the abolition of DFID is regretted by some UK regional partners, the creation of the FCDO, though unplanned, shows early promise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The merger of the FCO and DFID has contributed towards stronger policy integration in several cases, and appeared to have been easier in smaller missions or where there was a range of UK interests and perspectives in play and therefore greater balance between the voices of different government departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the disruption associated with internal planning and reorganisation, the FCDO’s formation was generally considered beneficial in Somalia and Sudan. For example, ambassadorial oversight of humanitarian and development work was said to have improved in Sudan since the DFID–FCO merger, corporate messaging became more unified, and dealings with the Sudanese government became easier to communicate. In both countries, DFID’s footprint and resources – though important – did not overshadow those of other departments. Additionally, there was broad acceptance that development challenges had political and security roots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, UK missions hosting a variety of similarly resourced departments, and which had strong incentives to integrate cross-government cooperation into daily operations, were probably better placed to combine FCO and legacy DFID infrastructure into a unified arrangement. In the case of Kenya, the merger was thought to have increased diplomatic engagement in health-related work, and led to better links between trade and development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, issues over prioritisation and leadership seem to have arisen when combining DFID Ethiopia’s sizeable staff base and budget with a far smaller FCO presence. Although benefits were noticeable over time, with former DFID humanitarian advisers now described as more cognisant of political factors associated with gaining access to the Tigray region, some partners felt the creation of the FCDO had cost the UK, undermining its hard-won reputation for aid and development leadership. This feeling was more prominent in Ethiopia and to some degree in Kenya, both countries having enjoyed long engagement with DFID linked to years of high aid spending levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frequently referenced issue was a lack of pre-merger planning. Slow implementation, including delays with integrating teams and systems, were frustrations in all countries, with staff morale (and retention) across UK embassies suffering in many cases. Ongoing restructuring has been necessary at different levels since the new FCDO was formed, and considerable time has been taken up with iterative reorganisation and re-strategising, down to individual embassies and teams. In line with previous research on “machinery of government” changes, all indications are that the creation and refinement of the FCDO will be unfinished business for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Explicit change management processes should be used to guide any further organisational change. Planning should cater for foreseeable risks, draw on the merger’s early lessons and prioritise communicating future direction with external partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-5&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK retains a good reputation across the region for the calibre of its diplomats and development and defence experts, and it has broadly maintained staffing levels despite budget cuts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite budget cuts and reported staff departures at corporate level, the FCDO and the MoD have maintained similar numbers of staff with a focus on the region between 2015 and 2022, and other departments such as Investment and Trade, have slightly increased their presence in Kenya and Ethiopia. Maintaining staff numbers has provided some “damage mitigation”, allowing officials to preserve relationships, provide technical support or exert influence, despite reduced budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The perceived quality of UK staff has similarly been a stabilising factor. It has helped to protect at least some longstanding networks amid political and budget uncertainties, supplemented by strategic staff placements to facilitate multilateral collaboration. The UK’s influence across multiple issues and sectors could however prove time-limited – research findings suggested that existing “clout” may only be sustainable if a narrower set of priorities is adopted or additional resources are brought to bear. At the same time, the increasing arrival of inexperienced civil servants across regional postings has raised questions over the durability of institutional memory in UK embassies, and the transferability of knowledge, contacts and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on lessons from the DFID–FCO merger, ensure that the FCDO’s operating model, including its staff base and handling of external relationships, is optimised to support integrated ways of working in a competitive, post-Brexit context. As part of this, ensure skilled international development professionals are attracted, retained and tasked to work effectively alongside others in pursuit of integrated policy agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-6&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK is reasonably well regarded as a development, defence and diplomatic actor across the region. Despite this, a range of middle and great powers increasingly offer alternative forms of support to East African governments, which contribute to perceptions of declining UK influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research showed that although the UK is less well resourced than the EU or the US, it is often credited by its partners with solid technical knowledge, expertise and convening power. This is in part due to the previous work of DFID, but extends beyond development issues. UK defence and security inputs (for example, training) are also well thought of, but there is awareness that UK political sensitivities can lead to cooperation being curtailed or withdrawn, as previously happened in Ethiopia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK diplomatic skill and outreach are also well regarded. The UK is seen as less strident than the US, with respondents mentioning the UK’s useful closed-door bilateral work and its presence in a range of diplomatic forums. While the UK is often expected to follow US positions, many feel that the UK can still act as a “bridge” between Washington and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prominent non-Western actors in the region include China and Russia, Turkey and the Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turkey is seen as focused on commercial and security issues. It has gained a reputation for small-scale investments and a willingness to deal at subnational level, although in Somalia it has successfully combined soft power, direct investment, military assistance, infrastructural development and humanitarian aid to become one of the FGS’s most prominent international partners. Crucially, this crosscuts elite and wider public sentiment, with Turkish officials, business delegates and NGO workers “walking the streets” and immersing themselves in the daily realities of Somali life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gulf States are thought to seek stability that protects investments (for example, land and productive enterprises in Ethiopia and Sudan) and are seen as pursuing “cheque-book diplomacy”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has a distinctive offer – financing quickly at scale with few conditions, particularly around infrastructure or agriculture. It has had some success framing itself as more generous than traditional donors, including through swift Covid-19 “vaccine diplomacy”. Civil society actors in the region often worry that China’s lack of conditionality or interest in accountability issues can fuel corruption or lower technical standards. More recently, the attractions of its developmental model may also be starting to shift, with loans becoming more expensive, alongside Beijing’s increasing reluctance to fund loss-making “white elephant projects” amid a downturn in its domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia was seen as competing on different grounds compared with the UK and the West, due to quite specific security (arms and miliary cooperation), commercial and political interests. It enjoys residual sympathies due to Soviet support for anti-colonial struggles and longstanding military links. In Ethiopia, Moscow benefits from a shared history of Orthodox Christianity. As with China, there is mutual interest in the principles of non-interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linked to the arrival or revival of these “alternative” actors, it is sometimes said that Western, and UK influence, is in decline. There are several aspects to this, ranging from the idea that alternative offers are on the table, to the growing self-sufficiency and assertiveness of national leaders in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia. This perception of relative decline needs to be recognised in its own right, independent of any impact that UK aid cuts or the withdrawal from the EU may have had on the UK’s standing. Frustrations with the West’s past double standards or moral failings also shape views across the region. Yet there is no consensus on whether the UK has found the right balance in terms of “pragmatism” versus “principles”. It wins plaudits from some in the region for pursuing “practical solutions”, but is seen by others as “less principled” than countries such as Denmark and Sweden, which tend to foreground issues of human rights and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that forging long-term partnerships with a range of constituencies becomes central to strategies in East Africa and for priority countries elsewhere, backed by sufficient time, resources and incentivising development and retention of regional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on this study, commission formal reviews of the contribution that UK defence engagement and international development efforts can feasibly make to UK foreign policy aims globally, focusing strongly on UK added value and clearer prioritisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-7&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK has established relationships and partnerships with a variety of actors. It often operates effectively through ad hoc groupings of bilateral and multilateral networks in the region and globally, bolstered by envoys and technical specialists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the UK–Kenya relationship remains strong, the UK’s cultural influence and the perceived value of its international development “offer” seems to be declining. As the UK competes for commercial advantage with China, the US and others, it has arguably shifted towards “less abrasive” terms of engagement and closer alignment to government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK maintains a range of productive relationships in Ethiopia, but changing political dynamics and the Tigray conflict have upended a previously close partnership with the federal government. Navigating an increasingly polarised environment since 2020, the UK had to work harder to maintain influence and access as it juggled pursuit of humanitarian access, development and trade agendas and exploring ceasefires and peace-talk options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fraught security situation in Somalia makes it hard for foreign donors to build relations beyond reductive, state-centric echo-chambers in FMS palaces or Villa Somalia. Nevertheless, the UK retains a significant voice and exercises comparatively strong links at the subnational level, often acting as a broker for other international stakeholders. With its membership of the Quad and the Quint, the World Bank’s Multi-Partner Fund, the Core Security Partners Group and S6; participation in or chairmanship of several coordination platforms; and position as UN Penholder, the UK has carved a leading diplomatic role and reputation for development expertise that can sometimes catalyse effective responses from others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK enjoys substantial depth and quality of partnerships both within Sudan and with regional actors. The UK won some praise for its political and technical support to the 2019 transitional government, and its support to debt relief. Many pro-democracy campaigners worry about Western willingness to compromise with Sudan’s military, while others would welcome increased UK engagement. Western influence may be seen as declining relative to that of players such as Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but a strength in the UK’s approach has until recently been its engagement with such players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure links and communication between regional and embassy-level officials, including “special envoys”, to coordinate advocacy and diplomacy, and better align missions and engagement across the Gulf and Eastern Africa. This includes adequately resourcing envoy positions, streamlining information flows (across Whitehall and country missions), and providing access to relevant teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Push to consolidate a clear strategy for ad hoc groups such as the Quad, the Quint, S6 and Friends of Sudan, working with partners to clarify (and potentially deconflict) their respective roles, resources, membership and mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-8&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, the UK bilateral aid budget was reduced by around 50% across the region. External relationships suffered as funding decisions were arrived at iteratively and were not always well communicated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reduced UK aid budget is probably the most significant variable examined in this project. The speed and extent of cuts damaged the UK’s reputation and partnerships in all four countries. While examples were found of cutbacks driving innovation, and relationships with national governments and key partners have endured in most cases, the UK is generally seen as less reliable by many organisations that it has partnered with on international aid and development work (both up- and downstream).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK was not the only donor to have reduced funding in Kenya over the research period, but respondents routinely noted that the scale of cuts (equivalent to 46% between 2019 and 2021) lacked any obvious strategic logic and risked diminishing UK capabilities, even in areas where it had previously found success. Despite the recognised need to consolidate procedural and institutional improvements over successive ballot cycles, for instance, stakeholders faced pressure to slash funding for electoral support, detracting from the sustainability of long-term cultural, normative and structural change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia, where past UK aid funding had contributed to impressive reductions in the poverty rate, the decrease in UK bilateral aid by over 50% between 2019 and 2021 was poorly received by many stakeholders. Shrinking budgets did in some cases lead to fresh thinking from UK officials about delivery options, for example, focusing minds on how to draw in resources from elsewhere. But the overall drop hampered the ability of the FCDO’s implementing partners to plan, deliver and maintain good relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flows of UK bilateral aid to Somalia rose considerably between 2019 and 2020, but diminished by 56% the following year, with cuts in staple activities including support for public administration, subnational governance and humanitarian relief. Although the UK is still respected and able to deliver impact with well-designed programming (as, for example, on famine relief and stabilisation), the reductions were described by many as detrimental to UK capacity and likely to diminish influence. While UK officials have been recognised for their expertise, capabilities and coordination during the 2017 humanitarian relief effort in Somalia, federal government stakeholders recently criticised the UK for becoming a “smaller player” and neglecting its leadership role. The disruption or scaling down of projects, delays in tendering or launching follow-up programmes, and confusion over long-term funding have reduced confidence in UK commitments. Resource levels are now arguably mismatched to the UK’s long-term state-building ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to Kenya and Ethiopia, UK budget allocations for Sudan increased in 2020, as the UK sought to demonstrably support Khartoum’s political transition, becoming Whitehall’s fifth-largest bilateral commitment globally. However, funding levels fell back by roughly 55% in 2021/22, due to the 2021 coup, when all non-humanitarian assistance was suspended. Although the UK has traditionally been the largest donor to the UN-run Sudan Humanitarian Fund, today the US, Germany and the Netherlands make larger contributions, leading humanitarian partners to expect a decline in UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarify intentions regarding the 0.7% GNI spending target, including spending priorities in the event of either future budget increases or cutbacks. Ad interim, introduce flexibility by confirming that the current 0.5% GNI spending measure is a floor, not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Brexit did not significantly impair the UK’s operational effectiveness in the region, but alongside other factors has probably contributed to a perception of declining influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the EU has excluded the UK from country-level EU coordination forums in the region. This means that the UK no longer has a formal role in determining the direction of EU defence, development and humanitarian priorities, nor in agreeing common positions. But this has cut two ways. The UK bilateral aid budget received a boost following EU withdrawal, as member contributions were no longer required of the UK. In terms of diplomatic positioning, UK officials now have a freer hand. In these respects, Brexit appeared to have little overt impact on the UK’s reputation or effectiveness in Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. Yet media coverage of protracted UK–EU withdrawal negotiations, and very public politicking around the issue in the UK, did negatively affect perceptions of the UK in the region. Some variations were evident across countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Brexit did not dramatically change UK standing and influence in Kenya, some interviewees argued that it had lost strategic cover – previously able to “lead from the back” on sensitive policy issues in a former colony, the UK now has one fewer channel for exercising influence. When combined with high ministerial turnover and poorly communicated aid reductions, there was also a widespread sense that the UK had become a less predictable partner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming alongside large aid budget cuts and the end of DFID, leaving the EU was felt by many Ethiopian interviewees who valued the UK and DFID’s track record to have diminished UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK’s existing relationships in Sudan have weathered Brexit comparatively well. Despite withdrawing from EU members’ meetings, workarounds have been found to coordinate with EU players. The UK’s network of officials operated effectively across multiple forums in Khartoum, the wider region and New York. Active in the UK–US–Norwegian “Troika” and the “Quad” (the UK with the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE), Whitehall appears to have offset its loss of influence over EU policy. Field research showed many believed that UK dexterity and messaging improved after Brexit, although it was argued that UK ministers might have concentrated more on Sudan’s early political transition in 2019 had it not been for Brexit negotiations at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respondents in Somalia also noted a diversion of UK diplomatic attention during the negotiation period. Others warned that withdrawing UK personnel from Somalia-facing EU activities could undermine local commitments, in part because UK funding contributions and political advocacy helped drive support for AMISOM/ATMIS in Brussels. However, the approval of successive EU financial packages in 2022 and 2023 appeared to have defused these concerns, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure there is sufficient flexibility to continue informal engagement and coordination between UK and EU officials over the long term, particularly at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Invest in working groups and bilateral platforms to enable the UK to continue its role as a “transatlantic bridge” between the EU and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly communicate the scope, scale and mechanics of continuing UK–EU cooperation to help defuse perceptions of an isolated, post-Brexit foreign policy, particularly to local audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-10&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UK strategies at the country level were sometimes unclear, overly broad or outpaced by contextual changes. The lack of a regional strategy also remains a significant gap, given the transnational nature of the opportunities and challenges facing Eastern Africa.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research suggests that the UK could improve its efficacy across Eastern Africa by looking afresh at strategy and providing support for implementation. At the country and sub-regional level, strategies were often vague or outdated, with contentious assumptions, disparities between goals and resources, and a lack of plausible delivery plans contributing to confusion and inefficiency. Similarly, theories of change, shared objectives and priorities were not always well articulated or connected, and at the regional level there appears to be little in the way of a viable roadmap. Given the transnationalised dynamics of local insecurity, development, politics and economic systems – especially across comparatively deprived borderlands – the lack of an East Africa strategy is a serious omission. It is also true that a policy of integrated working across the “3Ds”, linking to other policy areas (for example, trade, science and technology) as prescribed in IR21 and IR23, is complex to execute and cannot be driven by rhetoric alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the Strategic Partnership, the hierarchy of UK objectives in Kenya was not always well framed or understood – although in reality defence and trade relations increasingly appeared to overshadow concerns around accountability or human development. Additionally, there were indications that UK defence engagement and relationship building would benefit from being placed within a clearer overarching strategy, backed up by appropriate political outreach, although this process may reportedly already be under review as the MoD looks to clarify how “persistent engagement” will function in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether UK action in Ethiopia was guided by an up-to-date detailed strategy that matched well-articulated goals and interests to available resources and political will. A wide range of engagements, some in tension with one another, had been kept in play for some years amid a deteriorating context. The UK is not alone here – most Western actors have struggled to adapt to the pace of developments across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, recent events in Sudan are prompting renewed scrutiny of Western and UK strategy. Sudanese interviewees were often sceptical of international efforts to integrate military and security stakeholders into transitional government arrangements, despite the UK’s ability to dialogue with “all sides”. Others argued that UK and other Western actors had focused unduly on technocratic economic reforms during the failed 2019–21 political transition – at the expense of expanding non-elite networks and deepening political analysis to help chart a long-term path towards democratisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite reduced resources, Whitehall’s strategy towards Somalia has proved fairly consistent. Formally committed to the STP, the UK and other “likeminded” countries are continuing to back a “good enough” federal government capable of containing Al-Shabaab. That said, some query the execution and underlying assumptions of this approach, particularly the feasibility of building a stable state without prior societal and clan agreement on basic political questions. In the absence of local buy-in, ownership and shared alignment, the creation of artificial systems dependent on external resourcing raises the risk of aid diversion and economic extraversion that may disrupt or undermine Somali-led peacebuilding. At the same time, a reduction or withdrawal of donor support would likely precipitate a complete government collapse akin to that in Afghanistan. Amid new priorities in Ukraine, implausible timelines, international fatigue, and deeply embedded political and developmental challenges, the gulf between the strategic ambitions and hard realities of UK engagement seem to be growing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop integrated strategies for UK engagement with priority African countries and regions, including those in Eastern Africa. Guided by high-level policy such as IR23 and NSC decisions and informed by the context, these strategies should clearly articulate interests, values and objectives, while offering a means to revisit assumptions, possible dilemmas and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Measures could include setting shared objectives, training (for example, the FCDO diplomatic academy), work shadowing or issuing good practice guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has set out research findings on the UK’s use of international development, diplomacy and defence engagement in Eastern Africa from 2015 to 2022. It finds that the region has not been allotted the resources or level of attention initially signalled by IR21. It is notable that the UK has made progress on a number of its policy agendas despite domestic, regional and global challenges. The UK’s best results often seem to derive from long-term engagements. These have generated contextual understanding and broad-based relationships that could be leveraged in future for positive change. With strong cultural ties and a track record of providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and development and defence know-how, many in the region recognise the UK’s contributions and might welcome increased engagement from the UK on genuinely shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in a post-Brexit world of increasing geopolitical competition, the UK will have to face questions about its positioning towards Africa. The research surfaces important questions concerning the nature of UK–Africa relations and the role of aid, development and defence engagement within an integrated foreign policy. For example, policy statements in favour of “integration” or “partnerships”, while useful, do not in themselves constitute an effective strategy. With a contracting resource base, positive results may become harder to demonstrate in an increasingly competitive and transactional environment. African governments also now have a wider array of potential partners and greater leverage in shaping foreign engagement. This fact, together with policy decisions such as a reduced aid budget, contributes to perceptions of declining UK influence within the region. In the face of this, the UK will need to communicate its added value towards Africa very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the initial struggles around changes from Brexit to the FCDO merger recede, new opportunities could emerge for the UK to forge effective two-way partnerships. The UK should now clearly articulate its policy priorities towards the region and Africa writ large and establish a two-way dialogue with African partners at government and societal level on shared priorities. Whereas UK approaches were previously characterised by the use of aid for poverty reduction, the scope of UK development engagement is broadening, focusing more explicitly on the national interest and on establishing wider partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the country moves through its next electoral cycle by 2024, the UK government would do well to consider how the UK can pursue its significant diplomatic, security and development interests towards Africa in light of this project’s findings and recommendations, as well as their implications for engagement elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;余慧明完成作供 辯方案情完結 暫押至11.27結案陳詞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fbf1LlO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第115天。本案由2月6日開審至今，歷時近7個月，最後一名不認罪被告余慧明今完成4天作供，辯方案情完結，法官暫定押至11月27日讓雙方進行口頭結案陳詞，料需時約兩至三周。就法官李運騰有份審理的《蘋果日報》案原定12月18日開審，法官陳慶偉指若撞期，該案可再押後，李運騰亦稱相信該案律師不會介意延誤多數天。法官亦指押後期間會處理部分認罪被告就同意案情的爭議，但暫不會處理求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今接受盤問時，表明認為以否決預算案爭取五大訴求為合法、合理的手段，強調並非「淨係想破壞而無建設」，真正目的是爭取雙普選。被問是否有意與其他議員聯手否決預算案，余稱每個議員為獨立個體，「我冇辦法迫人哋去做」，「墨落無悔」聲明亦無表明會聯同其他議員運用權力；而她從決定參選至勝出也沒有相信參選人之間有協議。余作供完畢後，向旁聽親友面露微笑做握拳手勢，散庭時興奮地跳起數下，向親友飛吻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱雖以個人身分參選仍諮詢會員若大部分不支持或不參選&quot;&gt;余稱雖以個人身分參選仍諮詢會員、若大部分不支持或不參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，今繼續接受主控萬德豪盤問。余表示以個人而非工會身分參選，她先諮詢工會是因作為一名工會代表，擔心會員對她參選會有些反感，同意並非一定要諮詢，只是出於禮貌。法官陳仲衡問，那余想過工會不支持她參選會怎樣？余指如會員大部分不太支持，「我可能唔考慮呢條路線，因為始終嗰陣時我都係一個工會嘅代表，我唔可以唔理會我啲會員嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，約於6月初選競選階段時，聘請3至4名全職競選團隊成員，他們的薪金「全部都係我自己畀嘅」，因她以個人名義出選，「我一蚊都冇用過工會錢㗎，況且我係工會代表嗰時，我都冇收過工會嘅人工」；她亦有十多名義工，當中3至5名為核心義工。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱從無讀過戴耀廷區諾軒文章&quot;&gt;余稱從無讀過戴耀廷區諾軒文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，余的團隊成員有否告知她戴耀廷和區諾軒曾寫過關於否決預算案和「攬炒」的文章，余說沒有。萬再指戴作為初選組織者和公眾人物，余知道他於Facebook和《蘋果日報》發表文章嗎？余指不知道，因無追蹤戴Facebook，也無人告訴過她；而她「睇連登多過睇報紙」，看《蘋果日報》亦主要看港聞和娛樂，不知道戴對35+的目標有政治看法。余後在覆問稱，被捕前從無讀過戴耀廷和區諾軒的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱否決財案爭五大訴求為合法合理手段&quot;&gt;余稱否決財案爭五大訴求為合法合理手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選提名表格，余慧明同意簽署和提交時均無留意「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」的條款，指表格由助理填寫，助理無問她何謂共識，亦無告訴她曾否問組織者。萬德豪續指，條款中「目標」的英文是「goals」、是眾數，問余其助理是否護士？教育程度是什麼？余指是大學生。法官陳仲衡指萬是假設該助理閱讀表格的英文版，陳慶偉亦着控方改問助理有否與她討論計劃目標，「不論語言」，余回應沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，余慧明是否曾提及，願（willing to）以任何合法方式爭取五大訴求，余答「係」。萬再問，余是會（would）以任何合法方式爭取五大訴求？余說：「誒同頭先嗰個問題有乜嘢分別啊，都係『係』囉，或者你會唔會解釋一次第二次嘅問法同埋第一次嘅問法會唔會有乜大分別？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬說第一個問題是「You were willing」，第二個問題是「You would」，法官陳慶偉笑說：「有什麼分別？」旁聽席發笑。李運騰說沒關係，總之余兩條問題答案均為「是」，余同意，並在盤問下指，否決預算案爭取五大訴求「係一個合法兼且合理嘅手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否有意聯同他人否決-余每個議員為獨立個體無法迫人做&quot;&gt;被問是否有意聯同他人否決 余：每個議員為獨立個體無法迫人做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就余慧明於2020年3月發布的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提到「爭取35席後為手段，然後全面否決所有政府提出的議案為目的，藉此觸發基本法第五十條，令特首宣佈解散立法會，制造憲政危機，此為制度內的『攬炒』」，萬德豪指若無35席便不能否決所有政府議案，而為了行使否決權，大多數議員應一同行動，余均同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，因此余有意與其他議員聯手（join force）組成大多數否決預算案？余說：「但係每一個議員都係自己一個獨立嘅個體，我冇辦法迫人哋去做囉。」李運騰指，但若要達到余所說的目標，便需要民主派議員合作或有協議，余同意，並於覆問稱從決定參選至勝出初選，沒有相信參選人之間有協議，而她於8月訪問提到「我覺得大家係要簽一份共同認同嘅綱領」，是因「就係冇（協議）我先會咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱否決財案非目的僅手段我哋唔係淨係想破壞冇建設&quot;&gt;余稱否決財案非目的僅手段：我哋唔係淨係想破壞冇建設&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又承認上文錯用「目的」一字，指全面否決所有政府議案「唔係我哋嘅最終目的」，最終目的應是該段最後一句「再共同建構重光後的香港」，即「真正落實到『港人治港，高度自治』」；又解釋指：「因為我哋唔係想爭取否決晒所有議案呀嘛，我哋唔係淨係想破壞而冇建設，我哋嘅真正目的係想爭取雙普選」，同意法官李運騰指否決預算案並非目的，而是達致目的之手段（means to an end）。萬德豪質疑，余稱這是其宣言，會花時間準備，余同意，「但唔代表我嘅選字一定係最正確囉，始終我真係一個政治嘅素人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余提到：「當初要爭取議會過半，全面反枱，迫使政權解散立法會進行破局。這個目標一日未達成，一日亦要堅持」，余重申否決財案並非最終目標，強調「我係一直都想爭取五大訴求缺一不可」，並認為真普選是最重要。余在法官陳慶偉追問下，同意她望廢除功能組別，因認為「一個議席唔應該淨係代表到一小撮人嘅利益囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱簽墨落僅表達自己立場不包括聯同他人運用權力&quot;&gt;余稱簽「墨落」僅表達自己立場、不包括聯同他人運用權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於余於6月簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，萬德豪指余知道其他簽署者均同意當選後會否決預算案，余說「依個我唔肯定喎，佢簽咋嘛」，「佢哋話佢哋會囉。」萬續指出，余簽聲明時，實向公眾表明她會聯同其他未來議員否決預算案，余說：「我只係表達返我自己嘅立場，依度都唔包括話我會聯同其他立法會議員一齊運用基本法賦予嘅權力啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱專訪未完全反映其意思-重申若提修改或釀公關災難&quot;&gt;余稱專訪未完全反映其意思 重申若提修改或釀公關災難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引余慧明4月的《獨立媒體》專訪〈從組織工會到走進議會 余慧明：我要真攬炒！〉，提到余慧明「正積極考慮參選立法會『衞生服務界』，為了立法會過半後，全面否決政府提出的議案，製造憲政危機，重組一個真正為人民服務的政府」，余指這是記者選用的詞語，但「唔完全反映到我嘅意思囉」。李運騰指，該段最後也提到「重組一個真正為人民服務的政府」，與余的文章意思一致，余同意「差唔多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，余受訪後無向記者表示要修改。余重申當時已進入競選階段，如向記者指「有啲字眼我想執」、甚至全篇文章下架，有機會被其他潛在候選人攻擊、造成「公關災難」，故無特別處理。萬指，但無任何事情阻止余在 Facebook 就文章發表意見，余同意，但她沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬再引訪問提到「她很清楚，立會過半的目標，是透過否決政府的所有議案，令立法會停擺，觸發憲政危機」。余指「目標」是記者選擇的用語，萬追問是錯誤的選擇？余說：「我唔識幫佢答喎。」李運騰追問記者有否扭曲余的意思，余說：「佢唔算扭曲，但解釋得唔夠詳細囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續主動舉例，訪問提到「她記得，當時醫管局剛轉用電子派藥系統，有次醫生將某藥物的使用方法更改，系統卻沒有標示」，但她受訪時是指派藥的「三核五對（3 Checks 5 Rights）」中第二次核對只標示藥物處方，無顯示使用途徑。李運騰指毋須進入細節，「我們也不會明白」，余說：「可能陳慶偉法官會明」（陳為註冊藥劑師），陳慶偉說「我明白」，但笑言不認為與案相關，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余強調國安法後不認為爭取五大訴求的目標及手段違法&quot;&gt;余強調《國安法》後不認為爭取五大訴求的目標及手段違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明5月15日於「大紀元」的訪問，提及如當選後要反對政府任何議案，「去逼使呢個政權，佢一定要回應五大訴求缺一不可」，而非只是回應其中一兩個，又強調「我哋個口號唔淨係一個口號式嘅抗爭，我哋係要用行動去表達，我哋係要求政府真係要回應晒全部五大訴求，先可以叫做解決到呢件事囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問余，該想法直至《國安法》落實後是否也沒有改變？余同意，指「爭取五大訴求缺一不可，一直都係我爭取緊嘅嘢」，即使《國安法》通過後「我都唔認為爭取五大訴求缺一不可係違法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，余或認為目標不違法，但達致此目標的手段，余當時也認為是合法？余說「係」。控方問她曾否於訪問或 Facebook 專頁表明若政府放低身段對話，會與政府「有得傾」，余指記憶中沒有，強調「呢個係我嘅談判策略嚟嘅，我冇可能公開畀大眾知囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否意圖顛覆國家政權-余絕對不同意&quot;&gt;被問是否意圖顛覆國家政權 余：絕對不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日抗爭派記者會，梁晃維、岑敖暉、王百羽會上發言提及否決預算案時提到「我哋」，余說這是他們用的詞彙，但不等於事前「有傾過」。而余會後無向他們和公眾表示其言論不代表她，因認為無此需要，且每個議員也是獨立個體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rJ6f7O4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪最後指出控方案情，指余與其他被告串謀取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，余不同意。萬再指她意圖顛覆國家政權，余答：「絕對不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方完成覆問後，余完成作供，在座位喝水後，向旁聽親友面露微笑，在腰間做出握拳手勢，並在兩名懲教陪同下步回被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官下令控辯雙方分別於103及117前呈交結案陳詞&quot;&gt;官下令控辯雙方分別於10.3及11.7前呈交結案陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方案情完成，代表梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙其後表示，將呈上梁2015至2017年就預算案的投票紀錄。就結案陳詞，萬德豪指控方需時4星期準備，大律師石書銘稱辯方需要同樣時間。萬問控方會否被給予時間再回應，法官指控方通常無權就證據再回應，除非涉法律議題，控方屆時可再作申請。法官陳慶偉終下令，控方須於10月3日前呈交書面陳詞，辯方則於11月7日前回應，每名被告限30頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 續指本案牽涉頗為新的法例，辯方需更多頁數探討條文字眼。陳慶偉指可增加至35頁，又指辯方可以點列式處理。石書銘指辯方或就法律觀點呈交聯合陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s2V9AWP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官暫定1127結案陳詞-料需時兩至三周&quot;&gt;官暫定11.27結案陳詞 料需時兩至三周&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑問，法庭能否定下結案陳詞日期。陳慶偉指未能決定，因視乎法律議題的複雜性，但大概是在11至12月期間，望能於聖誕節前後完成，又指向身旁的李運騰，指他有另一宗案件（黎智英《蘋果日報》案）將於12月18日開審，「我不能承諾你任何事情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，聽取所有口頭陳詞或需兩至三星期，陳世傑再追問暫定日子，陳慶偉指大約是11月27日。潘熙問需多少天、5天是否可以，李運騰指5天有點太樂觀，因控方需涵蓋16名被告的案情及相關法律議題，控方陳詞或需5天，又指寧願預留較多時間（generous）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑關注，若11月27日開始陳詞，或與另案（《蘋果》案）重疊，陳慶偉擺動右手說：「那就由它，再延期（“So be it, further defer.”）」，庭上傳來笑聲。李運騰續說如有需要，不認為該案的律師會介意延誤多數天（“I don’t think the counsel in the other case would mind a few days’ delay if necessary.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RTcrhXX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉又指，案件押後期間，會處理部分認罪被告就同意案情的爭議，但李運騰補充不會在該段時間聽取求情，而是先處理事實的部分，Beel 指何桂藍望出席該些聆訊。陳慶偉下令休庭前，提醒各方執拾物品，指現在要清空此法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，多名旁聽人士上前揮手，梁國雄、林卓廷等也不住揮手回應，余慧明則在被告欄內興奮地跳起數下，又向旁聽親友飛吻。部分准保釋被告離庭時神情輕鬆，劉偉聰、何啟明，黃碧雲、施德來均一同離開，當中連日審訊均自備坐墊、交律師保管在庭內的施亦攜同座墊離開。漫畫家尊子今亦有來旁聽，「王婆婆」王鳳瑤亦有於庭外聲援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2月初開審-至今近7個月&quot;&gt;2月初開審 至今近7個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案今年2月6日開審，原定審期90天，至今歷時近7個月，惟至審訊第115天才完成辯方案情。47名被告中，原有18人不認罪，惟伍健偉和林景楠開審前改為認罪，最終16人不認罪受審。翻查資料，審訊第1至58日處理被告答辯和控方案情，第59至64日處理共謀者原則爭議及中段陳詞，第65日至115日則處理辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16名被告中，鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林及李予信10人獲准保釋，何桂藍、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、余慧明及吳政亨6人則須還柙。而當中楊雪盈、黃碧雲、林卓廷和梁國雄均不作供亦無傳召證人；吳政亨和柯耀林無作供但有傳召證人，其餘10人均有出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，認罪被告包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚、梁晃維、岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、尹兆堅、毛孟靜、胡志偉及劉頴匡曾到庭旁聽，他們於開審首周獲准在正庭與不認罪被告同坐，但至區諾軒開始作供後被改安排至延伸庭就坐，其後男女分庭而坐。准保釋的呂智恆亦曾到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有多人曾旁聽本案，包括歌手黃耀明，立法會議員謝偉俊（其律師行代表本案被告彭卓棋、區諾軒和鍾錦麟），漫畫家尊子，民主黨劉慧卿、黃偉賢，社民連陳寶瑩、黃浩銘、曾健成、陳皓桓，支聯會徐漢光，「王婆婆」王鳳瑤及多國領事等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件現暫定11月27日進行口頭結案陳詞，料法庭將押後裁決，並連同其餘31名認罪被告進行求情和判刑，意味屆時其中32名被告已還柙近2年8個月。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;余慧明稱初選結果公布後「35+計劃」已完結 後續協調僅處理「爛攤子」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第114天。余慧明繼續作供，就7月15日的抗爭派記者會，余自視為抗爭意志較堅定、與主流泛民有別的「抗爭派」而出席，但會前無與出席者討論發言內容，自言與他們「唔係好熟」，亦不同意記招是對組織者中止初選的回應、表示抗爭派想繼續。余又指當時「完全唔知」中聯辦前一天發聲明譴責初選或違法，並認為初選結果公布後，「35+計劃」已完結，其後若有協調工作亦只是處理計劃的「爛攤子」，她也是庭上始知組織者當時「有手尾」如選前民調要處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，衞生服務界從無討論關於財政預算案的問題，無共識辦有約束力的初選，否認呈堂協調文件是候選人共識。法官一度關注控方盤問基礎，控方指可作有關推論。此外，余亦稱其抗爭立場包括就抗疫議題提批評和建議，但卻被指為「抹黑政府」；余認為未能成功爭取是因無真正了解民意的政府，故最重要是爭取雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余強調初選要有約束力-如落敗一定唔會參選&quot;&gt;余強調初選要有約束力 如落敗「一定唔會參選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明繼續作供，余昨稱由於選民資格認證爭議，衞生服務界初選終並無約束力。辯方大律師石書銘今問，余當時是否認為要有約束力，余說「當然啦，如果唔係選嚟做咩呀」，強調初選目的只得一個，「就係揀選一位候選人，代表民主派出選衞生服務界」，故如其他候選人落選，「我係希望佢哋可以尊重個賽果囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示衞生服務界群組紀錄，顯示當時提及四個方案，方案一為凡於衞生服務界票站投票的選民均假設為有資格投票，如至少三位候選人同意此方案，投票結果將有約束力；方案二為要提供有效證件才可投票，如至少三人同意此方案，結果將有約束力；方案三與方案二一樣，只是沒有約束力；方案四為取消初選。當中余慧明和劉凱文選擇方案二、李國麟選擇方案一、袁偉傑選擇方案三。最終戴耀廷指在無決定的狀態下，只能是方案三，投票只供參考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以是一個妥協？余說：「只係一個無可奈何嘅方法囉」，並指戴曾說「如果唔接受嘅話就唔搞初選」，同意她是不情願接受，並曾發文表達自己立場，提及「希望亦相信各位候選人會尊重初選結果以達至舉辦初選的初衷，最終只有一位候選人代表民主派出選九月立法會選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，那若余於初選落敗，還會受約束不參選嗎？余加重了語氣：「依個正正就係我想講嘅嘢，我係願意有約束力的話，就係講，如果我係輸咗的話，我就一定唔會去參選囉。」即使最終方案無約束力，她自己也會遵從初選結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指衞生服務界從無討論財案問題僅視戴耀廷訊息為資訊分享&quot;&gt;余指衞生服務界從無討論財案問題、僅視戴耀廷訊息為「資訊分享」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷7月14日於群組發出「我公開訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力包括否決財政預算案，今（令）特區政府問責，不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府，供大家參考」，余慧明同意是群組首次提及否決財案。余指「因為我哋個界別係從來都冇討論過關於財政預算案呢個問題，我只係覺得係一個資訊嘅分享」，故除以表情符號表示感謝外無其他回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，戴的訊息是突然出現，余知道他為何在群組發出嗎？余指因當時有建制派或黨媒說初選犯法，「所以我諗戴耀廷就係為咗回應呢啲咁嘅輿論，就 share 咗呢啲訊息出嚟囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指戴耀廷715退出群組余初選後約候選人開會拒劉凱文任plan-b&quot;&gt;余指戴耀廷7.15退出群組、余初選後約候選人開會拒劉凱文任「Plan B」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，戴耀廷曾於初選前的7月6日發訊息指，若投票選民數目不理想，要於7月17日再舉行協調會議，以決定最後參選隊伍數目。余於初選後的7月14日曾發訊息問是否還需開會，戴耀廷說不用，惟余覺得「個問題未解決」，遂於7月16日發訊息邀請各參選人就衞生服務界的協調工作磋商，「想其他參選人即使無約束力下也尊重賽果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余確認，她發訊息前戴耀廷已退出群組，戴於7月15日發訊息指「結果已公布了，這群組的功能已完成。我一會兒會把這群組刪除」，不久後就退出群組。李運騰指，區諾軒曾稱當天早上到戴的辦公室表示退出初選，余記得，但對戴退出群組前有否任何人宣布35+計劃結束不太有印象，僅有印象於 Facebook 看到區諾軒稱要退出，但也不記得日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，當時她無想過要組織者出席該會議，而最終僅劉凱文出席，會上劉提出想做余的「Plan B」，惟余最終拒絕：「因為我覺得佢同我嘅政治路線唔同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指認知抗爭派記者會類似造勢大會自視抗爭派遂出席&quot;&gt;余指認知抗爭派記者會類似「造勢大會」、自視「抗爭派」遂出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日舉行的抗爭派記者會，余指不記得有人直接邀請抑或邀請其競選團隊出席，她認為「抗爭派」即「抗爭意志比較堅定、同主流泛民係有分別」，而她自視為「抗爭派」，故決定出席，事前僅知道黃之鋒、何桂藍和岑敖暉會出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，就記者會的目的，「我認知嘅類似係造勢大會」，因知道是「立場比較進取」的初選勝出者出席。陳慶偉問，余當時知道7月14日中聯辦曾發聲明譴責初選或違法嗎？余指當時無留意到、「我係完全唔知」，是收到審訊文件夾後才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余認為35計劃於715已完結-後續協調工作為處理爛攤子&quot;&gt;余認為「35+計劃」於7.15已完結 後續協調工作為「處理爛攤子」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，區諾軒於7月15日決定退出初選，記者會是對組織者中止初選的回應嗎？即抗爭派想要繼續（carry on）？余說「我嘅認知唔係」。陳問，即純粹慶祝抗爭派勝利？余回應當日發出的聲明亦提到另一個目的，「係想同泛民嘅一啲合作囉」，指她赴會前「我嘅認知都係咁多」。余亦不記得是在記者會前或後知道區諾軒退出、不肯定當時是否知道趙家賢翌日退出，也無留意戴耀廷其後宣布「休息」，因無追蹤其 Facebook。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問7月15日時，余認為「35+計劃」還繼續進行嗎？余說：「我認為係已經完咗㗎喇，即係當個（初選）結果出咗嚟之後。」陳指或已知道結果，但初選後或會再舉行民意調查及協調會議討論出選名單數量，追問余認為7月15或16日時，「35+計劃」是否仍繼續進行？余重申「對我嚟講係已經完結咗喇」。至於是否關注其他區，「我會 concern 係邊個出選囉」，「因為我要知道將來可能要同咩人合作囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，余說計劃已完結的說法不能是對的，因雖然已有初選結果，但衞生服務界的結果只供參考，余當然會預期有後續工作，例如有參選人拒從初選結果如何處理。余說：「我認為兩者係冇衝突嘅，因為我認為35+呢個 project 係真係完咗，而之後嘅協調工作，只係處理佢嘅爛攤子囉」。陳續指，大概是由區諾軒和戴耀廷所領導的後續工作，余回應：「當時我唔知佢有手尾做，但係喺庭上面就聽到係有囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指抗爭派記者會前無討論當選後做什麼同意抗爭派聲明內容&quot;&gt;余指抗爭派記者會前無討論當選後做什麼、同意抗爭派聲明內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，7月15日抵達記者會場時已看到部分出席者，但無與他們討論記者會說什麼，「因為我本身同佢哋唔係好熟呢，我自己坐埋咗一邊」。陳仲衡指部分人曾為她站台，余說「冇錯，佢哋純粹嚟站台囉，我哋稱唔上朋友，因為電話都冇，都係我嘅團隊邀請佢哋」。余亦指，會前出席者無討論當選後會做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成和何桂藍早前稱，會前與會者一同草擬聲明。余表示，印象中沒有參與草擬，因對早前提到的 Google 文件「我冇印象我有見過」，亦不肯定當時有否被邀請參與討論。李運騰問余是否知道其他人當時在草擬聲明，余不肯定，但看到有部分出席者「揸住部電話」，「似係傾緊一啲嘢嘅」，她亦知道一般記者會流程會先讀出聲明或新聞稿，故預期會有一份類似的文件，只是不記得有否參與討論或草擬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會上讀出的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，余指看騰本和片段令她有此印象，但如不看就不記得內容。辯方問為何余無留意，余指因認為聲明「都係 call 依個記者會嘅人準備囉」，而她只是「被邀請嘅出席者」。不過余亦表明承認是記者會出席者、有準備會上發言，並同意有在聲明署名。陳慶偉問她同意聲明內容嗎？余說：「我同意㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱爭取醫療制度改革未能成功因政府不解民意最重要爭取雙普選&quot;&gt;余稱爭取醫療制度改革未能成功因政府不解民意、最重要爭取雙普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後問，余慧明除了爭取雙普選，就衞生服務界的議題還有何抗爭立場。余指雖記者會未必講明，但她「一直都係做緊」，其「抗爭立場」可分為三個層次，首先作為醫療界別的工會代表，她一直就抗疫議題提出批評和建議，「但係可惜都不被政府接納嘅，更加被人形容為係別有用心、抹黑政府囉」；其次她一直爭取醫療制度改革，改善醫患比例，指是工會第一屆理事會政綱，他們亦有推行實質的「社區醫療自救計劃」，「想話畀人聽我哋唔係得個講字囉。」李運騰指毋須細節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三個層面，余認為上述兩個層面都未能成功爭取的原因，是「我哋冇一個真正了解民意嘅政府，所以最重要嘅層面，係我哋要爭取一個雙普選嘅制度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZhA0QAH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余相信否決財案機制無違反基本法或國安法&quot;&gt;余相信否決財案機制無違反《基本法》或《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「區區Interview」於8月10日發布余慧明訪問片段，余指訪問由一至兩小時剪成10分鐘，內容「大致上係 fair」，但有部分剪走其詳細解釋「令到成句嘅意思就有啲怪」。就余提到：「我諗破局最初嘅概念就係35+，即係爭取議會過半引致個憲制危機啦，咁就要佢用行政命令去解散立法會，令到佢一定要回應『五大訴求，缺一不可』呢個目標」，余指「爭取議會過半」後她應有解釋有何現象引致憲政危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問余的意思有否被扭曲或斷章取義，余說「有少少㗎」，因議會過半不會即時引致憲政危機，「佢壓縮咗我一啲字眼」，李運騰指理解是兩次否決財案令特首下台，余同意，亦同意片中表達意思與她早前的訪問和 Facebook 帖文亦一致：「因為我認為透過《基本法》之下解決行政立法分歧嘅機制，係冇違反《基本法》或者《國安法》嘅，我當時仍然係咁樣相信。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訪問稱要簽共同綱領-余就係冇我先會咁講&quot;&gt;訪問稱要簽「共同綱領」 余：就係冇我先會咁講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余訪問中亦提到「共同綱領」，認為如以爭取「五大訴求，缺一不可」為目標，「我覺得大家係要簽一份共同認同嘅綱領，起碼叫做大家有個 agreement 喺依度」；又指如真的促成35+，「候選人都應該要認同番呢一份共同嘅綱領」，不要臨陣退縮，「就會令到我哋唔夠票，做唔到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是哪些人之間的「共同綱領」，余指「大家」是指正選後真的達成35席以上的民主派。石書銘問以余當時認知，民主派潛在參選人之間有任何協議嗎？余說：「就係冇，所以我先會咁講。」余亦指，無與組織者和參與者就當選後做什麼有任何協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱對公民黨及數個初選記者會不知悉無深究三投三不投&quot;&gt;余稱對公民黨及數個初選記者會不知悉、無深究「三投三不投」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余最後確認，就3月25日公民黨記者會、3月26日的35+記者會、7月6日、11和12日的初選記者會，她當時均不知道，直至收到審訊文件夾才得知。而她於6月9日初選記者會後獲競選團隊告知會上正式公布衞生服務界有初選；她亦有留意7月13日公布初選結果的記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q52rf9x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月9日 35+初選記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「三投三不投」，余重申到了「好後期」、於7月投票日前才聽過，但無深究內容。陳仲衡指該計劃與余關注初選的約束力有關，余重申當時有正職和初選競選，「私人時間都冇晒」，「我真係冇去深究依個唔關初選事嘅 programme 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱無追問戴耀廷因搭單搞唔係太好意思催人哋&quot;&gt;余稱無追問戴耀廷因「搭單搞」、「唔係太好意思催人哋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘表示完成主問，續由主控萬德豪進行盤問。余表示4月中聯絡戴耀廷提出能否辦衞生服務界初選後，二人無再聯絡，直至6月9日記者會才知會辦初選。控方質疑余期間無追問戴，余指因衞生服務界是「搭單去搞，即係禮貌上，我唔係太好意思去催人哋」，重申認為「如果搞得成就去啦，搞唔成就再算啦」；而余雖望初選有約束力，但聯絡戴時無表明，「因為我已經假設會有囉」，「如果冇嘅話，咁搞嚟做咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又重申，5月中《立場新聞》分別訪問4名潛在候選人時，得知有另外3名潛在競爭者，但不記得他們有否表達對辦初選的看法，余也無與3人討論過初選應否有約束力，無留意就此有協議。余又指直至6月24日戴耀廷開設群組前，戴無提過初選安排或候選人間要有協議，而余就初選只曾聯絡戴耀廷而非其他組織者，並指她會「自己搞返」與組織者的聯絡，宣傳則交助手處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余否認與候選人有共識辦有約束力初選&quot;&gt;余否認與候選人有共識辦有約束力初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪又引戴耀廷決定初選不具約束力後，李國麟曾發訊息「未有共識 不就是照舊嗎？」，指「照舊」是指有約束力的初選，余指「我唔係咁理解」；萬又引李提到「大會突然作此決定 與初選的原則及初心不同 有負選民期望 實屬不幸」，指李想有約束力的初選，余回應只能說李想選方案一。萬最後指出，事實上余與其他候選人有共識辦有約束力的初選，余不同意，「因為我哋冇討論過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Qm8MzlE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李國麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指協議文件為候選人共識-官關注有否證據-控方指屬推論&quot;&gt;控方指協議文件為候選人共識 官關注有否證據 控方指屬「推論」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續展示「民主派衛生服務界協調機制協議」文件，該文件提及「會積極」運用否決權，並提到有兩個票站。余昨稱戴耀廷原提出4個，但最終減至3個。萬引戴於群組提及有4個票站時，余曾問：「想問最後只有四個票站可供衞生服務界投票，但總票站有二百多個？」萬說余用「最後」一詞，是因原本只有兩個票站，而組織者再找多了？余笑說：「我依度嘅意思就係總票站有200幾個，但係最後我哋得4個？你畀咁少我？」旁聽席發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指出，事實上該文件是衞生服務界潛在候選人的書面共識，余不同意。萬再指，該共識是在6月8日前已達成。陳慶偉問「6月8日前？」，李運騰亦問控方有否證據顯示該界別候選人6月8日前曾一同商議。萬回應是根據趙家賢的 WhatsApp 紀錄，李運騰問趙有否出席衞生服務界協調會議，萬說沒有。李續說，「你可以指出案情以節省時間，但她會不同意」，余答「不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5WXLQre.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 趙家賢（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問：「為何是6月8日？」，萬解釋趙家賢當天曾要求戴將所有協議的最終版本發出，並收到相關文件。李運騰問，但控方有紀錄顯示衞生服務界參選人於6月8日前，收到同一份文件嗎？萬回應：「我們是在談及可以作出的推論。（“What we are talking about is the inference to be drawn.”）」李運騰指余已回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指余簽墨落因是衞生服務界共識-余稱記得其他人無簽&quot;&gt;控方指余簽「墨落」因是衞生服務界共識 余稱記得其他人無簽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，余慧明有讀過提名表格上「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」的條款，余不同意。而就「墨落無悔」聲明提到戴耀廷於6月9日記者會稱毋須簽協議，余指她當時不知道此事，是簽署「墨落」時才知道。萬德豪問，故「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句與余無關？余說「其實都係㗎，不過我想表達我嘅立場係好夠堅定咋嘛」、「我想表達我咁堅定嘅立場畀我嘅選民睇囉」，又指有些簽署者也無參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指出，余慧明簽署「墨落」，是因兩點聲明是其界別候選人的共識，余不同意。李運騰關注，除余慧明外其他衞生服務界候選人有否簽署，余指「我記得就冇嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（28日）續審，余將繼續接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is adopting major new industrial policies with the objective of restoring the international competitiveness of its semiconductor industry. At the end of the 1980s, the industry accounted for over 50 percent of world production — a figure that had fallen to 9 percent by 2022. Today, the Japanese industry lags behind the global technological leaders by an estimated 10 years. Reflecting policymakers’ sense of urgency and concern, Japan has put aside practices that characterized its industrial policy throughout much of the postwar era, including limits on foreign investment and an aversion to allowing major foreign-owned manufacturing facilities to operate in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, collaborations with foreign partners are seen as imperative. On May 4, 2022, at the first meeting of the bilateral Japan-U.S. Commercial and Industrial Partnership (JUCIP), the parties agreed on “Basic Principles on Semiconductor Cooperation,” which outlined a vision for collaborating on objectives and strategies for establishing a more resilient semiconductor supply chain. Then, at the U.S.-Japan summit held on May 23 that same year, a joint task force for developing next-generation semiconductors was launched to implement the Basic Principles. At a meeting of the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Committee in July 2022, the two countries agreed to pursue joint research and development (R&amp;amp;D) in key technologies, and Japan announced the formation of a public research organization patterned on the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) called the Leading-Edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-paradigm&quot;&gt;A New Paradigm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While similar-sounding U.S.-Japan accords have been announced over the preceding decades in many sectors — often with little subsequent practical impact — the Economic Policy Committee agreement was concluded against the backdrop of an increasingly assertive China and the recent economic shocks arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the disruption of chip supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, both governments are approaching their vulnerabilities in semiconductors as a matter of urgent priority, with a recognition that neither country can pursue a go-it-alone approach to advanced chipmaking. In both countries, the pandemic has prompted policymakers to focus on the concept of “economic security” and the industrial policies necessary to reduce strategic risk. In May 2022, Japan enacted the Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA), bundling four separate laws together. The ESPA directed Japanese companies to consider economic security in their decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been a series of dramatic policy measures both in Japan and in the United States — including the enactment of major semiconductor-related industrial promotion legislation, unprecedented bilateral industrial collaborations in chip manufacturing and research, and equally unprecedented restrictions on the export of advanced chip technology to China. Japan’s new semiconductor promotional measures roughly correspond to measures the United States is taking pursuant to the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Similarly, Japan’s recent imposition of new export controls to China on 23 types of chip technology roughly parallels similar trade measures enacted by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the bilateral U.S.-Japan accord on Basic Principles, the two countries are participants in the U.S.-East Asia Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience Working Group (also known as “Fab 4”), a U.S.-led semiconductor alliance that also includes Taiwan and South Korea. Fab 4, which held its first meeting in February 2023, is focusing on how to strengthen the chip supply chain. More broadly, Japan and the United States are also working closely on digital trade issues in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge confronting Japan in chipmaking is stark. Japan’s most advanced fabs operate with 40-nanometer (nm) design rules, about 10 years behind world leaders TSMC and Samsung. Japan’s dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) producers, which dominated global markets in the 1980s, have largely exited the business, and the country’s most advanced DRAMs are now made in facilities owned and operated by a U.S. firm, Micron Technology. Japan remains internationally competitive in certain semiconductor device types — such as NAND memory, power semiconductors, microcontrollers, and CMOS image sensors — but as the Japanese government recently acknowledged, the current chip promotion effort may well represent the “last chance” for the country to stake out a strong position in the global chip marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-emerging-semiconductor-strategy&quot;&gt;Japan’s Emerging Semiconductor Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2021, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) announced a core strategy for the nation’s semiconductor and digital industries with these elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formation of a partnership with the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; This enables the design and production of next-generation chips (2 nm and below design rules) by the late 2020s, an objective that is being pursued through the formation of Rapidus, a consortium of Japanese firms in collaboration with IBM and the European research organization IMEC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of “game-changing” future semiconductor technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; For this purpose, Japan is establishing the LSTC, a government-supported R&amp;amp;D center for advanced chip research. The idea for the LSTC reportedly arose out of the U.S.-Japan discussions that led to the adoption of the Basic Principles. IBM will support the establishment and work of the LSTC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of new chip manufacturing bases to make legacy devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Pursuant to this goal, the government has encouraged the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan’s TSMC, to form a joint venture with Japanese firms Sony and Denso (a maker of auto parts): Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is building a wafer fabrication plant in Kumamoto Prefecture. A second TSMC fab is reportedly under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsidies for domestic chip manufacturing.&lt;/strong&gt; The Japanese government has indicated that it will subsidize up to one-third of the capital costs incurred by domestic and foreign manufacturers to produce designated types of semiconductor devices (including power devices, microcontrollers, and analog devices), equipment, materials, and raw materials. The subsidies are conditioned on a minimum of 10 years of domestic production, and they will require manufacturers to prioritize domestic shipments at times of global shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s emphasis on international collaborations represents a major shift for the country, which previously had pursued a policy of achieving self-sufficiency in semiconductors until at least the 1990s. This parallels the United States’ current recognition that regaining leadership in chips is impossible without key foreign partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan remains internationally competitive in certain semiconductor device types . . . but as the Japanese government recently acknowledged, the current chip promotion effort may well represent the “last chance” for the country to stake out a strong position in the global chip marketplace.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launch-of-rapidus&quot;&gt;Launch of Rapidus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. partnership prong of METI’s strategy was launched in August 2022 with the formation of Rapidus, a consortium of Japanese companies working in partnership with IBM Research to develop IBM’s 2 nm semiconductor technology for manufacture in one or more fabs to be built in Japan. The first fab, to be constructed in Hokkaido, has a target start-up timeframe of 2026–2027. Rapidus had previously entered into a partnership with Belgium-based IMEC, the foremost microelectronics research organization in Europe, which works with nearly all of the world’s major semiconductor device, equipment, and materials firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidus was formed by veteran Japanese semiconductor executives — most notably its president, Koike Atsuyoshi (who recently headed memory maker Western Digital Japan) and its chairman, Higashi Tetsuro (former CEO of chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron). The shares are held by 12 Japanese semiconductor experts. The consortium members are Japanese high-tech and financial firms including Toyota, Sony, NTT, NEC, Kioxia (Toshiba), Softbank, Denso, and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. Significantly, many of the consortium partners are large consumers of chips; they are expected to constitute an initial market for the output of the consortium. Rapidus is receiving substantial financial support from the government of Japan, reportedly an initial amount of 70 billion yen (about $530 million), most of which will be used to buy two extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines from ASML of the Netherlands. In late April 2023, the government announced it would provide an additional 260 billion yen ($1.94 billion) to Rapidus “to bolster the company’s research and development operations.” Rapidus is expected to require about 5 trillion yen ($35.1 billion) in investments to begin mass production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has also encouraged the formation of Rapidus and the collaboration of IBM with the new entity. Nevertheless, bilateral tensions exist. In March 2023, Orii Yasumitsu, a senior executive at Rapidus, criticized U.S. government export controls on semiconductors as “too aggressive,” the first time a senior executive in the Japanese semiconductor industry has “publicly expressed a negative stance on the US Chips Act.” Orii further said, “U.S. regulations weakened Japan’s semiconductor industry in the past. But now the United States is trying to take back global semiconductor supremacy via regulations again. Korea and Japan must work together to respond to the U.S. moves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lstc-the-leading-edge-semiconductor-technology-center&quot;&gt;LSTC: The Leading-Edge Semiconductor Technology Center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new developmental effort in semiconductors features close collaboration between industry, government, and academia. Thus, the Rapidus effort will be supported by the LSTC, established in December 2022 as an umbrella organization to coordinate Japan’s semiconductor research. The research themes being pursued by the LSTC closely align with the Rapidus workplan. The LSTC will be supported by some of Japan’s existing public research organizations: the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Riken (a large scientific research institute largely funded by the government), and the University of Tokyo. The LSTC will be open to researchers from “like-minded” countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LSTC will pursue a number of key themes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing leading-edge semiconductor circuit design technology&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing leading-edge technology for gate-all-around (GAA) field effect transistors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing mass production technology enabling fast turn-around-time (TAT) between chip design and manufacture&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing 3D packaging technology&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing materials for GAA construction and advanced packaging&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LSTC plans to select several dozen students and researchers per year from top Japanese universities for specialized training. Classes will be taught by experts in semiconductor manufacturing and telecommunications technology. Hokkaido, where the Rapidus pilot plant will be located, is to run its own training program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aggressive-technological-goals&quot;&gt;Aggressive Technological Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rapidus-IBM-IMEC collaboration is arguably one of the most ambitious in the history of the global semiconductor industry. As noted, Japan is currently 10 years behind world leaders TSMC and Samsung in chip manufacturing technology, operating at the 40 nm node. The consortium proposes to leapfrog multiple intervening nodes in two to three years, to begin production at 2 nm. This would constitute an unparalleled technological feat. Skipping even one node places major demands on a company, such as increased and more complex design rule checking, additional computation requirements, significantly increased node-over-node IP designer staffing requirements, and numerous evolving techniques that are challenging to implement — all under increased time and cost pressures and while navigating the risk of unanticipated technological unknowns. One analyst writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Think long and hard about skipping nodes . . . There is so much progressive learning node over node now, and the need for this learning does not go away with a node jump. You’ll just end up compressing that learning into the critical path of your next design, while management still expects you to complete that design with the same or shorter schedule as the last one. This can only end in tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavor from companies with the requisite experience (i.e., TSMC and Samsung). The key to success may be IBM’s technology, which utilizes GAA transistors or “nanosheet FETs,” which enable device scaling beyond current generation FinFET technology (a form of 3D transistor that allows faster switching times and higher density than planar devices). Multiple nanosheet FETs can be stacked up from the silicon substrate, and they are seen as superior to FinFETs because of their GAA character, reduced size, and higher drive currents. According to one source, “This may be the most disruptive transistor design since the beginning of the integrated circuit.” IBM has also recently announced a breakthrough in interconnect (the wiring between components in a semiconductor) technology, replacing copper as an interconnect material with ruthenium (“Interconnect 3.0”) — which can scale to one nanometer and beyond and still be an effective conductor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Rapidus-IBM-IMEC collaboration is arguably one of the most ambitious in the history of the global semiconductor industry. . . . The consortium proposes to leapfrog multiple intervening nodes in two to three years, to begin production at 2 nm. This would constitute an unparalleled technological feat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-chip-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Japan’s Chip Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers and industry leaders are reportedly coming to view Japan as an alternative chip production hub to China, notwithstanding its higher costs. To a significant degree, this perspective reflects Japan’s extraordinary competencies in the tools and materials necessary for the most advanced forms of chipmaking, with Japanese suppliers often representing best-in-the-world in their areas of specialization. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EUV lithography:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan produces much of that equipment that makes extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography use for chipmaking at the advanced nodes possible. Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TEL) has a near 100 percent share of the global market for in-line coaters/developers for EUV, the lithography technique Rapidus will utilize to fabricate 2 nm chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chip Stacking:&lt;/strong&gt; TEL is also working closely with IBM to enable the world’s first chip stacking operations on 300 mm wafers. TEL has a massive presence at Albany Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) in Albany, New York, sending hundreds of employees to the facility at which IBM conducts much of its applied chipmaking R&amp;amp;D. In March 2023, TEL announced that it would invest $167 million to build a new production facility in northeast Japan, “in anticipation of renewed demand from the semiconductor industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photomasks:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese firms JEOL and NuFlare hold a 91 percent share of the global market for mask-making for EUV lithography.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resist Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese firms TEL and SCREEN hold a 96 percent share of the global market for the equipment needed for resist processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-End Photoresist:&lt;/strong&gt; Four Japanese companies — Shin-Etsu Chemical, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, JSR, and Fujifilm Electronic Materials — account for 75 percent of global production of high-end photoresist for advanced chipmaking and hold a near monopoly on the photoresist needed to enable fabrication of devices with EUV lithography. A fifth Japanese company, Sumitomo Chemicals, has recently entered the market for the production of photoresist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wafer Crystal Machining:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese firms Accretech, Okimoto, Toyo, and Disco have a 95 percent share of the global market for equipment needed for wafer crystal machining. Japanese firms Rorze, Daifuku, and Muratech hold an 88 percent share of the global market for wafer handling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semiconductor Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan is the largest marker of semiconductor materials in the world — a status it has held for decades — holding over a 50 percent share of 14 of the most critical materials needed for chipmaking, including photomasks, photoresist, and silicon wafers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D Chip Packaging:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese semiconductor materials suppliers, including Nissan Chemical and Showa Denko, are making major new investments to develop and produce materials needed for 3D chip packaging. In 2024, Nissan Chemical will begin mass production of a temporary bonding adhesive used in 3D packaging to keep silicon wafers attached to glass substrates during polishing and stacking, while also allowing removal of the wafers without damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silicon Wafers:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese materials firms SUMCO and Shin-Etsu Chemical together hold a 60 percent share of the global market for silicon wafers, essential to chip fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rapidus-work-plan&quot;&gt;Rapidus Work Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to the Rapidus-IBM accord, Rapidus is licensing 2 nm technology from IBM; furthermore, as noted, the partners will collaborate at the Albany CNSE to bring 2 nm device technology to production level. At CNSE, IBM is making available an ASML EUV tool — including the requisite specialized air and water handling systems and beneath-the-floor infrastructure — to enable Rapidus engineers to build competency in EUV processes. Rapidus personnel can also benefit from the presence of a constellation of tool and materials firms at the Albany site, including Tokyo Electron, KLA, and Applied Materials. In approximately two years, the Japanese engineers working on 2 nm development at CNSE will return to Japan and set up a pilot line for test runs of 2 nm devices. Rapidus expects to take 2 nm chips to the market by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koike said in December 2022 that “it will take several trillions of yen” ($7–15 billion or more) to get pilot production up and running, although he did not indicate where such funds would come from. On April 26, 2023, the government indicated it would give Rapidus 260 billion yen ($1.8 billion) that would be used, in part, to fund the establishment of a pilot production plant at Chitose in Hokkaido. Construction of the plant will begin in September 2023 with a completion target in January 2025, a tight timeframe. Koike is also looking for comprehensive private investment and financing for additional investments in new fabrication plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidus will operate as a leading-edge foundry, but it does not seek to compete head-to-head with TSMC and Samsung in making commodity devices at high volumes. Instead, Rapidus will focus on specialized niche technologies that can command a price premium. It anticipates that its strength will be fast turnaround time at which it can deliver specialized devices to specific end users tailored to their needs. Initial production volume is forecast at a modest 50,000 wafers per month. While Rapidus has not disclosed information about its anticipated customer base, its own consortium members are likely to represent a major market for the new foundry’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the European side, Rapidus and IMEC have agreed to form a broad strategic partnership. With financial support by METI, Rapidus will become a core member of IMEC’s advanced nanoelectronics program, which receives substantial funding from both the regional Government of Flanders and the European Commission. The partners will focus on key enabling technologies — most notably EUV lithography, which is essential to the fabrication of semiconductors at the 2 nm node. IMEC also enjoys a very close relationship with ASML of the Netherlands, currently the world’s only supplier of EUV equipment. Rapidus has already secured a commitment for ASML EUV tools for its Hokkaido fab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate cooperation, Rapidus may send engineers to IMEC for training. IMEC is also reportedly prepared to establish an R&amp;amp;D team in Japan to develop long term R&amp;amp;D roadmaps. Further, IMEC and Rapidus expect to collaborate with Japan’s LSTC, a hub for advanced chip technology development being established by the Japanese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-support-for-us-investors&quot;&gt;Government Support for U.S. Investors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government’s new promotional effort in semiconductors involves financial support for other U.S.-Japan manufacturing collaborations in Japan. The government is providing 46.5 billion yen ($320 million) to the U.S. firm Micron Technology, which owns and operates production facilities in Japan, to manufacture DRAMs. Micron established a manufacturing presence in Japan in 2012, when it purchased the bankrupt Japanese DRAM maker Elpida Memories. Japanese government funding is reportedly being directed toward the expansion of a Micron fab in Hiroshima to make the company’s new high-capacity low-power 1-beta DRAM, the highest-density DRAM yet produced. U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emmanuel characterized the transaction as an example of how the two countries “are committed to strengthening semiconductor supply chains” and national security jointly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Japanese government indicated it would provide 92.9 billion yen ($680 million) to a joint venture between Japan’s Kioxia and the U.S. firm Western Digital to manufacture 3D flash memory devices at the joint venture’s production base in Mie Prefecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaboration-with-taiwan&quot;&gt;Collaboration with Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new 2 nm chipmaking alliance with IBM and IMEC is paralleled by partnerships with Taiwan’s TSMC to enable the production of legacy chips for use by Japanese industry, along with the development of advanced assembly, test, and packaging technology. TSMC’s presence in Japan is well-established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2019,&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC established the Japan Design Center in Osaka to develop and refine semiconductor process technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In March 2021,&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC launched the 3D IC R&amp;amp;D Center in Japan’s Tsukuba Science City, supporting research in advanced semiconductor packaging in collaboration with Japanese companies, public research organizations, and universities. The Japanese government is reportedly supporting this project with 19 billion yen ($150 million), about half of the project cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In November 2021,&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC announced that it would invest over $2 billion in a majority-owned joint venture with Japan’s Sony and Denso to create a semiconductor foundry in Japan’s Kumamoto Prefecture utilizing 12, 16, 20, and 28 nm process technology. The participation of Denso, a major Japanese maker of auto parts, reflects the fact that the Japanese automobile industry has been hamstrung by chip shortages since the onset of the pandemic. Construction began in April 2022 and production is expected to start in December 2024. According to the Nikkei, the Japanese government is subsidizing this effort with an extraordinary total of 476 billion yen ($3.5 billion), perhaps the largest subsidy by the Japanese government to a foreign manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of December 2022,&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reportedly setting up a facility near the new fab, from which it will source logic chips to be used to make CMOS image sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In February 2023,&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC disclosed that it planned to build a second fab in Kumamoto Prefecture — in partnership with Sony and Denso — with an investment of $7 billion, which will utilize 5 and 10 nm process and would start operations in or after 2025. Denso views the new fab’s 10 nm capability as essential to ensuring a stable supply of chips for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-focus-on-the-back-end&quot;&gt;A New Focus on the Back End&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s effort to shore up its chipmaking capabilities will include the “back end” of the production process — assembly, test, and in particular packaging, which is seen as playing a crucial role in the development of advanced chips. At present, most back-end operations, including packaging, are located elsewhere due to Japan’s emphasis on international collaborations in China and other countries in Asia. Some key elements of this back-end focus include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orii Yasumitsu, a senior managing executive officer at Rapidus,&lt;/strong&gt; said in December 2022 that “a lot of attention has been focused on the front-end [namely, wafer fabrication,] but we’ll work on the back-end processes as well. . . . We will build integrated front-end and back-end production lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyocera, a manufacturer of ceramics for semiconductor packaging,&lt;/strong&gt; recently announced that it would invest 62 billion yen ($470 million) to build its first new production facility in two decades, which will produce packaging materials for advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantest, a Japanese maker of chip testing equipment,&lt;/strong&gt; has entered into a technology alliance with Taiwan’s TSMC for the developing of testing equipment for high-density back-end applications, which will be implemented at TSMC’s 3D IC R&amp;amp;D Center in Tsukuba.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon, a leading Japanese maker of lithography equipment,&lt;/strong&gt; is introducing back-end lithography machines that are intended to establish high-density connections between devices to enable improved performance and energy efficiency in a single package.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulvac, a Japanese chip equipment maker,&lt;/strong&gt; is improving its equipment for removing microscopic debris, which is being created in greater quantities due to more complex packaging operations. Such impurities can impair chip performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sumitomo Bakelite, a chip materials supplier,&lt;/strong&gt; is developing specialized resin compatible with advanced back-end production processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new promotional effort in semiconductors represents a major departure from the policy characterized by industrial independence that continued at least until the 1990s. Today’s goal is to build a global supply chain in collaboration with the United States and Europe — one which is less vulnerable to shocks such as those which occurred during the pandemic and less dependent on an increasingly assertive China. Similar thinking is driving the semiconductor policies taking shape in the United States and the European Union, opening potentially rich avenues of cooperation. As a METI official put it in August 2022, “The era where the world is at peace and it doesn’t matter who supplies our semiconductors is over.” Japan’s new policies are an ambitious and potentially effective response to this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;

RUSI’s Jonathan Eyal spoke to Professor Gary Rawnsley, an expert on soft power at the University of Lincoln, about what these results mean for China’s global influence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Eyal (JE):&lt;/strong&gt; The Pew Research Center has been mapping for many years attitudes towards China and other countries, and the latest report that was published at the end of July indicates a fairly calamitous collapse in the reputation of China in many countries around the world. This collapse seems to be taking place across the board, across most continents, with very few exceptions. How would you interpret that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gary Rawnsley (GR):&lt;/strong&gt; I would begin by saying that the results of this survey are not surprising, and mirror previous polls conducted by Pew, Gallup, the BBC and other polling organisations. Public opinion about China, particularly in so-called Western countries, has never been particularly favourable, so it’s not surprising that such trends are continuing in those countries. I think what we are seeing is some dramatic decline in certain countries; India, for example, was a particularly interesting case. But again, I’m not seeing anything here that is particularly out of the ordinary or that is out of line with polls over the past 10 or 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also say that, if Chinese government officials are reading these polls – and I don’t know if they are – I doubt that they are particularly worried, because they are most concerned about public opinion within China. A lot of the soft power projection that China engages in is not so much for global influence, but for domestic consumption and enhancing the status and legitimacy of the Communist Party. If there are any discussions of these results in China, they will follow the official narratives – and given that Pew is a US organisation, they won’t want to take too much of what we say into account. In their view, the West does not understand China; this is a continuous narrative, and something I’ve been accused of myself many times while working and living in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the West believes China is a threat, China is favoured among those countries in which Beijing is investing heavily. So that’s why we’re seeing still some rather high favourable opinions, particularly in those African countries where Chinese investment is quite high through the Belt and Road Initiative. But even then, they’re not as high as they were. I think people are now becoming much more aware of the Belt and Road and are becoming more suspicious. And certainly, the fact that Italy decided to withdraw from the Belt and Road will be a huge blow, not only to the Chinese government but to narratives in China. They want to show that Chinese influence is spreading throughout Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; You say that the Chinese don’t pay much attention to their image, but they’ve spent a large amount of money on Confucius Institutes around the world and on a lot of publicity. And they have a lot of diplomats who keep on tweeting and engaging in all kinds of social media. That doesn’t indicate to me a country that doesn’t care about its image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think that it doesn’t care about its image, but it’s not a driving force in the way that it would be in a lot of Western countries. I don’t think they are too worried that an opinion poll by a US organisation ranks them low on a particular indicator in a particular country. They have their own public diplomacy, cultural diplomacy, soft power initiatives, and these will continue throughout the world. And of course, they are designed to reinforce the political agenda that President Xi Jinping is following around the Chinese Dream, around the rise of China and its growing status. I do think that these are important, but at the end of the day, the biggest audience for these narratives is within China and not outside. It’s demonstrating to the Chinese people that Beijing has a status and that it’s on the rise around the world. That’s more important to the Chinese government than what countries around the world think of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So would you say that a lot of this investment, like the Confucius Institutes – which try to highlight the achievements of Chinese culture and the Chinese language – is really much more an exercise in asserting that China has “arrived”, rather than in creating a favourable opinion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; I would think so, because Beijing is always under the impression that the West does not understand China. And Xi Jinping has certainly said that one of the objectives is to present a more accurate picture of China and to tell China’s story to the world. But at the same time, that is a very particular story, one which is not really resonating with many audiences around the world, as this opinion poll demonstrates. So when I look at these polls and I’m talking to my students about them, for example, I will say that despite China’s spending $10 billion a year on its influence programmes and on its soft power projection, it isn’t moving the needle in terms of public opinion. And that’s because at the end of the day, actions speak louder than words. People can perhaps see China in a favourable light when it comes to history, culture, TV or films, but when it comes to the hard reality of policy, people are seeing a very different picture of China. And that undermines all the other soft power initiatives that China may be pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the top leadership may not care a great deal about it or dismiss it as just a product of another Western propaganda activity. But the United Front Department – would they not be paying any attention to such figures? You have South Korea, for instance, where in the past only 30% had a bad opinion of China. Today it is 77%. And this is not Japan – this is South Korea, which of course historically had a very different attitude to China. Yet the collapse in China’s image is all too obvious. Do you think the United Front Department will be worried about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; They may be. Under Xi Jinping, the importance of the United Front doctrine has escalated, and the party organisation tasked with its oversight has welcomed a large increase in funding to carry out its work. Increasing awareness of such activities may affect public opinion in the target countries, but I would suggest this is less to do with concern about “image” or “narrative” and more to do with influence within societies abroad, and to monitor the activities and opinions of the Chinese diaspora. Public opinion is suspicious of the United Front because it is by its nature insidious, working through organisations who may or may not be compliant, and seeking to exert pressure on citizens and organisations overseas. This is designed to disrupt policy that may be against China’s interests, and to deepen China’s influence in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The decline in favourable opinion towards Beijing is based more on China’s behaviour and actions than on what it’s trying to do through any soft power initiative&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may call this “sharp power”, though I discount this term. I consider it a form of soft power – after all, soft power does not have to be benign – but perhaps simply “influence” is a more accurate term. Like much of China’s influence strategy, the United Front is intended mainly for nationals living within its borders – it has been a strategy followed by the Communist Party since its foundation in 1921 – but it is also designed for Taiwan (especially organisations considered more “blue” or nationalist/KMT) and for Hong Kong during its transition to more authoritarian rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I don’t think that the government is going to be concerned with how to influence public opinion or political elites. What is going to influence political elites more in these countries is trade, economics, the Chinese market and investment. And those will continue regardless of the trends in public opinion that we are seeing in these surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve seen the Chinese understand soft power because there was a period, if you remember, at the beginning of the Confucius Institute movement when even Xi Jinping was arguing that one of the objectives was to project soft power, to persuade countries to see things in China’s way. Do you think they understand what soft power can do? You’ve worked on soft power for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, yes, although I think even I sometimes don’t know what soft power really is – and there isn’t a consensus about that. I think the Chinese understand their own version of soft power, which is very different from the Anglo-American literature that we know through Joseph Nye and others who’ve been working on this. And they privilege culture. But my approach to soft power privileges political institutions, political values and behaviours, and this is where China falls down in terms of soft power, because actions speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that there are a number of reasons why these polls are presenting a slightly more dismal picture for China this year. Firstly, there is the increasing authoritarianism of Xi Jinping himself, the growing nationalism in China and the growing cult of personality around Xi. There have also been misgivings about the very strict way that China handled Covid. We saw that with the protests in Shanghai and other places, which is quite rare in China on the scale that we saw. And of course, there is still the idea that China was somehow responsible – that it was the originator of Covid. Whether that’s true or not, there is still that perception in some circles. Then there is the continuing worry about what’s happening in Xinjiang, concern about growing action against Taiwan as it gets ready for its presidential election next year, and growing suspicion about the surveillance state with what we saw in the US regarding TikTok and everything else. So there is a whole package of issues that are causing opinion to slide away from being favourable towards China, and these are based more on China’s behaviour and actions than on what it’s trying to do through any soft power initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; You mentioned the rise of Chinese trade as being one of Beijing’s key preoccupations. But don’t you think that these sorts of negative opinions – which incidentally, are not mirrored by the opinions that people have towards the US – have an impact on the readiness of people to buy Chinese consumer goods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think so. I think it would have more impact at the higher level than with consumers. In terms of trade policy, if there is a worry about governance, or about security and safety – and we’ve seen that with Chinese technologies, as I said, in relation to the surveillance state, TikTok and so on – then that may have an impact on the more macro level of trade and economics. But I don’t think it’s going to trickle down to the point where consumers on the streets are not purchasing equipment or goods that are made in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While soft power is important in creating certain images, perceptions and trust in governments, at the end of the day it is often be trumped by hard power and economics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything in this poll that will concern China, I think it is going to be that only around one third of countries now see China as the world’s leading economic power. And in the countries that make this claim – including Australia and several European countries – the numbers are falling. They’re saying, yes, China is the world’s number one economic power, but we don’t think that’s necessarily a good thing. So I think that for the economy, there’s a worry. It doesn’t matter whether this is good or bad for the surveyed country, but rather the position of China within the hierarchy of major powers. Xi Jinping has put a lot of stock on the recovery of China’s importance and status. This drives his domestic agenda, and I think it’s going to be very difficult to tell the Chinese people that fewer people in fewer countries now see China as the world’s number one economic superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; And don’t you think that that matters? I mean, wasn’t that one of the objectives of Chinese policy – to persuade countries that they are effectively a steamroller and whether you like it or not, they are destined to grow, so you might as well shut up and accept that narrative because your chances of succeeding otherwise are considerably reduced? This was the explanation for the “Golden Age” of relations in the UK, with our Chancellor at the time saying that whether you like it or not, this is how it’s going to be. So, if people no longer believe that China’s rise to a top position of power is inevitable, doesn’t it have consequences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, absolutely. And as I said, I think that takes place more at the macro level rather than the consumer level. So, governments, economic ministries, corporations and companies will be looking at these figures and making decisions about future trade with China. But at the end of the day, are they more worried about their profits and doing trade or are they more worried about the situation in Xinjiang? I’m going to be very cynical here and say that I think it will be the trade and economics that wins out. And all of this just tells me that while soft power is important in creating certain images, perceptions and trust in governments, at the end of the day, it can often be trumped by hard power and economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed. If we turn it around for a second, would you say that these increased negative perceptions of China would make it easier for a government like that of the US to build a coalition to contain China, based on a more general perception that the current Chinese government may represent a threat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; It may well do. I would be sceptical that the US could lead a coalition of concerned states regarding China though, because I think so many countries have their own policies, their own interests, their own perceptions of China. We saw this with Italy joining the Belt and Road Initiative and then deciding to pull out. I think it would be very difficult to reach a consensus that could build a coalition. There will always be groups of countries that express concern, and that will trickle down towards whether they engage and on what level. But I don’t see that it would be possible or even in everybody’s interest to build a coalition against China – all that will do is mobilise even further the nationalism within China. It will strengthen the hand of the nationalists and the Chinese government, and could actually lead to more destabilisation rather than stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting. So in sum, if you look at this episode and the conclusions that you’ve drawn, does it actually mean that the whole concept of soft power and its utility may be a bit overhyped? Because in a case where it is so critical, it seems to me – that of a rising power like China – you are suggesting that it has a minimal impact on China’s considerations and that the impact on our own policies towards China is probably less than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that is my conclusion, especially with regards to China. Every country has its own soft power strategies and ways that it understands soft power. In China, as I said at the beginning, I think that the main audience for a lot of these initiatives is the Chinese audience itself. At the end of the day, it is other considerations that will decide whether countries engage with China and on what level. And I think that will include how China behaves as an international actor, what it does at home, and the kinds of friends that it keeps. If you look at the current situation, it hasn’t really made much movement in terms of Ukraine and Russia. And I think these are the kinds of things that are more important to people around the world than spreading Chinese culture or the Chinese language through Confucius Institutes. Culture plays a part in familiarising people and getting them interested in a country, but it’s very difficult to move political opinion and policy through culture. If the bottom line is that the West does not understand China, then it’s very, very difficult to see how far they can go in changing that through the kind of initiatives that China has been engaging in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; I know I said that was the last question, but I will put another one before we finish, just a tiny one. If you as a Brit knew that your country was mistrusted by large amounts of people, it would probably affect you on a personal level as well. It is a question of pride and your view of your own country. Don’t you think anything similar to that is felt by the average member of the Chinese public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GR:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve just returned from living for four years in China. And as I said, the information and narratives are controlled to such an extent that if this opinion poll and its results become known within China, there will be a narrative that is communicated around it, which is basically, don’t believe it – that it is all part of a political agenda against China. And this could actually heighten the nationalist spirit within China because it shows, again, the West having what China considers a distorted or deliberately hostile view of China, that the West wishes to interfere in China and so on. So I think that actually it might have the opposite effect on many Chinese people because of the kind of narratives that the Chinese government engages in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s BRICS summit in Johannesburg – bringing together Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa for the first in-person gathering since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic – has seen the usual denunciations of the US and the liberal order which have characterised most of the organisation’s previous gatherings. Russian President Vladimir Putin, attending virtually as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes, was quick to blame Western countries for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, stating that “it was the desire to maintain their hegemony in the world, the desire of some countries to maintain this hegemony that led to the severe crisis in Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging the US and “the West” has been par for the course for BRICS gatherings in recent years. Originally conceived by Goldman Sachs as a way to capture the economic rise of a diverse group of countries (the BRICS together represent about 40% of the world’s population and a quarter of global GDP), the BRIC acquired a geopolitical significance when Russia took the initiative to convene the four initial member countries in 2009, with South Africa joining in 2011 (adding the S in BRICS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fanfare around its creation, the BRICS has often seemed more to be muddling along than mounting a systemic challenge to the Western-led international order. While China’s meteoric rise has underpinned the BRICS’s growing share of the world economy, the countries in the group have experienced wide disparities in economic performance. At times, there have also been significant tensions between its members, notably in 2020–21 when China and India were involved in fierce border skirmishes. Amid numerous declarations over the past decade and a half, the bloc’s only tangible accomplishment has been the launching of an international development finance arm, headquartered in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s annual summit produced much of the rhetoric that has led many observers to accuse the BRICS of being merely a talking shop, but the meeting also highlighted how Russia’s war against Ukraine and the growing confrontation between the US and China are injecting a new political impulse into the organisation. Rising geopolitical tensions have brought to the fore the question of how the rest of the world – notably the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America – is aligning with existing and emerging world powers. The BRICS countries, prompted by China and Russia, are now looking to seize this moment to expand the grouping of non-Western states and to fashion it as an alternative to the US-led political and economic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenging-the-mighty-dollar&quot;&gt;Challenging the Mighty Dollar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the increased competition for influence and access in the “Global South”, ahead of the summit there was talk of promoting global “de-dollarisation”, and earlier this year Brazil even floated the idea of a BRICS currency. Dethroning the dollar’s dominance is seen as a key element of building a new global economic order, not least since a number of BRICS countries have been vulnerable to Western economic sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Expansion is viewed in Beijing and Moscow as necessary in order to give the grouping a harder geopolitical edge and to challenge what they characterise as the US-led, unipolar world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such ideas currently appear overly ambitious and were not formally on the summit agenda, the BRICS group nevertheless reaffirmed its commitment to expand options for using local currencies for trade between bloc members. Since launching its war against Ukraine, Russia has shifted much of its trade to the renminbi, which now accounts for 16% of its export payments. The BRICS bank recently issued its first rand bond in South Africa, and it is planning to issue its first Indian rupee bond by October. President Lula da Silva of Brazil recently asked: “Why does Brazil need the dollar to trade with China or Argentina? We can trade in our currency”, and he has suggested that the BRICS bank is a more just economic institution than US-led institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-the-pluriverse&quot;&gt;The Rise of the Pluriverse?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Johannesburg summit will provide further momentum to economic coordination among the BRICS, headlines before and after the summit were dominated by efforts led by China and Russia to promote expansion of the bloc’s membership. This is viewed in Beijing and Moscow as necessary in order to give the grouping a harder geopolitical edge, as a means to challenge what they characterise as the US-led, unipolar world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, an expanding BRICS would present a vehicle for its more “inclusive” worldview, and building up the organisation is viewed as providing a counterweight to the G7 and G20. The Johannesburg summit has been presented by the Chinese state media as building a “pluriversal” world – “a world that is more multipolar, more inclusive, just, equitable, a world that respects the potential and contributions of all countries to human progress”. This suggests that China may be complementing its approach of trying to outcompete the US within existing international institutions by forging something new and more Sino-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, the summit host, supports expansion and invited representatives of dozens of other countries to attend the Johannesburg meeting. Speaking ahead of the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared: “An expanded BRICS will represent a diverse group of nations with different political systems that share a common desire to have a more balanced global order”. Concluding the summit, Ramaphosa announced that in a first wave of expansion, six countries had been invited to join the bloc as full members from 1 January 2024: Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement marked an important victory for China and Russia since India and Brazil had previously expressed caution over expanding the bloc. India is wary of China’s potential dominance and of adopting measures that give Beijing a larger international platform for pursuing its ambitions. Brazil is keen to ensure that its influence is not diluted and that it does not find itself being forced to choose sides in the struggle between the US and China and Russia. Ultimately, both were persuaded to support the expansion policy by the inclusion of their “strategic partners” – Argentina for Brazil and the countries of the Gulf for India – in the list of countries invited to join, and an agreement that future expansion would be based on consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking following the conclusion of the summit, China’s President Xi Jinping stated that “This membership expansion is historic”, while Putin observed that “The adoption of the guiding principles in the expansion of BRICS will ensure that the role and importance of BRICS in the world will continue to grow”. Putin announced that the next summit would be hosted by Russia in Kazan, and that he would promote a broadening of the grouping’s agenda to include transport, healthcare, science, and cultural issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While expansion will further the BRICS’ diversity, it will also import more bilateral tensions into the grouping, such as the difficult relationship between Iran and the Gulf states&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision on expansion and further progress on advancing the role of the members’ currencies were significant steps forward for the BRICS countries. Expansion is being presented as a major geopolitical step forward, bringing in key countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. For Russia and China, the inclusion of the fiercely anti-Western Iran is seen as a major victory in their efforts to forge a more coherent anti-West grouping to rival the US-led alliance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolution-rather-than-revolution-in-johannesburg&quot;&gt;Evolution Rather than Revolution in Johannesburg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has brought into stark relief the competition for influence and support around the world, and there is strong interest among the BRICS countries in positioning themselves as the champions of “the Global South”. The opportunity to join the BRICS will be viewed positively by many states, especially given the access it will provide to China and to major emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of intensifying competition, there is also a desire in many countries to use new opportunities in the international system, such as the BRICS, to hedge against the West and enhance their bargaining power. South Africa said that more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS and 22 have formally requested to be admitted. The upbeat assessment of the expansion of the grouping and its broadening ambitions clouds, however, the major challenges that this agenda will bring to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as a group of five states, the BRICS represents a diverse set of countries more united by what they don’t like – not being able to sit at the international top table – than by a coherent view of their position in the global order or what an alternative global order should look like. The BRICS began as a grouping to limit the “unipolar” moment of US pre-eminence and to promote multipolarity, and there is little appetite in Delhi and Brasilia to transform the organisation into a vehicle of bipolar confrontation with the West. While expansion will further the BRICS’ diversity, it will also import more bilateral tensions into the grouping, such as the difficult relationship between Iran and the Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the BRICS has provided a useful platform for emerging states to rail against the injustice of a world order that they felt did not properly include their interests and voices. Expansion is attractive as it will bring in more countries that feel short-changed or excluded by the existing order and strengthen the BRICS as a non-aligned forum. But China and Russia – and now Iran – have bigger ambitions to transform the grouping into a bloc as part of a counter-West project. This will involve moving beyond rhetoric and creating an organisation that can actually deliver an alternative order, tackle major economic problems of development in just ways, and create consensus among states that have deep-seated bilateral disputes with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tall order, and the reality is that while many countries will welcome being part of a grouping that offers an alternative to US-led institutions, few are keen to join an anti-Western geopolitical bloc led by Russia and China. The Johannesburg summit is likely to be remembered as an important moment that reinforced trends toward multipolarity and increased pressure to reform the existing international order’s key institutions. Further expansion of the BRICS is likely to strengthen these trends, but the BRICS still looks far away from becoming the nucleus of a counter-West political movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in digital assets’ popularity over the last decade has attracted its fair share of illicit actors. Prized for their ease of use and perceived relative anonymity, digital assets such as Bitcoin have become targets for sanctions evaders, criminal enterprises, narcotraffickers and terrorist networks. North Korea, for example, has stolen billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency in the past five years, in part to fund its WMD programme. Consequently, regulatory, monitoring and enforcement agencies have had to set their sights on addressing the often overlooked space between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Despite modest progress addressing key vulnerabilities that cryptocurrency creates for global finance, the dynamic and rapidly changing nature of digital assets requires new thought about risk and sources of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One increasingly difficult problem for regulatory and monitoring authorities is how to address and mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrency mining (the processes used to verify transactions). Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, mining typically falls outside the scope of anti-money-laundering (AML) regulatory authorities and can provide illicit actors with a stream of nearly anonymous – and possibly unlimited – revenue. Unfortunately, discussions on how to best mitigate these risks is largely absent from broader policy discussions on regulating and monitoring digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, intended for policymakers and those with compliance obligations, seeks to broaden the discussions of risk around cryptocurrency by providing a typology of risks related to cryptocurrency mining. The objective is not to provide an all-encompassing snapshot of cryptocurrency mining activities, but to offer a general framework for policymakers to consider and mitigate a range of risks that may not be immediately apparent. The paper also places the described typologies within the context of recent or emerging regulatory and enforcement actions, to highlight gaps and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper concludes with a series of recommendations aimed at mitigating risks and addressing regulatory and monitoring shortfalls in relation to cryptocurrency mining, consistent with global AML standards. These include, for example, modifying registration requirements for commercial and remote mining enterprises so that they fall under the purview of regulatory frameworks, despite outstanding questions over custody of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is abundantly clear that illicit actors have focused in on the usefulness of cryptocurrency, and it is quite likely that cryptocurrency will feature in financial crime for decades to come. Given the uniqueness, novelty and rapidly evolving nature of the digital assets industry, however, it is critically important that policymakers continue to think outside the box, re-examine previously held assumptions about the nature of risks associated with cryptocurrency – including mining – and continuously adapt regulatory and monitoring frameworks in response to emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once considered a fringe, novel technology, virtual assets – that is, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin – now have a global market capitalisation of more than $1 trillion. The sheer scale and scope of the cryptocurrency industry, paired with regulation and monitoring challenges, have created, over the past decade, opportunities for illicit state and non-state actors to facilitate financial crimes, including sanctions evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, among others, using cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international organisation responsible for setting anti-money-laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-finance (CTF) standards, set about addressing threats posed by digital assets to the international financial system. However, despite the introduction of several new requirements, including a requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to be “regulated for (anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism) AML/CTF purposes, and licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring … or supervision”, key vulnerabilities and gaps remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these gaps is cryptocurrency mining, which is generally not covered by AML rules and regulations. Mining cryptocurrency is the process by which users verify the accuracy of transactions on a blockchain and are subsequently rewarded for their efforts with newly minted cryptocurrency. Due to the fundamental design of this decentralised process, little in the way of information is available to national authorities on who has “mined” cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is very little in the way of transparency on miners, mining has attracted illicit actors ranging from narcotics traffickers to sanctions evaders such as North Korea. In 2019, for example, a report by the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea found that the country engaged in mining cryptocurrencies to generate revenue for its military programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper offers jurisdictions a typology of laundering through cryptocurrency mining. The objective is to increase overall awareness of money-laundering and proliferation-finance risks posed by mining, as well as guidance on how to best address these threats from a legal and regulatory perspective. Although this paper is not meant to be comprehensive, it aims to expand on these identified threats so that jurisdictions can detect vulnerabilities in their financial systems and form risk mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines general financial crime risks associated with cryptocurrency mining that have occurred since Bitcoin’s start. Next, it presents a typology of cryptocurrency mining risks, designed to illustrate how illicit actors can take advantage of existing and emerging mining to facilitate money laundering and proliferation financing. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the legal and regulatory challenges to responding to mining risks, and their implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mining has attracted illicit actors ranging from narcotics traffickers to sanctions evaders&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typologies outlined in this paper are based on a series of semi-structured interviews with public and private stakeholders, including representatives of VASPs, blockchain analytics companies, compliance specialists and academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interviews, along with a review of relevant news articles, guidance released by international organisations and other law enforcement and regulatory actions, have helped to inform case studies and risk mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-cryptocurrency-mining-risks&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING RISKS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FATF defines virtual assets as “a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes”. Bitcoin, for example, one of the most recognised and earliest virtual assets, was first conceptualised in 2008 as a decentralised currency – that is, free of a central monetary authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decentralised digital currency, however, faces a significant hurdle: without a central authority, how can users be assured that the record of transactions is complete and accurate? To solve this problem, Bitcoin and other similar types of cryptocurrencies use a “proof-of-work” model to validate and record transactions on a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blockchain, or ledger, consists of blocks of transactions linked together. In a proof-of-work model, a user, referred to as a cryptocurrency miner, employs computer processing power (or “work”) to solve a computationally complex mathematical problem that effectively ensures transactions are accurate and in the correct order – that is, that each new block is linked to the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work, however, is not free. To incentivise users to keep the ledger accurate, miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin). Miners compete against other miners to be the first to solve the complex problem and the first miner to do so is permitted to record the next block of transactions. Figure 1 illustrates how new blocks of transactions are added to a given blockchain that uses a “proof-of-work” model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oxR5fQ4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, mining increases the overall supply of cryptocurrency. Minting new cryptocurrency through mining, however, creates several pernicious problems from a financial crime perspective. Namely, newly minted cryptocurrency is not easily linked to an individual. Because of this, mining cryptocurrency is an attractive target for enterprising criminal organisations, sanctions evaders and those looking to avoid law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, for example, an investigation by Brazil’s Department of Narcotics uncovered a cryptocurrency mining operation as part of a drug enforcement investigation, shining a light on how criminal organisations are adapting to digital currencies. Similarly, in Argentina, there have been reports of crime associated with illicitly obtaining cryptocurrency mining equipment, either to launder funds or to make money from reselling the equipment at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s brazen cyber attacks against cryptocurrency businesses and applications, which have netted the country billions of dollars in cryptocurrency, are now well known. According to a 2019 UN report, North Korea has also been involved in mining cryptocurrency since at least May 2017. In February 2020, a cyber-security firm found that North Korea’s mining activity had increased at least tenfold since May 2019, based on an analysis of a North Korea-linked IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While converting stolen cryptocurrency to fiat currency requires a multi-step laundering process that runs the risk of detection, mining, on the other hand, has the potential to generate a nearly anonymous revenue stream. The ability to generate practically decoupled revenue is an enticing lure to illicit activity. Indeed, as illustrated in the next section, there has been a significant increase in the scale and scope of illicit activity targeting the cryptocurrency mining process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining industry, however, is not static. Much like virtual currency, mining encompasses rapidly changing and dynamic technologies. To better understand how illicit actors can exploit mining, the next section provides a series of typologies and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-cryptocurrency-mining-typologies&quot;&gt;KEY CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING TYPOLOGIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes a range of available cryptocurrency mining typologies, which includes cryptojacking and remote mining. These methods pose a challenge to law enforcement and regulatory authorities because they involve an individual receiving newly minted cryptocurrency that is not tied to previous transactions, thus making user identification more difficult. Such coins can then be converted to fiat currency without detection of a criminal link on the blockchain. The fourth typology in this section focuses on cryptocurrencies that use a “proof-of-stake” transaction verification model. Although this model does not provide a viable laundering mechanism, it is a method that illicit actors can use to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-1-cryptojacking&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 1: CRYPTOJACKING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the steep costs of specialised equipment, or sometimes a lack of access to stable internet or power grids, criminals have turned to cryptojacking – the process of hijacking another user’s computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, for example, a researcher used supercomputers funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF – an independent federal government agency) to mine Bitcoin, resulting in his suspension from working with the US government. According to an audit report, “the researcher misused over $150,000 in NSF-supported computer usage at two universities to generate Bitcoins valued between $8,000 and $10,000”. Later, from 2017 to 2021, this illicit revenue generation method grew in popularity as demand and price for cryptocurrency increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browser-based cryptojacking, or “drive-by mining”, likewise grew in popularity. The process involves embedding malicious code in a website, which allows the website owner to use visitors’ computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency. While there are legitimate reasons a website owner may include web-based mining on a website – such as generating revenue for a charity – criminal enterprises, extremists or even sanctions evaders can exploit the same method to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, for example, a neo-Nazi militant group known as the Order of Dawn allowed supporters to mine Monero to generate revenue for its volunteer army. The group’s website is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dnh7zwk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Order of Dawn and Cryptocurrency Mining.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counterextremism.com/blog/far-right-european-terrorist-group-crowdfunding-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Counter Extremism Project, “Far-Right European Terrorist Group Crowdfunding Cryptocurrency”, 28 April 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptojacking can also occur on a larger scale by rerouting unwitting users’ computer processing power to a mining “pool”, which functions as an aggregator for computer processing power. This method has the potential to create a nearly anonymous revenue stream for an illicit actor. Alternatively, it is also possible to target and hijack resources from cryptocurrency mining pools. In 2014, a hacker gained access to a Canadian internet provider and rerouted traffic from a legitimate pool to a malicious pool, which netted nearly US$84,000 worth of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptojacking has similarly caught the attention of North Korea. One of the first reported cases of North Korea-linked criminal activity associated with cryptojacking occurred in 2017, when cyber-criminals hacked a South Korean company’s server to illicitly mine Monero. North Korea was able to mine nearly 70 Monero coins, worth approximately $25,000 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is also alleged to have employed malware to infect computers to mine Monero. According to a 2019 UN report, analysts were able to trace the mined Monero back to servers located at Kim Il Sung University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-2-commercial-mining-facilities&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 2: COMMERCIAL MINING FACILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale mining operations have become a lucrative business in recent years, and although the exact number of commercial mining facilities worldwide is unknown, the scale and scope of the industry can be estimated by the demand that such facilities place on power grids. A 2022 report by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, which coordinates interagency science and technology policy efforts, found that commercial mining facilities are on the rise, estimating that the “total global estimated electricity usage for blockchains that support crypto-assets in 2022 falls into a range of 120 to 240 billion kWh per year”. While such estimates can fluctuate considerably according to demand within cryptocurrency markets, this nonetheless highlights the sheer magnitude of such operations, which at times has accounted for nearly 1% of global energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining facilities also have the capability to provide illicit actors with a substantial and relatively anonymous revenue stream. Mined cryptocurrency can be moved across jurisdictions through peer-to-peer transactions and potentially converted to fiat currency at cryptocurrency businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital costs of such ventures can, however, be high. Specialised equipment, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), can cost anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands of US dollars. In at least one case, illicit actors have used the crypto-mining process to launder other ill-gotten gains, as shown in the following case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-case-study-bitcoin-mining-centres-and-crime&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Case Study: Bitcoin Mining Centres and Crime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2016, Spanish police and tax authorities arrested 30 individuals suspected of laundering illicit proceeds via Bitcoin mining centres. The authorities seized Bitcoin mining centres that they suspected were being used by a large criminal network to launder funds. The amount of funds laundered through the operation is unknown.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/article/on-the-periphery-financial-crime-risks-in-cryptocurrency-mining/&quot;&gt;Dev Odedra and Chris Gschwend, “On the Periphery: Financial Crime Risks in Cryptocurrency Mining”, KYC360, 13 July 2020&lt;/a&gt;; Reuters, “Spain Arrests 30 Suspected of Laundering Money in Bitcoin Centres”, 25 May 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State actors have also focused on large-scale mining facilities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 provides a notional summary of how criminal networks could feasibly invest in mining equipment that can ultimately provide revenue that is decoupled from any illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZTAKq9J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Mining as a Laundry Service.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: A criminal uses illicit funds to purchase or rent a mining “rig”. In return, they receive clean cryptocurrency and can transfer funds across jurisdictions or convert them to fiat currency at exchanges with limited detection. By contrast, on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, the criminal in question would still face the need to surpass controls during the customer onboarding procedure. Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to criminal networks, state actors have also focused on large-scale mining facilities, requesting that the proceeds be sold to a central bank. Iran, for example, used this technique to generate revenue while under sanctions, according to several blockchain analytics firms. Furthermore, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization has said that the country’s central bank had made a proposal for how Iran can “use the cryptocurrencies produced internally or cryptocurrencies purchased by companies such as the private sector” for the import of goods. Similarly, although the full extent of North Korea’s mining operations is unknown, its 2020 efforts to mine Monero demonstrate, at a minimum, an interest in conducting mining operations on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are several elements necessary for a successful commercial operation and, therefore, the extent of this financial crime risk will vary among jurisdictions. First and foremost is whether there is access to stable and cheap power. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, mining farm operators generally choose locations with lower electricity costs to optimise profit. In addition to cheap power, commercial facilities also require stable access to the internet that can accommodate transferring data at high speeds. Climate can also play a role. Mining is preferred in regions with low temperatures, which can help operators avoid substantial cooling costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demand for cryptocurrency has increased, many states have considered and enacted policies to attract the crypto-mining industry. One such example is Transnistria, an unrecognised republic situated between Ukraine and Moldova. The unrecognised breakaway state adopted legislation in 2018 to legalise cryptocurrency mining and created incentives to attract parts of the industry. In addition to offering cheap, stable energy, Transnistria also allows entrepreneurs to set up a mining facility without needing to register as a local company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-3-remote-mining&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 3: REMOTE MINING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising costs of specialised mining equipment, as well as the need for cheap power and stable internet infrastructure, have prompted the formation of businesses that host mining equipment on behalf of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote mining presents a particularly thorny problem when it comes to combating financial crime. Operators of remote mining services may be unaware of their client’s identity or whether they are acting on behalf of a third party, as they are often located in different jurisdictions. This could mean that a remote mining service could unwittingly facilitate sanctions evasion or other types of illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host mining facilities, for example, allow remote customers to purchase mining rigs hosted on their property. The overhead costs for a hosting service typically comprise electricity and maintenance costs, including the setup of the mining equipment. Once the rig is operating, all earnings are directly transferred to the wallet that the customer has listed – whether their own or a third party’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One host mining facility, Bitriver, fell onto the US sanctions list in 2022. BitRiver and its subsidiaries were alleged to have aided Russia in monetising its natural resources by leveraging the country’s cheap energy to mine cryptocurrency. Prior to unilateral sanctions, BitRiver created a cryptocurrency known as the BTR Token. Holders of the coin receive an equivalent amount of electricity power for their hosted mining equipment and can submit tokens once a month to pay up to 10% of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, host mining facilities typically allow a portion of the electricity costs to be paid in cryptocurrency, which could provide avenues for criminal organisations and sanctions evaders to launder the proceeds of crime. It would be quite feasible for a representative operating on behalf of a sanctioned country to pay for electricity costs with illicit funds, and in return receive mined cryptocurrency decoupled from any criminal link. Notably, if traceable cryptocurrency is used to pay for a portion of the mining fees, investigators can still track the funds to the business that accepted the illicit funds. However, the facility may be based in a jurisdiction that is not cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commercial mining facilities also offer cloud-based mining services, whereby users can lease equipment and computer time. Some of the primary cloud-based mining services allow payment in cryptocurrency and for the receiving cryptocurrency address to be changed after purchase. The benefit of using such services is that it can help reduce long-term costs, including investments in expensive equipment, as well as provide a solution to those in jurisdictions with geographic, energy, legal or other limitations on mining. Like host mining, the user does not need to be physically located in the jurisdiction to reap the rewards of mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If information is needed, it is likely that the cloud-based mining service would keep a database of cryptocurrency addresses used by the customer. However, depending on whether the service obtains custody of the funds, it can be unclear to investigators where the funds then move to, when looking at on-chain activity. This form of laundering is outlined in the following case study of a North Korea-linked cyber group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-case-study-north-korea-and-cloud-mining-services&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Case Study: North Korea and Cloud Mining Services&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In March 2023, Mandiant, a US cyber security firm, released a report on the cryptocurrency laundering methods of APT43, a North Korea-linked cyber group. According to Mandiant, APT43 likely uses hash rental (the rental of a set amount of computing power to mine cryptocurrency) and cloud-based mining services as a method of laundering funds. The process of laundering via hash rental and cloud-based mining services allows for the buyer’s original payments and the mined cryptocurrency to be decoupled.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The user does not need to be in the jurisdiction to reap the rewards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cloud mining model involves peer-to-peer marketplaces that allow payments in cryptocurrency. For these services, the buyer can mine using the seller’s computer processing power. Of course, this can also create problems – especially from a transparency perspective. Operators of cloud mining services such as these generally have, for example, no insights into their users’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-4-proof-of-stake-model&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 4: PROOF-OF-STAKE MODEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a proof-of-work model requires miners to solve computationally complex problems to verify the accuracy of a blockchain and record new transactions, the proof-of-stake model requires validators to “stake” their own cryptocurrency as collateral to verify transactions. To confirm a transaction, the blockchain network randomly selects a validator based on the number of coins the user has staked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jtDBZWU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Proof-of-Stake Model.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: An individual stakes their own funds and, when chosen, will verify transactions on the blockchain. Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, proof-of-stake mining is less energy- and resource-intensive than a proof-of-work model. For these reasons, it may be more attractive to illicit actors. North Korea, for example, has a large stock of cryptocurrency from its various hacks over the past five years that the country could feasibly stake – effectively allowing it to “earn interest” on its illicit hacking operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Ethereum, a blockchain-enabled platform that allows smart contracts, shifted its economic model from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake to reduce environmental impact. For many illicit actors, this move could prove a boost to revenue generation. A recent report by Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs noted that while North Korea has not previously mined Ether, the shift to a proof-of-stake model may prove more attractive for revenue generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staking coins, along with cryptojacking, commercial mining facilities and remote mining, represent avenues for criminals to circumvent regulations or take advantage of a lack of oversight. Despite the difficulty of identifying users behind the transaction verification process, the public and private sectors can take steps to mitigate potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulatory-response-implications-and-solutions&quot;&gt;REGULATORY RESPONSE, IMPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding analysis of key crypto-mining typologies – cryptojacking, commercial mining, remote mining and staking – shows that, despite global interest in regulating digital assets, significant risks to the global financial system remain. In most cases, crypto mining does not fall within the purview of financial supervisors or AML frameworks. The following section addresses some of these legal and regulatory challenges, as well as their implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, only a handful of countries have addressed cryptocurrency mining within their sectoral risk assessments. Moreover, of those that have attempted to tackle mining, regulatory approaches have varied considerably. In some jurisdictions, for example, legislation explicitly states that cryptocurrency mining activity is outside the scope of AML rules and regulations, while in other jurisdictions, miners are subject to licensing and registration requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-approaches&quot;&gt;REGULATORY APPROACHES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many challenges is the fact that cryptocurrency mining businesses do not generally retain custody of the mined cryptocurrency. This means they do not generally fit into the category of financial institutions that fall under the purview of the FATF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the FATF, “natural or legal persons that solely engage in the operation of a VA [virtual assets] network and do not engage in or facilitate any of the activities or operations of a VASP on behalf of their customers … are not VASPs”, even if those activities are undertaken as part of their business. Examples provided by the FATF of activities that would not in themselves qualify an entity to be considered a VASP include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offering customers internet network services and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing computing resources (“cloud services and creating, validating, and broadcasting blocks of transactions”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China banned mining outright in 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the report notes that those that do not fall under the definition of a VASP include “validators … whose functions are only validating transactions and cloud service providers whose functions are only offering the operation of infrastructure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide further clarification on these requirements, countries have taken steps to release guidance on crypto mining. However, in the US, for example, little has been done in the way of modernising AML rules and regulations related to crypto mining. Current guidance, put forward by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the key agency responsible for countering money laundering in the US, is now nearly a decade old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance, unfortunately, does not take into account crypto-mining businesses, noting that “to the extent that a user mines Bitcoin and uses the Bitcoin solely for the user’s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, the user is not an MSB [money service business] under FinCEN’s regulations”. Thus, a crypto-mining company is typically not considered an MSB, and as such is not required to implement AML rules and regulations, such as know-your-customer procedures and record-keeping requirements, which are commonplace at banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries have taken drastically different approaches. China, for example, banned mining outright in 2021. Prior to the ban, nearly 50% of global Bitcoin mining occurred in China. In response to the new restrictions, cryptocurrency mining companies relocated to other jurisdictions, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran and the US. Despite the ban, however, an analysis of hash rates, which can be a proxy for measuring total levels of mining, indicate that there are still mining operations in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following subsections offer recommendations that countries should consider to restrict abuse of this type of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consider the Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall lack of rules around businesses that offer crypto-mining services poses a problem for securing the international financial system against illicit actors. The typologies outlined in this paper detail various methods that criminal networks and sanctions evaders can exploit to generate relatively “clean” streams of revenue – that is, revenue not linked to a specific criminal group or individual or prohibited activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the risks posed to the international financial system, states should, at a minimum, consider their relative risk exposure to crypto mining from a cyber security standpoint, and identify associated risk with businesses within the industry. This includes understanding the scale and scope of mining-centric businesses within their jurisdiction, which is not always straightforward – especially if there are no registration or licensing requirements. At a minimum, countries should include their crypto-mining industries within national risk assessments.42 To aid with understanding risk and mitigation strategies, operators of crypto-mining enterprises should be included in domestic public–private partnerships centred on cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jurisdictions should be especially concerned if sanctions evasion or other types of illicit financial activity have previously been associated with their jurisdiction. It is important to note that countries have an obligation to implement and enforce international sanctions. In the case of North Korea, for example, states are required to prevent the provision of financial services or economic resources to North Korea. While crypto-mining services may not fit neatly within the definition of a “financial service”, they are nonetheless an economic resource that North Korea could exploit to support its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand Regional Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor countries should consider is regional risk exposure. There could be negative spillover effects from neighbouring jurisdictions that incentivise crypto-mining businesses, such as by offering cheap energy or establishing free trade zones with favourable crypto-mining laws. For example, a country with little or no crypto-mining activity but active cryptocurrency exchanges may face significant risks from illicit actors mining in one region and cashing out in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collect and Verify Beneficial Ownership Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries need to identify and verify individuals who have ownership and control of crypto-mining facilities located in their jurisdictions. As shown in the second section, illicit actors can exploit such facilities for laundering or sanctions evasion purposes, so it is critical to identify who is behind operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FATF outlines that countries should take measures to prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles for criminal purposes by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the risk associated with legal arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making legal persons and legal arrangements sufficiently transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requiring corporate vehicles to provide accurate and up-to-date basic and beneficial ownership information to competent authorities in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to detect large-scale mining facilities that are not registered as businesses, law enforcement can look at spikes in energy consumption, as the proof-of-work mining process requires a substantial amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Require Customer Identification and Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries should also consider modifying registration requirements for commercial and remote mining enterprises. At a minimum, regulatory authorities should require these companies to retain customer identifying information for law enforcement purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most types of crypto-mining activities would not meet the definition of a VASP, and thus not be subject to AML rules and regulations, collection of customer information by remote crypto-mining businesses is highly recommended. By undertaking the following checks on remote clients when establishing business relations these facilities can ensure sanctions compliance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recording the full name, date of birth, nationality and address of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verifying the information provided to ensure the use of official government identification documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping a record of cryptocurrency addresses used by the customer to receive generated funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If illicitly obtained funds are linked to the remote crypto-mining business, holding this customer information will aid in law enforcement investigations. Furthermore, these facilities need to ensure they do not accept funds from sanctioned entities by screening customer information against relevant sanctions lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal networks and state actors have both used crypto mining to generate nearly anonymous streams of revenue. While the scale and scope of these illicit operations is largely unknown, the risk posed to the international financial system is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rapidly evolving industry, new innovations also bring new opportunities for illicit actors to exploit, and governments are failing to recognise risks associated with mining. To mitigate the risks that mining can generate, it will be important for governments to think outside traditional AML frameworks. Defining a crypto-mining company as an MSB, for example, may be akin to trying to place a square peg in a round hole. Instead, identification of beneficial ownership and recording client information will likely prove more useful for identifying illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;余慧明指中共立《國安法》「炒熟香港人」 官質疑煽動仇恨&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;余慧明稱《國安法》為「惡法」 官：就算唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5Ia2r70.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第113天。余慧明繼續作供，就《國安法》宣布實施後所撰的〈迷霧裡 黑夜終於響起號角聲〉，余解釋撰文是望港人「唔好對《國安法》淨係得個恐懼」，而是應繼續思考如何合法抗爭。法官陳仲衡關注文中「中共已按捺不住直接炒熟香港人」是否煽動對中共的仇恨，余否認，指只是陳述中共將《國安法》「加插」在《基本法》附件三，無經本地諮詢便在港實施；又形容是「中共單方面炒香港人」，嚇怕外資、令經濟不穩，猶如向港人開戰。余亦指很多港人不贊成《國安法》，但港府無將意見向中央表達，法官李運騰笑說報紙每天都有報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又表示，曾預期被DQ和取消選舉，但無想過「連議會都未入去就拉人」；她亦強調若政府拒絕談判，會反對所有議案，「我認為投下一票反對票係冇錯㗎。」余亦確認衞生服務界無召開過協調會議，她不曾收過及看過協調文件，最終亦因選民資格認證爭議令該界別初選結果不具約束力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱衞生服務界無召協調會議不曾收過及看過界別協調文件&quot;&gt;余稱衞生服務界無召協調會議、不曾收過及看過界別協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明繼續作供，余昨稱2020年4月曾問戴耀廷能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選，獲戴回覆視乎可能性。她今續確認6月9日前無與組織者和其他候選人見面，她是當天記者會後，才獲競選團隊告知戴會上宣布衞生服務界也會有初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/emNwJ37.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月9日 35+記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，衞生服務界無開過協調會議，戴耀廷亦沒有與她提過其他選區討論過的題目；就「35+計劃」和「民主派衞生服務界協調機制協議」文件，余被捕前均無收過也無看過，而就文件所有內容，「我哋都冇傾過點樣可以代表到我哋有個協議喺度」，因她向戴稱想辦初選的原因，只是想選出一人代表民主派出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文件提及衞生服務界有兩個指定票站，余指戴耀廷原曾提及有4個，但因街工退出初選而減至3個，戴有在6月24日創立的衞生服務界 WhatsApp 群組提及，群組成員還包括余慧明、李國麟、劉凱文、袁偉傑4名候選人，及趙家賢、鍾錦麟和時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，余同意該群組是與組織者溝通的唯一渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱無就替補及棄選機制與組織者討論棄選機制無協議&quot;&gt;余稱無就替補及棄選機制與組織者討論、棄選機制無協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就替補機制和棄選機制，余指無與組織者討論，但她認為如勝出後不幸被DQ，「我係應該可以指明另一個人去代替我出選」，同意即「靈童制」，不過她庭上才知道此名字；又指她於初選後曾約其他候選人開會，但只得劉凱文出席，她有向劉提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tJ0M1lk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉凱文（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余亦指就棄選機制，即落敗者不准參與正式選舉，並沒有協議，她認為有人「輸咗初選都照參選」的情況「避免唔到」，「但我就可以出嚟話佢哋出嚟鎅票，咁既然大家都應該會譴責佢哋依個行徑嘅話，咁佢地就會輸囉。」陳慶偉發笑，李運騰亦說那或是余的願望，但有否與其他候選人達成協議？余說「協議唔到」，亦不知棄選機制是計劃的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，余有從任何途徑得悉初選有棄選機制嗎？余說「我唔知『墨落無悔』算唔算」，但除此以外則沒有。陳慶偉問那「三投三不投」呢？余說沒有，稱接近投票日時才聽過，「但我冇關心佢呢個 programme 搞緊啲咩，因為我自己都好忙碌。」李運騰問余是否得悉「三投三不投」曾在《蘋果日報》賣頭版廣告，余指在審訊文件夾才看過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱組織者決定初選結果無約束力參與者無可奈何&quot;&gt;余稱組織者決定初選結果無約束力、參與者無可奈何&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余其後表示，2020年7月10日、初選投票前一日，衞生服務界群組內4名初選參與者與組織者，曾就選民資格認證發生爭議，當時有四個方案，他們花很多時間討論，但「達唔成一個共識」，組織者最終決定用方案三，即投票者出示職員證就可證明是該界別人士，但初選結果對參選人「不具規範性」、「冇約束性」，並叫民主動力將決定發布給所有人，指衞生服務界初選結果「只供參考」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Myd0V4z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並指，「依個係大會主辦單位所選擇嘅結果，我哋係無可奈何囉」、「我哋都唔滿意㗎」，指她自己希望結果有約束性，而李國麟則無明確表示要有約束性。余並指事後曾發文解釋自己立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱合法抗爭為重要考慮罷工曾問法律顧問意見&quot;&gt;余稱「合法」抗爭為重要考慮、罷工曾問法律顧問意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示余慧明5月23日於《香港獨立媒體網》刊出的〈迷霧裡 黑夜終於響起號角聲〉，余指同由她於 Facebook 專頁發布，獨媒轉載，撰文背景是當時人大已公布會就「港版國安法」立法，她「希望香港人唔好對《國安法》淨係得個恐懼」、「覺得做咩都冇用」，「應該繼續去思考點樣可以合法地抗爭」，「爭取我哋一直追求嘅民主、真普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意，「合法」對她來說是重要考慮，她在2020年初組織醫護罷工亦有考慮，「因為我始終係一個工會嘅代表，所以我好着重我自己做嘅嘢係咪符合法律嘅容許之下嘅」，而當時「為咗保障我啲會員」，她有確保整個罷工程序符合法律程序，亦有問過法律顧問意見。石書銘問，抗爭的合法性考慮對余有多重要？余微微發笑並湊前咪高峰：「好重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱立國安法非攬炒為中共單方面炒香港人&quot;&gt;余稱立《國安法》非「攬炒」、為中共「單方面炒香港人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「中共已按捺不住直接炒熟香港人，任誰也不能置身事外」，法官陳仲衡關注，余用中共「炒熟」港人的字眼，會否煽動（stir up）對中共的仇恨？余不認為會，解釋因她只是陳述中共將《國安法》「加插」在《基本法》附件三的決定，即「唔需要經過本地嘅立法、亦都冇經過本地嘅一啲諮詢，直接就可以喺香港度實施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳仲衡質疑，余並非陳述事實，而是用「炒熟」一詞。余解釋，因當時有人用「攬炒」形容此行為，「但我唔認為依個係一個攬炒，因為依個係中共單方面炒香港人」，故使用「炒熟」，並解釋認為中共行為可能嚇怕外資、令經濟不穩定，令香港無法維持「國際大都會」的名譽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余奮力迎戰對手為政府先傾後砌為爭取平等對話機會&quot;&gt;余「奮力迎戰」對手為政府、「先傾後砌」為爭取「平等」對話機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提到「面對中共赤裸裸上陣，香港人只可奮力迎戰。各路戰線，要堅持去做」，余解釋「奮力迎戰」指要繼續以不同戰線抗爭。李運騰指要戰鬥便需有對手，余的對手是誰？余思考了一會說：「當時嘅語境係政府囉，係拒絕聆聽民意嘅政府」，解釋因當時很多香港市民也不贊成《國安法》實施，「但香港政府係冇將依個意見表達畀中央。」李運騰笑說，「報紙每日都有報導。（“It was reported at the newspaper everyday.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，戰爭是關乎生死，余將政府視為對手，是排除任何談判的可能嗎？余說「絕對不是」，陳慶偉笑問，即「先砌後傾」？（余昨稱自己願談判，但會「先砌後傾」，解釋「砌」是擺出高姿態，事先宣揚反對一切議案。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今重申，這是一種高姿態談判手段，「但係最重要係政府必須放下佢高高在上嘅身段，佢先可以同我哋一齊傾囉，即係我哋唔會關閉咗我哋嘅溝通大門。」陳慶問，即余為了令政府放低身段，會「先砌後傾」？余指認為是可行方法，指是要爭取一個「平等啲」的對話機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱反對所有議案為擺高姿態談判認為投下一票反對票係冇錯嘅&quot;&gt;余稱反對所有議案為擺高姿態談判、認為「投下一票反對票係冇錯嘅」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱「當初要爭取議會過半，全面反枱，迫使政權解散立法會進行破局。這個目標一日未達成，一日亦要堅持，哪怕政權DQ也好，取消選舉亦好，目的只為向全界都揭示香港人已失去昔日人權與自由。」，余指「全面反枱」指她「會繼續全面將所有嘅議案係投反對票」，「我哋係要反客為主，將個話語權攞返去自己手上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，余使用的語言如何表達她是準備好談判的訊息？余指無很明確展示，「因為我係要展示我要擺出一個好高嘅姿態，同政府談判。」李追問，會高到令人認為她不準備談判嗎？余指不會，舉例醫護罷工時他們與政府同樣擺出好高的姿態，「但係事實上，其實係有一個 negotiation 出現咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指那或是罷工的情況，但重申余文中無提「談判」，讀者或認為其主張與戴耀廷「攬炒十步」類似，令特首下台、國際制裁、中共倒台。余先指「我係冇睇過戴耀廷嗰個攬炒十部曲」，而且「我係想向選民同埋公眾展現我嘅決心，唔會輕易退讓，但我唔會將我嘅談判嘅策略都擺埋出嚟畀人睇㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但余是威脅（threat）政府談判？余即說：「我冇 threat 喎，我用『迫使』咋喎，如果你話用 threat，我應該話威脅政權解散（立法會）㗎啦喎」，指這是她對文字的理解。余續同意，她是迫使政府談判，向其訴求妥協。陳仲衡問，而如政府不這樣做，余就會做出文中所言的行為？余同意，指「我認為投下一票反對票係冇錯㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱曾預想dq和取消選舉-但無想過票都未投就拉&quot;&gt;余稱曾預想DQ和取消選舉 但無想過「票都未投就拉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「哪怕政權DQ也好，取消選舉亦好」，辯方問余慧明當時還預期政府採取其他行動嗎？余說「嗰陣時淨係諗到嗰兩樣嘢，冇諗過會拉人囉，即係連議會都未入去就拉人咁樣，即係票都未投就拉咁樣」，並在法官追問下指，即她成功當選並「喺投下反對票之前，已經畀人拉咗喇」。余又指，就她提及的有機會取消選舉「事實上亦都發生咗吖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指要有心理準備爭民主路很長和平抗爭亦消耗大體力&quot;&gt;余指要有心理準備爭民主路很長、和平抗爭亦消耗大體力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「大家必須作好生理與心理準備，要不做順民，不再發聲；否則，便奮力迎接與中共的背水一戰！」，余解釋「心理準備」是要有準備「爭取民主之路會好長」；至於「生理準備」，「我絕對唔係話鼓吹緊大家要上街，即係街頭抗爭嗰啲」，而是進行和平的抗爭手法也會消耗很大體力。石書銘一度問是暴力抑或非暴力抗爭，余指是較暴力的示威，但強調「依樣嘢都係視乎返警方用暴力鎮壓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續解釋就和平抗爭，如罷工需要很多不同持分者溝通，包括醫管局高層、政府、會員、公眾和傳媒，該過程「好費心力」，尤其前兩者「唔聽我哋嘅說話」更費其心神。余又指如2019年6月16日的遊行，由起點行到終點也要至少6至8小時，如每星期都有，大家都需要一個「好強健嘅體魄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章提背水一戰-余稱反抗不一定使用暴力戰爭都會有negotiation&quot;&gt;文章提「背水一戰」 余稱反抗不一定使用暴力、「戰爭都會有negotiation」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「奮力迎接與中共的背水一戰」，陳慶偉問是否即一條「不歸路（road with no return）」，因「背水」指身後有河流，只能向前戰鬥。余先說看不到此解說，又指向前行不代表一定要戰鬥，並解釋她是「首尾呼應」文中早前提到「面對中共赤裸裸上陣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此余也是談及「先砌後傾」？余一度不同意，指因中共已實施《國安法》，她比喻此行為「已經向香港人開戰喇」，而他們只是「做一個反抗」，不代表一定使用暴力行為，「咁你戰爭入面都會有 negotiation 啦。」陳說他就是提議余文章的意思也是「先砌後傾」，但余卻稱不同意，「我在給你出路（“I’m giving you a way out.”）」，余說：「OK，我 get 到喇」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再問余是否預期談判，余重申「我係會有 negotiation」，無寫明是因不想將談判手段「擺埋出嚟畀人睇」，但又不想令公眾認為她很易退讓，不同意她無論如何也不會退讓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱從無發表要求外國制裁言論&quot;&gt;余稱從無發表要求外國制裁言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於文中提到「國際戰線」，余昨解釋是透過媒體向國際社會展示香港發生街頭運動、醫護於疫情罷工的原因，都是政府拒絕聆聽民意，而她望國際輿論令港府有壓力，如想維持香港國際都會地位和聲譽，就要停止高壓手段鎮壓人民、聆聽訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今指，文中意思與昨日解釋相若，引起國際關注是其原意，「可以引到幾多關注就另計囉」，並強調「我從來都冇發表過要求外國制裁嘅言論」，只是希望政府感受到壓力下聆聽民意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指政府無法運作指公務員罷工稱受基本法保障&quot;&gt;余指「政府無法運作」指公務員罷工、稱受《基本法》保障&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中亦提到：「有效的三罷是不設時限的，直至社會停擺，政府無法運作，必須回應訴求為止」，就「政府無法運作」，余解釋是其想像，若公務員也參與罷工應會影響政府部門運作，但要視乎規模，亦同意是談判籌碼。石書銘問余有考慮合法性嗎？李運騰指余已回答不想違法，石追問余腦海中有無特定法例，惟李運騰指余並非法律專家，陳慶偉亦說「你是問她撰文時有無查詢香港的法律？現實點！」，石指她是問余的心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余在雙方討論期間，一度答是《基本法》第27條（列明香港居民享有罷工的權利和自由），又主動說「我相信公務員都會有保障，因為《基本法》應該保障咗全香港人」，但陳慶偉指他們在跟余的代表律師說話，「我們不是在辦研討會」，李運騰亦重申辯方是問余無資格回應的法律問題。李其後改問，余當時認為公務員罷工是否合法，余說「絕對係」。石書銘欲再問為什麼，陳慶偉不准許，指余的理解或對或錯，而她將合法性放到最優先的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指訪問用字比自己立場更激進無要求下架因會帶來公關災難&quot;&gt;余指訪問用字比自己立場更激進、無要求下架因會帶來「公關災難」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續引余慧明4月22日刊於《香港獨立媒體》的訪問〈【專訪】從組織工會到走進議會 余慧明：我要真攬炒！〉，指訪問引述余稱「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變」，問余有否被引述錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指訪問刊出前記者無給予她看，刊出後她獲發文章連結並閱讀，認為有些字眼「係比我嘅立場更加激進嘅」，而有些位置「我覺得係唔完全反映緊我當時表達嘅意思」，但她無要求修改或下架，因當時是競選階段，如這樣做會帶來「公關災難」，故選擇「冷處理」。余並指就該句話，她不肯定是否確切引述（exact quote），但肯定她有用過類似「推翻呢個制度」和要民選政府的字眼，而她認為「政權」等於政府，「推翻政權」等同「林鄭下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦問題目中「我要真攬炒」是否余的說法，余說認為該標題是記者或編輯根據她早前文章〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉而擬定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱望爭制度改革林鄭下台無意思&quot;&gt;余稱望爭制度改革、林鄭下台無意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，正如她3月的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉也強調要爭取制度上改革，指「你純粹改咗個執政者，係冇意思嘅對我嚟講，因為林鄭落台，你搵個林鄭2.0上去，係冇改變過」。李運騰問，但若那人願意對話呢？余指「咁依個可能係一個改變嚟嘅」，辯方再問如制度一樣，但在位者願意對話，余還堅持要推翻制度嗎？余回應認為她在爭取一個較民主、公平的制度，「咁當然我都會願意同佢傾咗先，睇吓佢係咩態度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/68UTBa5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第113天。余慧明繼續作供，表明其預設立場是對議案投反對票，除非政府回應五大訴求，否則會反對一切議案直至政府回應為止；但余亦指，五大訴求中最重要是雙普選，若政府能提供確實時間表她便可接受，其他訴求則可由民選政府實行。余又重申反對一切議案是其高姿態談判手法，法官問她是「扮硬淨」抑或「真硬淨」？余強調「我係會講得出、做得到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余在《國安法》後發文稱「惡法壓境，極權肆虐……我們與政權再無斡旋餘地」，余指「惡法」是形容《國安法》，撰文望顯示決心，即使《國安法》後仍不會恐懼和讓步，因爭取五大訴求沒有違反《國安法》。法官李運騰指，無人要求余熱愛《國安法》，但「就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯」，余指當時仍相信投票無觸犯《國安法》，故望鼓勵選民於初選投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指認同墨落兩點聲明遂簽署自視為抗爭派與泛民有別&quot;&gt;余指認同「墨落」兩點聲明遂簽署、自視為「抗爭派」與泛民有別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明繼續作供，就「墨落無悔」聲明，余指6月10日晚從競選團隊 WhatsApp 群組得知流傳該聲明，她當時有看過，「最着眼」當中兩點聲明，而她認同該兩點聲明，故與團隊討論了一會後決定簽署，又指簽署「純粹想顯示我咁堅定嘅立場畀我啲選民睇」，無意呼籲其他人簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意她看到聲明前已有否決財案的想法，而她當時不知道其他區有否就運用否決權一點討論。陳仲衡指，若余有讀到前一段提及「在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，不會認為有討論過嗎？余說如當時有仔細看應會有此想法，但當時她認為該段文字僅鋪排聲明背景，她亦無參與過協調會，故該段「對我嚟講冇乜意思」。余亦認為，「認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一點，勉強來說「唔係太適用」於其選區，因衞生服務界只得一席，不過余認為簡單而言是「輸咗就唔好選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明標題「抗爭派立場聲明書」，辯方問余會否自視為「抗爭派」。余指該詞當時應該很新，「但係如果我簽得依個聲明書，咁我都會認為自己係抗爭派囉」，又指另一原因是她也有「堅定意志」，「我係想令自己同普遍嘅泛民係有啲分別。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指提名表由助手填寫無細看認為35目標是爭民主派議會過半&quot;&gt;余指提名表由助手填寫無細看、認為35+目標是爭民主派議會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，余指是由助手預先填好，她6月19日簽署後，助手翌日提交，「我係冇乜點樣睇過呢份表格。」陳仲衡問余是政治新手、首次參選，不會花時間閱讀提名表格嗎？余指其正職很忙，加上當時初選準備工作很忙碌，而她不視閱讀表格為準備工作一部分，認為純粹是報名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指出表格兩處錯處，其中見證部分有余的簽署，她指收到審訊文件夾後細看發現應「出錯咗」，「唔應該係由我本人見證我自己填㗎嘛」，如她當時有細看無理由留意不到。李運騰笑言似乎余的助手也沒細看，余同意。另一錯處為表格政綱將「五大訴求」誤寫為「五大缺求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格條款「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，余指當時無留意到，但如她有看到，就協調會議共識部分，無開協調會的她「會覺得唔關我事囉」，亦認為應指向地區直選的事，但「大會唔會為我哋依個界別特登設計多一張 form 出嚟㗎嘛」。余又指，理解「35+」的目標是「爭取民主派議會過半」。辯方問除過半外還有其他目標嗎？余說：「冇㗎啦喎，淨係35+咋喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱雙普選為最重要訴求有確實時間表會接受-但非實現就停止追求其他&quot;&gt;余稱雙普選為最重要訴求、有確實時間表會接受 但非實現就停止追求其他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格附上的政綱，余指以為一定要填寫，故着助手「求其整一張 poster」應付，該政綱她不曾印刷和派發。當中「我若當選，必定承諾行使反對權利反對一切議案，直至香港政府全面回應五大訴求，決一不可為止」一句，余指正確表達其意思但不全面，因她雖想展示決心，但仍會談判。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續重申認為五大訴求中最重要為「立即實行雙普選」，其他訴求則可在雙普選後透過可認真反映民意的民選政府實行，而「只要政府係有個實在、白紙黑字寫到明嘅時間表，我都可以解釋畀我嘅選民聽，我會接受」；而若政府「反口」，「咁我就根據我嘅承諾，行使返我嘅反對權利，直至政府再次回應我為止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注「立即」一詞，指余曾說普選不能一夜實現。余回應是立即實行一個確實、確切的時間表，用「立即」是想展示決心。惟法官陳仲衡引余慧明於另一訪問提及，政權「一定要回應五大訴求缺一不可，而唔係即係可能回應其中一兩個訴求，就當係可以解決到呢個問題」，指是「缺一不可」，而非僅回應一兩個訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意，但「唔代表我實行咗雙普選之後我就會停止吖嘛，我要確保嗰個民選政府，都要做埋第二、第三、第四個訴求，咁咪就係『五大訴求、缺一不可』囉」。而就列出的五大訴求無提林鄭下台，余重申因林鄭下台無法解決問題，要爭取制度改革。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱永遠企喺雞蛋一方-官質疑與案無關不准辯方發問&quot;&gt;余稱「永遠企喺雞蛋一方」 官質疑與案無關不准辯方發問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續就每項訴求發問，就「撤回送中惡法」，余同意已達到；就「撤回暴動定性」，余指認為出現該訴求是因每當有暴力事件發生，「政府只會一味就係話我哋係使用暴力，一味譴責，甚至乎抹黑緊我哋整場嘅運動」，陳仲衡問余用「我哋」一詞，是站在抗爭者一方？余答：「我永遠企喺雞蛋嘅一方」，又問：「我可唔可以繼續講？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉質疑為何要深究，石書銘指他是問及余的底線，即政府如何回應才可接受、她何時會反對政府議案，惟陳慶偉多番指看不到有何需要，李運騰亦指余已回答。余其後同意，當選後會在投票前諮詢其界別，陳仲衡即問她稱會否決所有議案，如何能就所有議案諮詢選民？余指不是就所有議案諮詢，如政府不回應五大訴求她仍會反對一切議案；但若局勢有變、政府開始回應，她難確保民意是否仍會堅決「五大訴求，缺一不可」，那時就要諮詢選民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱預設立場為反對議案-除非找不到反對原因&quot;&gt;余稱預設立場為反對議案 除非找不到反對原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後關注，余慧明當選後如何決定投票意向。余指她雖於競選期間表明會反對一切議案，但「唔代表我唔睇個內容就會投反對」，她仍會研究政府政策流弊，正如疫情時一直有就政府防疫措施作出批評和建議。李運騰問若議案與五大訴求無關呢？余指其政綱已表明反對一切議案，投票支持她的選民亦認同其政綱，故會投反對；又指會研究政策流弊仔細分析予選民，「我就算投反對票我都係有理有據嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡質疑，余並非衡量議案利弊，而是找理由反對，余指「利與弊都可以睇到嘅，但係我會詳細列舉個弊多過利」。李運騰再指即余已決定反對議案，其後再找原因，余答：「我個預設嘅立場係投反對票，所以除非嗰個議案係令我搵唔到任何一個反對嘅原因」，同意可按字面解讀其政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱認為爭取五大訴求無違國安法-官一度稱就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&quot;&gt;余稱認為爭取五大訴求無違《國安法》 官一度稱：就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明7月7日於發布的〈【初選意義】〉文章，余指非全由她所撰、助理處理，但她有背書（endorse）。當中提及「惡法壓境，極權肆虐」，余指「惡法」是指《國安法》，因認為條文很模糊，令人觸犯紅線；至於「極權」是指無理會人民反對聲音、支持《國安法》通過的香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「我們與政權再無斡旋餘地」，余重申想顯示決心，即使《國安法》立法後，「我都唔會恐懼，我都唔會作出讓步，除非政府係釋出佢嘅善意，放低佢傲慢嘅身段同我哋再商討點樣可以繼續爭取我哋嘅五大訴求，因為我認為爭取五大訴求係冇違反國安法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注余將《國安法》形容為惡法，說：「無人要求你熱愛《國安法》，但說可以違反《國安法》是另一回事。（“Nobody asks you to love it. Nobody requires you to love it. But it is another thing to say that one can violate it.”）」法庭傳譯一度未能翻譯，李續手持一枝筆指住余，直接以中文說：「就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續解釋文章意思，「就係立咗《國安法》之後，我哋要參加初選嘅，都唔好恐懼；亦都鼓勵緊選民，即使有《國安法》之下，我仍然相信投票係冇觸犯到《國安法》，所以我係想鼓勵選民，喺初選嗰兩日出嚟投票。」余又指，她「絕對唔係」籲人違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑是扮硬淨抑或真硬淨-余稱投反對講得出做得到&quot;&gt;官質疑是扮「硬淨」抑或真「硬淨」 余稱投反對「講得出做得到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余其後重申，提到「無斡旋餘地」是展示決心，但不欲公開談判手法，否則如「自揭底牌」。法官追問是否誇張手法，余指「或多或少都有」，但她「真係好想展示畀其他人睇，我係會使用一個高姿態嘅談判手法囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，故余是扮演「硬淨（tough）」，還是真的「硬淨」？余說：「咁如果政權唔同我傾嘅話，我係會堅持否決，我會投反對議案，係依樣嘢我係會講得出做得到」，又強調「我只係認為作出退讓嘅應該係政府囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指國安法後不講國際戰線推翻&quot;&gt;余指《國安法》後不講「國際戰線」、「推翻」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問《國安法》後余慧明的政綱有否改變，余指提名表格政綱無變，但宣傳單張和發言時有特意不再講「國際戰線」，因看過《國安法》條文後認為即使並非要求國際制裁，亦可能被視為「勾結外國勢力」，她亦無再用一些較敏感字眼如「推翻」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余認為投反對票非干犯國安法爭取五大訴求非解散立會&quot;&gt;余認為投反對票非干犯《國安法》、爭取五大訴求非解散立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明7月8日的選舉造勢大會，辯方展示《獨媒》報導〈【立會選戰】民主派4人戰衛生服務界 余慧明：要將抗爭意志帶入議會〉，余確認黃之鋒、朱凱廸、張可森、劉頴匡、何桂藍和劉澤鋒也有到場，解釋她望邀請到越多候選人幫她站台越好，並會揀選一些「立場比較進取」和「唔係泛民」的人。余指候選人是由競選團隊邀請，她事前無就會上發言與他們討論，故他們發言與她無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及支持「攬炒」候選人或被DQ的應對，報導指「余慧明坦言國安法沒有任何標準可供參考，全憑政府定奪，但她不想『自我審查』、『被噤聲』，不會為了當選而選擇暫時隱藏『攬炒』、『抗爭』等信念，希望『由心發聲』，不想違背一直以來的信念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指當時應指選舉主任或會用很低門檻詮釋《國安法》，DQ與她本身有否犯法為兩回事，故她不會自我審查，重申認為投反對票只是行使議員職能，「依個都係《基本法》之下已經寫咗㗎喇，所以即使係啟動依個機制，我都唔認為係干犯緊《國安法》。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就報導提及余望「借『35+』之力否決法案，爭取重組立法會」，余指她非爭取解散立法會再重選立法會，「我一直爭取嘅都係『五大訴求，缺一不可』」，強調會就一切議案投反對票。李運騰再問即使議案與五大訴求無關？余指若議案與五大訴求不相關、政府也無意回應五大訴求，「我就會投反對，依個係我預設嘅立場，真係除非政府係做咗啲嘢令我回心轉意，而依個係我嘅談判手法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱戴耀廷為憲法專家-故相信初選及其政綱合法&quot;&gt;余稱戴耀廷為「憲法專家」 故相信初選及其政綱合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明續確認，有出席7月9日的初選記者會，當時相信初選和她的政綱都是合法，而戴會上說法亦令她相信是合法。余欲解釋時，李運騰打斷指法庭有謄本，知道戴談及初選合法性。余說：「正確，因為佢係一個憲法嘅專家」，李運騰即說：「Well，他說他是，那是他在記者會上的說法」，余指戴「好似冇自介為憲法專家」，李說：「我向你保證他有」，但沒關係，法庭有謄本。多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jusOsAB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月9日 民主派初選記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，於7月14日在衞生服務界群組收到戴耀廷發訊息：「我公開訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力包括否決財政預算案，今（令）特區政府問責，不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府，供大家參考。」余指事前其界別參選人無與組織者討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱重組警隊文件具參考價值減少編制為可行方法&quot;&gt;余稱重組警隊文件具參考價值、減少編制為可行方法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就余慧明家中被搜出的「重組／解散警隊可行嗎？」文件，余指非她撰寫，從集會得到後認為就「追究警暴，重組警隊」的訴求具參考價值故保留。余又並指當中提及減少警隊編制是可行方法，「例如我哋每一日都見到（法院）下面嘅警力分布」，李運騰指「每日都在減少（which is decreasing everyday）」，余再說：「但都係仍然有好多，所以我認為絕對有呢個空間去減少警隊編制」，李運騰笑稱法院曾發生玻璃幕牆破裂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tvaJakE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明開始作供，表示組織工會是她參與政治的開始，工會於2020年初「武漢肺炎」時發起工業行動要求封關，以保障市民性命安全及保護醫療系統免崩潰，惟醫管局拒回應訴求，工會要求與特首談判亦不果。余又指曾獲「中間人」行會成員林正財告知，擬將全面封關訴求包裝為「禁止世衞定為高危地區的人來港」向政府推銷，惟翌日出台卻僅為隔離措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余形容當局回應的態度「絕對影響到」她之後參選的決定，明白到如果無足夠話語權，「政權或者掌權者係唔會同我傾、唔會理我」，因政府非民選產生；加上2019年政府對市民訴求視若無睹，「一味武力打壓示威者」，故選擇參選。余又指，曾擔心衞生服務界多於一名參選人會「鎅票」令建制得利，遂問戴耀廷能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明開始作供-指組織工會是參與政治開始&quot;&gt;余慧明開始作供 指組織工會是參與政治開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信昨作供完畢，今由本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明作供。正還柙的余慧明，身穿棕色外套、黑色長裙，在兩名女懲教陪同下步向證人台，其代表大律師石書銘一度上前與余握手，余精神不俗表示：「我OK」旁聽親友亦向余說：「加油呀！」余握拳放胸口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9aq4zZa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余宣誓後，接受大律師石書銘主問。余現年36歲，已婚，於香港出生和長大，2010年畢業於香港中文大學護理學系，成為註冊護士，並受僱於醫管局，於2011年成為威爾斯親王醫院深切治療部護士，2017年成為深切治療部專科護士，但同年轉為醫療信息管理助理主任，於醫管局總部工作。余確認，2019年前從沒有參與任何政治活動。石書銘一度問余為何會轉職，法官打斷問為何要知道，石解釋這與余為何參加政治和初選有關，但陳慶偉重申看不到如何有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石改問余如何開始參與政治，余表示：「我認為係由我組織工會嘅開始，係我參與咗政治嘅開始。」余指她有參與醫管局員工陣線的籌委會，工會於2019年12月4日刊憲成立，余其後獲理事會選為主席。余並指，當時醫管局有約8萬名員工，工會成立初期有約1,000名會員，而2020年1月底宣布罷工時，會員人數曾上升到接近2萬人的高峰。石欲問余發起工會的原因，惟陳慶偉再打斷說「no」，李運騰亦不准發問，着問下一題。石書銘指那與余涉足政治有關，惟二人再搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指2020年1月武漢肺炎消息傳出-罷工為促封關保醫療系統及市民性命安全&quot;&gt;余指2020年1月「武漢肺炎」消息傳出 罷工為促封關保醫療系統及市民性命安全&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問工業行動的主要議題，余慧明解釋在2020年1月時，「我哋其實已經留意到中國武漢嗰邊，有一個武漢肺炎嘅疫情消息出現咗」，他們望用很和平的手法，如曾發公開信予政府和醫管局望正視問題，因當時病毒未流入香港。而發動工業行動最主要原因，「都係想保障返香港市民嘅性命安全，同埋保護返香港醫療系統避免崩潰嘅狀態嘅，所以我哋希望醫管局同埋政府可以回應我哋嘅訴求，及早進行封關嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並解釋，根據會章，「即使我哋理事會決定咗一個工業行動，我哋都要召開一個特別會員大會……因為經過咗一個合法嘅程序……」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷，指認為與案無關，「我們不是就COVID展開獨立調查。」石書銘再問余有否獲會員授權，惟陳慶偉打斷着問下一題。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年2月3日醫護罷工第一日，醫管局員工陣線到醫管局大樓與局方對話。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指醫管局及政府回應態度絕對影響其參選決定曾收中間人林正財訊息&quot;&gt;余指醫管局及政府回應態度「絕對影響」其參選決定、曾收中間人林正財訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，罷工於2月3日開始，2月7日結束，期間曾與政府和醫管局磋商，「基於佢哋回應嘅態度，絕對影響到我之後參選嘅決定。」余指罷工前曾用電郵邀請時任食物及衞生局局長陳肇始與他們傾，但不獲回應；至罷工開始，醫管局最初接受與他們進行公開對話，但對話中「佢係完全冇直接回應我哋嘅訴求，只係不停咁遊花園」，故當晚宣布談判破裂，進行第二階段罷工。余當時亦認為在封關議題上，「淨係醫管局係話唔到事」，故想邀請時任特首兼抗疫督導委員會主席林鄭月娥「落嚟同我哋一齊傾」，但最終收到醫管局電郵指「特首係唔會同我哋傾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余亦透露，於罷工第二天宣布翌日會去特首辦找特首時，曾收到她認為是代表政府的中間人透過一位「我認為係比較接近民主派嘅醫生嘅中間人」的訊息，在法官追問下指是時任行政會議成員林正財。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CVG4VDo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 時任行政會議成員 林正財（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指林當時向她表示，會嘗試將全面封關的說法包裝成另一個意思相若的措施，向政府推銷，林當時說法是「禁止由世衞公布嘅高危地方嘅旅客進入香港」，余認為可以接受。惟第二日政策出台，卻轉為由內地來港人士要進行14天強制隔離，余認為「同我哋嘅預期係有落差」，因此於罷工第三天繼續罷工爭取訴求。余解釋時，李運騰一度着她毋須解釋，指「我們沒有興趣，我們不是審這個議題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指無法進一步爭取封關順應會員民主投票結果結束罷工&quot;&gt;余指無法進一步爭取封關、順應會員民主投票結果結束罷工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明強調，「我一直都係想同政府同埋醫管局溝通，而唔係單方面進行一個工業行動。」罷工終於2月7日結束，余解釋最後一日要決定會否延長罷工繼續爭取訴求時，曾號召會員到醫管局總部嘗試與高層對話，並到他們辦公室門外靜坐等他們出來，但「佢哋一直將我哋拒諸門外」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a9HfBNK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年2月7日醫護罷工最後一日，醫管局員工陣線到醫管局總部門外靜坐。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指「當時我哋感到極度嘅失望同埋唔甘心」，但認為「已經冇辦法爭取到進一步嘅封關」，同時亦了解有部分會員對病人擔心，「佢哋放唔低喺病房繼續作戰緊嘅同事」，故最終發起投票表決，最終7千多名會員投票，有4千多票反對、3千多票贊成，「所以我哋順應咗呢個民主投票嘅結果，結束咗罷工。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余解釋參選是因無足夠話語權政權唔會理我但立會過半可有話語權&quot;&gt;余解釋參選是因無足夠話語權政權「唔會理我」、但立會過半可有話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明續指，她罷工後開始考慮參選立法會，解釋參選有兩個原因，其一是「基於我喺2019年見證到政府對市民嘅訴求視若無睹，只係一味武力打壓示威者」；其二是罷工中她與政府和醫管局直接交手的經驗，「令我明白到一個道理係，如果我冇一個足夠嘅話語權呢，政權或者掌權者係唔會同我傾、唔會理我嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，余慧明認為政府只有在被迫時才會聆聽意見？余答：「我認為佢哋唔聽我哋嘅理由，係因為佢唔係一個民選嘅政府」，「我嘅睇法係，要有足夠嘅話語權，佢先會望到我哋囉。」余並在法官陳仲衡追問下解釋，「民選政府」就是雙普選下，行政長官產生方法是一人一票選出，「依個政府就會真正向市民問責囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，當時衞生服務界議員為香港護士協會的李國麟，他並非工會成員，理解為獨立人士。而余決定參選時，曾與工會同事討論參選地區直選抑或功能組別，但最後分析會員基礎，大部分為衞生服務界選民，加上對李國麟表現「唔滿意」，故於3月中時決定參選立法會衞生服務界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指當時尚未留意到有初選，也無看過戴耀廷和區諾軒的任何文章，但連登和 Telegram 群組等也有討論立會過半和「35+」，亦有很多文章分析如民主派於議會過半就可取得立法會控制權，「就有一個話語權喺度，咁依個正正就係我哋想要嘅嘢。」余當時也無與其他民主派候選人討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余話語權指35後有權力反客為主討論五大訴求&quot;&gt;余：「話語權」指35+後有權力反客為主討論「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明其後解釋，「話語權」是指當民主派取得35席後，「我哋係有一個權力可以 set 到一啲 agenda，咁我哋就唔係再跟住政府嘅 flow，唔係再跟住政府嘅 agenda 去做一啲審議，而係我哋反客為主，拎返五大訴求上嚟，做一個審議」，同意即民主派會與政府談判。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，若取不到35+，民主派還會有話語權嗎？余指認為話語權即談判籌碼，如失去否決權，「我認為係冇咗咁大個籌碼，個話語權係少咗。」不過余指，「個話語權少咗但唔等於冇嘅」，「因為我仍然係可以擺出一個高姿態去同政府去談判，只不過同罷工嗰時一樣啦，如果我冇一個話語權，政府咪可以選擇唔理我囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指曾聯絡戴耀廷提出能否順便辦衞生服務界初選認為是搭單&quot;&gt;余指曾聯絡戴耀廷提出能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選、認為是「搭單」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參與初選的經過，余指2020年4月時估計時任衞生服務界議員李國麟會競逐連任，亦知道劉凱文有意參選，但該界別只有一席，如多於一位參選人就會造成「鎅票」，「鷸蚌相爭、建制得利」。余指當時於網上論壇的新聞，留意到戴耀廷在地區直選正辦初選，故「打算可唔可以借助到佢哋個平台，順便搞埋衞生服務界嘅初選」，而她無特別留意戴的其他主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余遂從工會成員取得戴耀廷電話，向戴發訊息看有否可能在辦地區直選初選時順便辦衞生服務界初選，余不記得戴的確實回應，但大意是「睇吓有冇依個可能性啦」。余指，至6月9日記者會戴耀廷宣布辦衞生服務界初選前，她沒有再聯絡戴，「因為我覺得我哋只係搭單去搞初選啦，如果搞得成，咪去囉；如果搞唔成嘅，咁可能到時再算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XKeGpb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指5月中曾接受《立場新聞》專訪，有齊4位衞生服務界潛在候選人，故她感覺該界別「應該係搞得成初選」。石書銘問，那余期間有與其他「被指為組織者（alleged organizer）」區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟溝通嗎？陳慶偉打斷指「他們不是被指為組織者，他們是組織者」，余慧明表示沒有。余亦沒有與另外3人討論初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XG6q22f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。余慧明繼續作供，就其文章〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，余解釋是為爭取五大訴求，並理解「攬炒」是借助電影對白「if we burn, you burn with us」，當時市民「已經畀政權燒着緊」，她望以任何合法方法增加政府拒聽民意的代價，即使或利益受損、「冇咗份工」；又指「攬炒」雖帶來雙輸局面，但「始作俑者係政府」。余又強調其目標並非「攬炒」，而是爭取雙普選，提出「攬炒」和否決所有議案並非「恐嚇」，是擺出高姿態與政府談判。余強調「我哋從來都係有得傾」，關鍵是政府是否願放下身段聆聽民意，若政府拒談判便會反對預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提到「向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴」，余直言「7.21、8.31、10.1，我哋真係唔可以好似政府咁話要向前看就 move on 囉」，並指運動中「冇一個政府官員要問責落台」、「冇一個警員要為自己嘅暴力行為負上責任」，但有很多示威者被拘控。余不認為只有市民一方要承受代價，而她願意嘗試用任何方式令政府「直視民意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指攬炒為即使利益受損仍要增加政府代價始作俑者為政府&quot;&gt;余指「攬炒」為即使利益受損仍要增加政府代價、始作俑者為政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明續作供，辯方展示3月31日於《香港獨立媒體》發布的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，余指約於3月30日於個人 Facebook 專頁發布，其後獨媒無獲其授權轉載，但文章應完整及準確。而她這麼早撰文，「純粹為正選鋪路」，但當時未知有初選，並在法官詢問下指可將文章解讀為參選宣言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及標題的意思，余解釋她將「爭取五大訴求」比喻為一個旅途，若政府繼續堅持不回應民意，爭取五大訴求的時間「可能會好長」；至於使用「攬炒」，是因爭取五大訴求時，「我係願意嘗試用任何合法嘅方法，即使個過程之中我可能會利益受損，可能會冇咗份工，都要增加政府拒絕聆聽民意嘅代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，她並不是從戴耀廷借用「攬炒」一詞，解釋該字眼於2019年已曾出現，當時網上很多人已有使用，其文章亦與3月25日公民黨記者會和3月26日戴耀廷召開的35+記者會無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指攬炒借助if-we-burn-you-burn-with-us-指望在法律框架下令政府回應民意&quot;&gt;余指「攬炒」借助「if we burn, you burn with us」 指望在法律框架下令政府回應民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並解釋她理解2019年社會運動中「攬炒」的意思，「係借助咗一個電影嘅對白：“If we burn, you burn with us.”。」李運騰問是《飢餓遊戲》的對白？余同意，指認為當時的市民「係已經畀政權燒着緊」，「因為佢完全唔理市民嘅意見、唔聆聽市民嘅聲音，強行推動《逃犯條例》嘅修訂，令到事件演變成越嚟越多嘅衝突。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，她理解「you burn with us」，是示威者或市民角度「要令到政權都付出代價」，如發動大三罷令政府「面對一個好重大嘅政治壓力」，而該行動也是《基本法》保障下的權利和自由。余強調，她希望以「非暴力」的方法，在法律容許的框架下做一些抗爭，令政府聆聽民意、回應訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，余是談及雙輸局面？余說：「其實呢個唔係我想要，我想要嘅係一個 win-win」，陳慶偉笑出聲。李運騰指即使余不想，但「攬炒」基本上就是談及一個雙輸局面。余表示明白，但強調「依個局面點解會產生，係因為政府唔聆聽民意囉」，李追問但結果會是雙輸？余說：「係，但係個始作俑者係政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並指，罷工時曾形容「政府攬炒緊我哋香港市民大眾」，到特首辦示威時亦曾高舉「停止攬炒」的標語，望政府封關保障市民利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pJgCTj5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指議會內攬炒非目標-目標為爭雙普選&quot;&gt;余指議會內「攬炒」非目標 目標為爭雙普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章的主要訊息，余指是「議會內嘅抗爭，我哋可以做到啲咩……而議會外又有啲咩抗爭嘅手法」，並指出文中一段：「『攬炒』議會，爭取35席後為手段，然後全面否決所有政府提出的議案為目的，藉此觸發基本法第五十條，令特首宣佈解散立法會，制造憲政危機，此為制度內的『攬炒』。與此同時，制度外的『攬炒』就要透過組織『大三罷』，達成罷工、罷市、罷課，令社會停擺，務求煞停一切暴政，達致制度性的改革，再共同建構重光後的香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余解釋，議會內「攬炒」是要令政府付出代價，「佢唔可以任意通過佢想過嘅議案」；但同時市民和議員都要付出代價，可能失去「派糖」議案如消費券。惟余強調，「議會內嘅『攬炒』，唔係我想要嘅目標」，「我嘅最終目標係爭取到雙普選」，政府之後就可推行為民造福的政策，而非「惡法」和「大白象工程」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又預期在否決預算案前，「政府已經會同我哋傾」，因當立法會選舉結果一公布，「政府其實已經會睇到民主派係攞到幾多席，就等於我哋攞到幾多話語權」，談判亦會開始。李運騰問，即最好是民主派不用否決財案？余同意，重申罷工時曾講過無數次，「如果政府肯封關嘅話，醫護人員係唔會罷工。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指採取高姿態談判手法非恐嚇-指我哋從來都係有得傾&quot;&gt;余指採取高姿態談判手法非恐嚇 指「我哋從來都係有得傾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，余慧明提到爭取35席為「手段」，全面否決所有政府議案為「目的」，余承認「呢度係寫得唔好」，因其最終目的「唔係想要否決所有議案」，而是望煞停暴政，達致制度性改革。而她認為「暴政」是拒絕聆聽人民聲音、粗暴打壓人民、面對反對聲音時「解決方法係解決提出問題嘅人」、並推行違背港人意願的政策。石書銘問，她是形容施政態度抑或一個特定政府？余指是施政態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余文中亦指泛民主張的「又傾又砌」應畫上句號，她解釋過往泛民主派與政府談判時「意志唔夠堅定、好易作出退讓」，亦「好易比人睇穿佢嘅底牌」，舉例李國麟於2015年政府「綑綁式銷售」購買水炮車的財政預算案上曾投贊成，但余認為新一屆立法會應要由一些「意志比較堅定」的議員入立法會爭取五大訴求，令政府向市民問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q9pjjdd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李國麟（右一）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即余慧明認為就五大訴求不能退讓？余否認，指「我係採取一個高姿態嘅談判手法」。李運騰追問，即余會以「攬炒」的恐嚇（threat）迫使政府回應五大訴求？余說「呢個只係一個姿態，唔係一個恐嚇」，強調「我哋從來都係有得傾嘅，只不過係政府擺出一個高姿態。」李運騰問，那余的做法與「又傾又砌」有何分別？余指「我認為我嘅意志係會比佢哋更加堅定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問余會否讓步，余解釋：「我哋一直高舉住我哋要爭取五大訴求，但我認為最重要嘅係爭取到雙普選，因為只要爭取到雙普選之後，我認為其他嘅訴求都可以解決」，同意雙普選是她的底線。余續指，但何謂實行真普選，「依度係有得傾嘅，因為我知道雙普選唔會話叮一聲，第二日就變到出嚟畀我，但起碼我要政府畀到一個好實在嘅時間表畀我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余自言先砌後傾若政府拒絕談判會對預算案投反對票&quot;&gt;余自言「先砌後傾」、若政府拒絕談判會對預算案投反對票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，文章無明確表示她會與政府談判，因想向選民展示她會採取高姿態的行為作談判手段，「我會形容自己係先砌後傾」。陳仲衡指余沒有寫出來，余說「因為我怕咁樣寫出嚟呢，就會令到人哋覺得我同啲泛民冇分別囉」，陳志全、林卓廷和法官陳慶偉等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，但事實上余與泛民無分別？余說「我認為我自己會比佢哋企得更硬㗎」，指因泛民可因一些民生議題妥協，但她主要想向選民解釋「如果我哋制度上一日唔改變嘅話，我哋都搵唔到一個解決嘅方法」，並指「政治實際上操作，你係冇辦法避免傾呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉質疑她是欺騙公眾、玩文字遊戲，余說：「唔係呀，因為我真係會投反對票囉，係有啲泛民連反對票都唔敢投。」陳仲衡問余是談及預算案？余說：「係呀」，同意其底線就是雙普選。陳慶偉續問「先砌後傾」，即余會不論內容，先否決預算案？余不同意，指因對她而言「『砌』係擺出一個好高嘅姿態，事先宣揚我會反對一切議案」。陳慶偉指即她不會這樣做，余說「咁要視乎政府係採取咩態度回應囉」。陳問，若政府拒絕與他們談判，余會對預算案投反對票？余答：「係呀，會呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指憲政危機主導權從來在政府手無留意是戴耀廷主意&quot;&gt;余指「憲政危機」主導權從來在政府手、無留意是戴耀廷主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余另解釋，「憲政危機」是當民主派取得35席，政府仍拒回應民意，就會產生行政和立法機關的分歧局面，政府必須面對很大政治壓力，並要透過兩次否決預算案令特首解散立法會及下台的《基本法》機制解決。李運騰指那並非余自己想出來，她由其他地方讀到？余同意，重申是論壇和 Telegram 的討論，她自己也有看過《基本法》相關條文，但無留意是戴耀廷主意，並強調觸發憲政危機的主導權「從來都喺政府手入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指三罷是政府不回應訴求結果如政府願聽民意願停三罷與政府傾&quot;&gt;余指三罷是政府不回應訴求結果、如政府願聽民意願停三罷與政府傾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提及：「我與同伴萌生組織工會的念頭，希望團結有共同理念的同業，凝聚力量發動全民三罷，令社會停擺，向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴。」余解釋，「令社會停擺」是她想像全民三罷會發生的事，如巴士地鐵停駛、經濟活動停止。李運騰指余還談及罷課，基本上是日常生活停擺。余同意，但強調「呢樣嘢其實唔係我哋想見到，不過政府唔回應訴求嘅時候，呢個係最壞嘅結果囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余重申，文章主軸是要爭取五大訴求，「我會嘗試係用法律容嘅框架之下，作出我嘅抗爭。咁當然啦，如果政府係隨時聆聽民意嘅話，我哋係願意停止做呢啲三罷，而係同政府傾囉。但重點就係要政府放低佢嘅身段，放低佢傲慢嘅態度，嚟同我哋展開對話囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余控訴反修例無警員為警暴負責無官員問責下台-指林鄭應下台&quot;&gt;余控訴反修例無警員為警暴負責、無官員問責下台 指林鄭應下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴」，就向政權的控訴，余指2019年示威者上街示威，「換嚟嘅係政府越嚟越高壓嘅手段去鎮壓，然後同市民講，我哋要回復正常。」惟余指，「我認為依樣嘢唔可以得過且過，即係發生過嘅事，7.21、8.31、10.1，我哋真係唔可以好似政府咁話要向前看就 move on 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續說：「喺依場運動當中，冇一個政府官員要問責落台，亦冇一個警員要為自己嘅暴力行為負上責任，但同時間，已經有好多示威者被拘捕、被檢控，我認為依個係冇辦法接受嘅，我唔認為點解淨係市民一方要承受個代價」，因此她提「控訴」，是「我係願意嘗試用任何嘅方式，令到呢個政府係要直視民意囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於對醫管局的控訴，余指2019年，「佢要求我哋員工要政治中立，但係發生理大事件嘅時候，啲催淚彈水炮車喺QEH（伊利沙伯醫院）外面橫飛嘅時候，佢冇理過嗰度返工放工嘅員工嘅安全，佢亦都冇理過喺病房硬食TG嘅病人，只係擺幾部空氣清新機就算，佢從來冇對警暴作出任何譴責，我認為醫管局係企咗喺政權嘅一邊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;到了2020年，「我認為佢對於罷工嘅處理手法非常之差劣，隨後疫情嘅處理亦都反應好緩慢，佢係置公眾利益於不顧，所以我認為，人工比特首仲要高嘅醫管局行政總裁，應該喺疫情之後落台問責。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，那特首呢？她也應下台嗎？余說「依個我係認為係嘅」，重申「我爭取嘅雙普選，係要選出一個民選嘅政府」，因林鄭當時並非民選政權。石書銘一度問，余曾提到7.21、8.31、10.1，認為法庭應知悉，惟陳慶偉打斷表示不關心，陳仲衡亦指只會留意相關的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgBrAga.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。余慧明表示，認為在政府漠視民意、與市民僵持不下的情況下，制度上的變革，即透過一人一票選出立法會和特首的「真普選」，可反映民意並解決困局，並強調雙普選從來都是《基本法》承諾。法官陳慶偉聞言以英國脫歐為例，指支持和反對者相差甚微，難言政府是反映所有人民意；又指民主制度不一定要普選，有國家並非實行普選也不會被視為較不民主，舉例英國首相並非由普選產生，上議院亦毫不民主，何桂藍聞言大笑。余慧明回應，起碼外國可辦公投彰顯民意，「我哋連公投都冇」；又指英國議會也有很多議員是民選，惟香港在「完善選舉制度」下的議會，直選議席更少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱破局為以雙普選突破政府市民僵局強調為基本法承諾&quot;&gt;余稱「破局」為以雙普選突破政府市民僵局、強調為《基本法》承諾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明續作供，就2020年3月於《獨媒》刊出的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉一文，提及「要破局，必須由制度上的變革開始，甚至把制度推倒重來也在所不惜。今年立法會選舉可能是破舊立新的好時機」，被問「破局」意思，余解釋當時政府和市民爭持不下，政府漠視民意、以暴力鎮壓人民，市民就用暴力回應武力鎮壓，余不想見到此僵持局面，故望尋求突破，並認為制度上的變革，即她一直很想追求的「真普選」，「係可以解決依個困局。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指將「制度推倒重來」，是因現時制度不夠好，政府和立法會未能完全反映民意，故望以雙普選的新制度取代舊制度，即一人一票選出特首和立法會議員。惟余強調，「呢個新嘅制度，從來都係《基本法》承諾，而唔係我自己突然間變出嚟想要嘅」，形容是在《基本法》合法制度內爭取「一個制度嘅重置」，「唔係一個武力、亦都唔係一個制度之外嘅 mechanism。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，若余只是望在制度框架內改革，為何提及在所不惜把制度推倒重來。余強調，其意思並非將香港整個制度、即三權分立的局面推倒重來，只是希望特首和立法會議席均透過普選產生，特首仍須中央任命、向中央負責，但同時「都要向下面嘅市民負責任」。余亦指，推倒重來與香港是中國的一部分、及中央政府權力架構無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱真普選可反映民意-官指英首相亦非普選產生&quot;&gt;余稱真普選可反映民意 官指英首相亦非普選產生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「比起追求假希望，不如尋求真『攬炒』，或許才會為香港帶來一線生機」，余解釋假希望是即使市民「乜都唔做」，政府也會突然作出妥協、「突然回應晒五大訴求」，但她認為這機會是零；而尋求真「攬炒」就是在議會內外的攬炒，望令政府受壓，面對「堅持己見」或「順應民意」的局面。李運騰問即「攬炒」是可能？余指認為要到政府拒絕聆聽民意，「好極端嘅狀態」下才會發生。李追問基於余的描述，政府當時還不夠極端嗎？余說：「如果係夠極端嘅話，應該真係出現咗大三罷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說還有一個可能，就是不是所有人都同意余的立場。余表示明白，因此認為追求真普選是解決公平性問題的方法，因支持追求民主和五大訴求的人，應可揀選較貼近民主派的特首；但若局勢轉變便可能揀選建制派特首，「正正就係反映緊民意」。陳慶偉問，所以余是追求更民主的制度？余說「當然」。陳慶偉指那不一定是普選，指「更民主」可以指除普選外的任何東西，余回應「但係我暫時淨係認為普選先至可以解決到嗰個局勢嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳說香港的情況是這樣，因《基本法》寫明普選，但也有國家沒有實行普選，但不會視為較不民主。余回應視乎政府施政態度，「如果佢係可以真正反映民意嘅……」，不過陳慶偉打斷說那很困難，指就英國脫歐公投，支持和反對兩者相差不足1%，無論如何也不能說政府反映所有市民的民意，指是互相讓步（give and take）和制度的問題。余說：「但起碼外國有個公投可以令到民意得以彰顯，我哋連公投都冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指只是以此為例子，他不記得英國曾辦過多少次公投，又說「例如在英國，首相並非由普選產生」，被告欄的何桂藍聞言即大笑出聲，再以手掩口。陳續指，英國國會分為上議院和下議院，但上議院毫不民主（by no means democratic）；但亦指他同意余，在香港的情況，《基本法》列明最終會有普選。余表示明白，但指「人哋個議會都有好多議員係民選出嚟啦」。陳慶偉指下議院當然全部民選，但上議院不然，余再說：「我哋完善選舉制度之後嘅議會，直選議席係更加少。」辯方續就其他問題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，2016年的英國脫歐公投，支持脫歐為51.89%，支持留下為48.11%，兩者相差3.78%。而英國採用直接選舉制，由議員選出約650個下議院議員，如一個黨擁有絕對多數議員，該黨將組成下屆政府，該黨黨魁會成為首相。至於英國上議院有約780名議員，他們非經選舉產生，包括神職人員和貴族，但權力較下議院小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱2019年後功能組別不可只着眼業界利益應將港人利益擺先&quot;&gt;余稱2019年後功能組別不可只着眼業界利益、應將港人利益擺先&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，余表示文中一個很重要的訊息，就是鼓勵擁有功能組別資格的選民，由超區轉回功能組別，解釋因4月2日是申請的限期。陳仲衡關注文中哪處提及，余引述她提到：「所有立法會議會席位包括功能組別都不再屬於某界別利益，而應向全港市民問責」，又指「如果要爭取個話語權，梗係攞到越多席位越好啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，該句看來是着選民不應只看業界利益。余同意，指在立法會普選下，所有議席均應由直選產生。李追問，似乎余是指她投票時或會違背業界利益，因認為那代表更大更廣的公眾利益？余同意，指「經歷過2019年社會事件之後，我認為即使係功能組別都唔可以淨係着眼於自己嘅業界利益」，功能組別「應該要將香港人嘅利益擺先」，而其後訪問也有提到若業界利益與公眾有矛盾時會如何投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指光復香港是真正實行港人治港&quot;&gt;余指「光復香港」是真正實行港人治港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就文中提到：「這是一個考驗耐性與決心的時代，要進行這場時代革命，就看大家對光復香港有多大耐性與決心。」余表示由2019年開始，「我哋一直爭取制度上嘅改革，係一場革命」，故稱呼該場運動為「時代革命」。至於「光復香港」，余形容是「令到以香港人優先、真正實行港人治港高度自治方針嘅香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians often left their homes with only the clothes on their backs and a small bag — an all-too-common experience in a world experiencing record high levels of forced displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, unlike many other displaced populations, almost all Ukrainians were able to bring their smartphones, a near-unmatched level of tech savviness, and supportive, tightly woven online networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connectivity has presented new opportunities to assist vulnerable people; it has also put those same vulnerable people face-to-face with new online threats that can translate into very real physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-digital-connectivity&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Digital Connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HPh8yEO.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitization has always been central to President Zelensky’s vision of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises surrounding digitization served a critical role in his almost entirely virtual campaign. At the time, it was seen as a way to both fight corruption and engage the country’s younger generation. However, the long-term impacts of his administration’s efforts in this area can be seen both in the success of the war effort and in the options now open to displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just months after Zelensky’s election in 2019, the Ukrainian government established the Ministry of Digital Transformation — a trailblazing effort to transform government through the creation of the “state in a smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the goal of making 100 percent of government services available online by 2024, the Ministry of Digital Transformation quickly mobilized to launch Diia — meaning “action” — a mobile app and web platform centralizing citizen access to public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Ukraine became the first country in the world to issue digital passports through Diia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After February 2022, the Ukrainian government worked to ensure that Ukraine’s digital connections were both protected and strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IbsCOiN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky’s administration has partnered with Starlink, the European Union, and European telecom companies to ensure that Ukrainians maintain internet connection during the war. This has been essential to countering Russian attempts to control information flows about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining internet access is also critical to ensure that displaced Ukrainians — both within Ukraine and across international borders — are able to access to public services, personal networks, and aid resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stabilizing-connections&quot;&gt;Stabilizing Connections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yDkjb0Z.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ukraine’s level of digital connectedness has spurred new opportunities and innovations to aid displaced Ukrainians across several critical areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraines-diia-app&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Diia App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed with the motto, “the government in a smartphone,” Diia has brought essential public resources to the fingertips of Ukrainians both within and outside of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched in 2020, Diia was downloaded on the phones of one-third of the adult Ukrainian population by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diia has been at the center of the digital effort to aid Ukrainians. As of May 2023, 70 percent of Ukrainian-owned smartphones have Diia installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through Diia, Ukrainians can register as displaced and have access to digital forms of the identification document that they need to cross borders. They can also provide digital signatures on official documents using biometrics, pay taxes and fines, collect cash payments, receive compensation for damaged property, donate to the war effort, register a child or a business, report information about Russian troops, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internet-and-connectivity&quot;&gt;Internet and Connectivity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stable and secure internet connections have been critical to keeping Ukrainians connected with resources, aid, and their digital networks during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink, a satellite constellation that provides internet coverage to countries across the world, has been critical to ensure that Ukrainians — as well as Ukrainian hospitals, energy sources, educational institutions, and businesses — have access to fast and stable internet. Starlink was also responsible for restoring internet connection in cities such as Irpin, Bucha, Borodyanka, and Chernihiv.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nokia, in partnership with the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation, started a project to modernize internet networks across Ukraine, ensuring that Ukrainians and Ukrainian institutions retained internet access in the face of physical bombardment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Commission and the European Parliament coordinated with European telecom providers to reduce costs or freely provide roaming and international calling within the European Union and Ukraine for displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;services-and-assistance&quot;&gt;Services and Assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many Ukrainians having to quickly flee their homes, a number of different platforms have been created to connect displaced Ukrainians to key information, assistance, and aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Alarm app by Ajax Systems serves as a digital air raid siren that helps provide safety warnings to all Ukrainians with smart phones even if municipal air raid sirens are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) online dashboards outline key information about each refugee-receiving country, so that Ukrainian refugees have information on how to access public services and aid and how to report fraud and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Host governments have similarly created online platforms for Ukrainian refugees seeking assistance, including the “Dopomoha,” platform launched by the Romanian and Moldovan governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNHCR’s system also allows Ukrainians to register with their biometric data to collect cash aid payments at ATMs across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;housing&quot;&gt;Housing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of online platforms have been created to match Ukrainian refugees with short- and long-term housing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online projects have been started by many companies and organizations to match Ukrainian refugees with short- and long-term housing opportunities, including  betterplace.org, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Station F (France), Wunderflats (Germany), EU4UA, Prykhystok, Ukraine Now, HomesforUkraine.eu (Austria), Casafari, Shelter UKR, TakecareBnB, Icanhelp.host, and UkraineTakeShelter.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help aid organizations prioritize where to work, some projects are collecting comprehensive data on displacement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix has tracked internal displacement data in order to create a more accurate picture of the state of internal displacement in Ukraine to aid the IOM’s and other aid organizations’ efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supplies-and-resources&quot;&gt;Supplies and Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations are focused on distributing essential supplies such as food, water, shelter materials, and power banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects such as the Ukrainian Defense Fund and Gorillas have created apps to collect and distribute supplies on the ground to people within Ukraine and in areas with high numbers of Ukrainian refugees, such as across the Polish border.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other projects, such as Lifesaver and Techfugees, have focused on providing more specific supplies — power banks — ensuring that Ukrainians can maintain mobile access even when power is out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;Transportation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of different platforms have been created to help displaced Ukrainians travel safely to their desired destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Techfugees, in partnership with Citizens of Our Planet and Chili Piper, has created a detailed virtual guide for Ukrainians on transportation options for traveling within Ukraine or to cross international borders into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies such as Uber and Flixbus have offered free trips for refugees — especially around the Ukraine-Poland border.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing apps such as Uklon  and BlaBlaCar have worked to organize carpools for Ukrainians fleeing the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;employment&quot;&gt;Employment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many Ukrainians out of work due to the war, online platforms have been created to help connect displaced Ukrainians with job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those looking to work in tech, Employ Ukraine seeks to match Ukrainians with tech positions in EU companies and allows the companies to pay them directly through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google created a $5 million fund to provide cash awards and Google support to Ukrainian start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;education-and-culture&quot;&gt;Education and Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain a sense of normalcy, some organizations are utilizing online tools to connect displaced Ukrainians with educational and cultural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Laptops for Ukraine” is an EU initiative to collect and distribute laptops and smartphones for schools as well as other public institutions to ensure that public service provision can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Levebee was funded by the European Union to serve as an app to support the continued education of Ukrainian children during the war. Children can learn math, languages, and other subjects remotely on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In light of the destruction of parts of Ukraine during the war, the European Competence Centre for Cultural Heritage (4CH) created the Supporting Ukrainian Monuments Initiative, which digitizes and preserves Ukrainian culture online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missed-connections&quot;&gt;Missed Connections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cKIVAq3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As comprehensive as the digital platforms helping displaced Ukrainians are, certain demographics are at risk of being left behind as they try to access vital resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of organizations have found that elderly people have struggled to adjust to the mass proliferation of digital tools. A UNDP report found a significant digital divide across different age groups in Ukraine, with over 46 percent of older Ukrainians reporting in early 2022 that they never use the internet. Another study found that 53 percent of Ukrainians have a “below average” level of digital skills — an issue that has become a central focus for the Diia.Education team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, people with irregular status are unable to register for Diia, as the user’s information must be registered with the Ukrainian immigration system to gain access to the app. Moreover, users need a Ukrainian bank account and a taxpayer number in order to go through the identification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequentially, as discussed in a recent CSIS piece, stateless persons in Ukraine are also unable to use the app because they lack any proof of nationality, birth certificates, passports, or residence permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, according to an interview with a civil society organization conducting programming in Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens who reside in Russian-occupied territories such as the Donetsk and Luhansk regions cannot safely use Diia. Using Diia could put them at risk while under Russian occupation, as doing so would mean that they admit to retaining Ukrainian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap in availability of services and centralized information puts people already vulnerable to exploitation at additional risk of being left out of assistance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-exploitation&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/razAFfz.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Ukrainians navigate their journey away from the conflict, the same access to digital information that facilitated their escape can also leave them vulnerable to dangers just as real as those they left back home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-trafficking&quot;&gt;I. Trafficking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors with malicious intentions have also capitalized on this proliferation of new digital platforms designed to help Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine faced high levels of human trafficking, as both an origin and destination country for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN migration agency, over 300,000 Ukrainians have been victims of human trafficking since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men, women, and children are all at risk of trafficking, including forced labor, forced sex work, and forced begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via kidnapping or coercive recruitment, victims are frequently trafficked to various locations around Europe and Eurasia, such as Russia, Poland, Iraq, Spain, and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as displaced Ukrainians are using digital tech to help them navigate complex journeys, traffickers are becoming more adept at using these resources to identify, mislead, and capture people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2022 a Europol-sponsored hackathon identified at least 30 online platforms created to exploit Ukrainian refugees, 10 of which explicitly targeted them for trafficking. In May 2022 an EMPACT action day monitored 125 online platforms, leading to the identification of nine suspected human traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a PBS report showed evidence of online listings for rent-free housing in exchange for sex work and housework, as well as scam online advertising for intermediaries who claim to help with immigration paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the moderators for Facebook groups established to match Ukrainian refugees with resources — including housing arrangements — have witnessed potential traffickers attempting to contact vulnerable people, particularly women traveling alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the proliferation of online aid networks has opened a new portal for traffickers to target, locate, and capture displaced Ukrainians in search of assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ii-misuse-of-information&quot;&gt;II. Misuse of Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generalized lack of trust in available information, combined with complex, confusing, or missing language on official government websites has driven people to overly rely on peer-to-peer information seeking through informal channels. Many of these platforms, such as Facebook, Telegram, and WhatsApp are particularly susceptible to mis- and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign actors — including the Russian state — use these networks to spread false information. During the March 2022 invasion, a variety of popular Telegram channels spread false information claiming that Russia had taken critical Ukrainian cities. Soon after the March 2022 invasion, Russian actors used social media platforms to attempt to discredit reports about their attack on a Mariupol hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many small organizations and startups created their own online platforms in the wake of the invasion but failed to keep them updated. While likely unintentional, the proliferation of online information sources resulted in “digital litter” — an abundance of broken links and websites with outdated or false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People trying to plan how to flee Ukraine, find resources, or locate employment opportunities must sort through outdated, unclear, or even false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iii-cybercrime&quot;&gt;III. Cybercrime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad actors see opportunity in vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is filled with scammers, hackers, and websites that seek to take advantage of people in search of jobs, legal assistance, or humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, nine people were arrested for operating over 400 phishing sites claiming to offer financial benefits to Ukrainians. They are estimated to have stolen over $3,360,000 from approximately 5,000 victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People receiving displaced people in their homes have also become targets online. Fraud schemes, including fake financial assistance for hosts, fake donation websites, and illegitimate fundraising campaigns have led people in host countries to send money directly to scammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some host countries are worried that malign actors are using unknowing hosts to gather sensitive data about refugees from Ukraine. For example, government officials in Poland, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom have warned of fake letters circulating on social media asking hosts of Ukrainian refugees to share personal information about their guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iv-toxic-online-narratives-and-hate-speech&quot;&gt;IV. Toxic Online Narratives and Hate Speech&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the invasion, there has been an uptick in hate speech acts propagated via social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023 there were reports of anti-Ukrainian narratives circulating through Polish Twitter, with some tweets using xenophobic hashtags. A study by the Centre for Information Resilience concluded that compared to previous years, 2022 saw an increase in the use of nationalistic slurs against Ukrainians on Twitter and Telegram, including from verified blue-check accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegram channels dehumanizing the plight of Ukrainians and distributing hateful and disturbing media — sometimes depicting corpses or attacks alongside hateful narrations and captions — were identified as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These practices can be both a root cause of forced displacement and a protection threat to the displaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, these narratives can cause potential host communities to reject migrants; in others, they might lead refugees to be more reticent to accept aid from legitimate sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogue actors have successfully exploited online platforms to promote trafficking and cybercrimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the use of mis- and disinformation and the proliferation of toxic online narratives and hate speech can be prevented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-protection&quot;&gt;Digital Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QpL89Gn.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even as the war wages on, actors making use of digital tools can work to support the safety and integrity of information and services provided to displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-fight-cybercrime&quot;&gt;I. Fight Cybercrime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid actors implementing digital programming should work to train refugees and volunteers on how to spot and combat suspicious activity online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, UNHCR, according to interviews, is conducting training on digital issues with its staff in Ukraine. IOM Ukraine has similarly taken an innovative approach to training displaced Ukrainians on how to spot online threats. IOM developed two online games (one targeted at children and one at adults) where users engage in a “quest,” making a series of difficult decisions mirroring the experiences and threats faced by displaced Ukrainians during the war. At the end of the game, the pros and cons of each decision are explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping users learn to make smarter decisions about whom to trust when on the move, IOM’s platform has also been used to offer current information — including a road map — on best practices for displaced persons. However, while the game itself is digital, it does not address the threats that Ukrainian refugees are likely to encounter in the digital landscape. This gap has at least partially been filled by the Diia.Education team, which developed online guides and simulators walking Ukrainians through combating human trafficking, promoting online safety for children and elderly populations, and implementing best practices for cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ii-improve-vetting-for-digital-programming&quot;&gt;II. Improve Vetting for Digital Programming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations must implement stringent vetting procedures for aid and programming that is organized or advertised online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNHCR has already started upping vetting procedures for volunteers and discouraging beneficiaries from accepting help from unregistered volunteers. Similarly, Airbnb.org — the company’s nonprofit arm — implemented a vetting procedure to review hosts before they were matched with displaced Ukrainians. Still, the vetting procedures of various organizations, including Airbnb, have been criticized as falling short of what is necessary to truly protect the displaced, in part because they did not include substantive background checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing a comprehensive vetting process is often laborious for an aid organization and can slow down aid dispersal. However, it is critical to ensure that aid programs do not place the displaced directly in harm’s way. Similarly, although efforts to individually vet volunteers and share locations are smart practice, the onus should not be on vulnerable displaced persons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iii-reduce-digital-litter&quot;&gt;III. Reduce Digital Litter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital litter leads displaced persons to rely on misleading or unavailable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both governments and other actors should work to clear the web of outdated portals and simplify language online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organizations and researchers are now aware that the abundance of unusable links and outdated information online represents an important downside to using the digital space to distribute information. There are many in the tech space who are willing to volunteer to clear digital litter if the right campaigns are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, social media influencers and actors should be urged to carefully date and archive any information they publish and, should efforts cease, be responsible for clearing their digital footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many of these independent platforms are born out of a need for clearer information and conciseness, governments should work toward simplifying their website language, date and update content, display information in different languages and dialects, establish Q&amp;amp;A sections in their portals, and enable chatbots or a channel for feedback and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iv-work-with-ukrainian-civil-society-to-create-trust&quot;&gt;IV. Work with Ukrainian Civil Society to Create Trust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If digital programming is going to be effective, displaced Ukrainians must be able to trust the information they find online. Actors should look to campaigns created in other contexts to create a campaign promoting trust in credible online information. Notably, lessons could be taken from the “Confía en el Jaguar” campaign — launched by UNHCR and Facebook in Mexico in 2016 — which used the symbol of the jaguar to mark trustworthy migration information available through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, IOM created a Telegram hotline for Ukrainians looking to quickly verify online information. By scanning a QR code, users are taken to a Telegram chat room, linked with a hotline where users can engage with a real person in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNHCR has similarly launched a pilot of its messaging service (first piloted in Ecuador in 2020), offering frequently updated automated responses to aid queries. The platform also functions to connect refugees with specialized staff to help them answer questions that cannot be answered by the messaging service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working proactively to fight cybercrime, improve vetting procedures, reduce digital litter, and create trust in online information, state and non-state actors alike have the opportunity to develop a virtual world where displaced Ukrainians can thrive, despite the realities of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-digital-future&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Digital Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ahDpG6d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the world has rallied to support Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital innovations like Diia have rightly been celebrated as a means to keep Ukrainian refugees connected, despite the devastation caused by the ongoing Russian war of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a proliferation of digital resources and aid has translated to a growth of new, unmoderated platforms. While many of these initiatives were created with good intentions, many also lack the controls to prevent exploitation. Global actors should take care to avoid creating opportunities for malicious actors to exploit digitally connected — yet still vulnerable — displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Ukrainian refugees are getting smart about their interactions online and implementing their own vetting procedures. But they shouldn’t have to do this work alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and aid organizations seeking to use digital tools to help Ukrainians have a responsibility to engage in digital protection and to consider all of the uses — and misuses — of the platforms and resources they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine pushes forward toward the end of the war, the decisions made today about the country’s digital space have the opportunity to shape its reconstruction process. Building a safer digital space now means that Ukraine will be all the more ready to embrace a truly digital future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of cyber war hyperbole, unhelpful headlines such as Newsweek’s “The Rising Risk of a Cyber Pearl Harbour” in 2021 usually grab the everyday reader’s attention but limit our understanding of the far more important dimension of these cyber incidents: how states and non-state actors use cyberspace below the threshold of war to further their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when scrolling down The New York Times’s tag on “cyberwarfare”, most of the reporting concentrates on espionage and activities such as information operations and subversion – which in practice, is a more accurate reflection of what goes on in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the jury is still out on alternative concepts to “cyber war” that can appropriately capture the effects of cyber operations below the threshold of armed conflict and how they might transform intelligence activities. The book Deter, Disrupt or Deceive: Assessing Cyber Conflict as an Intelligence Contest offers some options – although it does not seek to be conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent is it worth considering that states are actually involved in a continuous “intelligence contest” in cyberspace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-a-trap-reassessing-the-vocabulary&quot;&gt;It’s a Trap! Reassessing the Vocabulary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ongoing war in Ukraine has illustrated, the obsession with the concept of “cyber war” is not just about the latest news headlines; rather, it has resulted in deep miscalculations about the role of cyber operations in conflict and crisis scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first miscalculation from the hyperbole around “cyber war” is the heightened expectations of what cyber operations can and should deliver. Having been known for numerous disruptive cyber incidents, Russia’s cyber operations at the outbreak of the war in Ukraine were commonly depicted as contrary to expectations. There was no widespread or particularly significant impact from Russian destructive cyber operations, no cyber takedown of Ukrainian critical national infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exemplifies how “cyber war” can also fail to grasp how effects are shaped by a culture of strategic doctrine – as is particularly the case with Russia’s conceptualisation of cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the focus on decisive and short-term effects of cyber operations, especially in conflict situations, has also led to a paradoxical dismissal of the cumulative effects that operations have as part of a wider contest between state and non-state actors. Russian cyber activity during the war has still revealed a largely unprecedented deployment of capabilities, with at least nine new wiper malware families, two ransomware attacks and the targeting of 100 organisations in Ukraine. According to companies such as ESET, Microsoft, Mandiant and other large threat intelligence companies, Russia has used a record amount of data-destroying malware on Ukraine, showcasing an accelerated pace of deployment of cyber capabilities in conflict scenarios. This in turn has also contributed to the reuse of many of these capabilities in at least other 25 countries, which showcases the cascading effects of sub-threshold capabilities. Despite these numbers – and within this particular context – cyber operations have not been the decisive or primary tool in the conflict. They have, however, contributed to the broader friction of war – be it in the operation of infrastructure, communication or leveraging the information space to push their narratives about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-intelligence-contests&quot;&gt;On Intelligence Contests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American University Professor Joshua Rovner suggests that activities in cyberspace are more about intelligence than the use of force. He argues that strategic behaviour in cyberspace will rarely surpass the threshold of armed conflict, but states will continuously engage in an “intelligence contest” through sabotage and covert action. Rovner defines the intelligence contest as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A race among adversaries to collect more and better information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A race to exploit information to improve one’s relative position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reciprocal effort to covertly undermine adversary morale, institutions and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A contest to disable adversary capabilities through sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A campaign to preposition assets for intelligence collection in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Countries recognise the importance of having an institution to engage in cyber operations – but it does not mean that all do so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the concept seeks to illustrate is that the dynamics of contestation among states in cyberspace extend far beyond the tactics of cyber operations and the battlefield itself, and play into strategic competition among state and non-state actors. As noted by the UK’s National Cyber Force (NCF), while cyber operations are not expected to be strategically decisive, they are effective when “combined and co-ordinated with the activities of partners to achieve a shared goal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies as much to cyber security as it does to offensive cyber. One example of the former is that in May 2023, Ukraine, Ireland, Iceland and Japan announced that they would officially join NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence. While the deal opens the door for greater exchange between NATO and non-NATO countries, the occasion sends a relevant message of expanding technical and strategic alignment between countries in the face of growing geopolitical contestation in the Indo-Pacific and amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive cyber capabilities should be seen as part of a much wider policy toolkit to respond to hostile activities in cyberspace. Likewise, offensive cyber capabilities can be used to respond to other threats such as terrorism, disinformation or child sexual exploitation. In short, a cyber incident does not necessarily merit a cyber response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, approximately 45 countries have launched military cyber organisations (that is, cyber commands) and nearly 35 of those possess an offensive mandate. While capacities and capabilities vary, both Western and non-Western countries recognise the importance of having an institution to engage in this contested environment – but it does not mean that all do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies vary as to how countries engage in this contest. The US Cyber Command, which defends the Department of Defense’s information systems, supports joint force commanders with cyberspace operations, and defends the US from significant cyberattacks, has developed complementary concepts of “defend forward” and “persistent engagement”. Meanwhile, the UK’s NCF has published a document outlining operating principles for its own approach to offensive cyber which is in line with a broader vision outlined in the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh to deter, defend and compete across all domains. Central to the NCF’s approach is the doctrine of “cognitive effect”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should we then consider “intelligence contest” as the most accurate means of defining the nature of cyber operations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of the concept have argued that the scale and scope of operations in cyberspace fundamentally change the nature of intelligence (especially covert action), resulting in a “difference in kind and not merely degree”. As some have argued, the 2016 Russian interference during the US elections shows that smaller activities can result in aggregated strategic effects – eroding trust and confidence in society. So, what are the consequences of framing cyber operations as an intelligence contest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-operations--long-road-ahead&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Operations – Long Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk when intelligence becomes the main qualifier to describe the nature of cyber operations is that it could alter public perceptions on what activities their government is conducting in cyberspace. Public understanding may also differ depending upon the oversight mechanisms in place within a particular national context. The outcome of framing cyber operations around intelligence activities could be for better or worse, depending upon the national context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cyber might play a significantly different role depending on the respective country’s primary threat concern&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UK has a detailed regulatory framework when it comes to intelligence activity. In addition, the NCF’s recent guide outlines the importance of robust oversight and accountability as a core element for responsible operational planning – a key part of our latest project at RUSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, less capable states contract cyber mercenaries for easier access to opportunities in developing and deploying capabilities. While commercial hacking tools have legitimate applications in support of national security and law enforcement objectives, they are also subject to misuse and abuse. As of 2023, 74 countries have reportedly used spyware and between 2015 and 2017, and EU member states have allowed surveillance technology to be exported more than 317 times. It is not always the case that states will contract well-known spyware vendors either – there is a complex market of companies promoting open-source intelligence tools that can be coupled with other sophisticated add-ons and services. In this regard, the intelligence contest concept does not help with addressing these kinds of dynamics. Instead of clarifying what kinds of intelligence activities are permissible, it overemphasises state-to-state spying rather than domestic activities – usually more appealing to less developed economies that can buy off-the-shelf products to meet their internal needs. What is then the applicability of the intelligence contest? To whom does this concept apply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the motivations of countries beyond the usual cyber powers in developing and deploying cyber capabilities. As illustrated by Saudi Arabia, Mexico, India and many other Western and non-Western countries, it might be more profitable for countries to develop their own cyber capabilities to conduct surveillance of citizens within their own national territory and abroad than to primarily do it among states. As states across the development spectrum enhance their capabilities, cyber might play a significantly different role depending on the respective country’s primary threat concern – which in turn will also affect how they engage in strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries might also be influenced by the NCF’s guide on cyber operations, as it provides some initial thoughts for establishing processes and guidance relating to cyber operations. However, there is a risk that some countries will see cyber operations as intelligence activity only, to be conducted against a foreign or external threat. A different and more worrying scenario takes place when countries seek to aggressively use capabilities against internal threats, with little oversight, as has been the case with commercial hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-contest-for-a-few&quot;&gt;A Contest for a Few?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial and yet overlooked question within this debate is: “who can engage in this intelligence contest?” While many countries have developed cyber commands and have sought to enhance their capabilities, the intelligence contest still arguably remains a game to be played by a small group of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be too much to assume that countries beyond the pool of cyber powers can effectively achieve significant cumulative effects through cyberspace in conjunction with other diplomatic and/or commercial strategies, despite their eagerness to outsource capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the 45 countries that have established military cyber organisations (and others) will continue to search for other levers to develop their own capacities, away from cyber. It is also questionable how applicable and operationalisable the intelligence contest in cyberspace is for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, how the term “intelligence contest” increases the understanding of cyber operations remains unclear. There are geographical, capability and conceptual challenges as well as consequences of the framing that require further assessment. Regardless, it is better than using the term “cyber war” to define state activity in cyberspace – although whether that is enough is yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-legacy-of-collaboration-at-risk&quot;&gt;A Legacy of Collaboration at Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In West Africa, a new breed of rice that can withstand flooding and drought has allowed farmers to triple their productivity, improving local economies and feeding thousands of people. In regions from South America to Scotland, new green technologies are generating an abundance of clean energy. And in Southeast Asia, hundreds of millions of children have been protected from deadly Japanese encephalitis through life-saving vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these projects is contributing significantly to the collective future of humans and the planet. And all of them hinge on partnerships in health, technology, and business between the United States and its greatest strategic rival: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Green Super Rice feeding thousands in West Africa, for example. It leverages 40 years of Chinese research on rice seeds accelerated with the financial muscle of U.S. philanthropy. Meanwhile, China’s ability to develop and produce low-cost vaccines — for safeguarding the health of its own enormous population as well as supporting millions in the Global South — has been bolstered by know-how and support from the West, particularly through global health research collaborations, assistance with regulatory reforms, and the navigation of global qualification and distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples, but a tiny sample of social impact collaborations underway around the world, remind us that endeavors advancing human health and development often fall beyond the purview of any single country; multinational and multisectoral partnerships are increasingly required. Specifically, they underscore the importance of continued engagement by two of the world’s greatest economic and technological powers, as well as the need to find ways to continue such collaborations in smart, informed, geopolitically sensitive, and mutually beneficial models. Truly game-changing innovations and opportunities with great social impact are within reach; and yet, many will depend on initiating, continuing, or expanding collaborations between partners in the United States and China to augment the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this reality sits alongside stark and uncontestable truths: that the relationship between the United States and China over the past 10 years has worsened to one of its lowest historical ebbs, that policy and national sentiment have negatively reshaped the countries’ perceptions of — and working exchanges with — each other, and that we are in an era of aggressive competition that threatens progress in some of this work. As the trajectory of this new great power competition continues to play out, what will happen to the substantial historical legacy of partnership between these two nations on issues of critical social impact? Will it be possible for would-be collaborators on either side of the Pacific to navigate these rocky waters without being immobilized by political risk, thwarted by sanctions, or hamstrung by the potential for reputational damage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. Between global climate change, food insecurity, and the very real threat of future pandemics, humanity is facing truly existential challenges. Against that backdrop, it is imperative to examine these opportunities and constraints, then reimagine new mechanisms and narratives — safe harbors — where China and the United States can continue to leverage their collective expertise for the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores the reasons such a dialogue is needed, the risks at play, and some options for moving forward. Its aim is not to wish away deeply competitive features of the U.S.-China relationship, but rather to accept that these dynamics will persist and then generate understanding of and support for actively reimagining U.S.-China transnational collaborations in key areas of development. It seeks to advance thinking around ways to identify and pursue opportunities that support U.S. interests for multilateral social impact projects with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is imperative to examine these opportunities and constraints, then reimagine new mechanisms and narratives — safe harbors — where China and the United States can continue to leverage their collective expertise for the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not take an expert to appreciate that the relationship between China and the United States is among the most complex, fraught, and critical on earth. Nor does this paper suggest that U.S. policies toward China — or vice versa — are misguided. Quite the contrary. Albeit without access to much of the intelligence behind the current stances, this is written with full awareness of the many potential threats that each nation perceives in the other. Acknowledging the realities — and the fact that aggressive competition between these two powers is only likely to increase — this essay proposes that we need a new set of principles and mechanisms to guide continued collaboration among scientists and activists in health, climate, food security, and humanitarian relief. The well-being of the world depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-journey-toward-global-development-impact&quot;&gt;China’s Journey toward Global Development Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among confrontational policies, rhetoric, and media coverage, it is easy to lose sight of or underappreciate China’s historical and current role in global development. In part, China’s work in countries across much of the Global South, with deep roots in the “South-South” brotherhood of developing economies starting back in the 1950s, is hard to track or understand. China’s historical role in global aid and development has often been opaque — deeply tied to its political interests in specific countries, often delivered as part of infrastructure or other economic packages, and generally done through bilateral (state-to-state) mechanisms or as part of larger investment deals. Without delving into a discourse on China’s philosophy and approach to global development, of which there are many, suffice it to say that China has taken a very different route from the West. Most notably, China has been slow to embrace multilateral initiatives (through large multicountry organizations) or to actively participate in large globally coordinated development or humanitarian initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the many strands of China’s international collaboration have knitted together a clear commitment and broad narrative that are increasingly notable in terms of their scale and political importance. A range of bilateral scientific projects in health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and climate greatly expanded in the 1990s through the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at global health as an example, U.S.-China collaboration quickly expanded after the two countries’ relations were normalized in 1979, particularly through exchanges and knowledge sharing with experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who worked with partner organizations to lay the health infrastructure groundwork that led to the establishment of China’s own CDC in 2001. With support from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and coordination from regulatory authorities like the World Health Organization (WHO), China has become an essential linchpin in helping to eradicate polio through vaccine production and monitoring systems. China has also played a major role in combating tuberculosis (TB) and malaria — two of the world’s top infectious killers — by working with the World Bank, the British Department for International Development, Japan, the Netherlands, the WHO, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and other international NGOs to dramatically cut infection rates through improved detection, technology, and treatment. Altogether, China’s work on TB has benefited some 668 million people, prompting the World Bank’s lead economist studying health in East Asia to call it “one of the most successful TB projects ever seen.” China also brought lessons learned in the fight against malaria to Africa. Its research program to find new treatments for malaria led to the discovery of artemisinin, now the basis of the world’s most effective antimalarial drugs. Overall, in the words of Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme, China’s healthcare advancements have had a global “ripple effect.” This success was not solely the result of international aid. China’s spending on research and development in 2017 — at $200 billion — was nearly seven times its investment just a decade earlier, much of it in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these collaborations have taken on a different tone and approach in the past decade. President Xi Jinping has embarked on an aggressive campaign to build China’s geopolitical influence, especially with the Global South, and has placed global health and development as a critical piece of that work. Such initiatives include a broad set of mechanisms, and approaches include the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for infrastructure development involving 70 countries across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa; the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral cooperative making social-improvement loans available to 91 member nations; and, more recently, a Global Development Initiative to aid nations’ continued recovery from the economic devastations of Covid-19. In his 2021 speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Xi explicitly stated that China would use its growing global influence to further the public good in science, food security, and other areas, calling on the world community to join in renewing a shared commitment to balanced, inclusive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the impact of these ambitious-sounding initiatives has been unclear and comparatively modest, depending on whether you are measuring political influence or actual social development impact. Some argue that these have been poorly executed approaches driven by China’s agenda to expand its economic and strategic interests across the world; others see them as glimmers of potential for the possibility of using the enormous resources, manpower, and research capacity of the world’s second-largest economy to focus on critical global issues. For the latter to be realized, China needs to dispel anxiety by clearly demonstrating that these initiatives work for their intended beneficiaries, not just China’s interests. Regardless, they certainly represent notable change in a country long criticized for failing to address global poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-and-the-united-states-working-together&quot;&gt;China and the United States Working Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, many of China’s international collaborations have focused on global social impact by partnering with various U.S. organizations. In some cases, these partnerships have lasted more than a century. The Rockefeller Foundation, for instance, has maintained significant programs in China since 1913, funding — and shaping — the education of generations of doctors at Peking Union Medical College, as well as supporting humanitarian causes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since opening its Beijing office in 2007, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has managed a portfolio of philanthropic grants and initiatives that includes programs to help China improve the quality of its medical products toward normative international standards, as well as contribute efforts to the fight against TB, HIV, and other diseases in China. The Gates Foundation has also provided technical assistance and support to Chinese efforts directed at low resource needs elsewhere in the world, including safe Chinese vaccines, innovations in agriculture and sanitation, and improved scientific research opportunities between Chinese and global scientists. In conjunction with the Beijing Municipal Government, the foundation launched and co-funded the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), based at Tsinghua University, to help orient and leverage research and innovation toward critical diseases across the globe for which cures and treatments are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Gates Foundation is actually a latecomer. The Asia Foundation has been active in China since the late 1970s. The World Wildlife Fund has been working to promote conservation efforts in China — from forest management to wetlands conservation and species protection — since 1980. Johns Hopkins University and Nanjing University opened the Hopkins-Nanjing Center for Chinese and American Studies in 1986. The Ford Foundation began working on U.S.-China issues in the 1960s through funding China studies centers in the United States, before establishing a Beijing office in 1988. Greenpeace has been working there since 1997. And the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. side, this long association attests to the fact that for decades, the United States valued international exchanges as a form of “soft diplomacy.” The first Fulbright agreement signed by the United States was with China in 1947. And even during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, U.S.-funded exchange programs supported some 20,000 international students for study in the United States each year. An increasingly large proportion of them have come from China. By 2019, 370,000 students from China were enrolled in U.S. schools, accounting for about 34 percent of foreign students in the United States. Most Chinese students in the United States have indicated a strong desire to stay in the United States, which underscores the importance of the programs but increasingly raises concerns in both Beijing and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China welcomed these partnerships as well for many years — in part as a recipient of aid as a developing country with health and development programs focused on China, and in part as a component of its expanding global footprint across Africa and other regions of the globe, where it also has a strategic interest in “soft power” politics. The technical assistance provided to Chinese government agencies, academic institutions, and even companies through these programs significantly elevated China’s know-how and engagement on critical social issues, and even today it continues to be welcomed by Chinese and U.S. authorities on specific issues such as HIV/AIDS prevention and cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-geopolitical-winds&quot;&gt;Changing Geopolitical Winds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many international observers hoped that mounting tensions between China and the United States would be a passing phase, provoked by Donald Trump’s anti-China rhetoric and vanishing with his exit from office. Others suggested that as Xi Jinping consolidated power with a third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, his antipathy toward the United States might ease. But the divide has only become more entrenched, with the Biden administration solidifying a framing of China as the primary U.S. strategic competitor with numerous policies, sanctions, and commitments, and the Xi administration expanding its anti-U.S. policies and rhetoric. With schisms playing out militarily, technologically, economically, and ideologically, more observers are speaking in cold war terms — and expressing concerns about the potential for some event, such as a confrontation over Taiwan, to trigger a “hot war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written by foreign policy experts about the nature and origins of this divide. This essay does not reiterate that analysis but hopes to advance a discussion of global good collaboration with full acknowledgement of the challenging landscape. Within a context of mutual distrust, the international community will need to develop new narratives and mechanisms through which academics and advocates can continue to make progress on urgent humanitarian needs. And it must undertake this quest while still struggling with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, which have added thorny new layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, health-related collaborations were viewed as politically acceptable, a safe harbor shielded from politics. But the panic and confusion around Covid-19 upended that tradition. First, questions about the origins of the virus itself — and whether it came from a lab in Wuhan — did significant damage to whatever trust existed between China and the West around common health concerns. The resulting accusations, misinformation, and counter-misinformation have created considerable tension. That fracture was compounded by questions about the WHO and whether it had helped China to cover its tracks during the first weeks of the pandemic. Later, new global tensions arose amid poor alignment between China and the West on confronting the pandemic. It has become increasingly difficult to understand how scientists and policymakers can rebuild trust in preparing for or responding to a future epidemic, although it is a hopeful sign that both countries contributed to the emerging Pandemic Fund established by the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At one time, health-related collaborations were viewed as politically acceptable, a safe harbor shielded from politics. But the panic and confusion around Covid-19 upended that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and indeed its amplification of Russian propaganda about the invasion, has further strained U.S.-China relations. Even though China has refused to supply lethal assistance to Russia, it has significantly increased its economic links with its northern neighbor. In short, this inhospitable environment for strengthening or expanding critical collaborations has forced many partners to play defense in order to sustain any momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this challenging political environment and this era of great power competition, collaboration on social issues like health, climate, and agriculture has been disrupted or slowed down, and the future of this important work is becoming increasingly hazy. Data and anecdotes abound, from the dramatic drop of exchange programs mentioned above, to the fear of sanctions impacting scientific research, to Chinese interference with foreign companies’ activities, to the U.S. government’s approach to scientists and scholars of Chinese origins, and beyond. Over the past 10 years, several foreign NGOs operating in China have withdrawn or reduced services voluntarily or involuntarily, including Mercy Corps, Habitat for Humanity, and the Li Ka Shing Foundation. While difficult to ascertain, the amount of foreign philanthropy donated to China has also decreased, and the number of life science research collaborations have been curtailed, due more to geopolitical tensions than the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are more than rhetorical; they directly impact the operations of organizations working to collaborate. Under China’s new Foreign NGO Law, all social sector activities are now subject to increased oversight by the Public Security Bureau. Partnerships with China also must operate within a new environment in the United States: bipartisan support of anti-China policies and increased scrutiny about its activities by government agencies and political leaders. Rigorous vigilance and full transparency are always wise when working on such issues, but this new climate creates a tangle of new bureaucracies and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far more challenging is the potential chilling effect of these government policies on mid-level bureaucrats. This is true on both sides of the Pacific. With officials disinclined to pursue any opportunity that might suggest political endorsement, social impact activists confront a distinct paralysis — a hesitance to go after even the lowest-hanging fruit. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many global offers to China for support or interventions from foreign parties, for example non-Chinese mRNA vaccines, were not even considered by many Chinese officials given the political sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chilling effect has also impacted scientific collaborations. Jenny J. Lee, a professor at the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Arizona, surveyed scientists, professors, and graduate students at 83 U.S. universities to determine how U.S.-China political policies were affecting research. More than 42 percent of Chinese scientists said they felt they were being racially profiled, even surveilled, by the U.S. government. Nearly 20 percent said that over the past three years they had prematurely or unexpectedly ended or suspended collaborations with colleagues in China. “This is actually undermining the U.S.’s ability to be globally competitive,” Lee observed. “Scientists are less likely to collaborate with China, less likely to host Chinese scientists, less inclined to apply for federal funding, which means smaller projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in every country, there are always challenging “red zones” around social impact work; in China, these include any effort to advance democracy or human rights, as well as any focus on Tibet, Xinjiang, or Taiwan. The strain around those engagements has flowed into other areas — such as data sharing or the use of technologies that raise concerns about misuse or national security concerns. Any such collaborations with commercial players must carefully consider the implications of a growing list of entities for which sanctions might apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this decoupling continues, and neither Chinese nor U.S. authorities and non-state actors provide clearer opportunities for collaboration, the chances of tackling major global challenges will be diminished. Partnerships between organizations from both the United States and China remain essential as they study, prepare for, and respond to issues on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-safe-harbors-ahead&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Safe Harbors Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news in this dire scenario is that both governments recognize these risks. High-level officials on both sides of the Pacific have made clear public statements about the potential for further collaboration advancing the global good. In the fall of 2021, both countries surprised the world by issuing a joint statement at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. “In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between China and the U.S. than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation,” said Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief negotiator on climate. John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, echoed the same: “The United States and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get this job done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the June 2023 meeting between President Xi and Secretary Blinken in Beijing reportedly focused on broader areas for cooperation. According to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “President Xi pointed out that the two sides need to remain committed to the common understandings he and President Biden had reached in Bali, and translate the positive statements into actions so as to stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations.” Blinken reiterated that both sides “agree on the need to stabilize our relationship” and that China and the United States should focus on areas of common interests. As Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan commented when meeting Blinken ahead of his trip to Beijing, “There are many global, planetary issues — climate, pandemics, even cyber security — which require the United States and China to work off the same page and be key pillars for a global system which will help increase resilience to threats to welfare, health and prosperity for people all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less-good news is that these statements have been vague, sometimes contradictory, and generally unsupported by details about the policies, mechanisms, timeline, or authority under which any such partnerships might advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the discussion is so urgent: the situation calls for nongovernment actors — perhaps a consortium of foundations, NGOs, or research institutions — to fill in the gaps and delineate safe harbors for collaboration in the waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several hopeful strands of government-approved policies and civil society engagements to build upon. Beyond the climate engagements, there have been several track 1.5 or 2.0 dialogues between key Chinese and U.S. actors regarding global health and other issues. Policies that would have had enormous unintended consequences on global health and food security, such as proposed legislative language to prohibit China-sourced elements in any vaccines as part of the U.S. commitment to fund Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, have been avoided. In addition, new broad-based commitments on both sides of the Pacific, like the Biden administration’s “Invest, Align, Compete” policy and Beijing’s new Global Development Initiative, might offer political frameworks in which potential collaborations could be advanced, though there is much uncertainty about both models. There have been additional commitments by both the United States and China to multilateral mechanisms such as the UN World Food Programme and the new Pandemic Preparation Financial Intermediary Fund of the World Bank, which offer some ideas for further alignment and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why the discussion is so urgent: the situation calls for nongovernment actors — perhaps a consortium of foundations, NGOs, or research institutions — to fill in the gaps and delineate safe harbors for collaboration in the waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are promising islands of hope in the increasingly turbulent sea of issues, more directed and focused efforts are needed. This could be structured joint initiatives that are clear in their global social goals (and not related to national security) and detached from politics at home, along the lines of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute referenced above; agreements for exchange of data and information that are shaped and managed in a way that both countries might accept, for instance on pandemic early-warning systems; or more philanthropic-led joint initiatives to collaborate in the case of third-country humanitarian responses, such as the cooperation during the West Africa Ebola epidemic. But given the new moment and particular conditions of the current great power competition, the parties at hand also need to both study how this has been done in the past and reimagine better ways for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-precedents&quot;&gt;Global Precedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these discussions, seizing the opportunity to create safe harbors for continued collaboration feels urgent. And we can look to history as a guide. Effective social impact partnerships, even during intense confrontation, are not unprecedented. In fact, examples abound. China and the United States can take inspiration from mechanisms such as the water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan that has endured since 1960, despite the two countries’ strained political relationship; the “humanitarian pauses” that evacuated civilians from conflict zones like Israel/Palestine and Syria; or vaccination campaigns and other public health risk-mitigation work undertaken during refugee crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most relevant example is the highly successful “science diplomacy” campaign between the Soviet Union and the United States that eradicated smallpox during the height of the Cold War, when U.S. virologist Albert Sabin worked with two Soviet virologists to produce an oral polio vaccine — even as all three were being watched by a suspected KGB agent at Sabin’s lab in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the vaccine was tested, deemed safe by the WHO, and licensed for production, Soviet scientists developed the technology for producing hundreds of millions of doses. Together, this health-focused collaboration between two political rivals eradicated smallpox in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, most observers believe prospects for accelerating development impact work with China over the next decade look grim. But social impact activists are realists, driven by optimism. To build collaboration, there are two needs upon which to focus: a more nuanced narrative regarding U.S.-China relations and a reimagined, clearer set of mechanisms for creating safe harbors for collaborative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;narrative&quot;&gt;Narrative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaping a new narrative in the midst of hardline government policies is difficult. But it is critical to emphasize an effort mission-driven by social impact concerns, rather than politics. At a minimum, a new framing can outline the ways in which non-state actors (such as NGOs, philanthropies, and businesses) are uniquely well positioned to continue shaping collaborative programs in areas of mutual self-interest, all without violating their respective governments’ policies or approaches. Most importantly, the narrative must make plain that these relationships are not part of a zero-sum game, where one side wins and the other loses. Rather, in thinking about climate change mitigation, global public health, food security, and development financing, it is more effective — and realistic — to advance an “all boats rising” perspective. Mutual self-interest in Washington and Beijing can drive progress in all of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mechanisms&quot;&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful discussion also would need to explore the actual mechanisms through which collaborations could flourish. What those are and how they should work is beyond the scope of this essay. But the examples provided may offer inspiration for new efforts to pick up the baton and stride forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding opportunities for engagement might start, for example, with “surgical strikes” on climate and health — targeted partnerships on key issues. Would such discrete efforts be sustainable? In an environment of conflict, would innovators, activists, and officials have the “cover” they need to devise creative solutions to the world’s shared problems? One model for action might involve a coalition of like-minded think tanks and philanthropies, acting in alignment with both governments while operating independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector may offer hints too. For example, a major boost to the World Wildlife Fund’s work on conservation in China came from Apple, the electronics company, which partnered with the wildlife group in 2015 to work with Chinese forestry companies on ways to reduce logging impacts, mitigate fire risk and chemical use, and increase worker safety. China — the world’s largest consumer and producer of paper products — has since protected 1 million acres of forestland in accordance with standards set by the international Forest Steward Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the consequences of getting this wrong are not trivial. While it is not hard to imagine a group of Western non-state actors operating in the sort of model sketched above, nothing in China is so neatly separated from government oversight. This reality would naturally raise concerns that the independence of one side could be weaponized by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, would China be acting as China alone, or as a representative of the developing world? In an era of democratic decline, could collaboration with China end up aiding authoritarian regimes around the globe? For example, if Washington supported making qualified, lower-priced, China-sourced drugs widespread for fighting disease in sub-Saharan Africa, might it risk subsidizing an emerging marketplace that would advantage China economically, against the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty years witnessing the impact of human-to-human work on areas of mutual concern across borders and boundaries reinforces the conviction that it is possible to build partnerships that run complementary to government policy, even in authoritarian states. Yes, the questions outlined in this essay are complex. But the problems confronting our planet demand that the United States fight its way through them with China as a partner — if only in this limited context. The first step forward lies in refining the narrative that frames this work. Brookings and CSIS have already begun that important conversation, jointly launching the Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition project earlier this year. The purpose of this essay is to deepen it — and to turn up the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ventures like this will always attract naysayers, who attribute any positive response from China as stemming entirely from national self-interest. But experience while running the global health nonprofit PATH offers another interpretation. At the time, China had a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis that had protected millions of Chinese children, while other global sources were too expensive for the markets in Southeast Asia where the disease was rampant. When PATH approached the Chinese manufacturer, the Chengdu Institute of Biological Products (CDIBP), about making its vaccine available outside the country’s borders, cost-benefit analyses and political chess were trumped by defining a common goal that would greatly benefit many children, which could not be done without working together. Over 300 million children have been protected from a terrible disease through this collaboration. “When it became evident that this vaccine could change the world,” one leader on the project later recalled, “[CDIBP] said, ‘What do we need to do?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李予信完成作供 指黨否決財案「統一口徑」無約束力、從無講過亦無採納&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ounAPi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第111天。李予信今續接受盤問，就被搜得的初選論壇筆記不止一次提及否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，李指只是公民黨資深顧問抄黨的「Line to take（統一口徑）」，但理解非百分百要求候選人說出當中內容，只是參考、無約束力，視乎臨場發揮和「自己想唔想講」，他在論壇「從來冇講過亦從來冇採納過」。法官質疑，若公民黨候選人可自由偏離黨的統一口徑，那制定有什麼意思？李指為「原則性嘅展示」、「展示緊黨嘅一啲態度為先」，但各區區情、每名候選人身分等均不同，故實際上講法也不一樣。而就另一份黨的統一口徑文件提到避免講「攬炒」，李指公民黨不支持「攬炒」，但又提否決預算案是「有矛盾」和彈性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李亦否認自己當選後打算跟從黨立場，重申雖無向公眾表明，但有透過選舉宣傳暗示此訊息。李予信今完成4日作供，明將由本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的余慧明作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指成為候選人後無深究墨落無悔不太重視該聲明&quot;&gt;李指成為候選人後無深究「墨落無悔」、不太重視該聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信今繼續接受盤問，就公民黨6月11日簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，李早前供稱無參與任何討論、與他無關，指他當時並非潛在候選人，「我冇去關心」。李今在盤問下指，他於6月13日後才獲准參選，而參選前很多政治人物和參選人也有分享該聲明，故他知悉亦有「快䁽過」，但在正式成為候選人後就無再繼續深究，「因為當時我唔係好重視呢個聲明。」李又指，不知道公民黨「用個黨嘅名擺喺個聲明度呢個動作」，但從黨的帖文看到其聲稱自己加入了聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示該6月11日的帖文，提及「公民黨已加入聯署【墨落無悔 堅定抗爭】聲明書」，又提到「我們早於3月25日召開記者招待會，當時已承諾尊重民主派初選機制；立會過半後政府必須落實五大訴求，否則公民黨將行使《基本法》賦予的否決權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指賴仁彪無畀壓力一定要講某啲承諾理解為彈性&quot;&gt;李指賴仁彪「無畀壓力一定要講某啲承諾」、理解為彈性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪指，帖文無提及就否決預算案有彈性，但李早前指譚文豪曾向他稱「有彈性」，李看到帖文後有問譚嗎？李指他沒有問，譚於5月底的會面亦沒有承諾他當選後會給予彈性，但譚「鼓勵我繼續持有我本來所講嘅政綱」，並指李選超區時要謹守他作為街頭舞蹈藝術家和社工區議員兩個「好特別嘅身分」，指其政綱與身分相連，因此李理解該彈性「係展現於鼓勵我繼續持有呢個政綱呢件事上面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，彈性也體現於6月13日後，賴仁彪指黨可讓他參選，「我理解係黨能夠用佢嘅資源去支持我作為一個候選人嘅選舉理念同政綱，佢亦都冇畀我任何嘅壓力，要我一定要講某啲嘅承諾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指黨統一口徑無約束力非百分百嚴格要求候選人講&quot;&gt;李指黨「統一口徑」無約束力、非百分百嚴格要求候選人講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，鄭達鴻被搜出選舉「論壇天書」，李予信也有收到類似的文件嗎？李指有，解釋準備選舉時，黨資深顧問 Masun 負責撰寫「line to take（統一口徑）」，該顧問也會參與候選人的媒體訓練（media training），並因每區的區情、形勢和關注點也不一樣，而「落去同我哋候選人傾一個 tailor made 嘅講法」，「所以我理解嗰個 line to take 唔係完全一百分之一百 strictly 要求候選人 exact wording 去講嗰啲嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示從李搜得、題為「Draft 5 LTT」的文件，李解釋是黨整體使用的統一口徑，不止有5個版本，但不記得共有多少；至於另一份「初選論壇（4/7錄影）」，李解釋主要為論壇準備，由資深黨顧問和李競選團隊一兩個成員草擬和修改，參考黨的統一口徑再加上自己區情形勢寫成。李指他知道內容，且「最緊要就係，其實呢份 document 只係一個參考，而所有論壇表現好睇臨場嘅發揮、同埋我自己想唔想講，係冇約束力嘅」。李又指，該文件最原始版本應在6月，其後不斷更改，最新版本為7月2、3日，但不肯定呈堂文件是否最新。他同意超區論壇於7月4日錄影，7月6日廣播。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指公民黨唔畀講攬炒又反對財案有矛盾-曾與資深顧問談及&quot;&gt;李指公民黨「唔畀講『攬炒』」又反對財案有矛盾 曾與資深顧問談及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「Draft 5 LTT」提到「避免自己講『攬炒』字眼」，李同意是公民黨一貫看法；文件亦提及「35+後否決預算案，令政府停擺，就是攬炒，令香港民不聊生」，以及民主派如議會過半「提出否決政府議案，係我哋反制暴政嘅強力武器，其實係俾最後一次機會林鄭政府去回應市民嘅訴求，只要政府同意回應五大訴求、重啟政改，同埋撤回國安法，民主派就會按照正常方式審議政府議案，根本唔會停擺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問李收到文件後，曾否向黨資深顧問表示不同意？李指該段文字「其實就係反映黨嘅立場嘅彈性嘅存在，不過好模糊地存在」，因公民黨不支持「攬炒」，「佢都識講，『攬炒』會令到民不聊生」，但同時又有否決預算案的說法，「唔畀講『攬炒』又講反對財政預算案」，「兩者係矛盾嘅。」李指他有與顧問馬生談過該「立場上嘅彈性同矛盾」，馬針對其街舞藝術家和社工區議員身分，着李「講返我想講嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇文件提勿太老實勿有問必答-李指為論壇技巧因論壇非100講道理&quot;&gt;論壇文件提勿太老實、勿有問必答 李指為論壇技巧、因論壇非100%講道理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示「初選論壇（4/7錄影）」文件，法官關注寫有「X太老實 X有問必答」。李指是論壇技巧，「佢意思係唔好人哋問咩你就講晒咁多咁」，陳志全發笑。陳慶偉指，因此李是在誤導？李否認，陳追問何謂「X太老實」，李答「因為政治嘅論壇唔係講緊道理」，陳慶偉發笑，李遂更正「應該唔係講緊100%嘅道理」。李運騰微笑問，即有些問題並非真問題，而是陷阱？李說「可以咁樣講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，李是說他們不要相信政治人物所說的話？李指政治人物發言時要強調一些訊息，喚起更多關注，「依啲都可以好有理性基礎，但係喺論壇上面，因為個時間好短，可能叫你十秒回應一個好大嘅議題，咁你就要記得自己好想畀公眾知道嘅理念。」李運騰說，基本上就是說他想說的話，李說「其實我係咁理解嘅」。法官陳仲衡續說，「不要在庭上這樣做，重要是先答問題，之後再提供解釋」，旁聽發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;統一口徑提35後以否決權迫政權落實五大訴求-李稱從無講過也無採納&quot;&gt;「統一口徑」提35+後以否決權迫政權落實五大訴求 李稱從無講過也無採納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續說，「我的問題不是一個陷阱，而是一個真正的問題」，法官陳慶偉和陳志全發笑。控方續展示李的論壇文件，提到：「入到立法會第一件事想做啲咩？35+後以否決權迫令政權落實五大訴求，係我哋當今出選人嘅共識。」李解釋「呢個係抄返（黨）LTT（Line to take），一模一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續向李指出，他當時知道初選候選人有共識否決預算案爭取五大訴求，惟陳慶偉指控方要記得李沒有出席過協調會。李續回應他不知道，亦不同意控方指他知道，「因為我連黨入面都觀察到有唔同立場，民主派陣營亦都有唔同嘅講法，我嘅論壇入面都顯示緊呢個事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，李事實上曾否於選舉論壇採納該句「Line to take」？李說：「從來冇講過亦從來冇採納過。」萬德豪問李沒有講過是否因為無人這樣問，惟陳慶偉即打斷指留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑如可自由偏離制定統一口徑有何意思-李原則性展示&quot;&gt;官質疑如可自由偏離、制定統一口徑有何意思 李：原則性展示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引文件提到「能夠做到議會過半真係好重要，咁我哋先可以反制暴政，喺議會裡面擋住23條呢啲惡法，另一方面可以透過否決所有政府提出嘅議案同撥款，包括財政預算案，逼使政府重啟政改、落實五大訴求」。李指該句「都係抄（黨）LLT，都係馬生嘅作品」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以這是馬生想李說的話？李說不肯定，但指團隊會將相關資料放在一起給他看，他不記得有否跟馬說不會於論壇提，「但最尾我係冇講嘅一定。」萬德豪續問，而否決財案的部分一直在所有類似文件出現？李同意，指「我理解都係抄黨嘅 LTT，亦都有我冇講嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，有趣地所有公民黨參選人也有相同的統一口徑，那如他們可以自由偏離黨的統一口徑，那制定統一口徑有什麼意思？（“… free to deviate from the LTT, then what’s the point of having one?”）李表示，「其實 LTT 係一個展示緊黨嘅一啲態度為先，但實際上嘅講法呢，每個候選人嘅身分、佢所代表嘅業界利益，同埋地區直選嘅區情，都係會好唔一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡打斷指，因此有 LTT，但也有個別和不同（exemptions and disagreement）的情況？李說「係，可以咁理解，係有彈性」。李運騰指他明白有彈性，但若分歧大到根本連一個共同共識也沒有，「為何要有這個統一口徑？（“Why bother to have this line to take?”）」李說：「我理解為係一個原則性嘅展示，例如一國兩制⋯⋯」惟陳慶偉即打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李無告訴公眾不跟黨立場否決-但指宣傳有暗示此訊息&quot;&gt;李無告訴公眾不跟黨立場否決 但指宣傳有暗示此訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示李予信的論壇「Drilling Record」文件，提到「自己政綱／議題（夾黨）」，列出工廈、囚權、追究警暴等，李解釋即自己的政綱議題與黨議題「相夾到嘅地方」。李並解釋，「Drilling」指「media drilling」，是「一種練習嘅 session」，他會重複回答一些問題和重複自己想講的理念，「睇吓講得好唔好、有啲乜嘢改善、或者有啲咩嘢內容需要更正。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪最後問，李曾否告訴公眾他不會跟從黨立場，否決預算案以爭取五大訴求，李回應：「我冇咁樣講過，因為我有透過我嘅宣傳 imply 一個咁嘅訊息。」萬最後指出控方案情，指李當選後有意跟從黨立場，串謀與其他被告取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求，李不同意。萬再指李有意顛覆國家政權，李答：「我無意顛覆國家政權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李作供完畢-余慧明將作供&quot;&gt;李作供完畢 余慧明將作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問完結，大律師關文渭沒有覆問，李予信案情完結。代表本案最後一名被告余慧明的大律師石書銘表示，余會作供，料需時少於兩天，問現在抑或明日開始？法官陳慶偉指明日開始，林卓廷說：「吓？」案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第110天。李予信繼續作供，表示超區初選落敗、宣布不參與立法會選舉後，7月底獲時任黨魁楊岳橋指示報名參選港島，理解楊當時因DQ憂慮而作出準備。李指郭榮鏗、楊岳橋和郭家麒三人被DQ後，楊一度要他停止申請，惟他已交表、未能取回表格，向楊表示「好 frustrate」，楊則回答「阿信，it’s OK」，李其後得悉原參選港島的鄭達鴻同被DQ。不過李表示，理解他並非鄭達鴻的「Plan B」，他交表前亦不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻。此外，原表示擬不作供、參選衞生服務界的余慧明，其代表大狀指索取指示後，余將會作供。余為本案最後一名被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露原擬不作供余慧明擬作供&quot;&gt;辯方透露原擬不作供余慧明擬作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑表示，鄒另所涉的7.1佔領立法會案，擬於本周三（23日）下午進行案件管理聆訊，問本案能否於當天下午休庭。法官陳慶偉指待他想想，但據現時進度，案件有可能於周三完成。不過代表本案最後一名被告、原表示擬不作供的余慧明的大律師石書銘即表示，收到指示余慧明將會作供，辯方案情或需數天時間處理。陳世傑臨散庭時表示撤回申請，指鄒毋須出席該次聯訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱楊岳橋指示報名參選港島惟楊3人被dq後被要求停止申請&quot;&gt;李稱楊岳橋指示報名參選港島、惟楊3人被DQ後被要求停止申請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，他早前供稱於超區初選落敗，於7月15日宣布不參與正式選舉，李今同意於2020年7月30日報名參與港島區立法會選舉，而他不曾參與港島區初選。李解釋，他於7月29日中午收到時任黨魁楊岳橋電話通知，指黨有機會徵召他參與港島區選舉。當時該區由鄭達鴻出選，李理解楊當時因DQ憂慮而作出一些準備，故在前一日要準備提名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當晚至翌日早上仍在找提名，取齊提名和填好表格後便等候指示，當時公民黨未有人被DQ。李並指7月30日下午約1時，楊岳橋致電他「叫我去入紙報名喇，可以」，李遂與助理一起到上環選舉事務處，約兩時多開始進行申請程序，提交逾100個提名及公民黨予他的5萬元現金按金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指完成手續後獲發收據，行出大廳時便收到楊岳橋指示，當時郭榮鏗、楊岳橋和郭家麒已被DQ，楊「叫我去停止呢個申請動作」。李指他即回頭找職員，「就話我啱啱遞完張 form，但我而家想收返個申請」，惟職員拒絕，表示根據制度，退選只能透過正式申請一份退選申請書辦妥。李指職員其後給他一份文件，但記不清楚是否該表格，他並告訴楊岳橋「我收唔走嗰張申請」，「我向佢表示好 frustrate，因為攞唔返」，楊則回覆「阿信，it’s OK」，並叫他先回公民黨總部，容後再商討。李並於當天近4時、尚在選舉事務處時收到鄭達鴻被DQ的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱立法會截止報名日-曾陪梁嘉善報名新西&quot;&gt;李稱立法會截止報名日 曾陪梁嘉善報名新西&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，當晚約7時楊岳橋召開記招，交代有關DQ事宜，當時無人有時間再商討他收回申請一事。至記招完後，楊岳橋着李「hold 住個申請先，聽朝再算」。至7月31日的立法會正式選舉截止報名日期，李稱當天中午到曾獲通過排楊岳橋新東名單第二的梁嘉善辦公室，因他理解當時的討論「係究竟其他選區嘅好似我呢個情況徵召嘅人，報唔報名好」。李同意，理解梁嘉善同樣為被公民黨徵召的人，但不肯定其會員狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，看到梁收到指示要去報名參選新界西，並指「因為我係唯一一個一早報咗名嘅徵召者，所以31號我淨係坐喺度睇嘅啫」，並陪伴梁去報名。李在法官追問下指當時無人指示他要做什麼，「我純粹係陪伴佢，因為大家都係徵召者」，不過同日傍晚，政府宣布將選舉延後一年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱理解不是鄭達鴻plan-b交表前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻&quot;&gt;李稱理解不是鄭達鴻「Plan B」、交表前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭續展示選舉事務處的文件，顯示「Te-wing chi（戴穎姿）」於7月31日報名港島區。李理解戴與公民黨有關係，指於2016年認識戴，她當時為公民黨實習生，至2020年「應該係」鄭達鴻競選團隊員工，因他4至5月中探討成為鄭名單第二時曾在鄭的辦事處見過戴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，不知道戴是否被公民黨徵召參選和是否代表黨參選，也不知道她是否鄭達鴻「Plan B」。至於李本人，「我理解我唔係鄭生嘅Plan B」，但除他以外當時不知道公民黨有派其他人參選港島。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續問，李是否從無被DQ，惟法官即打斷指當時選舉已延期。關續指，但李已交表，可於翌日被DQ，法官陳慶偉笑言「我不認為公務員是那麼有效率」，法官陳仲衡亦着辯方要現實。陳慶偉並指，認為辯方提出戴小姐的議題是完全與案無關。關續表示完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的大律師黃宇逸其後進行盤問，李予信同意，他提交正選提名表格前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻，亦不知鄭曾否被任何公民黨的人諮詢或通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第110天。李予信今接受控方盤問，就楊岳橋於公民黨記者會指若政府不回應五大訴求，否決每個法案和撥款是「莊嚴承諾」，李指黨內議員以往也有投票不一致的情況，「so far 冇嘢可以 bound（綑綁）到所有公民黨立法會議員一致去投票」，亦認為該承諾未必會兌現。李又指就否決財案立場與黨不同，但無公開表達，遭法官質疑如他沒有黨的支持便「什麼也不是」，他要跟從黨立場。惟李指其政綱已反映他以選民利益為先，若黨不批准他豁免跟黨立場投票，「我都會照跟自己意向投票，就即管睇吓個黨有啲乜嘢嘅後果畀我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，《國安法》條文頒布後，認為提及否決權的政綱或違法，即通知團隊停派舊單張並設計新單張，將含有公民黨政綱的內容「全部放棄」。李又指，除目標議席外不知超區初選有其他協議，指多年來協調均談及議席和配票策略。李亦指他無收過超區協調文件，主控萬德豪指他至少有看過，惟法官李運騰質疑控方說法有何證據，指李並無被搜出該文件，「你是代表控方，你指出案情時要有基礎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑公民黨記者會非推廣選民登記-李指選民登記可助爭議會過半&quot;&gt;控方質疑公民黨記者會非推廣選民登記 李指選民登記可助爭議會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信今早完成主問，由主控萬德豪進行盤問。就前黨友鄭達鴻早前供稱黨團負責立法會最前線政策，李指「我當時咁樣猜測，但 actually 係點樣我唔清楚」；至於鄭稱黨團凌駕執委會，李亦稱不知道兩者互動實際上是怎樣，「無從評論邊個高權力啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨3月25日記者會，楊岳橋提到若特首不回應五大訴求，「公民黨係會同佢唔客氣⋯⋯以後政府每一個法案、財政撥款申請，我哋都會否決，呢個亦都係一個莊嚴嘅承諾」，而政府如仍不退讓，也會「義無反顧」否決預算案，並希望能促成35+「一齊否決」預算案。公民黨事後將記者會摘要於 Facebook 發布，李同意有轉發該帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vrTVWan.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁家傑（左）、楊岳橋（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續質疑，李於記者會上手持「議會過半 實現五大訴求」的紙牌，指記者會並非如李所說是關於選民登記。李不同意，指屬論述層面、是選民登記一部分，理解「選民登記係可以貢獻於爭取議會過半呢個目標」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方欲追問時，陳慶偉稱理解李指該些紙牌是用來吸引人做選民，李同意，並指黨推廣選民登記是想更多人支持民主派。李運騰指，尤其是想人支持公民黨？李指「可以咁講」，但會上訊息提及尊重、團結，「我理解就係有個大局觀喺度」，即取得議會過半。萬指若過半便可落實五大訴求？李稱「我哋唔知係咪真係落實到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李重申記者會訊息混合發言者有矛盾&quot;&gt;李重申記者會訊息混合、發言者有矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信早前形容，記者會訊息「混合」，楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款，但郭家麒又指預算案合理會支持。萬續質疑，據楊岳橋記者會上說法，很清楚（crystal clear）公民黨立場就是否決預算案爭取五大訴求，並非李所說的「混合訊息」。李不同意，指「有好多人講嘢」。陳慶偉追問，雖然其他人說了不同的話，但公民黨於記者會的立場還是很清楚？李運騰亦問，不同人的訊息並沒有彼此矛盾？李均不同意，認為有矛盾，但同意主題是清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨議員投票不一致理解公民黨未必兌現否決財案莊嚴承諾&quot;&gt;李稱黨議員投票不一致、理解公民黨「未必兌現」否決財案「莊嚴承諾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，李予信曾否告知楊岳橋，若他當選後不會跟隨黨立場，否決預算案以爭取五大訴求。李指他無這樣說過，但公民黨以往也有出現「議員投票唔一致」的情況，「so far（至今為止）冇嘢可以 bound（綑綁）到所有公民黨立法會議員一致去投票」，他當時亦有此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，但以往公民黨議員有不同投票立場時，黨有作出過「莊嚴承諾」嗎？李指不記得。陳續指，莊嚴承諾並非「口輕輕」許下、應該被兌現，否則就會令選民失去信心，因此公民黨3月許下此莊嚴承諾時，完全是打算兌現。惟李指「我理解係未必會兌現」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，公民黨以往曾許過多少「莊嚴承諾」？惟李運騰指，李予信只於2018年入黨，問題是否對他公平。李予信續在追問下，指公民黨在2018至2020年曾做過很多承諾，李運騰追問，但重要到會召記招表明作出莊嚴承諾？李再指不記得。陳慶偉亦提到，3月25日記者會上黨魁楊岳橋和黨主席梁家傑均坐在中間，問李看過多少次這樣的安排？李指二人份量較高，公民黨開記招時都是坐中間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑李過往均跟黨立場惟至控罪核心始稱不跟-李指政綱有反映&quot;&gt;官質疑李過往均跟黨立場、惟至控罪核心始稱不跟 李指政綱有反映&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指李予信是公民黨的鐵粉（die-hard fan），一直跟從黨的立場（line），那為何7月時改變？李指他入黨前一直關注公民黨，成為支部會員後很多工作、守則和政治原則上，也會參考公民黨的說法、他亦同意；但就否決預算案的立場，「其實喺嗰個 moment，我係有唔同嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他就是要測試李，並追問若李一直跟從黨路線，為何偏偏在本案控罪的中心議題（centre issue of the charge），才有不同的做法？李解釋：「因為依個部分就直接同我想參選做立法會議員嘅初衷好有關係，而依樣嘢係我之前未 encounter（遇上）過嘅。」陳慶偉續指，若不是鄭達鴻「拍膊頭」，李不會成為區議員，又指「我不是要貶低你，不過沒有公民黨的支持，你什麼都不是（“Without the support of the Civic Party, you are simply — put it this way, I am not trying to be derogatory — nobody.”）」，李說：「可以咁樣講嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，李予信決定參選時需要黨的支持，因此要跟從黨立場，亦從沒有向公眾提及他不會跟黨否決預算案。李指他對公眾所有講法和訊息，都是根據其參選理念和原則，「無論喺公開嘅發言、單張、文宣、論壇，我嘅訊息都係一致同清晰」，但承認無公開講過，不會跟從黨立場否決預算案以爭取五大訴求。陳慶偉即說：「但你可以，不是嗎？在你新印的單張，你可以說我以選民利益優先，不論黨的立場如何。」李指「依個訊息我從來都係咁樣強調」，他未必用文字直接表達，但政綱內容有反映，均清晰談及整體社會市民利益和他特別關注的群體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱理解黨資助有考慮其政綱若申豁免投票不獲批-仍會跟自己意向投票&quot;&gt;李稱理解黨資助有考慮其政綱、若申豁免投票不獲批 仍會跟自己意向投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻早前稱，公民黨有豁免跟隨黨立場投票的機制。李續同意，若不跟隨黨立場投票須申請豁免，未必會批准，而若不獲批，「我都會照跟自己意向投票，就即管睇吓個黨有啲乜嘢嘅後果畀我」，但承認當時沒有提過會申請。而李早前供稱黨最終願資助他40萬初選經費，法官陳仲衡問獲得該資助有否任何責任伴隨，陳慶偉亦問李會否認為自己應負一些責任，例如對黨忠誠？李指「都會有呢個理解」，但當時未有就「莊嚴承諾」的講法「有一個咁 specific 嘅關注」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前亦稱，5月底與譚文豪會面，指其所倡議政策需要錢，與黨立場或有出入。李今再指6月5日晚與選舉策略委員會會面時，譚亦是委員之一，李將曾向譚提過的政綱，即他在單張和論壇提及、一些需要爭取撥款的項目寫下予委員會，「所以佢 finance 我嘅決定，我理解其實佢有考慮過我所持有嘅政綱同想法係點樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5RrST9s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，但前提是政府回應五大訴求、公民黨不否決預算案，李才能提出其項目，並問李有向委員會提過，會將其政綱放在黨的莊嚴承諾前嗎？李指當時無討論過，只能說理解如他所持理念和政綱能得到黨支持，「入到議會無論點都好，我都會繼續跟進」，「無論政府回唔回應（五大訴求）都好，我都會繼續去咁樣講、咁樣投票。」陳慶偉問，李予信想黨支持其政綱，那認為黨也會想他支持其政策嗎？李說「會有咁樣嘅理解」。萬德豪其後指，李從無意圖申請豁免機制，以不跟從黨否決預算案的立場，李不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱政綱或違國安法-着團隊停派並設計新單張-全棄公民黨政綱&quot;&gt;李稱政綱或違《國安法》 着團隊停派並設計新單張 全棄公民黨政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李予信於初選提名表格提交的政綱，提及「爭取議會過半35+，以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」，控方指是楊岳橋之前提過的「莊嚴承諾」。李指講法相若，控方可以這樣聯想，但「我嘅政綱同依個講法係矛盾嘅」。李追問下表示，當時無反對用此政綱，而他授權其他人交表，提交時知道亦同意表格附上此政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指《國安法》實施後，公民黨秘書處於6月30日晚或7月1日早上，為所有候選人發電郵，「一次過轉晒」所有公民黨候選人政綱為「無字政綱」，他其後獲告知此事，但無參與決定過程、不知確實由誰下決定、亦無人諮詢過他，而他理解「之前嘅政綱可能有問題，同《國安法》相違」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，李認為舊版政綱有問題？李指「我當時有咁諗過」，指《國安法》6月30日晚出爐後，他看過條文加上自己一些判斷，「我第一時間通知我嘅選舉團隊，立即停派舊嘅單張，同埋立即設計一個新嘅單張，將包含有公民黨政綱嘅內容呢，全部放棄。」李盤問下指之後沒有告訴選民他已放棄相關政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Facebook 帖文，李指3月25日記者會帖文內有選民登記網頁的連結，認為是該帖文焦點，故沒有刪除。控方質疑即使選民登記截止、《國安法》生效後李也沒有刪除，李指「因為已經沉晒底㗎喇個 post」，尤其選舉最熾熱的宣傳期曾發布很多帖文，「當時我都唔再在意啲咁舊嘅 post 喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李理解初選規則衍生自共識除目標議席不知其他協議-指是對多年協調理解&quot;&gt;李理解初選規則衍生自共識、除目標議席不知其他協議 指是對多年協調理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格提及「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，李指他沒有出席超區協調會，亦不知黃文萱有否出席，但承認當時想知道「嗰個協調嘅共識係啲乜嘢」，「因為喺我嘅概念，初選其實就係關於協調，如果我參與初選連協調嘅共識係啲乜都唔知嘅話呢，我好難繼續參與落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當時無問黃文萱、也無問戴耀廷或區諾軒，但曾問秘書處總幹事歐飛，因他對每區協調、選舉策略或形勢「好有認知」，「我問佢係最快嘅。」庭上早前顯示紀錄，李曾問歐飛「我想知道超區初選既規則係點？」，獲悉超區目標議席是「3+1」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪質疑李只是問及初選的規則而非共識，李指當時理解「啲規則係衍生自呢個共識嘅，都係字眼上問題」，認為他問有什麼規則要參選的人遵守，意思就是共識。萬問共識即是協議？李認為無衝突，指有共識去遵守規則也屬「協議咗嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，除了該些規則，李還知道初選有協議嗎？李指他不知道，強調其焦點和當時概念，就是「咁多年嚟初選嘅協調都係講緊個議席、配票嘅策略，如果就住依個目標有任何嘅協議，其實都係衍生一啲嘅規則，去約束參選人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指不知公民黨記者會發言與初選協調共識有何關連&quot;&gt;李指不知公民黨記者會發言與初選協調共識有何關連&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前同意，曾出席3月30日公民黨「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」會議，紀錄提及「上星期三各團隊聯合召開記招，各團隊認為成功為民主派設定選舉議程，力爭透過立法會選舉議會過半迫使政府落實五大訴求，為未來民主派繼續就選舉作出協調及合作提供基礎」，李指不記得當時是否確實用「基礎」一字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，李看到上述提名表格條款時，有否想到在「心戰室核心小組」會議上提及，關於民主派協調的基礎？法官陳慶偉一度指問題很差勁，控方再問後李說「冇呀，太遙遠呀」，並指看到6月20日的條款時，不會想起3月會議提及的一個點，反而頗肯定他是基於向黨就初選規則追查所得到的認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指出案情，指李當時知道的協議不止是有關議席數量，李實遠比這知道得多，李不同意。陳慶偉續指，李除了知道超區目標議席為「3+1」，亦知道公民黨參與初選的基礎，是要在立會取得過半後否決財案，這亦是「莊嚴承諾」？李不同意，指「我唔知道公民黨講嘅嘢，同埋所謂初選協調嘅共識嘅 linkage 喺邊度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無看過超區協調文件控方指出有看過-官質疑提問基礎&quot;&gt;李稱無看過超區協調文件、控方指出有看過 官質疑提問基礎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，不清楚提名表格條款中「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是指一份文件。萬德豪展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派區議會（二）協調機制協議」文件，李指他無看過。萬續指，文件是由戴耀廷於5月12日以 WhatsApp 廣播發給超區參選人。法官李運騰即打斷說：「5月12日？他當時成為參選人了嗎？」萬說未，但指他是問李是否知道，李予信答他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續向李指，他事實上曾獲發該文件，李不同意。萬再指至少李有看過該份文件，惟李運騰打斷，表示「抱歉萬先生，你有什麼證據基礎這樣說？你是代表控方，你指出案情時要有基礎」。萬指有證據公民黨有潛在候選人參選超區，李運騰指，「但坦白說，我看不到你有任何基礎指出該案情，你沒從他搜出這份文件、無法證明他在廣播名單上，你有什麼基礎？」，並再語帶無奈攤出雙手：「算了，你已問了，而他也答了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續在盤問下表示，無讀過戴耀廷於2020年4月至5月的文章，亦沒有興趣。控方一度指如李曾排鄭達鴻第二，會有興趣了解組織者的說法，惟李強調當時只是探討排鄭達鴻第二，「但係從來冇落實過」，亦不同意因此有讀過戴的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱曾看過投票宣傳片稿但無留意楊岳橋說話發布後僅確實有看過自己部分&quot;&gt;李稱曾看過投票宣傳片稿但無留意楊岳橋說話、發布後僅確實有看過自己部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就公民黨7月10日發布的初選投票宣傳片段，李指於6月20日拍攝前獲發一張「紙仔」要「拎住嚟背」。李早前稱拍攝前僅獲發自己講稿，不知道他人確實會說什麼，萬德豪今問李有否要求看其他人講稿，李稱「有嗰份稿」，他「唔記得好清楚」拍攝前有否讀過，「但係應該有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就片中楊岳橋承諾若特首未能落實五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府法案和預算，萬問李看到時沒有提出反對？李說沒有，「因為我焦點擺咗喺自己講嗰幾句度」、無用心留意楊會說的話，又指當時不斷要記住自己的部分，「唔想有咁多NG」，以便更快完成工作，而楊拍攝時他不在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，片段發布前，僅曾在錄影後即時看過自己的回放（playback），他當時無表達需在發布前看全片。片段於7月10日發布，李指他有看過，但忘記有否「由頭到尾逐秒睇晒成段片」，並指據其處事手法，「我會即刻飛去睇吓自己拍成點、好唔好睇咁嘅」，故只能確實有看過自己的部分，至於楊岳橋談及否決財案的部分則不記得有否看到。控方質疑片段只長2分鐘，李指當時忙於拉票，「我十幾個鐘都喺條街度」，其餘時間也是睡覺和休息。萬再追問即李連2分鐘也懶得看？惟法官打斷指這就是李的答案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，李予信將繼續接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it briefly assesses the policy ideas and approaches in the DCPR and makes suggestions for how the Department could sharpen its thinking and approach ahead of the next major review, likely due after the next general election.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall-assessment&quot;&gt;Overall Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer three headline assessments of the DCPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because of the fiscal constraints under which it was produced, the DCPR centres on policy ideas and approaches rather than on new capabilities. The white paper contains a large number of policy ideas. But, as the chapter-by-chapter analysis below indicates, very few of them are new. We suggest that those who will be planning and leading the next major review would benefit from familiarising themselves with what has gone before, including the 2010 and 2015 white papers (and previous ones) and the defence green paper in early 2010. The DCPR arguably – even if not deliberately – serves a similar function to that green paper, setting out a broad menu of issues that will need to be considered again in the next major review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the DCPR sets out a series of worthy high-level goals but is very light on detail and contains no clear sense of prioritisation. The original Integrated Review, Defence Command Paper (DCP) and Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) were crammed with commitments – anecdotally, they added up to more than 250 in total. The DCPR contains dozens more. We suggest that those leading the next major review should consider carefully how to prioritise the key outcomes relating to force structure, capabilities and policy and planning approaches. It would be much more useful to select a dozen or so major targets and to build robust implementation and monitoring functions to ensure that these key outcomes are being delivered effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we observe that, despite the rhetoric, the “Integrated Review” has hardly lived up to its billing. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) was the first attempt to conduct an integrated defence and wider national security review, and even then produced two back-to-back white papers. The 2015 SDSR produced a single, integrated white paper. The 2021 exercise produced three separate white papers. In all cases, these major reviews were followed by minor ones only a few years later, as with this year’s “refreshes”. Those designing the process for the 2025 reviews should consider in advance which of these models they would prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mods-strategic-approach&quot;&gt;The MoD’s Strategic Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new purpose for Defence proposed by the DCPR – “to protect the nation, and to help it prosper” – is clear. And the six “design principles” that will inform the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) approach – threat-led, adaptable, Allied by design, integrated, innovative and digitised – look sensible, although none are new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inverted structure of the body of the DCPR – with chapters on the key elements of the “Defence Enterprise” in Part 1 and on the more traditional policy fare of white papers in Part 2 – suits the limited ambition of this document, but would not work so well for a full-scale review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-1--securing-and-maintaining-strategic-advantage&quot;&gt;Part 1 – Securing and Maintaining Strategic Advantage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DCPR can be applauded for literally putting people first, in Chapter 1. It challenges the notion that headcount is the appropriate measure of the “size” of the UK’s armed forces and their capability – a notion that takes little account of the mechanisation of warfare and the latter-day profusion of uncrewed and lightly-crewed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter commits to “taking forward” the recommendations of the recent Haythornthwaite Review on the terms and conditions of military service. Many of these – for example, “zig zag or portfolio careers” – are not new. The key test will be how quickly the MoD implements them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major theme is skills, with a particular focus on enhancing digital skills. It is good to see the Defence Academy put at the forefront of this – and the commitment to working closely across government and with industry and academia. But the paper gives little sense of how Defence collectively and the Defence Academy in particular will drive through the skills agenda with the energy and pace required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD civil servants will be disappointed by the single – and largely boilerplate – paragraph on the vital contribution of “our Civil Servants”. The next review should not treat the MoD’s civil service workforce as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 follows several earlier reviews in emphasising the MoD’s intention to modernise and transform defence through science, innovation and technology. The MoD says it will increase its investment in advanced research and development and align its Science &amp;amp; Technology (S&amp;amp;T) programmes with the five critical technologies identified by the National S&amp;amp;T Council: Artificial Intelligence, Engineering Biology, Future Telecommunications, Semiconductors and Quantum Technologies. The MoD also plans to develop its capabilities in robotics, human augmentation, directed energy weapons and advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Improving operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness has featured in every major post-Cold War defence review. Unless a markedly different approach is taken this time, it is difficult to see how there will be decisive change&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on lessons learned from how the Ukrainian armed forces have operated, these steps aim to accelerate the speed of operational decision-making, contribute to increased productivity in the force and improve lethality. Pound for pound, investment in these technologies collectively has the potential to increase the battlefield capability of the UK armed forces to a much greater extent than any increase in personnel numbers, although it will likely require significant re-rolling and upskilling of current personnel and the recruitment of new personnel with the skills required to operate such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensible too is the move away from a platform-centric approach in favour of focusing on the military effects that are required, along with autonomy, digital and data-centric capabilities. It remains to be seen whether the MoD will reduce its investment in major platforms and how it will prioritise the development of these promising ideas to the extent required to really move the dial on the technology-led modernisation of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 covers plans to improve the Department’s performance in the acquisition of defence capabilities. Like other Western defence departments, the MoD has grappled with this challenge for decades with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document declares that “….we must buy simpler platforms more quickly and design into them the capacity to upgrade at speed…” and “[we] must force ourselves to accept solutions that are good enough…” Amen – but how is this to be achieved? Open-systems architecture, spiral development, more emphasis on exportability, encouraging project leaders to remain in post for longer, and greater attention to front-end planning are all laudable, but they are not new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is new? The stress on timely delivery over perfection may not be, but it is described with greater conviction (and aligns with one of the conclusions of the recent Australian Defence Strategic Review). It would be good to hear a ringing endorsement from industry. Setting a maximum five-year commitment for acquisition programmes (three years for digital) is new, but it is not clear how this will be enabled or enforced. And, how will a thematic (as opposed to domain-centric) approach to capability development contribute to the improvements sought, and how will this work in practice? Further detail and clearer plans will be required to measure progress towards achieving these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his annual RUSI lecture in December 2022, the Chief of the Defence Staff foreshadowed a major drive to increase the productivity of the armed forces through greater levels of lethality and readiness. We had expected to see more detail in the DCPR, but Chapter 4 does not provide this clarity. Improving operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness has featured in every major post-Cold War defence review. Unless a markedly different approach is taken this time, it is difficult to see how the DCPR will deliver decisive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are encouraged to see that work is now underway to review the current Defence Operating Model. In our view, the recommendations of the 2011 Levene report on Defence Reform were applied in a one-sided manner. The delegation of financial authority to the Commands was not accompanied by the strengthening of the corporate framework and the Centre of the Department which Levene had envisaged – resulting in an erosion of financial discipline and a model which is ill-suited to making the defence-wide adjustments that the contemporary strategic context requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2--operational-ambition&quot;&gt;Part 2 – Operational Ambition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the debate over UK defence and security policy during the seven years since the Brexit referendum, perhaps the most significant phrase in the DCPR is: “… we will develop a force that is optimised to warfight in the Euro-Atlantic and in defence of our homeland”. Such clarity is overdue and very welcome – as is the focus on deterrence in Chapter 5. This paper follows the IRR in speaking of “An Integrated Approach to Deterrence and Defence”; why both documents could not have used the simpler US formula of “Integrated Deterrence” is a mystery. While the paper updates the reader on the Defence strands of deterrence, it does not adequately fill the gap we identified in the IRR: it says little about the integration of defence and civil capabilities to enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On nuclear, the DCPR notes that “we have… committed to a once-in-two-generations programme of modernisation of our nuclear forces” – a decision taken many years ago which sustains the concept of nuclear deterrence we have had since the late 1990s. Like the IRR, it says little about the fundamental changes in the global strategic balance since then, not least the dramatic growth in China’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening message of Chapter 6 is that the MoD will “evolve” the previous DCP’s concept of “persistent engagement” to a “global campaigning approach”. We expressed some scepticism about the former in our commentary at the time – and the DCPR does not entirely still our doubts. In principle, a “campaigning approach” makes sense. But it is hard to see how Defence will “double the effect that we seek to achieve in the world” by 2030. The specific commitment to create a “Global Response Force” does not appear much different from the Joint Rapid Reaction Force announced in the Strategic Defence Review of 1998 and updated in most of the major reviews since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While it may be true that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is indivisible, it is important that all concerned have a shared understanding of the limits of the military commitment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention to continue to grow the Global Defence Network is welcome. The chapter also records the decision (taken since the previous DCP) to transfer leadership of the Network to Strategic Command – but does not explain how this will make a difference in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures to increase defence exports are sensible, although few are new. UK defence exports appear to have grown significantly during the international turbulence since the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine. But some of the longer-term trends may be less favourable, including the increasing demand from key customer states for higher levels of indigenous development and production. A more penetrating examination of this area will be required in the next review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7 covers international relationships. One of the UK’s strengths, in contrast to its adversaries, is its extensive array of alliances and partnerships. Bringing this subject to life without descending into a long list of friendly states around the globe is a familiar editorial and diplomatic challenge. The most striking features are the resurfacing of the EU and the space given to the Five Eyes and other Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We applaud the renewed acknowledgement of the importance of the EU to UK security: “The UK will use the new momentum in the relationship to develop forms of direct cooperation, as we already intend to do through the PESCO project on military mobility”. A key task will be to ensure that the UK is not frozen out of EU capability cooperation programmes which would benefit UK Defence in the round, including the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be true in one sense that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is indivisible, it will be important that all concerned have a shared understanding of the limits of the military commitment. The DCPR manages to tread this fine line, including by apparently stepping back from the somewhat bolder language in the March 2023 AUKUS statement on the deployment of submarines to Western Australia. Continuing to tread this line successfully in the future will be testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language on Strategic Resilience in Chapter 8 is the clearest sign yet that the MoD has fully absorbed its importance in an era of great power confrontation. We welcome the commitment to work with other government departments to implement the government’s 2022 Resilience Strategy. This will be a huge undertaking, made more challenging by the state of the economy and the public finances. The skills and capabilities of the UK’s armed forces are widely acknowledged. But the MoD will need to strike a balance between playing its full part and recognising where the lead falls to other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis placed on the Reserves is striking. Finding a way to make service in the Voluntary Reserves more attractive, particularly to young people of all backgrounds, should be a priority. The MoD should expand on its plans to turn the ex-regular reserve forces into a “Strategic Reserve”. We have always found it odd that so little use is made of ex-regular forces for defence purposes, even though adequate incentives and the cooperation of civilian employers would be a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where the MoD will need to elaborate publicly on its plans is the commitment to introducing an integrated air and missile defence system. Questions include how the maximum benefit will be secured from close engagement with NATO’s system, and how it will improve the dispersibility of UK forces for self-protection, given the substantial contraction in the number of airbases and other defence sites in recent decades. We wonder whether the MoD really has the bandwidth to engage effectively in the range of resilience-related activities mentioned in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been relatively little commentary on the DCPR, likely because of the timing of its publication, but also due to its modest content. The MoD did not expect to have to update the 2021 DCP so quickly – although the history of defence planning suggests this was likely. As this article has brought out, the DCPR contains a range of worthy ideas but sparse detail on how these will be delivered, so leaves many questions unanswered. There will be important decisions on force structure, capabilities and planning approaches to be made in the 2025 review. Whether that review leads to the acceleration of plans to further modernise the UK’s armed forces and wider defence capabilities will depend on whether the incoming government decides to make further significant investment in defence. No doubt preparatory work is underway in the MoD to make the case for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0m9XZ9k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第109天。前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，就他拒任鄭達鴻第二，但其後改參選超區，李解釋自己想做立法會議員，但「排第二係唔會做到」，而當時譚文豪曾問他參選意向。李指曾與譚會面，提及他所倡的政策理念或與公民黨否決所有撥款和議案的立場有出入，譚指他可繼續講其主張，李理解其言下之意是黨就否決的立場「有彈性」、他成功出線再算。李其後申請黨內「徵召機制」參選超區被拒，理解黨因他勝算不高無法全數資助其40萬初選經費。不過李於6.12一周年涉非法集結被捕後，獲告知引起黨內高層和黨員關注，並獲得捐獻，黨遂重新考慮支持他出選，李終於6月19日宣布參選，但於初選落敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，李指與他無關，因他當時並非公民黨潛在候選人，「我冇去關心」；而他無出席過協調會議，決定參選後不知道初選規則，向黨查詢方獲告知超區「坐三望四」，理解是協調目標。李亦指，提及否決財案的選舉單張為公民黨共用，但《國安法》後無再派發亦刪去相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問為何改選超區-李稱想做立會議員但排第二係唔會做到&quot;&gt;被問為何改選超區 李稱想做立會議員但「排第二係唔會做到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨東區區議員李予信今繼續作供，他昨供稱，曾拒絕參選港島的前黨友鄭達鴻提議排其名單第二，但其後報名黨內「徵召機制」參選超區。法官李運騰關注李曾告訴鄭他想專注地區工作，但兩三星期後突然又下定決心獨自參選，為何會有此心意的改變？李欲回答時，法官押至今處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李今解釋，「其實當時我可以形容我係想做立法會議員」，而與之前心態不同在於「排第二係唔會做到立法會議員嘅」。李並指，他想做立會議員是因當時或因社會政治氣氛較緊張，政府代表不太聆聽區議員意見；他亦望為被政府於抗疫基金遺忘的業界爭取撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨高層找人填補黃文萱位置-譚文豪曾問他有無意向參選&quot;&gt;李稱黨高層找人填補黃文萱位置 譚文豪曾問他有無意向參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，就時任公民黨沙田區議員黃文萱原欲參選超區但及後退出，他5月最後一星期得悉黨高層正找人填埔黃的位置，而當時譚文豪曾致電他，言下之意問他有無意向參選超區，李回答「有」，並談及一系列政策和問題想透過立法會處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指一兩日後，應在5月27至30日之間，譚相約他到其立法會議員辦事處再傾談，李指會面很短暫，他向譚指有一系列政策和理念想透過立法會選舉說出來，惟它們有機會與早前黨稱否決所有撥款和議案的主張「有出入」，「簡單啲嚟講我係要錢，而之前黨有啲講法就係反對撥款，即係唔要錢，但我選舉嘅主線將會係不斷講一啲需要錢嘅項目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指其政綱要錢與黨有矛盾-理解譚文豪言下之意有彈性&quot;&gt;李指其政綱「要錢」與黨有矛盾 理解譚文豪言下之意有彈性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李記得譚回應，「選超區呢最緊要嘅係知名度，而依樣嘢係我當其時欠缺嘅」，故譚建議他應好好運用他「社工區議員」及「街頭藝術舞蹈家」的兩個身分，「因為佢知道我跳咗十幾年街舞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，就其政策和理念與黨說法有矛盾，譚無正面去解決，但譚有提及「你可以繼續講你想爭取嘅嘢」，因這些東西與其身分有很密切的關係。李理解譚言下之意，是黨就否決所有撥款和議案的立場「係有彈性嘅，亦都唔係一個已經決定咗或者係好實在嘅一個講法，係一個 undecided 嘅議題」，譚亦認為「我成功出線到初選，先至再算啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨因財政和勝算問題-拒絕其徵召機制申請&quot;&gt;李稱黨因財政和勝算問題 拒絕其徵召機制申請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，6月2日中午向公民黨秘事處總行政主任 Pancy Ho 發電郵，提交5個區議員名單報名參與「徵召機制」，其中一位是黃文萱。李6月5日獲確認報名，顯示他是唯一表示有意參加的公民黨區議員。李同日晚上接受公民黨選舉策略委員會的面試，展示政綱及選舉的財政預算和計劃，「因為我當其時希望黨可以資助到我，我冇咁多錢」。李解釋就超區初選和正選分別保守估計需40萬和160萬元，他當時望黨可以全額資助初選，就正選費用則可借貸、如他成功當選再分期付款歸還，但「結果係傾唔成功」，委員會告知他就初選經費，「佢哋 expect 係 grant（資助）7萬蚊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，於6月6日出席諮詢會，向黨內區議員介紹參選理念和政綱，約於6月8日再接受品格審查委員會面試。辯方大律師關文渭指會上是否問及他有否隱瞞的事及可能被對手利用的黑材料，例如有多於一個女朋友，李同意。法官陳慶偉續笑着問：「有多於一個女朋友有什麼問題？（“What’s wrong with more than one girlfriend?”）」多人發笑，陳再說：「如果他是未婚（single），有什麼問題？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，他6月9日收到時任副主席賴仁彪電話，表示經過上述3次面試，「有時黨都要作出一啲困難嘅決定」，並告知李其徵召機制申請不成功。李不記得賴解釋時的確實用字，但「最尾我哋 come up 咗係同財政關係」，理解賴言下之意是勝算和經費上，「個情況就好似一個投資嘅決定咁樣，佢覺得我開出嗰個 financial 嘅要求呢，黨滿足唔到呀。」李認為，初選的40萬資助是「最大嘅問題」，因黨僅可資助其中7萬，其餘33萬需由他向黨借貸。法官陳慶偉問，因李勝算不高，所以黨無法借33萬給他？李答：「我係咁樣理解嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱公民黨於610宣布重啟徵召機制&quot;&gt;李稱公民黨於6.10宣布重啟徵召機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，秘書處於翌日、即6月10日再向所有黨內區議員發電郵公布決定，提及徵召機制再啟動，李撤回申請，李稱「依個係佢哋嘅說法」，並重申前一日與賴仁彪通電話後，「我就知我自己唔能夠代表公民黨參加選舉。」李指他遂重整心態，「決定再做返自己區議員應該做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問及李的財政狀況，李指2019年畢業後至2020年間，主要任陳淑莊兼職助理，月入約6至7千元，亦很偶爾會有街舞表演收入；而他任區議員後月薪約3萬5千元，至2020年6月時銀行存款約有3至5萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道69初選記者會與墨落無關因當時非潛在候選人&quot;&gt;李稱不知道6.9初選記者會、與「墨落」無關因當時非潛在候選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就6月9日初選記者會，李稱當時不知道，亦不知道組織者會上說的話，因當時尚未確認黨是否接納他參選，故只是埋首關於籌備選舉的工作、是「預備埋班去選」的心態，如接納就可「去馬」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒家成等人6月10日晚發起「墨落無悔」聲明，公民黨於翌日中午以黨名義簽署，李亦表示「我沒有參與黨內任何關於『墨落無悔』聲明嘅討論」，與「墨落」無任何關係。陳慶偉問，是因為李在公民黨的階級太低嗎？因他只是支部黨員。李稱是其中一個原因，而且「我當時並不是公民黨嘅潛在候選人，我冇去關心」。李亦同意，他曾於 Facebook 轉發3月25日公民黨記者會帖文，但沒有轉發黨有關「墨落無悔」的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱612一周年被捕後獲捐獻支持-黨重新考慮派他出選超區&quot;&gt;李稱6.12一周年被捕後獲捐獻支持 黨重新考慮派他出選超區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李予信其後為何重新出選超區，鄭達鴻曾供稱李2020年6月12日參與街頭活動「被邀請入警署」後，黨才討論找李參選超區，因黨擔心在街頭「貢獻」不足，想被攻擊時「可以有呢樣嘢講出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信今指2020年6月12日，即6.12一周年紀念日，有北角街坊向他表示「佢啲仔女都落咗去」，而在場很多防暴警察、他很擔心，故「叫我去睇吓」。李遂去了銅鑼灣，及後被警方以非法集結罪名拘捕，李稱當晚是用區議員身分到場，惟法官李運騰打斷指不是要就該案審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ex5meLG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月12日 李予信於銅鑼灣被捕（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，其後被帶到東區醫院，獲公民黨三名律師楊岳橋、梁嘉善和彭皓昕探望，他翌日獲得警署擔保。法官李運騰問李予信之後參選超區，與被捕有關嗎？李指有關係，提及是「基於警暴」；又指賴仁彪其後致電他，指李被捕後引起了一些黨內高層和黨員關注，故有一些來自他們的捐獻支持李出選超區，「所以之前呢，因為財政理由退出呢，而家黨就可以重新考慮，去解決我之前嘅財政問題，支持我出選超區」，賴並提及因有捐獻，故可達到李當初提出40萬的財政要求，意味李初選可獲得全數資助，而賴「冇多講勝算」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知初選規則曾向黨查詢-獲告知超區民主派坐三望四&quot;&gt;李稱不知初選規則曾向黨查詢 獲告知超區民主派「坐三望四」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，賴仁彪其後「要好從速咁 resume（重啟）返嗰個徵召機制嘅程序」，李亦要再取得15名黨內區議員支持和再辦多一次區議員大會。李指當時並不知道初選的規則，亦無出席5月13日的超區初選協調會議，而他曾於6月17日向公民黨秘書處總幹事、「大內總管」歐飛發訊息稱：「HI AUFEI，有點急…我想知道超區初選既規則係點？我係阿信」，庭上展示相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當時是與賴仁彪通電話兩三日後，他正「好急咁籌備緊我要參加超區初選」，而李當時就初選規則的概念是每區均有目標議席，並要就該目標做決定。李指發訊息後，歐飛即時致電他講解初選規則的前設，指超區形勢是民主派在五席內可「坐三望四」，視乎建制派出多少張名單，而第五張名單不可報名，且投票率要夠高等。李指他曾追問「條數點計」，歐飛着他找賴仁彪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示公民黨區議員群組的紀錄，顯示6月18日賴仁彪曾發訊息提及「早前李予信議員曾表達有意參加區二立選，但由於經濟負擔問題，所以主動要求中止程序。612晚上阿信被無理拘捕事件得到極大關注，有心人得知阿信出現選舉經費問題，因而向他表達願意捐款支持鼓勵他重新考慮出選。立法會黨團及候選人即時作出討論，並支持重啟相關程序」，並重新安排於6月18日及23日舉行區議員諮詢會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李619首次公開宣布參加初選無提及否決預算案&quot;&gt;李6.19首次公開宣布參加初選、無提及否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後於6月19日發訊息予賴仁彪，問「我想知道更詳細取四席條數係點計」，賴遂將一份公民黨有關超區選情內部分析的簡報發給他。李同日出席公民黨於中環的初選街站，首次公開宣布參加初選，並指當時從無講過否決預算案，街站發言期間亦無人提及，但其後的問答環節有人提及。李同日於 Facebook 發文宣布參選，但同樣無提過否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱國安法前就初選投票拍片-事前僅獲發自己講稿無參與發布決定&quot;&gt;李稱《國安法》前就初選投票拍片 事前僅獲發自己講稿、無參與發布決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就公民黨7月10日在 Facebook 發布的「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」片段，楊岳橋片中承諾若特首未能落實五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府法案和預算，鄭達鴻曾稱片段講稿因《國安法》作出刪改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，公民黨秘書處職員「KAYEE」於6月19日曾發訊息給他，提到就初選投票拍片，並通知李和楊岳橋、譚文豪、鄭達鴻及郭家麒5名參選人於翌日拍攝的時間地點。李指拍攝前獲發他自己的講稿，不知道其他人確實會說什麼，但據其認知均是教人投票的內容，而當天到達時鄭達鴻剛拍攝完成。李並指由拍攝片段至發布期間，均無看過片段成品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示第八次選舉經理會議紀錄，提及「投票片改了兩轉，預計不遲於7月2日提供 third cut，予選舉經理人提供意見」，李指他沒有出席，只有其選舉經理和代理人出席，但無印象獲告知會上情況，亦無參與片段發布的決定、沒有被諮詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱單張提否決財案為公民黨共用國安法後無再派發並修改單張&quot;&gt;李稱單張提否決財案為公民黨共用、《國安法》後無再派發並修改單張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格，理解當中「支持和認同戴耀廷和區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，意思是民主派需要有個協調，並聯想到早前向歐飛和賴仁彪查詢超區協調目標，應是「坐三望四」，「咁我係認同呢個目標嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並確認，表格附有寫上「越打壓 越頑強」及他大頭照的政綱，提到公民黨將全力爭取議會過半35+，「以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」。李指該政綱是公民黨「中央 share 用嘅政綱」，「我記得黨亦都提，交表嘅時候係用呢個政綱」，李當時亦無其他現成已設計好的政綱可以用。李並解釋5月底時已醞釀政綱的意念與倡議，至6月13日得悉可出選後就「同 designer 去夾」，當時是「一路設計緊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續同意，初選超區 WhatsApp 群組於6月24日建立，他是群組成員之一，但群組內無提及否決預算案。而他6月27日將設計好的單張分兩批付印，首批1,000份於6月28至29日的街站「派咗七至八成左右」，至於另外5,000份於6月30日中午才可領取，但最終他「一張都冇派到」，解釋因當時有消息指晚上《國安法》將出爐，故決定晚上「觀察住嗰個法例嘅條文，睇吓有啲咩事發生」。李最終一直保管餘下未派的單張及5,000份單張，直至被捕，亦僅就首1,000份單張、而非5,000份單張申報選舉開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示該款單張，寫有「顛覆想像」，同樣提及公民黨將全力爭取議會過半35+，以關鍵否決權促使政府落實「五大訴求」。李重申該內容是其團隊「從黨公用嘅 template 攞返嚟」，並於《國安法》前設計和印刷。李續指，《國安法》後曾修改單張，無再提及以否決權促使政府回應五大訴求，並修改部分字眼，他於7月3日分批印刷共14,000份，全部派畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱初選論壇從無倡否決財案-初選落敗得票僅2&quot;&gt;李稱初選論壇從無倡否決財案 初選落敗得票僅2%&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信其後於7月4日出席初選論壇，同意論壇上從來無倡議否決預算案，而會上鄺俊宇曾問李是否願意入議會提倡社會福利政策幫助基層，李表示當然願意，又提及社福政策最大的流弊，「我覺得一筆過撥款係毀滅咗好多社工嘅夢想，係對於好多嘅社福界嘅機構、高層同前線出現矛盾，呢個係一定要喺議會入面繼續去跟進」，又指作為議員，「市民嘅福祉一定係要我哋去捍衛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6kY27lr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄺俊宇（左）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，於7月11至12日初選投票日，附在提名表格的政綱並無張貼於票站外，而是如鄭達鴻早前供述改為「無字政綱」。鄭作供時曾展示該單張，寫有「以言入罪 無字政綱 SPEECH CRIMES ARE AGAINST FREEDOM」。而李最終於初選落敗，只有2%得票，他並於7月15日記者會公開宣布不會競逐超級區議會正式選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第108天。參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信今開始作供，表示2016年因協助公民黨立會競選而接觸鄭達鴻等人，並於2018年底獲鄭邀請參選北角錦屏區，遂加入公民黨成為支部黨員，並成功當選。惟李指支部黨員權力受限，不能出席會員大會及投票、不能參選執委等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨提及否決預算案的3月25日記者會，李稱獲秘書處通知出席，指是呼籲選民登記，他認為理所當然要幫手；並形容會上得到「混合嘅訊息」，一方面楊岳橋等提出否決所有撥款，但郭家麒則稱若預算案合理會支持。李並指當時「我從來冇表達過，亦都冇諗過參與該屆嘅立法會選舉」，他會上也無發言。而李會後曾出席公民黨「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」會議，李指當時有如「新入公司嘅員工，入咗一間高層嘅房」，他僅曾就疫情議題發言一次，亦無人向他解釋過邀請他出席上述記招和會議的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信開始作供-稱2016年獲鄭達鴻邀請代表公民黨參選區議員&quot;&gt;李予信開始作供 稱2016年獲鄭達鴻邀請代表公民黨參選區議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的李予信今開始作供，接受大律師關文渭主問。李今身穿黑色上衣、深啡色長褸和白色長褲，以基督教宣誓。李確認，1993年生於香港，2020年案發時26歲，明天將踏入30歲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yI5BOiS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同意，於2014年首次接觸政治，他於香港大學專業進修學院（HKU SPACE）社會科學系副學士畢業後，任街工實習生，主要關注基層和勞工權益，同年入讀中大社會學系，翌年轉讀社工學系，因「想服務香港年青人同埋基層」。而李大學於公關公司任兼職時，公司於2016年負責公民黨立法會選舉港島區競選工作，參選名單包括陳淑莊和鄭達鴻，而李獲指派與公民黨聯絡，為他與該黨的首次接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，該次選舉後與公民黨「冇好頻密嘅接觸，可能大時大節講一兩句恭賀嘅說話咁」，而他2018年底臨近畢業時思考畢業後的出路，得出結論是他很想做一些與社區或青年政策倡議有關的工作。李並指，當時任東區丹拿選區區議員的鄭達鴻剛好電話聯絡他，表示公民黨正就2019年區議會選舉作準備，認為當時在其選區旁的錦屏區「值得新人去嘗試」，公民黨亦正找人為康怡區的區議員接班。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 陳淑莊（右）與鄭達鴻（左）競選2016年立法會選舉港島區（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，當時鄭邀請他出席一個飯局，與會者包括時任公民黨執委陳淑莊和賴仁彪，席間他們「詳細地傾過個可能」，李最終同意以公民黨名義競逐北角錦屏區，指選擇北角主要基於其工作理念，他望為基層爭取一些資源和為舊區規劃作出一些貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李加入公民黨港島支部-當選區議員後倡政府防疫基金援助被遺漏業界&quot;&gt;李加入公民黨港島支部 當選區議員後倡政府防疫基金援助被遺漏業界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信表示，他當時尚未加入公民黨，而同意參選後第一步便加入成為公民黨香港島支部黨員，並於2018年11月27日收到確認電郵，同意電郵提到一國兩制原則。李並解釋，支部黨員為最基本成員身分，但權力有很多限制，不能出席會員大會及於會上投票、不能參選執委會成員、不能出任黨魁、司庫、秘書長等高級人員職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，他亦成為兼職地區發展主任，指是培養地區工作者的系統，要出席基本社區工作手法、法庭知識、輔導諮詢知識等訓練，並獲公民黨實報實銷資助進行地區服務；他亦於2019年1月任時任立法會議員陳淑莊的兼職議員助理，主要從地區接收投訴轉介立法會及處理文件等支援工作。李同年5月完成大學課程，7月21日成為註冊社工：「我喺19年7.21朝頭早收到社工證。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後於11月當選為東區錦屏選區區議員，指他上任前民建聯蔡素玉已於該區任職逾20年，近兩屆均自動當選。而李上任後任東區區議會社會福利及安老事務委員會副主席，曾提倡支援社區創傷、失業援助金等社福政策，亦爭取糖水道天橋拆卸，及處理區內交通擠塞和衞生黑點問題。李又指，2020年初政府發放第一輪防疫抗疫基金，但當時收到一些被遺忘的行業投訴，包括藝術團體、健身中心、舞台工作者、技藝教育中心如跳舞學校和拳館等，嘗試游說政府將援助覆蓋支援他們營運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知325記者會前有籌備會議-獲悉記招呼籲選民登記無需發言&quot;&gt;李稱不知3.25記者會前有籌備會議 獲悉記招呼籲選民登記、無需發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨3月25日舉行記者會，時任黨魁楊岳橋曾承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，會否決所有政府議案、撥款及預算案致特首下台。李予信確認有出席該次記者會，但對鄭達鴻早前供稱會前曾舉辦籌備會議並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，記者會前一日，一名公民黨秘書處女員工電話通知他出席，介紹是一個呼籲選民登記的記招，因當時選民登記將截止，有逼切性呼籲大家盡快登記。李指聽到介紹後，「我就覺得好理所當然要幫手嘅，因為我係新任嘅區議員，咁登記選民呢啲咁地區性嘅嘢，從來都係地區工作者去做」，故他很快答應出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，當時公民黨有32名區議員，但不知道他被揀選出席記招的原因，稱「冇人同我解釋過個原因」。而該員工亦無詳細講誰會於記者會發言、會傳遞什麼訊息，並指他並無需於會上發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問，李於記者會前一天才突被要求出席，該記者會對他來說是完全意料之外（surprise）？李說「其實唔會好愕然嘅」，解釋黨很多時辦記招或街站等活動，也會邀請一些成員去撐場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱出席記招時從無表達亦無想過參與立法會選舉&quot;&gt;李稱出席記招時從無表達亦無想過參與立法會選舉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續確認，記者會出席者包括時任立法會議員郭家麒、楊岳橋、郭榮鏗、譚文豪、黨主席梁家傑，東區區議員鄭達鴻、沙田區議員黃文萱、油尖旺區議員余德寶，及擬參選立法會飲食界的林瑞華和大律師梁嘉善。而當時立法會議員坐前排手持「35+選民登記生成器」的紙牌；李予信和鄭達鴻等則站在後排，手持「35+議會過半，實現五大訴求」的紙牌。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年3月25日 公民黨記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，出席記招時仍是公民黨支部黨員身分，解釋章程規定支部黨員要最少成為12個月才有資格成為普通黨員，且要申請才做到，而他當時無申請，但同意無規定支部黨員不可參選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各出席者，李指黃文萱無參加初選，但其後有報名新界東正式選舉；余德寶當時無表明有意參選，「佢同我一樣都冇發言，淨係企咗喺後面」，並約於5月「公開講到明唔會參與」。他不記得梁嘉善當時是否黨員，亦不知她會否參選立法會，而梁最終無參加初選，但後被黨徵召於7月31日報名參選新界西，他不知道原因。至於李本人，他指當時「我從來冇表達過，亦都冇諗過參與該屆嘅立法會選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱記者會訊息混合-楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款-郭家麒稱不會&quot;&gt;李稱記者會訊息「混合」 楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款 郭家麒稱不會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，當時從記者會得到一個「混合嘅訊息」，一方面清晰聽到楊岳橋、郭榮鏗、譚文豪3人提到反對所有法案、議案和撥款，要政府回應五大訴求，並提到《基本法》就否決預算案後安排的規定。但另一方面郭家麒發言時「好強調財政預算案嘅合理性」，舉例「如果撥款係胡亂畀警察嘅開支嘅話呢、如果唔合理的話呢，咁議員係有責任否決」；但「如果預算案係合理、得到市民支持嘅話呢，無論選到35席40席呢，其實都會支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0cm3fqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 郭家麒（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦指，林瑞華當時發言「有一個位好觸動到我」，指林提及「政府啱啱提出一個荒謬嘅禁酒令」，而李正幫助的被遺忘的業界也受政府停業令影響，故很明白林所說的「業界利益」。李續指，總括而言他會上聽到一些關於否決所有撥款的說法，但似乎郭家麒又不會否決所有撥款的說法，而林瑞華則爭取業界支持，故形容當時記者會訊息「混合」，「但有一個一致嘅訊息就係，要政府聆聽民意同埋選民登記」。李並同意，他在黨內年資很淺，會上無反對楊岳橋等人說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱獲邀出席心戰室核心小組會議-理解與選民登記及樁腳有關&quot;&gt;李稱獲邀出席「心戰室核心小組」會議 理解與選民登記及「樁腳」有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信續表示，記者會後，被秘書處職員邀請出席3月30日的「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」第三次會議，除鄭達鴻和梁家傑外，曾出席記者會的人士均有參與，亦有其他區議員。被問會議目的，李指大意是記者會後「可能有啲嘅檢討同埋有啲嘅工作」，而因有些工作應與他有關，故答應出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示會議紀錄，李表示於事後看過「心戰室核心小組」的名字，理解是關於立法會選舉籌備的討論、或一些論述思考上的會議，但當時他理解「係同我距離有啲遠嘅，因為我只係一個上任3個月嘅區議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，李知道他為何被邀請出席嗎？李指有兩個理解，首先他出席了3月25日記者會，記得楊岳橋有提及他身後有一些新的區議員，「佢哋係可以幫大家做選民登記」；其次是在傳統立法會選舉，區議員有機會做「樁腳」的角色，需在選舉時做一些地區上的支持，「呢兩個就係我當其時諗到我自己嘅身分同立法會選舉有關係嘅地方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會議如新入職員工進入高層房-僅發言一次&quot;&gt;李稱會議如新入職員工進入高層房 僅發言一次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就紀錄提及「與會者同意，現階段公民黨可透過發表文章，進一步闡述星期三記招的論述」，並提及由黃文萱發表文章。李解釋當時輿論不斷講議會價值、亦有非建制派政治人物提過「議會係冇用」，故會上應有探討如何將議會價值透過文章彰顯出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續指，參與者發言均會被記錄，但看不到李發言的紀錄。法官陳仲衡指「與會者同意」一句，李會是其中一個同意的人。李續解釋，「其實嗰一日嘅會議呢，我可以形容為好似一個新入公司嘅員工，入咗一間高層嘅房⋯⋯咁呢間房入面就有啲立法會議員講緊啲立法會層次上嘅大事啦，咁我當其時其實就真係坐喺度㗎啫，咁我記得我唯一一個發言嘅時候呢，就係喺後面嘅」，而就「與會者同意」的部分，他印象中無任何決議過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，但李予信同意應再發文闡述立場？李指當時理解每個記招後都會有文章解釋黨的發言和論述，認為「係一個好平常嘅工作」，亦無任何異議，但當時無跟進、不清楚黃文萱有否撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道屬哪個團隊&quot;&gt;李稱不知道屬哪個團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡關注紀錄亦提到「各團隊」，李指理解是不同立法會選區候選人的工作團隊。陳問李屬於那隊？李說：「我唔知道我係邊個團隊。」李運騰續指李是東區區議員，看來屬於港島團隊，李表示「其實呢個團隊冇一個好官方嘅認證，你係咪一個團隊嘅意思」，又指他有機會是港島區的「樁腳」，但在會議紀錄的文字上「我唔清楚佢係咪 regard 我 as 嗰個團隊嘅一員」。李並指，不知道會議紀錄是草稿抑或正式紀錄，同意紀錄從鄭達鴻辦公室檢取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會議與選民登記有關喚起關注選舉-官稱有保留&quot;&gt;李稱會議與選民登記有關、喚起關注選舉 官稱有保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引紀錄指，會議是「心戰室核心小組」的第三次會議，李予信此前一定有參與多過一次會議。李不同意，指該會議是他第一次參與，他前兩次無出席；而他是出席會議時才知道他成為了該小組的一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，李指楊岳橋曾稱區議員可幫助選民登記，而他們獲邀出席會議的目的就是幫助選民登記，但會議紀錄卻完全無提過？李指會議紀錄上無，但「口頭上應該有講」，紀錄「未百分百準確」；而他不記得事前有否收過會議議程，但「我理解其實呢個會入面所有嘅討論，都係同選民登記有關係」，因「選民唔會無啦啦走嚟登記」，而是需要一些論述和解釋；又指每區關注議題也有出入，故理解會議存在意義是討論有什麼重點論述可在地區層面解釋給街坊聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，故會議並不是關於選民登記的流程，而是關於更高層面的事？李同意，認為是「喚起關注選舉」的工作層面。陳慶偉指能理解李稱會上討論是為了吸引選民投票支持公民黨，但若李稱該些討論是為了選民登記，他則有保留，並主動稱相信大家均有在街上被人問「先生，登記咗做選民未呀？」的經驗，陳志全、林卓廷等發笑。陳續提高聲線指，「而你不會說『我們想要這、想要那，入到議會我們會做這、做那』，不！我只會給你5秒鐘時間！然後我就會走開。」陳仲衡亦指，李不會告訴選民有關會上討論的「國際戰線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續解釋，在傳統政黨的工作，「我哋會視肯畀我哋吸引登記做選民嘅市民呢，其實好有機會喺將來嘅選舉投返畀我哋。」陳慶偉即高聲說：「為什麼？如果你來問『先生你登記咗未，我依家同你登記』，你怎知道我會投票給你？」李續指據其地區工作經驗，如擺街站幫人登記做選民，區內就會說「阿信幫人登記緊做選民喎」，形容是讓選民知道他在服務選民的其中一個工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無人解釋邀他出席記招或心戰室會議原因&quot;&gt;李稱無人解釋邀他出席記招或心戰室會議原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指假設李所言正確，但這是一個由黨魁主持、有立法會議員和部分區議員出席的高層次會議，關於如何喚起市民關注並幫助黨於立法會選舉的選情，而在公民黨三十多名區議員中，為何會叫作為新人的李予信出席此會議？李說：「冇人去好詳細解釋過點解我喺記招或者呢個 meeting 嘅原因。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會上唯一就疫情影響發言郭家麒曾關注否決財案會否阻礙振興經濟&quot;&gt;李稱會上唯一就疫情影響發言、郭家麒曾關注否決財案會否阻礙振興經濟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信其後補充，登記選民時會向市民點出社會問題如疫情，並闡述議會可幫助解決，有部分是會議上提過的內容。李又指會上唯一一次發言，就是討論到關於疫情後的經濟復蘇時，立法會議員問到地區上有否關於疫情影響的聲音，他遂舉手說有，並提及有接觸被防疫基金「遺忘」的業界代表，有相約他們去立法會開會，將有行動向政府爭取援助。法官李運騰再質疑與選民登記有何關係，李稱與登記流程關連不大，但與論述層面有很密切關連，同意是爭取社會對黨的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李欲再解釋時，法官陳慶偉打斷問及相關性，李運騰亦指認為辯方意圖顯示被告曾提出需政府支持的方案，他想與政府合作而非反政府，指法庭已理解。李亦確認，郭家麒會上曾提及，「民主派否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求的策略，會否阻礙振興經濟的措施，建議要求政府將警察的撥款用作救市，以爭取市民支持」，亦吻合他在記招說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無收過心戰室核心小組會議紀錄&quot;&gt;李稱無收過「心戰室核心小組」會議紀錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後再質疑，會議紀錄提到設計選舉文宣、開設選舉經理群組等事項，問李予信是否同意選民登記是會上次要關注，首要關注是公民黨如何於立法會爭取更多議席？李不同意，指選民登記與立法會得票和策略上的考量其實並非互相排斥，「喺思緒上係要統一咁去考量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，會後無收過這份會議紀錄，他是被捕後開審才在審訊文件夾看到；又指之後有去過多於一次「心戰室核心小組」會議，但「依一刻事隔三年之後，我的確係唔記得咗」。李又指，就所有會議均從無收過會議紀錄，理解紀錄「唔係畀我哋睇」，是供秘書處職員存檔及執行，像他這種參與者「記得有咩要做就自己去做」，如就介紹選民登記的原因和論述「用個腦記住就得喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N2OxQba.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第108天。李予信繼續作供，表示參選港島的前黨友、同案被告鄭達鴻，曾於2020年4至5月問他「（港島名單）排佢第二好唔好」，二人曾探討該可能性；惟李認為自己剛任區議員，忙於處理地區工作，如還要頻密落區派傳單，難以發揮其工作理念關注的議題，終在5月中向鄭表示不想做第二，並退出其選舉預備工作。李續指，其後前黨友黃文萱決定不參選超級區議會，他並於6月初報名黨內「徵召機制」參選超區。法官關注，李曾告訴鄭達鴻自己想專注地區工作，但兩至三星期後突然又下定決心獨自參選，為何會有此心意的改變？李欲回答時，法官打斷問答案是否很長，辯方確認，法官遂押至明早處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信稱曾探討正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二的可能-但無協議&quot;&gt;李予信稱曾探討正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二的可能 但無協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，李的前黨友、鄭達鴻早前曾稱，李予信於3月至5月時原排其港島名單第二。李予信今指，二人「冇一個協議，只係一個可能性嘅探討」，該討論應於4至5月中進行，「有一次鄭達鴻同我講過，排佢第二好唔好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ccfVTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（左）、李予信（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注李是於初選抑或正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二，李指他當時知道公民黨會參加初選，但鄭問他時無指明是初選還是正式選舉，「我淨係得悉到排第二就係9月嗰個（正式）選舉係排第二，我冇深究過關於初選嘅事情」，理解鄭是談及正式選舉。陳仲衡指，但要參與正式選舉，二人都要參加初選？李指當時是這樣猜測，「但係實質上冇人同我傾過關於初選嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，最終於5月中，「我係冇同意做佢嘅第二」，不過該討論無向公眾公布，只有公民黨內部得知，他不清楚當時黨高層如何看，亦無從得知他們有否被通知，但當時猜測可能會有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;公民黨5月特別會員大會通過出選名單-鄭達鴻無安排名單第二&quot;&gt;公民黨5月特別會員大會通過出選名單 鄭達鴻無安排名單第二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，5月30日公民黨召開特別會員大會，他以無投票權的支部黨員身分列席。辯方展示會議紀錄，李確認有收過，會上楊岳橋宣布原有意參選超區的黃文萱決定退出，最終通過6張出選名單，其中鄭達鴻出選港島區，但沒有安排名單第二的人選，至於梁嘉善則排新東第二位，與李今早稱終報名參選新西不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x2hxbFI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁嘉善（左）、黃文萱（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄亦顯示，會上授權執委會在無法召開特別會員大會時，決定候選人最後出選名單，主席梁家傑並匯報公民黨已參與了35+計劃，並指2019年12月成立的選舉策略委員會，會繼續尋找參選超區和替補的Plan B候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱因剛上任忙地區工作遂不排鄭達鴻第二-惟與黃文萱不選超區無關係&quot;&gt;李稱因剛上任忙地區工作遂不排鄭達鴻第二 惟與黃文萱不選超區無關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黃文萱不再參選超區，李予信指於5月最後一個星期，已從公民黨立法會議助聽到「阿萱唔選喇」。李運騰問，而李不屬於公民黨高層人員的圈子？李說：「係，我唔屬於嗰個圈，因為我只係支部嘅會員」，同意高層會比他更早知道該消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，李予信不做鄭達鴻的名單第二，與黃文萱退選超區有關係嗎？李表示沒有關係，「但係又有啲時間上嘅巧合，都影響咗我之後嘅少少決定」，解釋5月中時曾向鄭達鴻表示「其實我就想唔做第二」，因他剛上任要處理很多地區和抗疫支援工作，很忙碌，而當時只有他與全職助理兩人，「其實都好吃力，如果我仲要好頻密做一啲落區派傳單嘅工作呢，其實我覺得喺工作理念上，唔係好發揮得到我當時關注嘅議題」，因此向鄭交代後，「我就退出咗佢個團隊喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，李予信說退出團隊，即曾經加入？李指「團隊」並非「一個好official嘅認證」，指鄭有一個一起工作的選舉群組，「如果我探討緊參選可能嘅時候，都會接觸到嗰個團體」，而他最後是退出鄭的「選舉預備工作」，至5月尾就有議助傳出黃文萱不再選超區的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李確認終循徵召機制報名超區-官問為何有心意改變&quot;&gt;李確認終循「徵召機制」報名超區 官問為何有心意改變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示由公民黨秘事處總行政幹事於5月31日，向所有公民黨區議員發出題為「2020年立法會換屆選舉啟動徵召機制」的電郵，邀請他們參選超級區議會，並指有意參加者須於6月2日下午3時前收集5名區議員的支持，其後要接受面試並出席諮詢會，向所有黨內區議員介紹政綱和宣言，並要於6月9日前提交15個區議員的書面支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他有回覆表示有意參選，於6月2日提交一個5名區議員的名單，表示有興趣參與該「徵召機制」，並於3日後獲回覆確認收到報名。法官李運騰問，李予信於兩日內要找5人支持，時間很緊迫，而他其後要再找多至少10人支持，且全部須為區議員？李予信一一同意。李予信續同意他是「好新」的黨員，李運騰問，那獲得15人支持是否容易？李予信說「都要花啲時間」。李運騰再問，而這需要他的一些決心？李予信回應：「都可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問：「你兩三星期前才告訴鄭達鴻你想專注地區工作，但兩三星期後突然又下定決心參選，而且還是獨自參選，為何會有這個心意的改變（change of heart）？」李說：「我可以解釋，正如……」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷問是否很長，關文渭笑言非常長。法官遂將案件押至明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 August, the G20’s Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting convened for the last time under the current Indian presidency. Unsurprisingly, asset recovery was a key area of focus for the G20 participants. Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to making the recovery and return of proceeds of crime a key policy objective – both at the domestic level by enforcing effective legal powers, tools and measures, and at the international level via effective coordination and communication, and timely execution of cross-jurisdictional asset recovery requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that asset recovery has been a hot topic in the world of financial crime over the last year. From Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, which led many G20 countries to step up their response to the proceeds of crime, to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) increased interest in the topic, organisations and governments across the world have committed to increasing their efforts to recover stolen assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are multiple reasons why policymakers should be paying more attention not only to catching criminals, but also to recovering the assets they’ve stolen. Recovering assets from criminals is an effective deterrent, underlying the principle that crime does not – or should not – pay. For countries that have been decimated by corrupt politicians, recovered assets can be reinvested in education, infrastructure and other projects, increasing public trust and strengthening the rule of law and democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G20 has a crucial role to play in global asset recovery efforts, not least as G20 countries are very often the destination of choice for plundered assets. The lack – or inefficacy – of asset recovery and return mechanisms has a devastating impact on the economies of the countries from which the assets are originally stolen: it halts growth, increases inequalities and corrupts democratic processes. There is, therefore, a moral imperative for G20 countries to boost their efforts in relation to asset recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-g20s-approach-to-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;The G20’s Approach to Asset Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopes were high when India was placed at the helm of the G20. The country had previously argued for the inclusion of asset recovery in the G20’s anti-corruption commitments in 2018. Under the Indian presidency, “strengthening asset recovery mechanisms related to corruption” has been identified as one of the priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment is echoed at the global level by the FATF’s approach to enhancing global asset recovery mechanisms. Last year, the FATF and Interpol announced an initiative to upscale the global response to asset recovery and “to deprive criminals of their dirty money”. This includes revising the FATF’s Recommendations 4 and 38, a long overdue action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite some improvement over the last 15 years, it is clear that current international asset recovery mechanisms are still not good enough&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time, however, that asset recovery has been a focus of the G20. In 2011, the G20 adopted nine principles on asset recovery. Inter alia, the principles require countries to make asset recovery a policy priority, implement legislation to support the application of global anti-money laundering standards, establish a wide range of legislative options for asset recovery, and adopt laws that facilitate international cooperation. Under the Indian presidency, resources have been collated from a small number of G20 countries (currently Canada, Mexico, Turkey and India) to provide step-by-step guides to asset tracing, requesting mutual legal assistance and asset recovery in each jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, G20 countries have been engaged in many initiatives to improve global asset recovery mechanisms, focused in particular on the sharing of information and expertise. For example, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil are members of the GAFILAT Asset Recovery Network which was established in 2009 to facilitate the identification, tracing and recovery of criminal proceeds. Data shows an increased number of consultations since the network’s inception, especially in relation to drug-trafficking offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these actions are commendable. However, despite some improvement over the last 15 years, it is clear that current international asset recovery mechanisms are still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-current-state-of-asset-recovery-in-the-g20&quot;&gt;Assessing the Current State of Asset Recovery in the G20&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While asset recovery is undeniably a key area of focus for G20 countries, at the national level the results still leave much to be desired. The latest FATF Mutual Evaluation Reports (MER) for some G20 countries provide a mixed picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, for example, has a moderate effectiveness rating on issues related to asset confiscation. The authorities have managed to demonstrate positive results in the recovery of proceeds of crime, particularly in the areas of fraud and economic crime. However, wider efforts on recovering assets from state capture and proceeds moved to other countries have been less successful and have only been undertaken more recently. Following its mutual evaluation, South Africa was grey-listed by the FATF; as part of its action plan, it has to address issues around enhancing the identification, seizure and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of a wider range of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Indonesia has also achieved a moderate level of effectiveness on asset confiscation according to the FATF. One of the key elements of the country’s anti-financial crime strategy is optimising asset recovery, and while the authorities do pursue illicit assets laundered abroad, the amounts effectively recovered transnationally are low. The most recent Mutual Evaluation Report shows the assets that have been repatriated to victims in cash, which amounted to only €4.75 million from 2017 to early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While new laws to boost recovery are welcome, what is needed from Global North countries is operational capacity and a willingness to engage with “victim” countries in the Global South&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the European level, MONEYVAL, the Council of Europe’s anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing body, warned in its annual report for 2022 that the recovery of proceeds of crime against states is insufficient. According to its chair, Elżbieta Frankow-Jaśkiewicz, there is an “urgent need for [European countries] to greatly improve their results in confiscating and managing criminal assets, adopt stricter sanctions and increase the number of convictions for serious money laundering offences”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs that some G20 members are listening to calls for better international cooperation and providing increased assistance to developing countries. In November 2022, France introduced a mechanism aimed at returning the proceeds of the sale of illicit assets that have been confiscated in the country. The law enables the state of origin to make requests for mutual legal assistance for the return of assets. States can now bring an action before French courts to seek redress and have rights of ownership – this can be done via the opening of an independent investigation in France or by starting civil proceedings. While new laws to boost recovery are welcome, however, what is needed from Global North countries is operational capacity and a willingness to engage with “victim” countries in the Global South. This is currently one of the main weaknesses of G20 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exception, Italy, has been regarded by many as a “beacon” for asset recovery efforts. Italians understood quite early on that mafia members could still operate from inside prison walls. What really hurt them was taking their assets. The country is now one of the leaders in the recovery of assets globally and has created dedicated asset recovery liaisons in relevant host countries. Early this year, the country’s Guardia di Finanza also hosted a Learning and Development Forum on behalf of the FATF to share best practices and “make a difference in the fight against financial crime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-more-do-g20-countries-need-to-do&quot;&gt;What More Do G20 Countries Need to Do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was argued in a previous commentary on G7 commitments that stale thinking and paraphrased commitments were the main threat to the group’s efficacy in the fight against illicit finance. The same can be said about the commitments made by the G20. There are clearly pockets of good practice across the G20, and G20 countries are rightly promising higher international standards. But, as ever, these promises need to be followed by concrete action, particularly when it comes to areas where the G20 should excel, like information sharing and international collaboration. The step-by-step guides referenced above are a case in point; so far, only four G20 countries have contributed, but these could prove to be an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As India’s presidency of the G20 comes to a close, its successor, Brazil, should continue to prioritise asset recovery and – in particular – the G20’s commitments around improved international collaboration and coordination. The last Ministerial Meeting noted the countries’ commitment to update their information on existing guides to international cooperation requests, which is a promising start. If asset recovery remains a priority for the G20 – and if G20 countries can deliver on their commitments – the fight against corruption might stand a chance of seeing some much-needed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林前助理、選舉經理陳展浚昨完成主問，今接受控方高級檢控官陳穎琛盤問。陳同意與柯認識十年，被柯邀請作證，自視與柯關係緊密，關心柯亦想幫他。就首次新東協調會議，陳稱柯由區鎮樺通知時間地點，據他所知柯無通知組織者會出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示趙家賢與戴耀廷的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示戴發出的出席者名單包括柯耀林。陳指不清楚戴為何知道柯會出席，陳慶偉問故他稱柯無通知組織者是「揣測」？陳重申以他所知柯沒有告知組織者，「我相信如果有呢件事，佢會同我講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳引柯稱會上提初選目的為五大訴求因爭拗嘥時間提早離場&quot;&gt;陳引柯稱會上提初選目的為五大訴求、因爭拗「嘥時間」提早離場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚昨稱柯當晚提早離開會議並致電他，陳今指柯於8時半致電他，指已得悉初選程序，包括新東初選如何進行，及目標議席「6+1」等3點共識，但無提替補機制；柯並指當時有人應因「恩怨」問題爭執，但因距離遠而「唔係太聽得清楚」，他「唔知道嗰啲人拗緊乜嘢」、「覺得好嘥時間」，故離開會議，有份爭執的包括將軍澳青年力量陳緯烈，陳同意與柯所屬的將軍澳民生關注組是敵對關係（rival）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦指，柯稱會議提及初選其中一個目的是爭取五大訴求，「但冇講過係由邊個講」，據陳所知柯當天於會議亦沒有發言。柯也無提到戴稱會就「共同綱領」討論、能同意的事項會變成文件讓大家簽署，及有與會者提及戴的「攬炒」文章。而陳其後從有出席的區鎮樺，確認當天餘下會議都是爭執，但區沒告知他內容，他亦無問。控方問陳沒興趣知道？陳說「冇回應」，追問下稱他想知但應忘記問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯初選前認識區諾軒戴耀廷-惟無儲存戴電話&quot;&gt;陳稱柯初選前認識區諾軒戴耀廷 惟無儲存戴電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯告知他「民主動力」是會議的主持，但無提過區諾軒。陳確認區是前民主黨員，他和柯於初選前均認識區和有其電話；而柯亦認識戴耀廷，但無將其電話儲存，解釋戴處理票站時曾 WhatsApp 柯，柯向陳展示電話，清晰顯示為電話號碼、無儲存為聯絡人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示從趙家賢手機擷取的新東 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，顯示於6月24日由戴耀廷創立，柯是群組成員。陳慶偉指，明顯地表面看來，戴於柯仍是民主黨成員時就有其電話號碼，因紀錄顯示戴將其電話儲存為「Ricky Or (DPHK)」。陳說不一定，但在法官追問下答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟辯方大律師唐樂山指出，上述紀錄是從趙家賢手機擷取，故是趙儲存柯的電話為「DPHK」，不是戴耀廷。陳慶偉指明顯該紀錄是從趙擷取，但群組是由戴耀廷創立。唐重申電話是由趙儲存，指戴不會將自己命名為「戴耀廷教授（HKU）」，林卓廷大笑，楊雪盈等亦發笑。陳慶偉一度手指向屏幕重申，但群組是由戴創立；李運騰則指紀錄顯示的聯絡人或反映趙而非戴手機，並與陳耳語片刻，陳續說：「好，繼續。（“Right, carry on.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑選舉涉大量金錢-陳卻無派人出席第二次會議&quot;&gt;官質疑選舉涉大量金錢 陳卻無派人出席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二次會議，陳展浚指柯耀林核心團隊大約有12至13人，少數為義工，但柯無派任何代表出席，陳亦沒有安排，解釋當日進行區議會大會，最後三小時大部分動議均由他們提出，而團隊大部分人為西貢區議員，無人手出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉質疑，據早前證供，柯在初選和正式立法會選舉要花共至少180萬，「但你卻沒派任何人出席第二次會議。」陳重申當天的確無人手，而大埔團隊區鎮樺亦同因大埔區議會超時無出席，「我都冇辦法。」陳慶偉再指，但180萬對組織鬆散的區政聯盟而言是很大金額？陳同意，「所以好大機會都係由候選人自己出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指據他所知無第三次新東會議。控方問那他是否從無聽過柯耀林投訴，沒有從組織者收到文件？陳答：「係，但係點解要投訴？」陳慶偉指因組織者處事草率鬆散，「你看，你要花180至250萬在一些沒有白紙黑字紀錄的事上！什麼都沒有（nothing）！」陳稱：「但過去選舉協調嘅情況都係差唔多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯耀林無看戴耀廷和區諾軒文章的習慣和興趣&quot;&gt;陳稱柯耀林無看戴耀廷和區諾軒文章的習慣和興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意，他被指派告知柯耀林最新的政治發展，亦有閱讀有關初選的文章。控方續展示戴耀廷於《蘋果日報》發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉、〈攬炒的定義和時間〉及〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，陳均稱無看過，指他有閱讀《蘋果日報》的習慣，但「專欄比較少睇」、對「蘋果論壇」無甚印象，又指當時不關注由35+組織者發布的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦指他甚少看戴的 Facebook，近年較少看區諾軒文章，他與區關係「一般普通、冇乜特別」；至於柯耀林有否看戴耀廷 Facebook 和區諾軒文章，陳說：「我淨係知佢冇呢個習慣同興趣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aqjrskt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就柯6月討論「墨落」時曾於區政聯盟「2R戰略討論處」群組說：「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」，陳昨稱柯當時感覺戴無再寫文章提及否決預算案。控方質疑即柯有看過戴文章，陳重申柯無看、亦無此習慣和興趣，「總之個講法就係唔覺得新聞再有、或者再有呢啲嘅議題提及過」，「總之係佢有個印象就係唔覺得戴耀廷仲有，冇補充。」陳其後同意法官指，該訊息表面看來柯知道戴以往說過什麼，並指他自己也知道戴以往說過的話，指是來自新聞一般觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組紀錄顯示，柯亦曾發布《蘋果日報》連結，標題為〈【李八方online】素人反枱 民主派初選會拉倒？〉，控方問柯是否主動找初選相關新聞。陳指他「無從判斷」，亦無印象有否打開該連結。李運騰問陳的上司發出連結，有沒有問他為何這樣做？陳笑道：「其實呢件事好小事嚟嘅，每一件事問我開唔開 link 真係冇可能記得。」李再說但這是有關初選，而陳是柯的選舉經理，陳即說：「我諗唔到呢條問題有咩嘢關係」，林卓廷聞言大笑，李運騰說：「可能有人會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認為無需再了解69記者會&quot;&gt;陳認為無需再了解6.9記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就初選記者會，陳表示事前不知道3月26日的記者會，事後「好似喺新聞睇過」，但無告知柯，他在柯出席首次協調會議前亦無任何準備。至於6月9日記者會，陳指有團隊成員將相關訊息轉發至群組，就是他知道的所有詳情。李運騰再問陳作為選舉經理，沒有嘗試再了解記者會發生的事？陳指覺得無此需要，亦認為訊息已如實反映初選如何進行，無需要再向柯作補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱與范國威票源重疊望鬥快簽墨落&quot;&gt;陳稱與范國威票源重疊望鬥快簽「墨落」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明，陳展浚指當時認為鄒家成是發起人，亦知他是新東潛在參選人，他曾透過 Facebook 私訊鄒，問如何加入該聯署及表示有興趣，獲回覆「OK」，但記不起具體時間，亦不能確定是在柯確認簽署前或後。陳亦同意，當時鄒無答他如何加入聯署，他也沒再問，無法肯定是否成功為柯加入聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，似乎其團隊想比范國威和梁國雄更早簽署，因有人於群組提及「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」。陳回應因看到越來越多人簽，「所以先有想同范生鬥快呢個情況」，但指「我從來都冇諗住同阿梁國雄鬥快，個別人有個別意見，我冇辦法代表佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問為何陳想比范國威更早簽署，陳稱范也是將軍澳民生關注組創辦人，基本上與他們票源重疊，票源上是其中一個主要對手。陳慶偉追問，即比范更早簽署，會令其選民轉為支持柯？陳指「我又唔覺得一個聲明嘅威力可以大到咁，只不過係個行為上面可能係快過佢，純粹係一個比較」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ccCLNmw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 范國威（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，團隊當時唯一的考慮，就是要比范國威更快簽署？陳同意，但在李追問下改稱「快過范國威簽係我哋其中一個主要嘅考慮」，而「唔係唯一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯耀林連鄒家成係邊個都唔識無與抗爭派聯繫的想法&quot;&gt;陳稱柯耀林「連鄒家成係邊個都唔識」、無與抗爭派聯繫的想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦表示，當時無向組織者查詢該聲明。控方指他不想知道聲明如何出現？陳指「我唔係唔想」，但似乎無充足時間讓他考慮。陳亦指柯耀林無叫他找更多關於聲明的資料，「佢連鄒家成係邊個都唔識」，並同意柯曾問他誰是鄒家成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並同意，當時為帖文製作圖片，寫有「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」。陳慶偉問將柯與「抗爭派」聯繫是誰的想法，陳說他們無此想法，又指「呢個只不過係聯署帖文嗰張圖，請問法官閣下個關係喺邊度？」。陳其後同意，在「墨落」加名並不會顯示柯與抗爭派有聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱墨落提否決權非共識-官追問下認不知道&quot;&gt;陳稱「墨落」提否決權非共識 官追問下認不知道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，陳展浚是否同意「墨落」兩點聲明是協調會議共識，惟法官李運騰指控方是在問陳對聲明的意見，指陳無出席會議，「他對聲明的理解不會比我們更好（just as good as ours）。」陳重申有建議柯耀林簽聲明，而他只集中於「墨落」上的兩點聲明，認為其他內容不重要，他亦無法判斷柯有否閱讀全文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續引柯 WhatsApp 提到：「暫不需理會，靜觀其變，呢份嘢可能成為DQ理據，我未正式宣布參選，有時間」，問陳是否同意柯當時看過聲明並有自己意見。陳重申「無從判斷佢係咪完全睇晒」，李運騰說沒關係，這是由法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳盤問下重申，認為「墨落」第一點聲明除認同五大訴求外，其餘均非協調會議達成的共識。李運騰追問柯耀林於首次會議早走，如何得知不是共識，陳指該三點共識是柯認知協調會達成共識的一切，「就係咁多，冇補充」。李再重複問題，陳說：「我唔明你問題，定係翻譯出咗問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱問題很簡單，就是柯提早離開，怎知共識不是在他離開後達成？陳說：「我頭先已經講過，我哋根據我哋認知達成嘅共識就係嗰三點，我冇補充」，後同意即是他不知道。控方欲再追問，惟李運騰指問題重複，並笑說「而他會說他沒有補充」，陳志全和林卓廷等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑無向柯講述對墨落非強制否決的理解-陳不同意&quot;&gt;控方質疑無向柯講述對「墨落」非強制否決的理解 陳不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就陳昨稱，理解「墨落」中運用否決權一點無強制須否決預算案，他今確認於決定簽署「墨落」當晚、與柯耀林3至4分鐘的通話中，有與柯討論過他上述理解。控方指出，陳事實上並無與柯提過庭上他對該點的理解，陳說「唔同意，我唔係好明你個問題嘅事實基礎喺邊度」，其後再稱他有向柯「簡單提及過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問柯曾否表明非攬炒一分子-官質疑問題毫無作用&quot;&gt;控方問柯曾否表明非「攬炒」一分子 官質疑問題毫無作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林於6月19日提交提名表格，陳確認柯簽署前曾閱讀表格第二點有關認同戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，但無說或問什麼。控方續展示柯翌日的 Facebook 帖文，提到當天《國安法》細節已公布，「我知道參選甚至如果當選，已經一半踏入監牢，但係面對暴政，絕不退縮」，問為何柯認為自己會犯法，及是否與簽署「墨落」有關，惟陳慶偉均即打斷着問下一題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，柯曾否表明他並非「攬炒」的一分子，陳慶偉說「這是一條很差的問題（“I think that is a very bad question.”）」，李亦說「恕我直言」，指即使柯有這樣說過，如何能幫助控方，並指舉證責任在控方，不能以此反證其案情（“By establishing the negative, doesn’t help you build a positive case.”），「這問題毫無用處。（“… the question is useless.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱地區直選不方便直接與劉凱文合作婉轉表達反攬炒-官質疑邏輯&quot;&gt;陳稱地區直選不方便直接、與劉凱文合作婉轉表達反「攬炒」 官質疑邏輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛表示會嘗試另一方法，惟李運騰指由他來，並問柯有否提過不同意「攬炒」的意念。陳回應：「我哋喺內部嘅討論，同埋經過同（衛生服務界）劉凱文嘅合作，其實都表達到出嚟。」陳仲衡指，但他們是想選民而不只是內部知道，問選民如何知道。陳展浚指「地區直選就唔方便用咁直接嘅方法，咁所以我哋咪用咗個婉轉嘅方法。」陳慶偉提高聲線問：「陳先生，你認真嗎？」陳展浚答：「認真。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在法官陳仲衡詢問下確認，劉凱文並無簽署「墨落無悔」。陳仲衡續問那據其邏輯，透過與柯合作，人們也會認為劉支持或同意「墨落」？陳回應：「劉凱文反對攬炒嗰個形象嗰個立場，絕對大過我哋有簽聲明呢個認知，公眾多數認識佢就係因為佢反對攬炒。」控方質疑公眾如何知道，問劉提到反對攬炒的訪問有否附在柯的選舉單張和 Facebook，陳指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱國安法後審視文宣-惟無移除墨落以免被攻擊&quot;&gt;陳稱《國安法》後審視文宣 惟無移除「墨落」以免被攻擊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就戴耀廷7月8日及9日記者會，提到「35+計劃」目標及違反《國安法》的風險，陳展浚均稱無印象，亦不知7月時戴曾就初選合法性公開發言。陳同意，對《國安法》實施感到擔心，「我哋有審視文宣嘅內容，用字更加小心」，但沒有再審視「墨落」亦沒有移除帖文，因柯若刪文或會被攻擊「退縮」或「做乜突然間 delete 咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方重複提問着善用法庭時間&quot;&gt;官質疑控方重複提問、着善用法庭時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛續指，柯認為聲明或違《國安法》，卻在《國安法》後仍保留該帖文，惟陳慶偉不耐煩打斷說「Thank you」，示意問下一條問題，李運騰亦指如控方已問了問題，不要只用另一方式再問一次，「你已經得到了答案，請善用法庭時間。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛續問及柯參選宣言，陳展浚同意該帖文由柯認可（endorse）發布。陳穎琛續指文末附有柯「墨落」帖文的連結，指柯無就此說過任何話？惟陳慶偉再大聲不耐煩打斷：「謝謝，陳小姐」，李運騰亦指證人已肯定地說柯耀林認可此帖文，「為何你一直重複問同一條問題？你還想說什麼？」陳慶偉亦指：「重複與說服是兩個完全不同的概念（“Repetition and persuasion are two completely different concepts.”）」，陳仲衡亦說：「你想問一些東西與你有東西要問，兩者是有分別。（“There is a difference between you want to ask something and you have something to ask.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選論壇提兌現協議書-陳指屬贏咗有得選輸咗冇得選&quot;&gt;初選論壇提兌現「協議書」 陳指屬「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及初選論壇上，柯耀林曾表示「我哋會兌現今次我哋初選簽嗰個協議書，我哋係會支持所有⋯出選初選嘅候選人」，問柯指「協議書」是什麼。陳指是初選提名表格，指柯認知協議是「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」，因此「就算林卓廷贏咗，佢都唔會因為一啲過去嘅恩怨，而唔支持勝出嘅人」，陳志全發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為七一前國安法不追究&quot;&gt;陳稱認為七一前《國安法》不追究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛其後問可否進行小休，法官陳慶偉關注還有多少要問，陳說會非常短，陳慶偉續着繼續提問。陳穎琛遂俯身問左右兩邊的萬德豪和周天行，後向法官指：「若是這樣，我們盤問完結」，陳仲衡問「那短的部分呢？」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，控方除了指證人所說的不正確，有沒有任何案情要向他指出？陳穎琛續向陳展浚指，柯耀林發布「墨落」聲明，是有意圖依從（comply）該聲明。李運騰即邊皺眉邊張大嘴巴，神情錯愕。陳展浚指不同意，並指柯無移除聲明其中一個原因，是「我哋認為7月1號之前嘅嘢，《國安法》係唔會追究嘅」，故無因《國安法》實施而審視或移除之前的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱曾問鄒家成如何加入聯署-覆問下確認無問自言記憶較混亂&quot;&gt;陳稱曾問鄒家成如何加入聯署 覆問下確認無問自言記憶較混亂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後進行覆問，就陳今早稱不記得何時私訊鄒家成問如何加入聯署，辯方展示訊息紀錄，顯示6月11日凌晨12時46分，陳向鄒稱來自柯耀林團隊，「我哋願意加入聯署」，鄒覆「好」。陳確認，當時已是柯發布「墨落」帖文後逾20分鐘。辯方問，故陳今早稱曾問鄒如何加入聯署，是記錯了？控方和法官指是引導性問題。陳續同意法官指，訊息無問如何加入聯署，指「因為剛才我作供時都提到對於呢個記憶係比較混亂，有張圖係比較好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳展浚作供完畢-李予信明作供&quot;&gt;陳展浚作供完畢 李予信明作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示覆問完結，柯耀林案情亦完結。這意味新東案情完結，16名被告中只餘下參選功能組別超級區議會的李予信，及衞生服務界的余慧明未開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;選舉經理稱「墨落」無強制用否決權 憂不簽遭攻擊遂促柯耀林簽署&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第106天。柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚續作供，供述團隊討論是否簽署「墨落無悔」的經過，其中柯曾於群組表示「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」，亦憂聲明成為DQ理據。不過陳認為聲明內容可接受，應考慮簽署，因無強制何時何地或是否須否決預算案，只提到該權力「係其中一個 option」；亦認為聲明是「保守與進步的分界線」。陳並指，當時柯的潛在對手工黨郭永健及人民力量等均已簽署，擔心發起人或隨時截止聯署，並標籤或攻擊其他無簽署者，故凌晨致電柯促他決定，柯終決定簽署。陳並指，柯從無向他表達會否決預算案，但不移除聲明是怕被攻擊，指柯於區議會被本土派針對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，團隊思維進步，但不代表手法激進，他們不同意用「攬炒」爭取民主，而「進步」是指不會像傳統民主派般「淨係坐喺個冷氣房度」、投完票「話民主今日最黑暗就算數」。法官李運騰一度笑言在冷氣房可做到很多事，「我在冷氣房寫判詞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林的助理及選舉經理陳展浚續作供。陳昨表示，曾為柯耀林於 Facebook 發布「墨落無悔」聲明帖文，事前有與柯於 WhatsApp 討論。辯方大律師唐樂山今展示名為「2R戰略討論處」的 WhatsApp 群組對話紀錄，陳指於2020年5月成立，是柯耀林（Ricky）和區鎮樺（Ray）討論選舉的地方，成員最主要為兩人的團隊，但選舉完結和本案拘捕發生後，很多人也退出群組，包括區鎮樺，陳於半年前進行截圖時群組只餘下3人。至於陳昨稱沙田區政丁仕元和李永成也有意參選，陳指二人其後也無進一步意欲或行動參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄顯示，6月10日晚區鎮樺於群組轉發鄒家成「墨落無悔」聲明連結，稱「又夾硬夾人」，陳展浚其後亦轉發「墨落」聲明全文，表示：「應要考慮 內容係啱 呢個係保守與進步的分界線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「內容係啱」的意思，陳解釋「墨落」聲明第一點提及認同五大訴求，「喺嗰個時空底下呢，認同五大訴求係一個作為民主派最基本嘅基礎」；至於「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，陳認為否決財案「的確係《基本法》賦予立法會議員嘅其中一個權力」，但聲明「冇強制何時何地或者係咪必須要實行呢個權力，佢只係講呢個權力只係其中一個 option（選項）嚟㗎啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落」第二點「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」，陳指「我哋認為係新界東協調會嘅共識，亦都係初選最重要嘅基礎」，因此認為聲明「整體睇落去講嘅嘢係冇乜問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱從新聞得悉運用否決權非新東協調會議共識&quot;&gt;陳稱從新聞得悉運用否決權非新東協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚同意法官陳仲衡指，他無在該 WhatsApp 對話提到上述就運用否決權的理解，但他之後曾與柯通電話談到，「法官大人可以繼續靜候聽咗先。」陳續解釋認為就第一點聲明，除認同五大訴求外，不認為其餘內容是共識，「因為至少李永成就反對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但柯只曾出席首次協調會議的頭半部分、缺席第二次會議、無收到文件，根本不知道會議發生何事。陳同意未能完全知悉會議內容，亦無向李永成或組織者查詢，但新聞提及李永成對否決財案有不同意見，故「達成共識呢樣嘢應該就係冇發生到囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，因此當陳說「內容係啱」，是指這是會議上同意的事項，抑或聲明兩點可以接受？陳指是「內容係睇落去可以接受」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯對聯署有擔心-憂成dq理據或違國安法&quot;&gt;陳指柯對聯署有擔心 憂成DQ理據或違《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，若認為運用否決權非協調共識，為何柯耀林在 WhatsApp 提到「墨落」有機會成為DQ理由。陳展浚解釋因當時已「講緊會立《國安法》」，柯不知道DQ的紅線或準則，又指「佢不嬲對於一啲聯署、各式各樣嘅聯署都有擔心嘅」，尤其當有機會立《國安法》，便認為有機會成為DQ理據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，即當時柯認為「墨落」有機會違《國安法》？陳說「可以咁講」，並重申柯「覺得好多嘢都有風險」，因認為《國安法》無詳細解釋或任何標準，即使未頒布條文，亦有「好強烈嘅擔心或者恐懼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，那為何陳展浚起初又說柯對政治無興趣、不閱讀新聞，只透過陳了解政治議題。陳展浚指無提過柯對政治無興趣，只是他工作很忙，「佢係冇咁嘅習慣去閱讀一啲可能比較政治性嘅新聞例如戴耀廷嘅文章等」，並依靠他們就政治發展作更新，但不代表柯對於立《國安法》等完全無基本認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱因否決權非共識但墨落發起人放進聲明-區鎮樺才稱又夾硬夾人&quot;&gt;陳稱因否決權非共識但「墨落」發起人放進聲明 區鎮樺才稱「又夾硬夾人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續關注，當時群組無提及「墨落」第一點並非協調會議共識，陳展浚回應，相信區鎮樺稱「又夾硬夾人」就是此意思。陳慶偉問，既然陳認為並無強制否決，那為何當時不向柯解釋，「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」一句，其實是「我會考慮運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」？陳先說「我哋嘅認知呢係呢個冇強制性」，並在追問下反問：「其實我哋都唔係發起或者草擬聯署一方，咁點解要自己去修改嗰個內容呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在追問下，指不知道新東第二次協調會上，就「會」、「會積極」運用否決權有激烈的討論。陳慶偉問既然如此，他如何能說這是共識，陳指「我從來冇提及過否決財政預算案係任何共識喎」，並重申認為該點並非共識，但「墨落」發起人卻放進聲明，因此區鎮樺才稱「又嚟夾人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注柯曾稱聲明講到明否決財案-陳指柯無向他表達過會否決財案&quot;&gt;官關注柯曾稱聲明「講到明」否決財案 陳指柯無向他表達過會否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦關注，就陳展浚稱「墨落」無強制須用否決權，柯耀林似乎不同意，並引柯於群組稱：「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」。陳表示，柯在「墨落」發布前或後不曾向他表達過有意否決預算案，亦曾表達他不同意「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，從上述訊息字面上來看，陳認同柯對聲明中運用否決權一點的理解與他不同嗎？陳說字面上是這樣，但在之後的口頭討論，柯曾表示「覺得戴教授已經冇提呢樣嘢，或者冇任何文章或新聞講呢個意思」，感覺「呢個聲明再 raise 返呢件事出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，「我以為柯先生依靠你提供資訊」，陳同意，但指柯亦是物業管理公司的營運總監，「所以佢每日都會摷啲報紙，點都睇到 topic（標題），因為佢會睇啲招標廣告。」李運騰聞言搖頭，並問因此柯有閱讀報紙的習慣？陳說：「佢有閱讀招標廣告嘅習慣」，庭上傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱路線上需與民主黨有區別-因墨落看上去進步故應簽署&quot;&gt;陳稱路線上需與民主黨有區別 因「墨落」看上去「進步」故應簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於簽署聲明為何屬「保守與進步的分界線」，陳解釋「只要進步過民主黨嘅話呢，就係進步，唔係保守」，而當時認為「睇落去個聲明係進步嘅聲明，所以應該要考慮（簽署）」，黃碧雲與林卓廷對視而笑。陳續解釋，「因為大家都喺民主黨退黨出嚟」，故參選立法會時路線上需有些區別；亦相信民主黨決策程序較慢，就是否簽署聲明應「冇咁快做到呢個決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯被本土派針對-曾因倡建周梓樂陳彥霖紀念公園被掟人血饅頭&quot;&gt;陳稱柯被本土派針對 曾因倡建周梓樂陳彥霖紀念公園被掟「人血饅頭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於與本土派的關係，陳指在西貢區議會「本土派其實都幾針對我哋」，原因與區議會選舉協調和區議會議題上的衝突有關，「可能有啲恩怨」；又指將軍澳民生關注組曾動議將兩個由西貢區議會出資興建的公園，改名為周梓樂和陳彥霖紀念公園，本土派議員葉子祈遂向柯「掟『人血饅頭』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱工黨郭永健簽署後即致電柯耀林望盡快做決定-柯終同意簽署&quot;&gt;陳稱工黨郭永健簽署後即致電柯耀林望盡快做決定 柯終同意簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就柯耀林最終如何決定簽署「墨落」，對話紀錄顯示當晚鄭仲文提到「人力落水了，柯生快動員」，陳展浚表示「遲簽冇乜用」，至翌日零時12分，柯耀林稱他早上7點要開街站，而何聞達於零時18分轉發「墨落」聲明，提到「唔掂，即跟，郭永健跟咗」，陳展浚即回覆「同意」，並於3分鐘後回覆「打左比柯生 跟」，至零時24分何聞達再稱「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問郭永健簽署有何特別，陳解釋曾與郭永健合作，認為「佢都唔係咁快做決定嘅人」，而郭立場較溫和，「大家都係潛在競爭對手，佢都跟咗，我哋需要跟」。陳並指，柯稱要開街站後便「上床瞓」，而陳覆「同意」後立即致電柯，「佢嗰陣未瞓着，不過都懵懵地」，陳遂告知柯人民力量、公民黨和工黨郭永健已「跟咗」，他們很擔心發起人會否隨時截止聯署的更新或參與，「繼而標籤或者攻擊其他冇簽嘅人」，故致電柯「希望盡快做出一個決定」。而陳「攞咗 instruction」後，立即回覆群組指柯會簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後指，鄭達鴻曾供稱公民黨討論是否簽「墨落」至6月11日下午，陳承認當時較混亂，故就公民黨是否已簽署「唔肯定」。至於「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」一句，陳解釋是指「最緊要早過梁國雄同范國威」，而范當時未簽署，至翌日下午才簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳發布墨落時將柯耀林名字置於郭永健前-認是小學雞行為&quot;&gt;陳發布「墨落」時將柯耀林名字置於郭永健前 認是「小學雞行為」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚續指，他遂在聲明加上柯耀林名字，並於 Facebook 發布。辯方展示柯的帖文，問郭永健比柯耀林早簽署，但為何柯的名字排得比郭前，余慧明和林卓廷等發笑，陳笑說「呢啲俗稱啲小學雞行為嚟嘅」，承認「純粹係唔想落後佢啫」，多人發笑。法官李運騰關注，帖文提到最後更新時間為「00:13」，比陳與柯耀林通電話決定簽署更早，陳指該時間只是「手動打落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又確認，當時群組有人不同意此做法，區鎮樺於凌晨約1時稱「我覺得個問題要停一停」，認為就是否簽署「墨落」應先停下討論，惟當時柯已簽署。區亦稱「現在我同柯，一個名在超區，一個在新東」，陳解釋柯出席超區協調會後已不考慮參選超區，不過當時區依然想柯參選超區，而區最終無參加初選，但有簽署「墨落」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯從無提倡否決財案-但無移除墨落因怕被攻擊&quot;&gt;陳指柯從無提倡否決財案 但無移除「墨落」因怕被攻擊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問，若柯從來沒有提倡否決預算案，為何不移除「墨落」帖文。陳指「因為我哋驚畀人攻擊啦」，而且本土派區議員葉子祈「經常 mon 住我哋啲 Facebook」。李運騰問，那他們也有否「mon」人 Facebook？陳說：「我哋會，但係我哋唔會 mon 完人之後即刻 cap 圖，發現 delete 咗嘢之後即刻開 post 鬧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到柯在發布「墨落」後亦提及「民協施德來都簽咗」，陳指柯「純粹可能見到其他都係標籤溫和民主派嘅人都簽咗」。李指，故柯也有留意其他人？陳說始終「發生咁大個聯署，咁大家都會留意事態發生，或者好多時 Facebook 都會睇到好多人 update」。李指似乎柯不需其他人告知他事態發展，陳說「咁冇衝突」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指極權指過分使用武力的警方及容許它的政府&quot;&gt;陳指「極權」指過分使用武力的警方及容許它的政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及柯耀林的選舉文宣，包括宣傳短片、政綱、和選舉單張，陳展浚均稱有份撰寫內容和設計。就宣傳片段提到「極權壓境之際，更要頑強迎戰」，配上將軍澳尚德邨十字路口的警民衝突相片，陳解釋當時基本上每晚都發生衝突，他們會進行協調、調停或被捕支援，並認為警方有些行動使用暴力並不合理，相信當時警方的「過分武力執法」是「得到政府嘅授意或者縱容」。陳同意，片段提到「極權」是指過分使用武力的警方，及「容許佢過分使用武力嘅政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於片段提到參選是「希望立法會能夠多一個行動派」，陳指既指在立法會內做一個「勤力、盡責」的議員，運用議會力量和平台爭取民主、為社區政策或議題努力為市民發聲；亦指「唔係淨係坐喺冷氣房入面，更加要身體力行」，如落社區調停警民衝突，柯亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢提醒陳展浚就柯耀林想法作供-屬傳聞證供&quot;&gt;官屢提醒陳展浚就柯耀林想法作供 屬傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，陳同意為柯耀林提交，而他從柯得悉首次會議共識（辦初選、「贏咗有得選，宣咗冇得選」、目標議席為「6+1」）的認知沒有改變，法官提醒柯的說法屬傳聞證供。表格附上柯的參選宣言，提到港人要放棄舊有想法，不再被傳統影響抗爭，陳指是不希望港人繼續沉迷經濟發展，應更多關心香港民主進程，鼓勵人投票。惟法官再質疑所有人也能閱讀宣言內容，而證人無法就柯的想法作供，即使事前二人有討論，亦可能是傳聞證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再問及陳有份草擬的選舉單張是否與預算案有關，惟陳慶偉再指這不是陳的政綱，而是柯的政綱，「柯先生決定不作供沒問題，但你不能問他在想什麼」，李運騰亦指不能要求證人猜測柯的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯耀林團隊與劉凱文聯合宣傳-是較婉轉表達反對攬炒&quot;&gt;陳指柯耀林團隊與劉凱文聯合宣傳 是較婉轉表達反對「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，柯曾與參選衞生服務界的劉凱文聯合宣傳及印發聯合單張，指因劉是將軍澳街坊，亦是年輕進步的民主派，但手法上與他們一樣溫和；又指劉旗幟鮮明反對「攬炒」，而他們亦不同意用「攬炒」方式爭取民主。陳仲衡指單張無表明柯不同意「攬炒」，陳承認當時是使用「比較婉轉」的方法，因當時有很多報導均顯示劉反對「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「我哋思維進步，但唔代表我哋手法要激進」，在李運騰追問下指「進步」是指「我哋唔係好似傳統民主派咁淨係坐喺個冷氣房度，願意做更多嘅行動去實踐爭取民主」。李運騰笑言在冷氣房可以做到很多事，「我在冷氣房寫判詞」，旁聽人士發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問陳指行動是什麼？陳指包括在衝突現場監察警方執法並嘗試調解，他們曾成功阻止防暴隊進入屋苑行動或施放催淚彈；又指要用議員權力監督政府，「唔係投完票，話民主今日最黑暗就算數喇。」李運騰說那不是在冷氣房完成嗎？陳僅重申議員不能只在冷氣房，亦指單張提到「站在衝突前線，與手足同路並肩同行」，不代表無調停雙方衝突。陳慶偉遂指，即使兩人曾聯合宣傳，但不代表他們有相同政綱，辯方指會留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳終表示，以他所知，柯沒有與其他人達成協議否決預算案以迫使政府回應五大訴求，亦無協議顛覆國家政權。唐樂山表示主問完畢，控方明早進行盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

Yet other signs, such as Prigozhin shaking hands with officials from the Central African Republic (CAR) in Saint Petersburg while the 2023 Russia-Africa summit was unfolding, or Russian flags being flown during the Niger coup this July, suggest that Russia’s influence in Africa is here to stay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current volatile situation calls for a coolheaded look at the fundamentals of Russia’s existing footprint and its forays across the continent, to better assess how they might evolve and how to address them. Russia’s breakthroughs in Africa are owed in part to a rekindling of Soviet-era relations. Yet the Kremlin’s remarkable advances on the continent throughout the last decade also result from twin contemporary efforts: adept diplomatic reengagement with key regional players and opportunistic predation in areas where Western powers are either absent or in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S.-led effort to form a global coalition aimed at isolating Russia internationally has indeed strengthened the transatlantic alliance, it has not yet fully convinced the rest of the world, including countries on the African continent, to break ties with Moscow. In fact, many across Africa regard the war in Ukraine as primarily a Western problem and are preoccupied with protecting their own national interests. Even with the war and sanctions straining Russia’s economy and defense sector, the Kremlin retains sufficient ties with the continent to challenge Western narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s creeping influence over Africa, assessing Moscow’s historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with Russia. In doing so, particular attention is paid to the Russian private military company (PMC) Wagner Group, which has been playing an important role in forging ties between the Kremlin and different African nations, despite the uncertainty following Prigozhin’s rebellion in June 2023. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to counter a rising Russia in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kremlins-playbook-in-africa-from-diplomatic-to-military-footprint&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s Playbook in Africa: From Diplomatic to Military Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly argued that the hesitancy of many African states to openly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is rooted in the deep Soviet-era ties Moscow forged with the continent, which continue to generate a lot of sympathy and respect toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the mid-1950s, as Africa turned into another important Cold War battleground, the Soviet Union became actively involved in reshaping the continent’s political and security landscape by granting generous economic and security assistance programs to many different local Marxist, anti-colonial, or anti-U.S. groups. By supporting independence movements during a period of colonial conflict and aiding governments that faced internal or external confrontation, the Soviet Union managed to penetrate all the major countries across Africa, including but not limited to Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Mozambique. The Kremlin supplied those states with weapons and equipment, provided military training and advisers, and developed relations between the Soviet and various African intelligence communities, ultimately creating “a long-term legacy of Soviet hardware and operational culture throughout Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8G7xTQu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Leonid Brezhnev, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, meets with the new Egyptian president, Anwar al-Sadat, in Moscow, the latter seeking political support and military hardware from the Soviet Union for use in Egypt’s imminent war with Israel, 1971.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation—finding itself in political and socioeconomic turmoil—was forced to disengage from the continent, which meant that its generous economic and military assistance programs came to an abrupt halt. For around two decades after the Soviet collapse, Russian activity in Africa was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-diplomatic-reengagement-with-africa&quot;&gt;Russia’s Diplomatic Reengagement with Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s first visible attempts to reengage with the continent started in the mid-2000s. In 2006, President Vladimir Putin visited the Republic of South Africa, followed by his successor Dmitry Medvedev’s trips to Egypt, Angola, Nigeria, and Namibia in 2009. The Kremlin doubled down on its diplomatic efforts following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when the first round of Western sanctions against Russia forced Moscow to actively seek new geopolitical partners and business opportunities. Since 2014, various high-ranking Russian state officials—including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov—have frequented different African states and signed multiple bilateral military, economic, and security cooperation agreements, as well as written off billions of dollars in African debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s return to Africa has also coincided with (and has been encouraged by) the reduced U.S. engagement with the continent, including the 2018 decision under the Trump administration to scale back U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region despite the growing terror threat in many African nations. Moscow was quick to fill that security void. In 2019, President Putin hosted the first-ever Russia-Africa summit at the Black Sea retreat of Sochi, aimed at reinforcing Russia’s standing as a reliable strategic partner on the continent and securing military contract agreements with different nations, including the Nigerian government, which agreed to purchase Russian attack helicopters. In July 2023, despite the war, sanctions, and Western pressure, 17 heads of African states attended the second Russia-Africa summit, signing several agreements with Russia on prevention of arms race in space, cooperation in informational security, and combating terrorism on the continent. Moscow also promised to write off additional debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wW9NlK4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ President Putin, African leaders, and heads of delegations pose for a group photo at the second Russia-Africa summit held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on July 28, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ongoing diplomatic efforts, encompassing high-level visits, debt relief, and strategic partnership agreements, have proved to be particularly useful at the United Nations. The Kremlin has been able to count on the backing of many African nations on key UN votes, including the 2014 General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian annexation of Crimea, the 2018 resolution urging Moscow to demilitarize the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and the 2022 resolution decrying Russia’s attempted annexation of four Ukrainian regions. In all three cases, a considerable number of African countries voted against the proposed resolutions, abstained, or did not show up for the vote, thus directly or indirectly contributing to the Kremlin’s efforts at challenging the United States and its allies within international frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-economic-and-trade-relations&quot;&gt;Russo-African Economic and Trade Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening diplomatic ties with African states, the Kremlin has also expanded its economic footprint on the continent. For instance, trade revenue between Russia and African countries almost doubled from $9.9 billion in 2013 to $17.7 billion by 2021. Grain exports are of particular importance, as nearly 30 percent of Africa’s grain supplies come from Russia. Moscow’s leading trade partners in the region are countries in North Africa—particularly Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco—which together account for approximately 67 percent of Russia’s total trade with the continent. Moscow mainly exports wheat, coal, refined petroleum, and electronics to these states, while importing fruits, sugar, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal—which enabled Ukraine to safely export grain to different parts of the world, including Africa—may benefit Moscow’s own grain exports by cutting Kyiv out of the global market and increasing the dependence of a number of African republics on Russian grain. Moscow has maintained that it will do “all it can” to shield Africa from the negative consequences of the halted grain deal, with President Putin asserting that “our country is capable of replacing Ukrainian grain on a commercial and a gratuitous basis.” During the 2023 Russia-Africa summit, Putin even promised to start shipping free grain in the next several months to six African nations significantly impacted by the cancellation of the grain deal: Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea, and the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of Russia’s economic outreach to Africa is that it is dominated by Russian companies that are either partially or fully owned by the state, including oil and gas giants Rosneft, Tatneft, and Gazprom, which carry out major hydrocarbon projects in North Africa. Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear power company, has also been actively engaged with different countries across the continent. For instance, in summer 2022, it received permission from an Egyptian regulator to start building Egypt’s first nuclear power plant, based on the 2017 agreement signed between President Putin and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The plant is expected to become fully operational by 2030. Rosatom also funds different educational and cultural exchange opportunities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to support the Kremlin’s soft power efforts in Africa. In addition to energy deals, Moscow has also boosted cooperation with different states rich in natural resources, primarily diamonds. For instance, Alrosa, Russia’s top diamond mining company, has expanded its operations in Angola, Congo, and Zimbabwe. Importantly, according to some African scholars, “Russia is highlighting collaboration over aid” when seeking lucrative business opportunities in Africa, thus stressing partnerships of equals, “and that message is tempting to some leaders who view the West’s outreach as patronizing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite Russia’s ongoing efforts to build stronger business and trade ties with the continent, the Kremlin’s economic engagements in Africa today are modest when compared to those of the Soviet Union, as well as those of the modern-day China, United States, and European Union. While trade revenue between Russia and African countries comprises around $17.7 billion, Africa’s trade value with the European Union, China, and the United States currently stands at $295 billion, $254 billion, and $65 billion, respectively. Russia also invests little in Africa, representing less than 1 percent of total foreign direct investment (FDI) going to the continent. Moscow’s main competitive advantage against the global powers seeking to expand their footprint on the continent is therefore its ability to render relatively cheap security and military services, including arms transfers, as well as anti-insurgency training and consultancy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-defense-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Russo-African Defense and Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Kremlin continues to be a small player in Africa when measured by its economic and trade relations, it retains strong defense and security ties with the continent, spanning arms sales, joint military training programs, and Russian PMC activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is the chief arms supplier to Africa, accounting for 40 percent of African imports of major weapons systems between 2018 and 2022. This has been higher than the total arms imports from the United States (16 percent), China (9.8 percent), and France (7.6 percent) during those years. According to a report by the RAND Corporation, Russian weapons sales to Africa have increased from around $500 million to over $2 billion annually in recent years. The key importers of Russian weapons systems are the North African countries Algeria and Egypt, with 73 percent and 34 percent of their arms imports, respectively, coming from Russia. Both states have purchased billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and equipment from Moscow since 2013, including the Su-24, Su-30, and MiG-29 combat aircraft, as well as the S-300 missile systems, among others. Besides Algeria and Egypt, many other countries across the continent also receive Russian matériel, including but not limited to Mali, Sudan, the CAR, and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons explaining the dependency of African countries on Russian-made weapons and equipment. Modern Russian arms are usually cheaper than their Western alternatives and compatible with Soviet-era stocks retained by many states on the continent. Additionally, unlike the United States and its allies, the Kremlin does not make its arms deliveries contingent upon adherence to democratic principles or the protection of basic human rights; it has sent armor, combat aircraft, and missile systems to different war-torn countries in Africa—including Libya, where it has supported eastern Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar’s fight against the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides arms transfers, Moscow has advanced military diplomacy in the region by engaging different African countries in Russian-led military forums and exercises, including the International Army Games, which since 2015 has been attended by around a dozen African states, such as Angola, Algeria, Congo, Mali, and Zimbabwe. The Kremlin has also organized the annual naval (“Friendship Bridge”) and aerial (“Defenders of Friendship”) exercises between the Russian and Egyptian armies and supported UN peace operations in Congo, Western Sahara, Sudan, and South Sudan by providing a limited number of military observers. Yet, while the official Russian military presence might seem modest, it is usually supplemented by Russian PMC activities, which have been rather extensive on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact numbers of Russian private military companies or operations in Africa are difficult to estimate, available reporting shows that there have been at least seven Russian PMCs that have carried out at a minimum 34 operations in 16 African countries since 2005. PMCs became particularly active in the mid-2010s following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its intervention in the Syrian war in 2015, both of which enabled Russia to advertise and offer its PMC services—from providing private security and military training to conducting combat operations—to different governments and separatist groups across Africa. According to RAND, Russian PMCs have a substantial presence in the CAR, Sudan, and South Sudan. They are also found in a number of other African states, including Congo, Gabon, Libya, Mali, and Madagascar. What makes the proliferation of Russian PMCs in Africa particularly noteworthy is that, in virtually all cases, they have strong ties with the Kremlin. As Major Thomas D. Arnold of the U.S. Army argues, “Russia effectively trades PMSC [private military and security company] services for access and economic concessions in resource-endowed fragile states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent among the Russian PMCs operating in Africa is the Wagner Group, owned by Prigozhin, an infamous Russian businessman dubbed “Putin’s Chef” whose notoriety increased immensely following his June 2023 short-lived armed mutiny against the Russian government, and particularly the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD). However, prior to the June uprising, the Wagner chief was known as one of President Putin’s most loyal subordinates. For instance, in 2018, the United States indicted Prigozhin for financing a Russian troll factory that had spearheaded Moscow’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. As for having strong links to the Russian government, Wagner forces were allegedly trained along with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’s (GRU) special forces units. The PMC gained notoriety for its participation in the 2014 Ukrainian and 2015 Syrian conflicts. In Syria, due to Wagner’s assistance to the Assad regime, several Prigozhin-owned or closely linked companies struck exclusive oil and gas deals with the government, thus enabling the Kremlin to get its share of Syria’s energy revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner adopted and further developed a similar strategy in Africa, where it has advised tottering leaders, run pro-government and disinformation campaigns, conducted military training and anti-insurgency operations, and, in return, secured concessions in extractive industries, particularly gold, diamond, and uranium mining. For instance, in CAR, at various times since 2018 up to 1,900 “Russian instructors” (i.e., Wagner and its subsidiaries) have provided escort protection to the country’s senior officials, including President Touadéra, and have assisted the Russian MOD with arms deliveries and on-site military training. In return, the Kremlin has been able to explore “the possibilities of the mutually beneficial development of Central African natural resources,” with Prigozhin-linked companies spearheading gold and diamond mining efforts in the republic. In Sudan, Wagner has provided site security to Prigozhin-owned gold mining companies and has been actively involved in strengthening ties with General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), a deputy head of Sudan’s ruling council, to establish its first naval base in Port Sudan. Similarly, in Libya, the Kremlin reportedly sent up to 1,200 Wagner contractors to aid General Khalifa Haftar, a de facto ruler of eastern Libya in control of a significant share of the country’s oil reserves, in exchange for securing economic concessions that included Russian oil giant Rosneft’s access to the country’s lucrative oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Demonstrators hold banners and a Russian flag in the capital city of Bangui, CAR, in March 2023. Taking advantage of the security vacuum created by the departure of French troops from the country, Moscow first sent “military instructors” to CAR in 2018, followed by hundreds of Wagner troops in 2020 at the request of President Touadéra to help him fend off a dangerous rebellion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s military presence in Africa, focused on the strengthening of both official and unofficial channels of defense-security cooperation with different African states, has proved to be a cost-effective way for the Kremlin to gain considerable political and economic leverage on the continent that even the 2022 war in Ukraine has been unable to undermine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-continued-progress-in-africa-despite-the-war-in-ukraine-and-domestic-fissure&quot;&gt;Russia’s Continued Progress in Africa, despite the War in Ukraine and Domestic Fissure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s military shortcomings in Ukraine—including incurring significant personnel and equipment losses, struggling to produce advanced weapons systems, and increasing reliance on Soviet-era defense equipment—there have not yet been any tangible signs of African countries actively seeking to replace Moscow as a chief arms supplier or military partner. In fact, throughout 2022, a number of countries on the continent initiated new or continued existing military cooperation agreements with the Kremlin. Cameroon, for instance, signed a new defense deal with the Russian MOD entailing joint military trainings, and Mali received military equipment from Moscow. In 2023, the Russia-Africa summit participants agreed to establish a new permanent Russo-African security mechanism, aimed at combating terrorism and extremism on the continent. However, some negative trends have also been observed. For example, Algeria and Egypt, which have long been listed among Russia’s top five arms purchasers globally, slowly started to lessen defense ties with the Kremlin in 2022. Yet, considering the large reliance of both countries on Russian-origin arms, they will most likely maintain defense cooperation with Moscow in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Russian armed forces, Wagner has sustained significant losses in Ukraine. In May 2023, Prigozhin openly accused the Russian MOD for not supplying his PMC with enough ammunition during the fight for the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. A month later, this disagreement led to the Prigozhin-orchestrated “march for justice” against Moscow, which, even if brief, has given rise to a number of questions connected with the stability of the Putin regime, as well as the future of Wagner in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkpDe1i.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Wagner soldiers sit on the top of a tank in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on June 24, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the uprising, experts believed that, even if Wagner were to be sidelined in Ukraine, the PMC would not “fade into obscurity.” Instead, it would pivot back to Africa, where it still retained a comparative advantage against the backdrop of a new wave of insurgencies spanning the continent, resuming limited-scale “expeditionary operations and supplying muscle to fragile states in exchange for access to valuable resources.” Indeed, in March 2023, Wagner was already actively recruiting new contractors willing to serve terms ranging from 9 to 14 months in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also argued that, by putting a private army to work in the region, Prigozhin was able to at least partially fund Wagner’s war effort in Ukraine. This, in most cases, was achieved by expanding the PMC-linked mining operations across the continent. For instance, in exchange for supporting regime stability in CAR, Wagner reportedly gained some degree of control over the country’s international airport, flying gold worth billions of U.S. dollars that it had been mining in CAR from the capital of Bangui straight to Moscow. According to some estimates, despite the allied sanctions imposed on Russia, Moscow’s gold reserves reached an all-time high in the first quarter of 2023. Similar to in CAR, Wagner continued to exploit the existing power struggle in Sudan, allegedly assisting the country’s General Hemedti through Wagner’s Libyan partner General Haftar, and thus attempting to preserve Russia’s ongoing gold mining operations in Sudan and advance the Kremlin’s interests of building a naval base along the Red Sea in Port Sudan. Experts believe that, if Moscow is ultimately successful at gaining port access in Africa, it will be well positioned to “disrupt naval and maritime passage along the central and eastern Mediterranean, and establish coastal airfields that would make global transit of Russian aircraft—including anti-submarine aircraft—possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the June mutiny, the Kremlin is now forced to come up with a plan dealing with the reorganization of Wagner’s ongoing operations in Africa as seamlessly as possible. As one of Prigozhin’s people stated after the uprising, “entire sectors of Russian foreign policy are dependent on the assets of Wagner PMC abroad, and if they are removed, there will be a rapid compression of Russian influence, more in Africa, to a lesser extent in Syria.” In fact, the CAR leadership has already expressed concerns regarding the Wagner chief’s highly precarious position inside Russia and how this would impact the PMC’s presence in the country; yet the leadership has also declared readiness to sign contracts with other Russian “instructors,” should Moscow decide so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, no matter how the war in Ukraine plays out or how the fate of Prigozhin is ultimately decided, the Kremlin will likely have strong incentives to maintain its use of PMCs—including a restructured Wagner Group or its subsidiaries—in Africa to ensure uninterrupted access to the continent’s gold reserves, among other benefits, and to destabilize Western strategic partnerships with different African states. Importantly, as the invasion of Ukraine will inevitably produce more veterans seeking adequate remuneration amid Russia’s wartime economy, it can be expected that Russian PMCs might expand the size and scale of their current operations in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-now-new-offer-new-tactics-and-new-branding&quot;&gt;What to Do Now? New Offer, New Tactics, and New Branding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s forays in Africa present the West with serious strategic dilemmas, as letting Russia expand further affects the United States and allied interests, but attacking it head-on can backfire and end up fueling Moscow’s narrative, something recently experienced by France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the West cannot afford to stand idle and resort only to “strategic patience,” as the stakes are too high considering that Africa is the continent with the youngest and fastest-growing population, with daunting challenges that have direct consequences for global security and stability. Russia is both uninterested and unable to foster sound and sustainable development in Africa, as it does not provide substantial aid nor capacity building beyond the military-security realm. Instead, its entrenchment can only compound the challenges that Africa faces and comes with major risks, especially for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it would be delusive to expect new grand strategies at times when the United States and Europe struggle to sustain their joint efforts in the two most pressing theaters of strategic competition: Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific. Traditional key Western stakeholders in Africa such as the United States and France have both recently heralded a “reframing” of their approaches, in which the security component is relegated to the background, to the benefit of political, economic, and social engagements. This is a sound evolution—especially considering that ongoing Russian efforts in these arenas are rather limited—but it leaves free ground for Russian progress in the security realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rules of engagement for the West to confront Russia in Africa therefore stand somewhere between “strategic patience” and “grand strategy.” This section lays out recommendations for Western policymakers, stressing the importance of equal footing cooperation with African partners in order to offer attractive and efficient alternatives catered to the region’s security and prosperity aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overarching-recommendations&quot;&gt;Overarching Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise a security cooperation package that will be principled but not transactional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s current approach of providing security assistance through Wagner remains attractive to many African nations despite it being expensive in the longer term (local governments have to pay the PMC for its services in addition to accepting its multiyear commercial conditions, while also losing at least part of Western aid and risking sanctions). This is because the “regime survival package” offered by Russia in the region, which is beset by chronic instability and military coups, supersedes any other potential gains from traditional cooperation agreements advanced by Western partners, which are usually based on institutional capacity building instead of securing the authorities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mali, for instance, Wagner agreed to provide the Malian authorities with helicopters and ammunition that the French were always reluctant to consider due to rising levels of violence and continued insurgencies, among other reasons. This issue calls for a more horizontal and less vertical Western approach to cooperation that will remain principled, but not based on conditions. Western security assistance should thus ultimately serve political objectives that are consistent with the transatlantic community’s values and principles, but due diligence should be conducted upstream through arms control policies and downstream through accompaniment and monitoring—not during the negotiation phase or political engagement, so as to alleviate the sentiment that Western support is a politically motivated bargaining chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redouble efforts in the energy domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not thrive in Africa only through Wagner and security assistance, even though its efforts in this regard are particularly extensive. Moscow also offers assistance in the energy domain, notably through a push for nuclear energy to meet the continent’s growing needs. While Western countries are late to engage in energy diplomacy in Africa, they should redouble their efforts, as this will be one of the key parameters of strategic competition on the continent. Engaging in energy diplomacy is also central to countering the widespread narrative that Western countries are only interested in plundering the continent’s resources for their own prosperity, without benefiting Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build strategic partnerships free from “neo–Cold War” perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be recognized as a preferable alternative to Russia, the West should direct its efforts toward the key “swing states”: major regional players that maintain close ties with the Kremlin, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Yet the Western reengagement should not resemble a neo–Cold War approach, forcing the countries to take sides through “carrots and sticks.” Instead, it should take the form of a strategic dialogue aimed at better understanding why these African states maintain ties with Russia, in order to assess if the West can offer something more attractive. The West should also strengthen partnerships with other countries on the continent committed to building functioning institutions, robust militaries, and strong technological bases, including but not limited to Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and Botswana, especially when those countries are courted by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actively prove Russian narratives wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West should continue exposing the failures of corrupt regimes, especially those that engage in mafia-type deals with the Russian government, as well as widespread atrocities and human rights abuses committed by Russia-linked groups—including Wagner paramilitaries—in Africa. But perhaps more importantly, the United States and the European Union should promote their own success stories in the region, while also reflecting on the legitimate concerns of many African nations. The West should also invest more in establishing or supporting reliable local pan-African media outlets promoting African voices and perspectives on key regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engage with new partners that are more palatable to the African public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African countries are enthusiastic about increased “South to South” cooperation and would welcome engagement with leaders from the Global South. However, these relations remain largely nascent at this stage, as the major nonaligned states such as Brazil or India are also figuring out how to best engage with Africa. In the longer term, increased “triangulation” between Africa, the Global South, and the West could prove mutually beneficial, with India and Brazil becoming the key partners in this effort as they are pro-democracy without appearing anti-Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preserve an ability to act against traditional and potential new threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s continued advances in Africa are also risk multipliers, with the most prominent one being rising levels of terrorism in the countries where Russians, including Wagner fighters, set foot. According to the 2022 Global Terrorism Index, 48 percent of all terrorism-related deaths worldwide occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, with three of the top ten countries—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger—all having a Wagner presence. Increased levels of terrorism coupled with the ongoing Russian hybrid warfare efforts in the region—including information warfare and cyberattacks, weaponization of migration, and disruption of critical infrastructure—have the potential to further fuel instability and insecurity on the continent. Facing these threats implies that the West should retain certain capabilities in the region, including defensive equipment and airlift options, to protect both Western citizens and African partners in case of serious violent outbreaks, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to disclose intelligence on Wagner’s nefarious activities on the continent to partners in Africa and dissuade them from partnering with the PMC. Finally, the United States and its allies should also retain an ability to carry out defensive strikes against Wagner in the event of an assault, as happened in Syria in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;country-specific-recommendations&quot;&gt;Country-Specific Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The United States: Africa is too important to be let down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently published public documents, as well as statements by U.S. government officials, show Washington’s eagerness to treat African countries as peer partners, which undoubtedly is a positive development. But to be effective, the United States should adopt a whole of Africa strategy rather than only a sub-Saharan strategy, especially when it comes to challenging Russian advances across the continent, given the interconnectedness between North Africa, the Sahel strip, and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Europe: Get serious about “Europeanisation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has been the main prey of Russia’s forays in Africa. Anti-French sentiment and the Russian disinformation apparatus have become so entrenched in certain parts of the continent that any French-led effort to turn the tide tends to result in adverse outcomes. France has therefore opted for a transformation of its relations with Africa, presented by President Macron on February 27, 2023, as an intention to build a “new, balanced, reciprocal, and responsible relationship” underpinned by the expressed needs of African partners. This entails a reduction of France’s military personnel across the continent, following the termination of the Barkhane counterterrorism operation in Sahel late last year, and co-management with African partners of French military bases on the continent (except for the one in Djibouti dedicated to the Indo-Pacific strategy). The expectation is that reducing the focus on security and defense will move the otherwise rich Franco-African cooperation into the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Europeans welcome the ongoing reorientations in France’s strategic thinking. Yet if Paris lowers its profile, this requires others to step up, both at the national and EU levels. Paris has pushed for years for Europeans to get more involved in Africa—for example through the Takuba task force in the Sahel, or more recently through the “Team Europe” coordinated initiative between member states and EU institutions resulting in trips to Ethiopia, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite genuine French efforts at coordination, the view in some European capitals has sometimes been that France looks after its own interests in Africa, and then seeks partners to share the burden. Right or wrong, this view could prove an obstacle for Paris. In the meantime, France’s unique know-how and assets, let alone francophone connections and the importance of the African diaspora in France—the largest in Europe—will remain indispensable. Paris should therefore be genuine in its effort to empower other Europeans to take on increased responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, some European countries are expected to step up and seem to be willing to do so. This is the case for Germany, which has steadily increased its presence in the Sahel and recently completed its first-ever Sahel strategy. With a less visible colonial record on the continent, Germany could appear as a more acceptable partner than France in many places. Some perceived German weaknesses at the European level, such as its absence from the UN Security Council or its alleged leniency vis-à-vis Russia, could conversely prove to be assets for building confidence with Africans. But Germany will need to convince African states that it can be not only an assistance provider but also a partner for security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain also nurtures ambitions to become a strategic partner to Africa. Madrid has repeatedly voiced its interests for increased collective engagement with the Global South—notably Latin America and Africa—through EU or NATO efforts, and it will continue advocating for this cause during its presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023. In its recently released “Africa strategy,” Madrid pledges to send a warship to the Gulf of Guinea to fight piracy and increase security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the United Kingdom, although not a member of the European Union, remains one of the most knowledgeable European players on Africa-related issues, as well as one of the most active and experienced actors confronting Russian threats worldwide. Despite a low interest for Africa in its Integrated Review, London heralds that it will keep prioritizing Europe’s “wider neighborhood.” Therefore, the country could become an important player in the region, should it have the political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the European level, the most recent declaration of the European Union–African Union summit held in February 2022 has committed to renewing and enhancing “cooperation for peace and security.” EU missions in Africa, which were generally assembled upon French request, have been collateral victims of Russia’s progress. The European Union seems aware of the need to change its approach and is experimenting with new forms of partnership—such as the one with Niger, in which the African country was given the lead on operations, with European supply of equipment through the European Peace Facility and growing bilateral support from several member states. Although the coup in Niger has put an end to this experiment in a very fragile state, this approach was certainly going in the right direction and could be replicated in other, more stable countries. In general, the European Peace Facility, as an instrument initially conceived of in Paris to support its own efforts in Africa (taking over the Africa Peace Facility) and later reoriented to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces, should be supported in a way to fund efforts in both theaters. The European Peace Facility has the potential to be a very competitive instrument, with due diligence carried out up front to ensure that arms are supplied into safe hands, for clear and shared objectives. Failing to do so could add to the sentiment of double standards and frustration in the relations between Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

But the task of convincing the Japanese public is far from complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/publ/w_paper/wp2023/DOJ2023_Digest_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Defense of Japan 2023&lt;/a&gt;” had a difficult task, coming less than eight months after the publication of three major and headline-grabbing national security policy documents. Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/221216anzenhoshou/nss-e.pdf&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/agenda/guideline/strategy/pdf/strategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/agenda/guideline/plan/pdf/program_en.pdf&quot;&gt;Defense Buildup Program&lt;/a&gt;, released in December 2022, announced historically significant commitments, including a dramatic increase in defence spending, acquisition of long-range strike weapons, and a pivot in force posture to reinforce the island chain that extends from the main islands down to Taiwan. This made for a hard act to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet policymaking is only half the battle, and as Japan begins the implementation process, there are reasons to suspect that this could prove the harder part. Considerable gaps still separate the ambition from the reality. After generations of being educated in an identity as a pacifist nation and relying on the US to shoulder the main burden of Japan’s defence, Japanese society and other government departments have to be convinced of the need to provide the country with the resources to assume primary responsibility for its own defence in an era of – as the white paper diplomatically puts it – “changes to the power balance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one indicator of this gap, we need only follow the money. The December 2022 commitments to increase the defence budget triggered a still unresolved debate on the question of finance. Initially, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida proposed to source the money through higher taxes. This partly reflected concern over Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which stands above 250%. Opting for tax rather than borrowing also sends a more convincing signal that the increases are sustainable. If all goes to plan, by 2027 Japan should be on track to have the third biggest defence budget in the world. However, opposition to this approach – including from inside the ruling party – caused Mr Kishida to back off. Among the competing demands on the budget is an expensive programme designed to raise the birth rate, inter alia by doubling child support. But the same demographic trends that are making it harder to hit military recruitment targets are also shrinking the tax base. The government is now reported to be considering selling off some of its stake in Japanese companies – worth over $200 billion – to help raise the money. A law was passed in June to create a defence funding pool made up of such non-tax revenues. Some combination of tax, debt and other resources now appears more likely. However, the one-off nature of non-tax solutions is a disadvantage from a strategic point of view, and Kishida’s retreat reveals how far the government still has to go to convince key constituencies of the urgency and importance of resourcing a stronger and more independently capable defence capacity. Clearly, there is more to be done on the public diplomacy front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The white paper offers a renewed effort of presentation that seems intended to bring home to the Japanese population and others the rationale for the planned build-up in defence capabilities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence white paper published on 28 July 2023 contains hardly any new information about the threats facing Japan and the capacities it needs to confront them. Rather, it offers a renewed effort of presentation that seems intended to bring home to the Japanese population and others the rationale for the planned build-up in defence capabilities that is necessary to achieve deterrence in the current context. Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada launches this narrative in the opening line of the white paper’s foreword with a bold historical assertion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is at a turning point in history. The international community is facing its greatest trial since World War II, and we have entered a new era of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests a greater trial than the Cold War, which was hardly “cold” at all for the region around Japan. Is Hamada’s rhetoric pure hyperbole, or is he justified in the judgement that the present era’s challenges surpass those of a period that saw an unbroken chain of Asian wars – from the Chinese civil war, the Vietnamese war of liberation and the Malay “emergency” in the 1940s, through the Korean war in the 50s, the Indonesian “confrontation” and renewed Vietnam War in the 60s, to Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia and the China’s invasion of Vietnam that lasted until the end of the 1970s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we have to step into the shoes of the officials responsible for Japan’s security. From this perspective, while there was incessant violence in Asia during the Cold War, the threat to Japan itself and to the stability of the basic principles of the world order that allowed for Japan’s return to sovereignty and rise to prosperity may appear more severe now than they did then. Mr Hamada’s foreword continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an unprecedented situation. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shown disregard for international law by launching an aggression against a sovereign country and repeating rhetoric and actions that can be interpreted as threats of nuclear weapons use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of disregard for law, naked conquest, and nuclear threats by a neighbour of Japan might seem bad enough, but it is only part of Japan’s security problems. A closer neighbour, North Korea, has not only developed nuclear weapons and long-range delivery systems (which it flies over Japan and sometimes drops into surrounding waters), but its ability to do so while under sanctions by the UN Security Council justifies doubts about the reliability of that institution itself, as well as the attitude of China to its responsibilities as a permanent member. If Beijing’s inability to acknowledge Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not enough cause for concern, its military has taken to patrolling the seas and airspace around Japan together with Russian naval and airborne nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The combination of disregard for law, naked conquest, and nuclear threats by neighbouring Russia is only part of Japan’s security problems&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the white paper makes the following evaluations. North Korea’s military activities pose a “grave and imminent threat to Japan’s national security”. Russia’s military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, together with its strategic coordination with China, are described as of “strong security concern”. China’s current external stance, military activities, and other activities are described as “a matter of serious concern for Japan and the international community”, presenting an “unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rate of change in the security environment that justifies a shift in Japan’s defence is communicated in a special feature titled “An Era of Upheavals: 10 Years of Change”. This era begins in 2013, the year of Japan’s first NSS, and coincidentally the year Xi Jinping topped his titles of Communist Party General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission by becoming President of China. This section contains numerous upward-tilting graphs detailing the increase in threats; Japanese defence investment; and cooperation with Japan’s ally the US, “like-minded” countries, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Japan’s defence establishment has drawn two main conclusions: that there is a need to defend the country “by ourselves” (by implication not relying as much on the US), and to achieve deterrence that makes the opponent think “attacking Japan will not achieve its goals”. In material and technological terms, Japan has the wherewithal to achieve both objectives. The question is whether Japan’s population – particularly its taxpayers and would-be military recruits – can be convinced that this is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

The graphs, maps, and tables in this report only highlight a limited range of the complex changes involved, and reliable data are often lacking for the years after 2020. They still show, however, that the civil and military role of the world’s major powers is in a process of dramatic and unpredictable change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-key-impact-of-chinas-emergence-as-a-major-global-economic-power&quot;&gt;The Key Impact of China’s Emergence as a Major Global Economic Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has emerged as an economic superpower that rivals the United States in many ways, although the total economic power of modern democracies — most of which are strategic partners of the United States — vastly exceeds the size of the Chinese economy, trade efforts, and efforts in technology and research and development. China also faces major internal challenges created by outside restrictions and economic sanctions, its handling of Covid-19, and state interference in its economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China is already competing with the economies of developed democratic states on a global level. Its “belt and road” efforts to establish economic ties to developing states and control critical minerals and resources. It may succeed in creating a rival economic bloc that can function and grow outside the “rules-based order” democracies created after World War II, and it is already competing in its relations with a number of developing states and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends presented in this report show that this competition may well become an ongoing confrontation between China and its allies, and developed democracies and their strategic partners, unless radical changes take place in Chinese policies and leadership. And — as is discussed shortly — is a growing level of civil confrontation that is being matched by military confrontation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-diminished-global-economic-role&quot;&gt;Russia’s Diminished Global Economic Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graphics show that Russia is not an economic superpower now that it has lost control of most East European states and many of the Central European and Asian elements of the former Soviet Union. Russia has long lagged badly in total economic growth, trade, research and development, and all the other major areas of economic power. Russia’s size, geographic position, and large oil and gas reserves do, however, still make it a key global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-uncertainties-in-the-civil-impacts-of-economic-power&quot;&gt;Key Uncertainties in the Civil Impacts of Economic Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed, however, that current trends can only tell part of the story. Any analysis of economic and civil power will be shaped by many key trends that cannot be quantified. They include the longer-term impacts of the economic stresses between and within developed states, the impact of internal politics, the impact of demographic change and population pressure, and the impact of global warming. They also include the degree to which the developed democracies can succeed in cooperating and creating truly functional economic strategic partnerships. As yet, governments often rely far more on rhetoric about such cooperation than on taking tangible action, although there are positive indicators as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics in this analysis also do not include the developing world. Here, the allocation of international economic power has generally favored developed states. As the UN, World Bank, IMF, and a host of NGO reports make clear, many states have failed to move towards effective development and face major challenges from failed or corrupt governance, repression and internal division, population pressure, limited water supplies, and climate change. For all the former rhetoric about globalism, this includes at least one-third of the world’s nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are cases like India, where the trends in global power could move in other directions. While they are not yet positive enough to include in this analysis, India has overtaken China as the world’s most populous state, has a GDP of some $9.3 trillion, and ranks high in terms of total military spending. Several major petroleum states in the Gulf are taking positive steps to develop beyond a reliance on energy exports, as are some states in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For all the failings in the developing world, they are also important potential successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-trends-in-military-power&quot;&gt;The Impact of Trends in Military Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphs and tables that follow show that the United States remains the world’s largest military power, the one with the most combat experience and highest levels of total spending and investment in modernization, and the one with the strongest strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear, however, that the United States already faces growing competition from China, particularly in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean as well. In the case of Taiwan, competition has already turned to serious confrontation and the risk of war. Once again, China has vastly increased its capabilities since 1990, as well as its military links to other Asia power. Much depends on the United States’ ability to strengthen its strategic partnerships with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and other Asian states — as well as European states with major power projection capabilities like Great Britain and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uncertainties-driven-by-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Uncertainties Driven by the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States and its strategic partners face a major challenge from Russia and one that current U.S. national strategy tends to seriously understate. As the graphics show, Russia may not have an economy that can fully support its present conventional forces, but it remains a major threat to the United States’ European strategic partners and NATO, and the Russian military threat must be given equal priority with that from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends shown in this analysis do not generally go beyond 2021 and cannot reflect the many longer-term changes in the military balance that are growing out of the war in Ukraine. It is clear, however, that the United States and its NATO allies are engaged in major proxy war, supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia. They also are already rebuilding NATO’s overall level of extended deterrence against Russia, and doing so at a time when Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leader, has made it clear that he sees NATO as a major and continuing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no current way to predict how the war in Ukraine will change the overall balance of military power and how and when it will end. It seems almost certain, however, that as long as Putin rules Russia, the United States and the rest of NATO will be engaged in a new Cold War, and one which will effectively match a similar Cold War between the United States and its strategic partners in Asia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-return-to-nuclear-forces&quot;&gt;A Return to Nuclear Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the final sections of this analysis also show, these two Cold Wars have a major nuclear dimension. The race to build up conventional military power is, in some ways, being outpaced by a new nuclear arms race. This race not only reflects the near collapse of nuclear arms control but a potential return to major tactical, theater, and dual-capable nuclear forces. It also is clear that Russia is now only a superpower to the extent it has inherited a massive legacy of nuclear weapons and technology from the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Rising Economic Power Has Vastly Outstripped Russia and Competes with the U.S. and EU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative Military Spending is Highly Uncertain, but the U.S. still has a Clear Lead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China has made sustained major rises since 2000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia has lagged badly since the early 1990s, but has made significant increases as a result of the Ukraine War.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O5Ir3vB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Estimates Do, However, Reflect a Major Rise in Russian Spending Since 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous SIPRI data reflect a major increase from $65.9 billion 2021 to $86.4 billion in 2022, but this is not a serious rise not relative to the increases made by the U.S., China, and major NATO states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IISS report that the draft Russian 2023 budget, submitted to to the State Duma on 30 September 2022, showed that final core spending for 2022 rose from an original proposal of RUB3.50tr (USD50.0bn) to RUB4.68tr (USD66.9bn), with a corresponding rise in total military spending from RUB4.98tr (USD71.1bn) to RUB6.15tr (USD87.9bn).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reuters reports that Russia spent 2 trillion rubles ($26 billion) on defence in January and February 2023, a 282% rise over the 525.4 billion rubles in the first two months of 2022, and driven by the conflict in the Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other estimates emerging from a Google search indicate Russia’s official 2022 military budget could be 4.7 trillion rubles ($75bn), or higher, and reach $84 billion for 2023. This is 40% more than initial military budget announced in 2021. They also estimate that Russia plans to spend a total of $600 billion on military and the police between 2022–2025, or $150 billion a year&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Military Spending Has Led To a Massive Force Modernization Effort that Continues in 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rises in spite of COVID crisis, investment crisis, and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government fiscal revenues down 30-40% in some months of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military spending up more than 7% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Planned to increase by 7.2% in 2023&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arms Transfers Provide an Important Indicator of Comparative Strategic Influence and Security Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has cancelled its report on World Military expenditures and arms transfers, and there now is no reliable declassified estimate of the actual market value of arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SIPRI does, however, provide an well structure estimate of the total value of major weapons transfers based on estimates of comparable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These SIPIR estimates indicate the the U.S. retains a massive lead over other providers of arms transfers and had 40% of the world total in 2018-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia had a 16% share.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other major arms sellers were largely strategic partners of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China only had a 5.2% share, although it was increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia Only Remains a True Military Superpower in Nuclear Forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Nuclear Capability Is Growing Sharply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems to be more than doubling its stockpile of nuclear weapons. May have risen from around 200 to 350 by 2020. 272 operational for exiting missiles and bombs and 78 for new systems. Possibly grew by 118 warheads during 2020-2021. Estimates for 2023 are 410 weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have detected 270+ new missile silos. 119 in Northwestern China seem to be for ICBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese Military Power estimates China may have some 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030, most deployed on systems capable of ranging the continental United States”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has rejected arms control initiatives and provides steadily less transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is improving nuclear command and control and battle management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deploying advanced solid-fuel mobile ICBMs (DF-21 &amp;amp; DF-31/DF-31A/DF-32AG), MIRV’d liquid fuel ICBM (DF-5B), new MIRV’d DF-41 ICBM, Type 094 SSBN with JL-2 SLBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing low noise 096 SSBNs and a 9,000 kilometer range 096 SLBM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively harder to determine what theater and short-range delivery systems may become dual-capable. DF-21 MRBM (2,150 KM) and DF-26 IRBM (4,000 KM) known to be nuclear. DF-21 is precision strike, dual-capable and could deliver low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modifying H-6 nuclear bombers to H-6N with refueling, missile carrying capability. H-20 stealth bomber in development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May be evolving far beyond countervalue second strike capability. Examining use as theater warfare threat?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is according to the shapes that I lay plans for victory, but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory.” (Sun Tzu)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;柯耀林選舉經理作供 指柯曾令不可提「光時」、港獨及「攬炒」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3bYWueY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第105天。參選新東的區政聯盟前召集人兼前西貢區議員柯耀林，今傳召選舉經理陳展浚作供，陳稱區政聯盟為鬆散的組織，成員團體互不代表和從屬，而柯曾考慮參選新界東和超級區議會，但於超區協調會議看到有岑敖暉後，認為岑知名度很高、他參選超區無任何空間，終決定參選新東。陳並指，柯只曾出席首次新東協調會議但早走、缺席第二次協調會議，亦無收過任何協調文件，而他無向組織者查詢會上內容，因認為組織者有責任就重要事項主動通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，曾為柯發布「墨落無悔」聲明帖文，而柯自2019年區選便命令團隊不可於宣傳材料提及「光復香港 時代革命」和支持港獨，初選時亦不容出現「攬炒」二字，指他們團隊均認為如癱瘓政府運作，「香港會何去何從呢？癱瘓咗又點樣呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方傳區政聯盟執委柯耀林助理作供&quot;&gt;辯方傳區政聯盟執委、柯耀林助理作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成上周作供完畢，新東餘下3名被告林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林均不作供，只有柯耀林傳召一名辯方證人。辯方大律師唐樂山今傳召曾任柯助理和選舉經理的陳展浚作供，陳確認於2012年任民主黨實習生、被分配到將軍澳工作時認識時為民主黨黨員的柯耀林，同年柯排劉慧卿名單參與立法會選舉。陳於2013年加入民主黨、2016年退黨，柯亦於2018年退黨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注陳如何知道，陳指因當時在柯耀林與林卓廷爭拗的風波中，柯帶領59人退黨，「我中間係有參與全程個過程同埋規劃」；並確認柯於2017年從馬來西亞返港，為2019年區議會選舉準備時，他已成為柯的助理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯要求定期更新區議會事務及政治發展&quot;&gt;助理稱柯要求定期更新區議會事務及政治發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，柯於2004至2011年任西貢廣明區議員，並於2019年再度當選，其後他正式成為柯的議員助理。陳指柯並非全職區議員，他同時是一間物業管理公司的全職營運總監、廣明苑業主立案法團主席，亦是將軍澳民生關注組主席和區政聯盟召集人；而陳與柯每日會通電話，如時間許可一星期至少有三晚一起吃飯和開會，至初選期間陳任柯的選舉經理，基本上每日見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PUWh3H3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 柯耀林&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯會在平日晚上和周末處理區議會事務、與市民會面，而因柯「工作真係好繁忙」，故要求他們定期甚至每天向他更新區議會事務和政治發展，柯每天與他通電話時亦會問及，但陳「有冇同佢講、講漏咗佢都唔會知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區政聯盟會章提一國兩制原則下爭取民主&quot;&gt;區政聯盟會章提一國兩制原則下爭取民主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚同意，柯耀林自2000年就是將軍澳民生關注組成員，初選期間任該組織主席；陳則是組織召集人，組織主要關注將軍澳地區工作和參與西貢區議會的選舉和議會事務，但並非政黨，只是跨民主派政黨地區組織，成員包括獨立人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，將軍澳民生關注組與沙田區政、大埔及北區團隊，為區政聯盟的三大團體成員，聯盟很多成員是從民主黨和新民主同盟離開，而陳是執委會成員，其有份草擬的會章第一條為「在一國兩制大原則下，爭取民主、維護自由、捍衛法治，團結社區力量，為香港市民服務」，亦規定只能以團體成員身分加入。惟陳表示，2020年3月區政聯盟進行改組，不再以團體形式運作、要以個人身分加入，主要是應付沙田區政有逾半成員退出的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱區政聯盟為共享資源成立-組織鬆散成員團體互不代表及從屬&quot;&gt;助理稱區政聯盟為「共享資源」成立 組織鬆散、成員團體互不代表及從屬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，不論改組前後，「理論上」都是由執委會管理聯盟事務，但2019年區議會選舉後，執委會無再開過一次正式會議，故改組時無即時修改會章，至2021年才修改。法官李運騰一度指，若然如此改組便違反會章，陳指「唔可以咁講」，因他們有「追認」並將「團體」字眼改為「個人」。李一度說：「這對我來說在法律上完全不合理。（“None of that makes any legal sense to me.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，區政聯盟是一個組織鬆散的組織，基本上三大團體就代表三大地區，「有自己完全嘅自主性，我哋互不代表，互不從屬。」辯方問若組織如此鬆散，為何會存在？陳指組織成立是望為2019年區議會選舉和2020年立法會選舉「共享資源」，「只不過希望有一個共同嘅組織名義。」李運騰問，那會章第一條是否組織真正的目的？陳同意，並指區政聯盟支持者來自區議員「樁腳」，票源與民主黨和新民主同盟高度重疊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱獲鍾錦麟告知有初選柯參加初選主要目的為得知支持度&quot;&gt;助理稱獲鍾錦麟告知有初選、柯參加初選主要目的為得知支持度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參加初選的經過，陳展浚指於2020年3至4月時，時任西貢區議會主席兼前民主動力副召集人、新民主同盟的鍾錦麟，詢問他們有否意欲參加初選和選舉協調，他即時通知柯耀林。陳並解釋，在西貢區議會中，將軍澳民生關注組與新民主同盟「衝突都幾大」，主要透過他和鍾作雙方溝通區議會和選舉協調事務的渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯當時有表達對參加初選的興趣，「因為無論有冇初選，我哋都計劃必然參與2020年嘅立法會選舉」，又指據過往經驗，一名候選人參加初選需30至50萬選舉經費，參與正式選舉至少需150至200萬，若直接參加直選，「柯生好大機會要按樓」；故參與初選最主要目的是望做民調以知道柯的支持度，如支持度低就不參與直選，可「慳返啲錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯並非區政聯盟唯一一個考慮出選的候選人，初期考慮出選的還包括大埔及北區團隊的區鎮樺，以及沙田區政的丁仕元和李永成。被問柯對參選哪區有興趣，陳指「其實唔係主要佢有興趣，係其他人希望佢出選超區」，而將軍澳民生關注組則想他參選新界東；陳指柯本人對兩區均持開放態度，視乎其他人如何商討和決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯首次新東協調會議早走因西貢區議會開會缺席第二次會議&quot;&gt;助理稱柯首次新東協調會議早走、因西貢區議會開會缺席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就4月14日的首次新東協調會議，陳展浚指柯耀林有出席但早走，並於離開後即時致電他，指會議中段開始「有啲人因為一啲恩怨不斷喺度爭拗」，故離場並約陳於將軍澳共膳。陳指當晚9時看到柯，柯稱會議達成一些共識，包括辦投票而非民調、「贏咗初選有得選，輸咗冇得」、新東出線名額為「6+1」。法官指柯的說話屬傳聞證供，辯方指並非依賴其說話真實性，只是作為背景。陳並確認柯當時未決定參選超區抑或新東，當時「靜觀其變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，據他所知區鎮樺也有出席首次會議，區並通知柯5月5日第二次新東會議，但柯終無出席，因西貢區議會當晚開會到晚上10時。辯方展示會議出席紀錄，陳確認當天列席，而鍾錦麟和柯耀林均由約早上9時半開會至晚上10時40分。陳指因當天大埔區議會亦超時，故區鎮樺也無出席第二次會議，他事後從新聞報導得知李永成有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指他無問李永成會上發生何事，因李也有意出選新界東，「大家係內部競爭關係，唔係好方便」；而當時亦「冇呢個意識去問」組織者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯曾出席超區協調會議-因岑敖暉知名度高遂不考慮超區&quot;&gt;助理稱柯曾出席超區協調會議 因岑敖暉知名度高遂不考慮超區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯當時未決定參選新東抑或超區，並於5月14日出席超區協調會議。柯事後告訴陳，看到岑敖暉出席會議，認為岑「知名度好高」，「佢覺得計過數，超級區議會冇任何空間」，故不再考慮參選超級區議會；而柯於初選截止提名前兩三日才決定參選新界東。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱無收過協調文件無查詢因認為組織者有責任主動通知&quot;&gt;助理稱無收過協調文件、無查詢因認為組織者有責任主動通知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他無從組織者、柯耀林及區政聯盟收到任何有關協調會議共識和協議的文件和草稿。法官陳仲衡問，他們無出席第二次會議、亦無從組織者收到文件，不會想從組織者知道會上發生何事嗎？陳說：「如果係有重要嘅事項，協調者係有責任主動通知我哋，即使我哋冇出席。」李運騰指，但當時柯耀林並無表明會參選新界東，陳仍認為組織者有責任就重要決定通知他們？陳說：「係，因為無論邊個出選，區政聯盟都好大機會派人出選。」法官陳慶偉追問，為何陳會認為組織者有責任通知潛在初選參與者，陳展浚重申因區政聯盟「明顯係好大機會會參與直選，咁所以佢都係需要接觸返我哋，如果我哋冇出席，係要話返畀我哋聽究竟係咪有任何決定」，聯盟只是未定出選人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指認為區政聯盟應問組織者，因他們不想在無勝算的正式選舉花百多萬，並再追問為何當時無興趣向組織者查詢。陳展浚指因認為其中一個組織者鍾錦麟也知道他們因區議會事務缺席第二次會議，如該次會議內容「真係咁重要，佢會通知我哋，佢冇同我哋講，我哋就唔問」。陳仲衡指，但鍾當天也同於西貢區議會開會，不知道協調會議發生何事，陳展浚說：「咁可能佢哋民主動力事後有溝通。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VMTLFgl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續說，因此陳是說，區政聯盟樂意將所有責任推給其他人、自己則不用承擔任何責任？陳說：「誒法官閣下，我唔知你點樣理解，我只係將事實去講返出嚟嘅啫。」陳慶偉追問他的理解與陳展浚理解是否一致？陳說只能說他們頗依賴組織者主動提供最新發展，「如果你覺得我哋呢方面做得不足，呢個都係事實嚟嘅，因為我哋的確係一個幾鬆散嘅組織」；又指他們只是出席了第一次會議，「理解嘅嘢就係咁多」，組織者之後無任何更新，再找他們已是有關票站事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，因此柯報名參選新東前，只曾出席第一次協調會議的頭半部分，並缺席第二次會議，亦從沒有從組織者收到任何文件，實際上他對協調會議上說過的事知道很少？陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯耀林曾令團隊不可有光時港獨及攬炒&quot;&gt;助理稱柯耀林曾令團隊不可有「光時」、港獨及「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就柯耀林 Facebook 發布的「墨落無悔」發問，陳指柯的 Facebook 專頁除了柯外，還有約十人包括他管理，施德來和陳志全聞言面露驚訝和發笑。陳並指，帖文基本上由團隊其他人撰寫，柯不會撰文，但重要的帖文會由柯看過後才發布，涉地區事務的則未必全部看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦確認，就柯所有選舉宣傳材料包括片段和單張，均由團隊成員草擬，陳審批和最終修改，再交柯做最終決定和修改。至於柯曾否就相關內容作出指示，陳指由2019年區議會選舉開始，柯便命令全個將軍澳民生關注組、包括其團隊，「唔可以有『光復香港 時代革命』口號，同埋係支持港獨嘅」，而「初選期間都唔容許有『攬炒』呢兩個字出現」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問柯曾否定義「攬炒」，陳稱他們無很詳細定義，但柯與他們整個將軍澳團隊的看法，也是：「如果癱瘓政府嘅運作嘅話，香港會何去何從呢？癱瘓咗又點樣呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯 Facebook 的「墨落無悔」聲明是由他發布，事前他有與柯於 WhatsApp 討論。辯方明將展示相關紀錄，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議只是發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，刺激他們思考「要簽啲乜嘢」去展現抗爭意志，但他們並非想製作一份以協調會議為基礎的協議、聲明無寫上會議已達成共識的項目，「墨落」中會運用否決權迫特首回應五大訴求、及支持度不足須停止選舉工程兩點聲明，均是具爭議或暫時未有共識。法官陳慶偉問，發起「墨落無悔」是否填補戴耀廷留下的空白（fill the gap of Benny Tai）？鄒不同意。而就主控萬德豪指，鄒發起「墨落」是想集結人一起否決預算案，鄒說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？唔同意」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，張可森當時加上「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，是承上啟下，諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」及帶出「墨落」兩點聲明；亦「畫龍點睛」，精要之處在「選民」，強調參選人如反悔要接受選民問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與墨落無悔僅導火線未必有密切因果關係&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與「墨落無悔」僅導火線、未必有密切因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第6日作供，今續接受控方盤問。開庭前，有旁聽親友向鄒家成說：「今日最後一日」，鄒說「希望係啦」，有親友回應：「加油呀捱埋今日呀。」甫開庭，鄒笑着向主控萬德豪問：「Mr. Man, you don’t need Monday right?」林卓廷等發笑，萬德豪笑問：「Why are you asking me?」鄒答：「我會全力配合。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問焦點，在於鄒家成等人發起的「墨落無悔」聲明，是否戴耀廷原擬要求參選人簽署的協調會議共識。控方先引鄒家成2020年6月與張可森和梁晃維的訪問發問，被問「點解發起抗爭聲明」時，鄒表示：「一路開幾次會都話係有一個共同綱領大家要簽，但喺無通知我哋嘅情況底下，跟住就開咗個記招跟住就話唔需要簽，嗰陣先知原來係唔需要簽。我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒同意，他提及「一路開幾次會」是指新東協調會議。陳慶偉指理解鄒說法亦是指向其他兩人，鄒否認，並重申訪問前「我哋冇夾過」，3人均是「自說自話」，記者問題也是「當場先知」。李運騰提到，而鄒提到的感受，是其他兩人也有的感覺？鄒說根據當時討論，「我估佢哋應該都有呢個感覺」，追問下稱「我相信嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就訪問提到要簽「共同綱領」，鄒同意是指「已達成共識的共同綱領」，而提到不想被泛民撕毀約章，是想就已達成的共識簽署。萬問，因此3人發起「墨落無悔」？鄒認為「未必有一個好密切嘅因果關係」，指戴稱毋須簽文件的說法只是發起「墨落」的背景和「導火線（triggering point）」，刺激他們思考要簽什麼文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放墨落-因無助展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放「墨落」 因無助展現抗爭意志&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續說，而「墨落」不一定反映協調會議已同意的事項，可能「更進一步」？鄒同意，指「因為我哋唔係想整一個以協調會議為基礎嘅協議呀嘛」，故聲明「其實冇寫一啲已達成共識嘅項目喺度」。李提到，但聲明提及「最大公因數」，「墨落」兩點聲明（即會運用否決權，及如支持度不足會停止選舉工程），是否就是「最大公因數」？鄒否認，指辦初選、辦論壇、「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」、及以靈童制為替補機制4點共識，才是他們討論時「搵到五區嘅最大公因數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並強調，沒有將上述4點放進「墨落」，「因為對我嚟講一件事還一件事」，發起「墨落」目的就是想「展現抗爭意志」和「保障返一啲政治素人」。鄒指他的確同意想簽一份由初選籌組平台提供的文件，因這是他參加兩次新東會議後的想法；不過當戴稱毋須簽，就刺激他們思考「我哋需要簽啲乜嘢去展現我哋嘅抗爭意志」，經討論後得出兩點聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問，鄒認為「墨落」是一個好機會，讓他放進4點共識讓人們簽署嗎？鄒說不會，「因為嗰4點係無助於展現抗爭意志嘅，我覺得一般市民大眾根本就唔 care 嗰4點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指張可森擬墨落理應無悔一句-諷刺戴耀廷講咗嘅嘢唔算數&quot;&gt;鄒指張可森擬「墨落理應無悔」一句 諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落」提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒引張可森指這是「畫龍點眼」的說法，精要之處在於「選民」兩字，張想強調「墨落」是面向公眾的聲明，「要接受問責嘅對象係選民，而唔係我哋三個或者其他參選人」。萬德豪說任何公開聲明也是面向公眾，鄒說：「所以佢想畫龍點睛加呢句說話囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續主動交代背景，「畀大家再了解多啲個 picture」，指「墨落」初稿標題原只是「本土派立場聲明書」，但張可森「想昇華成個聲明，叫我哋畀啲時間佢再諗多一個標題」，終加上「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」，並改為「抗爭派立場聲明書」，內文亦加入「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，「點睛」之處是運用否決權迫使特首回應五大訴求？鄒指「墨落」兩點聲明當然是重點，但重申精要之處在「選民」。李運騰問，即鄒想透過聲明告訴選民他們進入立法會會做的事？鄒說：「我同意㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續說，但看到聲明的選民並不會知道參與者之間達成過的協議，根本不存在「失信」，鄒重申「之前協調會議達成咗嘅共識係唔重要嘅……選民根本冇興趣知道嗰4點」，而「墨落理應無悔」一句主要指參選人簽了「墨落」並同意聲明中的兩點，如最後違反承諾就等於「失信於選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指如那是真的，該句便應附在提及兩點聲明的第三段。鄒指因此他曾提過據張可森說法，該句是「過渡句」，「佢話想產生一個承上啟下同畫龍點睛嘅作用」，張一方面想「承上」諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」，另一方面想「啟下」談及兩點聲明，「佢有佢嘅堅持啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議-指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&quot;&gt;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議 指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在盤問下續指，協調會議4點共識對選民不重要，是因無助展現抗爭意志，但認為辦初選和論壇、及贏輸機制是對參選人重要，至於靈童制他則不太重視。陳慶偉打斷指，認為靈童制對參選人和選民重要，指黃之鋒於九東會議就此爭論，如他投選黃之鋒，也想知道誰是他的 Plan B；陳亦認為贏輸機制對選民重要，舉例若他投票予萬德豪，而萬落敗仍參加正式選舉，他一定不會投選他。陳又主動提到「三投三不投」，指如果贏輸機制不重要，「吳政亨為什麼要花這麼多錢在《蘋果日報》賣廣告？要賣給誰看？《蘋果日報》的目標讀者是誰？是公眾！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說「嗱我初選真係唔識佢（吳政亨）㗎」，又笑着回應，「其實我同意你講嘅嘢，我啱啱已經準備講你啱啱講嘅嘢喇」，被告和旁聽席發笑。鄒並指討論以靈童制抑或排名制作替補機制時，大家都不想被DQ後自己主張的理念無人繼承，舉例如他被DQ，用排名制便會由范國威代表他，但「支持我嘅人未必係會投畀佢范國威嘅」。鄒續指對他而言，靈童制「我覺得係常識嚟㗎喇」，新東亦幾乎無爭拗，在2016年立法會選舉亦已開始使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又重申，沒有將靈童制寫進「墨落」，是因屬五區共同共識，並指「我喺 set 一個聲明嘅時候，決定咩 point 呢，除咗係覺得能夠展現抗爭意志呢個考慮之外，亦都有具爭議性或者當時未有共識嘅考慮」。陳仲衡問，鄒是指因戴耀廷未能就參與者同意的事項提供聲明簽署，故3人決定就未取得共識的事項發布聲明？鄒說：「呢個真係我哋當時討論個次序。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示明白，但若然如此為何不在聲明表明：戴耀廷曾提出就已同意的事項簽協議但食言、而這不重要，重要的是有未取得共識的事項，而發起人望邀請人就此簽署。鄒說：「我覺得交代咗喎，你啱啱講嘅嘢都正正係我哋嘅諗法嚟。」陳慶偉問，因此「墨落」是一份補充文件，補充（complement）共同綱領？鄒重申，原本達成的共識是「墨落」的背景，而會運用否決權一點有很大爭議性，他們三人亦覺得重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落」是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問到，梁晃維於訪問稱：「既然如果戴教授佢唔希望好似送上一個魔鬼嘅祝福，令到好多人被DQ嘅話，咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任，所以就會有呢個聲明書出現」，問是否指因戴耀廷不想簽署文件，故3人發聲明就是承擔製造DQ風險的責任？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，戴稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，故三人決定發起一個自願性質的聲明，讓參選人自行承擔被DQ風險。陳慶偉續問，即3人嘗試填補戴留下的空白（「fill the gap of Benny Tai」，即頂替戴無做的事）？鄒不同意，亦不同意會予聲明讀者此印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱草擬墨落時將項目分成有共識及具爭議或暫未有共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱草擬「墨落」時將項目分成有共識、及具爭議或暫未有共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒盤問下續指，不知道新西和港島有否就否決財案達成共識。萬德豪問他有無興趣知道？鄒說「其實都唔係話咁有興趣」，旁聽發笑。鄒續提到討論草擬「墨落」時，曾將協調會議上討論過的項目分成兩個類別，有如「兩個籃」，一個是「最大公因數」，即已達成共識的事項；另一個是「具爭議性」或「暫時未有共識」的項目。而當時他帶領以新東協調會議為藍本一起討論，並第一時間說明第二次新東會議的爭拗，將否決預算案「揼咗落去具爭議性呢個籃度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問他不想知道新西和港島會議的事？鄒指因當時主要想梳理兩個籃內有什麼，「既然我搵到喇，咁我哋就冇再進一步去討論，即係份『墨落無悔』趕住出街呀。」鄒並指，其後找出辦初選等4點共識，放進有共識一籃。至於就「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一點，則放進「暫時未有共識」一籃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱出線人數未達共識-故停止選舉工程一點寫得較籠統&quot;&gt;鄒稱出線人數未達共識 故停止選舉工程一點寫得較「籠統」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，雖然這點在新東無爭議，但梁晃維當時提到港島「好煩好複雜」，出線人數未傾好、「又無啦啦話有四票」；張可森則稱九西連目標議席亦未傾好，亦有區指要「n（目標議席）+1」或「n+2」，故他們終將該點聲明「寫得籠統少少」，讓其他區參選人未來仍有一個商討的空間。他們亦認為該點「幾重要」，因是保障政治素人，故也放進「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指，如這是鄒的關注，聲明卻無提及出線名單數目、或該數目如何決定。鄒同意沒寫明，解釋因當時有數個區連出線人數和目標議席都未達共識，故只寫上「可得議席範圍」；亦因有選區會於初選後再討論出線名單，遂故意無寫上棄選的時間點，以讓簽署人跟從該區得出的結果。鄒又強調，棄選機制是初選邏輯，亦保障本土政治素人，「可能因為我哋三個都係政治素人，我哋睇到個重要性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他明白該點精神如「三投三不投」，及對素人的重要性，但再指如鄒關注出線名單數，為何不在聲明寫明，又指三人當時應在想戴耀廷遺漏了一個重要的事項，「重要到認為你們要填補空白！」鄒回應，認為各區協調會議並非沒有處理棄選機制，而在可見的未來亦不是會沒有共識，他認為聲明已清晰交代，至於法官指議席數目不清晰、沒有寫明「6 6 4 4 3」，「係因為其他區都仲傾緊吖嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，控方的立場就是，這兩點其實就是參與者達成最重要的共識，所以鄒家成3人才決定將這兩點放進「墨落」，但鄒說有關目標議席未有共識，故是測試鄒的邏輯，問鄒是否明白，惟鄒搖頭，亦指沒有要再解釋的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落無悔非35計劃參選人共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落無悔」非「35+計劃」參選人共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒早前稱「墨落無悔」與「35+計劃」無關，萬問若然如此，鄒實可自己發表聲明，無需叫其他人簽署一份聯合聲明？鄒回應：「我係可以有呢個選項，但我冇選擇呢個選項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指鄒沒有這樣做，是因為想集結其他人一同在立會過半後否決財政預算案？鄒望着萬說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？」引來哄堂大笑，鄒續說「唔同意」。萬再問，「墨落無悔」的內容，是否「35+計劃」參選人達成的共識？鄒說「不是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示五大訴求中最重視雙普選，但若政府回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，他也會接受，指爭取訴求需要長時間、五大訴求並非一步登天：「袋住先啦！爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到。」控方質疑鄒是「妥協」，鄒不同意，並指若政府不回應五大訴求，只是給予「甜頭」來「氹」議員投贊成票，此情況下投贊成才屬妥協；但在這情況下，他仍會對預算案投反對票，強調「有回應（五大訴求）先至有得傾」，亦同意張可森稱「抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成6日作供，步入囚室前頻頻向旁聽和律師席抱拳致謝。新東餘下3名被告林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林均不出庭作供，柯耀林一方將傳召一名辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權-鄒指沒看過&quot;&gt;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權 鄒指沒看過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成繼續接受盤問。他在盤問下同意，知道張可森和梁晃維有 Facebook，但「未 friend 到成日睇」，對他們有關初選的帖文也未必有興趣。控方續展示張可森6月11日、即「墨落」發布後翌日的帖文，提到與鄒和梁晃維一同發起「墨落」，及新西協調會議上所有人都逐一表明，同意「會運用立法會權員的權力，包括否決財政預算案，要求政府落實五大訴求」。鄒指沒有看過該帖文，亦無獲張告知，他亦無出席過新西協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才有得傾即使有甜頭亦不妥協&quot;&gt;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才「有得傾」、即使有「甜頭」亦不妥協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就張可森於3名發起人的訪問提及，「香港而家討論緊嘅唔係政治，唔係咩妥協嘅藝術，唔係開天殺價、落地還錢，唔係我哋一開始話攬炒，然後佢回一回價我哋又唔攬炒」，鄒指理解張意思是不會看到預算案「派吓錢、或者講吓起醫院咁樣」就會「妥協」。萬德豪指張意思是3人一開始就想「攬炒」？鄒指應無此意思，張亦無向他解釋過如何看「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引張提及，「我哋香港而家討論緊嘅係抗爭，即係如果政治係妥協嘅藝術，抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」，鄒同意其說法。萬追問，即不會妥協、不會談判（negotiate）？鄒說要視乎如何看「妥協」，並指理解張可森稱不容妥協意思是，如果政府在財政預算案可能「畀咗啲甜頭」予立法會議員或民眾、但不回應五大訴求，「我都係投反對票㗎喇」；而「除非你回應咗五大訴求啦、除非你喺 budget 度畀我睇到你有回應啦，有回應先至有得傾囉」，鄒亦同意張的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判-鄒稱視乎政府是否有心推動&quot;&gt;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判 鄒稱視乎政府是否「有心推動」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬問，而即使政府只回應一個或兩個訴求，鄒亦會同意與政府談判？鄒指，「最重要係睇政府個態度係咪有心去推動」，指看過財政預算案、與政府官員有對話，「傾完之後其實你都大概有個了解㗎喇，呢個過程我覺得都係一個談判過程。」鄒又指，如果政府不回應五大訴求，用其他方法「氹啲立法會議員去投贊成票」，此情況下投贊成便屬「妥協」，故張稱「抗爭係不容妥協」，是指「爭取五大訴求係唔可以妥協」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指，但如果政府無回應雙普選，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒承認五大訴求中最重視爭取雙普選，但「真係要好整體睇吓政府如何回應」，亦「真係好難逐個逐個訴求抽走再問我點樣睇」。鄒又指要視乎回應時間：「我假設去到十年之後，其實啲示威者都坐完監咁濟㗎喇，咁要求政府釋放示威者仲有冇意義呢？所以其實係好複雜㗎答呢條問題」，並指除了政府已回應的兩個訴求（撤回逃犯條例和6.12暴動定性），餘下三個訴求中（釋放所有示威者、成立獨立調查委員會及雙普選）「雙普選係應該要堅持到底嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會袋住先-控方質疑屬妥協惟鄒否認&quot;&gt;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會「袋住先」 控方質疑屬「妥協」惟鄒否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，如果在2021年預算案，政府願回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒說：「我會呀。」萬追問：「你會？你會接受？」鄒再說「我會呀」，指「因為爭取訴求係需要長時間」，重申爭取五大訴求「唔係要一步登天，背後更重要嘅精神係，一種鍥而不捨、繼續爭取嘅精神，所以要逐步逐步嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬追問，即使對鄒來說，雙普選是最重要的訴求？鄒笑言：「袋住先啦！」多人發笑，鄒續說：「爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到嘅，要搞諮詢都要時間。」法官李運騰續指，但由當選至政府翌年發表預算案，只有很短、以月計的時間，鄒同意。萬續問，那鄒認為他所說的是妥協嗎？鄒再重申：「我唔同意喎，因為我爭取緊五大訴求吖嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引張可森提及：「當你簽咗呢張嘢（「墨落無悔」）應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔，唔可以話我哋政治就係妥協㗎嘞，所以我哋一開始開個價咁高希望可以落返嚟」，惟鄒說：「佢冇講爭取五大訴求要一步登天喎，Mr. Man。」萬再問，那鄒曾否告知選民他不是要一步登天？鄒指沒有，指他甚少與選民就五大訴求溝通，他在初選期間「主要都係宣揚香港民族理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識-墨落無悔並非重申立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識 「墨落無悔」並非「重申」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦再質疑「墨落無悔」是協調會議共識。就3名發起人在6月19日向組織者發出的訊息，提到當時共39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，並指「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結」。萬德豪問「共同目標」是否否決預算案。鄒指應是按「墨落」的結果理解，即有39人因為「墨落」的第一點聲明而「集結」簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬亦指訊息提到「初選原設共同綱領」，鄒解釋是指協調會議原本有討論過否決權議題，但中間有些拗撬，最後有39個人或政黨同意。法官陳仲衡指，但似乎整段也是談及戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議之前的事，鄒不同意，指「如果唔係唔會出到『墨落無悔』39個人嘅結果出嚟啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，而訊息提到「在戴教授決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖然大部份參與者有簽署『抗爭派立場聲明書』重申自己堅定的立場」，故「墨落」是「重申」運用否決權的立場？鄒問控方是否指參與者原本一直同意會運用否決權一點，而他們有「墨落」後簽署，故是「重申」立場，萬同意。鄒說：「我只能夠講，我個人上，我由持至終都係支持嘅」，而他不是代表其他簽署者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件癱瘓議會不包括解散立會&quot;&gt;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件、「癱瘓議會」不包括解散立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續確認，就「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，「冇發過畀我。」萬續問鄒是否沒有反對協議內容，惟法官陳慶偉指鄒沒收過文件。萬指這是控方案情，林卓廷說「吓」。李運騰續指若證人已否認，控方沒有基礎繼續提問，但引文件提及首7張名單參與官方選舉，問是否有達成共識，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒家成於新東初選民間論壇提到，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指不包括解散立法會。萬續指，而鄒當時知道否決預算案，特首可解散立法會？鄒說：「《基本法》係咁寫，」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出案情，指鄒家成與其他被告串謀取得立法會主導權，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首或政府回應五大訴求，並意圖顛覆國家政權，鄒表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒作供完畢-林卓廷梁國雄柯耀林不出庭作供&quot;&gt;鄒作供完畢 林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林不出庭作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示盤問完結，大律師陳世傑指沒有覆問，亦不會傳召證人，辯方案情完結。鄒完成6日作供，在懲教陪同下步回被告欄，一度向旁聽席微笑戚眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文及代表梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸其後分別表示，林卓廷和梁國雄均選擇不作供亦沒有證人。代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山則指，柯選擇不作供，但會傳召一名事實證人，意味新東案情將完結。法官李運騰笑指：「我必須說這星期的尾聲有些驚喜（surprises）。」案件押至下周一（11日）續審，除柯耀林外，尚餘參選超區的李予信和衞生服務界余慧明未開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒不住向旁聽親友揮手，又指向自己做睡覺手勢，步入囚室時又不停雙手抱拳作揖，向旁聽人士和律師道謝。&lt;/p&gt;

From a military perspective, this is the kind of reconnaissance any capable nation would engage in against a potential opponent to identify targets and possibly prepare them for cyberattack. What was misleading in these reports is that critical infrastructure in Guam was not the primary target. The primary targets, particularly those that would support U.S. forces in any engagement over Taiwan, are located in the United States. China is engaged in a major cyber reconnaissance effort against them. If China is willing to accept the risk of broadening a conflict over Taiwan, it may decide that cyber actions against civilian infrastructure in the United States could usefully disrupt communications and the flow of material needed for military operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese decisionmaking on the use of offensive cyber operations against civilian critical infrastructure will be shaped less by the likelihood of detection and attribution and more by a desire to manage escalation and retaliation. China may decide not to use wide-scale cyber disruption and reserve its efforts for espionage. A decision on how and where to use cyberattacks will also be shaped by the progress (or lack thereof) in any Chinese offense; a lack of success could lead to more aggressive cyber actions. The broad calculus for China’s decisionmaking will likely involve weighing the relative military advantage gained from cyberattacks on critical infrastructure against the probability that such attacks would provoke a harsh U.S. response or expand the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of China’s decisions will be shaped by resource constraints. Cyberattacks are often tailored for specific vulnerabilities and targets have a greater chance of success but take time (usually a few months) to develop. Even China faces limits on skilled personnel. These two factors suggest some prioritization of targets for cyberattack. A Chinese priority list of targets will be shaped by a balance between the likely military payoff and the political risk of expanded conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This estimate assumes that China does not engage in reconnaissance of targets unless it is considering attacking them. It is also based on Russian and U.S. practice in using offensive cyber actions against opponents’ critical infrastructures during invasion. China’s Strategic Support Force, created in 2015, combines space, cyber, electronic, and information operation capabilities. Published Chinese military doctrines discuss the central role of informatized warfare, the importance of the cyber domain in any conflict between the United States and China, and strategies to achieve “dominance in the space, cyber, electromagnetic, and possibly psychological domains.” The intent is to disrupt, paralyze, or destroy an opponent’s operational capabilities. This makes it likely that China has considered attacks on critical U.S. civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most probable targets fall into three categories: The first would be electrical power facilities. The second would be the pipelines and railroads in the continental United States that connect to these locations. The third would be the logistics and communications networks, including those that support supply chains for manufacturing precision-guided munitions and military aircraft. Primary targets would include telecommunications systems in cities and regions where naval and air bases are located, such as California, Hawaii, and Washington State. All are logical targets for cyber disruption, and many are located on the United States’ Pacific Rim. Disruptions at such targets would provide near-term, tangible military advantage and would be conducted in parallel with Chinese cyber actions against military targets, such as information systems and advanced weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The broad calculus for China’s decisionmaking will likely involve weighing the relative military advantage gained from cyberattacks on critical infrastructure against the probability that such attacks would provoke a harsh U.S. response or expand the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s planning is likely bound by a desire to minimize the probability of a general war with the United States. Cyberattacks against targets in the continental United States and Hawaii could threaten to prolong any conflict and make it unmanageable. The question for China’s leaders is whether quick and precise strikes on civilian critical infrastructure with temporary effects justify this strategic risk. In preparing to defend against cyberattacks, however, the United States cannot assume that China will decide on a minimalist course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;likely-targets&quot;&gt;Likely Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All digital targets are vulnerable to some degree. Pipelines, for example, stretch for thousands of miles across several states and traverse sparsely populated areas. They are digitally controlled, with many possible points for both cyber and physical disruption. The ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline showed that short-term disruption can produce political benefits. Although the Biden administration (led by the Transportation Security Administration) is taking steps to reduce risks, there are many possible digital and physical targets along the length of a pipeline, and hardening them will take time. Electric grids have always been considered high-value targets and the potential vulnerabilities of electrical grids are well-known. There has been progress in reducing vulnerability in the years since the 2007 Aurora test showed how a cyberattack could cause physical damage to an electrical power generator, but electrical power generation and transmission remains perhaps the most valuable target for disruption by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could also target the communications infrastructure for disruption. Ukraine’s telecommunications infrastructure was a key target for Russia. In a Taiwan scenario, this could include attacks on undersea fiber-optic cables and communications satellites. It could also include kinetic attacks on physical infrastructure. Like pipelines, undersea fiber-optic cables stretch thousands of miles. They are most vulnerable in relatively shallow waters. Something as simple as a fishing trawler hooking and breaking a cable is effective. It is also likely that China will attempt to disrupt, blind, or disable both military and commercial satellites for reconnaissance, navigation, and communications. China may not distinguish between military and commercial satellites, and commercial satellites play an essential role in U.S. military communications. Chinese officials have privately complained about Starlink. China has practiced jamming and spoofing satellite signals for navigation, and media reports and leaked U.S. documents state that China has developed cyber “weapons” for use against U.S. satellites. Using cyber methods against satellites is less intrusive and less escalatory than kinetic attacks (though these cannot be ruled out) but may also have a lower probability of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war points to the vulnerabilities of the precision-guided munitions (PGM) supply chain and the importance of steady resupply. These are complex munitions, so delays in obtaining even a single part can slow or stop production. The experience of European allies in the 2012 air campaign against Libya, where they depleted their PGM stocks within a few days, is suggestive of the benefits of disrupting the PGM supply chain. The United States (and regional allies) can prepare for this by stockpiling PGMs, but Ukraine shows that consumption rates are higher than expected. A combined cyberattack could disrupt PGM production and resupply. However, it remains an open question as to whether disruption to PGM resupply would provide the near-term benefits most useful to China, since the damage could take weeks to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks on other critical infrastructures are possible but offer less of a benefit to China. Disrupting financial networks may provide secondary benefits if credit cards won’t work and cash is unavailable. Disrupting municipal traffic control systems would provide temporary (and easily remedied) disturbances. Civil air traffic management systems are likely targets since civilian air freight will play a role in the resupply of high-value equipment (like PGMs), but the effects of a cyberattack on air traffic control could be quickly remedied, given U.S. experience in dealing with air traffic disruptions. Attacks on other infrastructures are unlikely to provide any military or strategic benefit. Water supply in key metropolitan areas may be one exception to this, since telecommunications and electricity depend on it. In all instances, deciding on targets, their location, and whether to strike them using cyberattacks will require a careful calculation of immediate military benefit weighed against the strategic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factors-affecting-chinese-decisions-to-use-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;Factors Affecting Chinese Decisions to Use Cyberattacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Ukraine, given U.S. military setbacks in the Middle East and Xi Jinping’s belief that the West was in irreversible decline, the Chinese government likely overestimated the level of action they could engage in without risk. The Western response to Ukraine, including sanctions against Russia and financial and military support for Ukraine, has led China to recalculate the costs of action against Taiwan, but domestic political pressures could still impel Xi to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is currently unlikely that China will use force to occupy Taiwan, if it does decide to do so, it would undoubtedly prefer a short, sharp conflict, sinking a few U.S. carriers while holding off any U.S. response until its forces occupied the country. The PLA has, after all, been practicing some kind of Taiwan invasion scenario for 70 years. Their calculations may be similar to those made by Axis forces before World War II: that a sharp, decisive blow against U.S. naval and air forces in the Pacific region at the onset of conflict would stop the United States from intervening and dissuade it from continuing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors that shape the calculations that apply to critical infrastructure are the comparative risks of striking civilian versus military targets, and the risk of striking targets in the continental United States. If China chose to attack civilian infrastructure in the continental United States, the most effective cyber actions against critical infrastructure would unavoidably affect several large U.S. cities, such as San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Honolulu. Collateral damage is inevitable if electrical power, telecommunications, and fuel pipelines are attacked. These are civilian infrastructures, but they are legitimate targets. The United States has attacked similar targets in the past, showing restraint when it believed it would quickly occupy opponent territory and need these infrastructures for itself. China does not face similar constraints, and the risk of civilian casualties from cyberattack in these cities is extremely low — the intended result is most likely the disruption of critical infrastructure, not physical damage or casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may consider targeting Washington, D.C., in the hope that disruption to power and communications in the nation’s capital would slow any U.S. response; however, the degree of resilience found in national command systems and the risk of a fierce U.S. response to a cyberattack on the capital suggest that Chinese efforts at disruption in D.C. are unlikely. It is also likely that China would prefer to reserve cyber tools for intelligence gathering rather than disruption since it has had a long record of remarkable successes against the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese planners face the complications of having to consider attacks on U.S. military facilities located in allied territory, particularly Japan. If Japan has not entered the conflict, it would be in China’s interest not to attack targets in Okinawa or other areas. If Japan has entered the conflict, China will need to decide if it targets only U.S. military facilities in Japan, attacks Japanese critical infrastructure that supports these facilities, or disrupts some broader range of targets. Moving up this target ranking risks expanding and prolonging any conflict, so China may — if it is reasonable (though participants in a conflict tend to become less reasonable the longer it continues) — minimize cyber actions against Japan. The most likely outcome is that in the context of armed conflict, China will decide it has little to lose by launching cyberattacks against Japan’s military and critical energy and communications infrastructures and will seek to maximize disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One assumption behind this analysis is that economic warfare (e.g., striking targets in order to degrade the opponent economy and industrial capacity as opposed to striking targets that directly support military operations in order to disrupt them) is unlikely. Although some argue that China has engaged for decades in long-term, low-level economic warfare, this assertion is unsupported by any direct evidence and Chinese intentions are best described as espionage to build its economy and technological capabilities. In a short conflict, the military benefits of economic warfare would arrive too late to change the outcome and striking civilian manufacturing targets (such as factories) risks expanding the conflict. Although there could be benefits to disrupting production at oil refineries or semiconductor fabs, this benefit is smaller than in the past given the globally distributed nature of supply chains, which creates a fair degree of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks are most effective when combined with other weapons, including conventional delivery systems, PGMs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and electronic warfare (EW). This combination can cripple command networks and advanced weapons systems and, if done at scale, may overwhelm defenders by exploiting a rapid pace and large scale of action. Against Taiwan, the United States should expect to see a combination of cyber and kinetic attacks. Coordinated kinetic and cyber action against targets in the United States are very unlikely (with the exception of Guam, which is within easy missile range of China). Kinetic actions against targets in the continental United States or Hawaii would create an unmanageable risk of escalation for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-operations&quot;&gt;Influence Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of critical infrastructure may not be the only target of Chinese cyber efforts. China could use its trove of personal information on millions of U.S. officials, civilians, and service members to send intimidating or confusing emails, text messages, and social media posts to them and their families (as the Russians have done in Ukraine). Officials in one Asian country have said that China used its access to telecommunications systems in that country to send politically oriented text messages to all mobile phone users in the country and something similar could be done to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia attempted to blend cyberattack, EW, and psychological operations in its invasion of Ukraine. Russian EW systems (such as the Leer 3) were able to connect to Ukrainian mobile telephone networks, both to disrupt communications and to collect and send messages. These have had limited success in Ukraine given the political circumstances. The Chinese have not shown the skill of the Russians in influence operations, but the population of Taiwan will be a target for text, email, and video messages — perhaps generated by new artificial intelligence tools — intended to create confusion and emphasize the futility of resistance. The United States should also expect Chinese actors with a presence on U.S. social media platforms to plant disinformation aimed at U.S. media and audiences. China will also try to inject disinformation into global media about U.S. losses and (if there is opportunity) collateral damage to civilian targets from U.S. actions. Artificial intelligence provides a way not only to make more convincing digital falsehoods, but also to inject them at speed and at scale against the target population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global audience, some of which is inherently hostile or predisposed to distrust the United States, is a better venue for China’s influence operations than the United States given the broad consensus among the American population and leaders on the need to compete with China and the intense reactions that attacks on U.S. territory have generated in the past. The United States cannot assume that Chinese aggression against Taiwan will be met with universal disapproval. Russian propaganda about Ukraine has been successful in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America despite clear evidence of its aggression. China could similarly engage these audiences. A Chinese campaign could attempt to exploit pacifist sentiment in Asian countries like Japan, but if China is seen as the aggressor, it will likely not gain traction with regional audiences. This suggests that Chinese influence operations will be unsuccessful with U.S. and Northeast Asian audiences but more persuasive in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reconnaissance-is-a-warning-not-necessarily-a-prelude&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance Is a Warning, Not Necessarily a Prelude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are likely targets and this analysis does not consider the effect of cyberattacks, which may be limited even if successful, particularly if ships, satellites, aircraft, and air defenses are well defended. However, given the complexity of digital networks and the unevenness of cybersecurity preparation in the United States, if China decides to attack critical infrastructure, some attacks would be likely to succeed. Efforts to create a “zero threat architecture” are misleading in the context of military action by state actors. There will always be some success for cyberattacks, so the goal should be not to prevent but to minimize these successes and to be resilient in the continued provision of digital services when defense inevitably has failed. A later white paper will discuss defending against cyber actions during armed conflict, but planning must consider how to continue necessary operations and services despite cyber disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting reconnaissance is not always a prelude to attack. Russia has conducted strategic reconnaissance against the United States for decades without acting on it. Reconnaissance is, however, an indication of both increased risk and opponent intentions that should guide U.S. preparations for defense. It should be assumed that some percentage of Chinese cyberattacks against U.S. targets would succeed, making the issue a matter of how to ensure resilience and recovery. Even if Chinese cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure are unlikely, the United States needs to prepare for them, improve cyber defenses for the most probable targets, and test its capacity for response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent article, Admiral James G Stavridis, the former NATO SACEUR, suggested that a NATO-led convoying system in the Black Sea could go some distance towards alleviating the costs of Russia’s de facto blockade of Ukraine following President Vladimir Putin’s withdrawal from the grain deal. While Stavridis makes a number of important points, a convoying system would be an impractical solution to the challenges posed by a blockade, one which would incur significant risks for uncertain gains. Instead, an approach to meeting the challenge of the blockade should be built on two pillars: circumvention in the short term, and a wider effort aimed at coercing Russia back into a settlement in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-convoys&quot;&gt;The Problem with Convoys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several issues with using the Iran–Iraq Tanker War of the 1980s as an analogy for a potential full-scale convoying operation in the Black Sea. The first issue is that to a far greater extent than the Tanker War, the outcome of a contest to move grain through Ukrainian ports will be determined by the attitudes of insurers. US convoying operations during the Tanker War mitigated but did not eliminate the high war risk premiums demanded by insurers, not least because they were restricted to reflagged Kuwaiti vessels. The reason that neither Iraq nor Iran was able to seriously impact the other’s oil exports and the global economy was that the profit margins involved in moving oil justified the transit even in the face of higher insurance rates – something that is not as true for grain. Moreover, Iraq was able to circumvent the Iranian blockade using overland pipelines to Turkey and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia. While convoying was a useful means of both defending the principle of freedom of navigation and forestalling the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase its influence in Kuwait, its economic impact was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the major challenge facing Ukraine is that insurers’ risk perceptions will likely drive a spike in war risk premiums, which could make movement in the Black Sea effectively unprofitable, or even lead to coverage being withdrawn. While convoys could resolve this underlying challenge by reassuring shipowners, they could also have the opposite effect. The sight of NATO and Russian assets operating cheek by jowl could just as easily increase perceptions of war risk. Russia could exacerbate this risk through acts of brinkmanship such as risky aerial manoeuvres, much as it has done recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major issue with convoys is that the Russian threat to shipping in the northern Black Sea is in certain ways dissimilar to the Iranian one. Iran sought to interdict or attack vessels at sea using the assets of its navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), making the presence of nearby friendly combatant vessels a useful deterrent. Russia’s fleet has largely avoided the northern Black Sea since the Moskva incident. The risk posed by Ukrainian coastal defence cruise missiles such as the Harpoon and Neptune has largely eliminated the surface vessels of the Black Sea Fleet as a presence in the northern Black Sea. The primary tools of blockade for Russia are naval mines – which it can seed using a range of capabilities including its Kilo-class submarines – and missile strikes on storage sites on the ground. Convoys can usefully deter things such as the interdiction and boarding of vessels, but are of less value in the face of a mine threat. Indeed, in instances such as the Bridgeton incident during the Tanker War, US assets had to form up in columns behind a double-hulled tanker as a defence against mines. The mine challenge could be a basis for deploying mine countermeasures (MCM) vessels – something discussed in the original article – but as will be articulated more fully later, this is a separate consideration from convoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third consideration, acknowledged by figures such as Stavridis, is the degree to which the Montreux Convention constrains policy options. Considering that the aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea navies at any given time cannot exceed 45,000 tonnes (around the weight of five Ticonderoga-class cruisers) and that vessels must rotate out of the region after 21 days, the ability of non-Black Sea countries to maintain credible forces in the region will be circumscribed irrespective of whether they are willing to commit more vessels. Of course, a Turkish decision either to void certain restrictions or to participate in a convoy system itself could change this dynamic, but this remains unlikely. A convoy system could only work in practice if it was led by those members of NATO that are also Black Sea states, with a somewhat token presence provided by Allies from beyond the region. This implies that smaller members of the Alliance would bear the lion’s share of the cost and risk – something they are unlikely to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a real risk of escalation, as acknowledged. While Russia is unlikely to directly attack a NATO member, there are a number of avenues to inadvertent escalation. For example, if a NATO vessel struck a mine like the USS Samuel B Roberts did during the Tanker War, the Alliance would be faced with an unpalatable choice between escalating or choosing not to attribute the damage (and thus perhaps incentivising intentional efforts to clandestinely attack its vessels). A weaker opponent may act in risk-acceptant ways that draw it into clashes with a stronger rival – as Iran’s IRGC did with the US Navy on several occasions. Brinkmanship by both sides can create room for misunderstandings, as was nearly the case during the Cold War when a Soviet Tu-16 buzzing a US carrier pitched into the sea in an incident which could have been misinterpreted as a shootdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-short-term-approach-circumvention-and-limited-support-to-shipping&quot;&gt;A Short-Term Approach: Circumvention and Limited Support to Shipping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are short-term solutions that adopt elements of the proposals put forward by proponents of a more forward-leaning NATO role, but which do not require the Ukrainians and their partners to run the risks of a full-scale convoying operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foremost among these is circumventing the blockade. Both overland routes and riverine transit via the Danube offer alternatives to the Black Sea. In the past year, Ukraine’s riverine ports such as Izmail have seen a substantial increase in the volume of shipping that they have handled. While not sufficient to completely offset the impact of a blockade, this could substantially mitigate the challenge. Unsurprisingly, these ports have come under sustained air attack by Russia. The challenge of air defence, while complex and resource-intensive, can be resolved by the provision of additional platforms to Ukraine. A more ambitious course could see Ukraine’s partners defend these areas from cruise missiles directly. Given their proximity to the borders of a NATO state, a defensive counter-air mission over these riverine ports need not be framed as an entry into the conflict, but rather as a means of mitigating risk. The fact that such a mission would involve intercepts of missiles and not manned aircraft limits the risk of escalation. To be sure, any such decision would need to be taken alongside efforts to define the geographical limits of NATO support to avoid mission creep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second palliative would be subsidising overland transport. Thus far, the costs of overland transport and the reluctance of European states such as Poland to expose their own farmers to competition from Ukrainian produce – which is more price-competitive in nearby countries than it is after a long and costly transit – have meant that the EU’s grain corridors have had limited utility for Ukraine. Subsidising the transit of Ukrainian goods to ensure that they do not stay in EU countries could be a ready fix to this conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the only long-term guarantee of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea is a settlement with Russia; anything short of this will not solve the problem of war risk premiums&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a basis for a more limited approach to directly challenging the blockade. Clearing mines through channels in the western Black Sea could allow some vessels to depart from Odessa, especially if the effort was combined with a bolstering of Ukraine’s ground-based air defences. There is an obvious utility to vessels such as MCM ships, but the value of a wider convoying effort is less clear. Because of the Black Sea Fleet’s restricted freedom of action in the face of the Ukrainian coastal defence cruise missile threat, the risk to vessels at sea will come primarily from mines, and they are likely to be most at risk when they are stationary targets in port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, MCM vessels operating on their own would be vulnerable to Russian attack (though Russia’s difficulty in sinking the Ukrainian tank landing ship Yuri Olefirenko at sea demonstrates real challenges with dynamic targeting). It should be noted, however, that even a convoy in the Black Sea would theoretically be at risk of being sunk if Russia wished to invest the resources into doing so. The deterrent to this would be the wider implications of a direct attack on a Western vessel, not the vessel’s own defences. While it might be regarded as counterintuitive to deploy vessels in such a manner, it is worth noting that this is precisely what Western European deployments such as the Armilla patrol did during the Tanker War by utilising naval vessels that were unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their limited tonnage and lack of offensive armaments, MCM could be rotated into the region in larger numbers and with less escalatory risk. The task of navies, then, would be to brief insurers on the fact that the absence of convoys does not mean that channels are unsafe, given the low likelihood of direct Russian interdiction by surface platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to air defences, NATO members such as Greece and Bulgaria which currently operate S-300 batteries could be encouraged to play a role here. Similarly, the US Army’s Iron Dome batteries, which may have some utility against threats such as UAVs, could be donated if – as argued by some – they are deemed unfit for the environments in which the US expects its ground forces to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with this, a multilateral effort to provide state-backed insurance could be utilised to further mitigate the financial risk undertaken by vessels’ owners. This is something Iran did to good effect during the Tanker War when it underwrote 15% of the cost of insurance. This contributed to Iran’s oil exports rebounding to pre-war levels by the late 1980s, despite the Iraqi air threat to terminals like Kharg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each approach is likely to be extremely expensive and involve diplomatic and financial costs. Countries are loathe to part with capabilities such as air defences, and subsidising transport is likely to be exceedingly expensive. However, the ability of a new Iranian regime to achieve the latter goal in the 1980s demonstrates that it is not impossible, while the former is less diplomatically challenging than organising a multilateral convoying effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-term-coercing-russia-into-a-settlement&quot;&gt;The Long Term: Coercing Russia into a Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the palliatives described above can only work in the short term, however, given the costs involved. Ultimately, the only long-term guarantee of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea is a settlement with Russia; anything short of this will not solve the problem of war risk premiums. The question for Ukraine and its backers, then, is how Russia can be coerced into entering a settlement and respecting it. The importance of the ability to counter an opponent’s blockade with one’s own punitive measures, thus denying them the perception that time is on their side if they only wait, is an enduring lesson of naval combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if Ukraine’s ongoing offensive proves immensely successful, Crimea might cease to be a springboard for Russian coercion, and the country’s Azov ports might open. That said, it is worth planning for a more conservative outcome in which both sides remain deadlocked and Russia seeks to grind Ukraine down through a long-term campaign against the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Ukraine’s ability to compel Russia to re-enter some form of agreement on shipping (even if hostilities continue) will be predicated on its capacity to counter-escalate. There are several avenues by which this might be done. Firstly, Ukrainian forces can contest Russia’s own commercial vessels’ freedom of navigation at or near ports. The uncrewed assets used near Sevastopol could serve as a useful tool to harass shipping, and though Russia would likely deploy countermeasures, this could still drive up insurance rates. Presumably such vessels could also be used as minelayers – though their carrying capacity might be somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the immediate term, it will likely prove more viable to mitigate the effects of the blockade by circumventing it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a more concerted effort could be made to identify and interdict the grey shipping upon which Russia’s own economy depends. Though it is politically and legally challenging to seize vessels on the high seas, states with territorial waters that straddle transit chokepoints can deny these vessels access if they are not suitably insured against environmental risks. NATO countries that currently straddle such chokepoints include the UK and France (in the case of the English Channel and Gibraltar) and Turkey (at the Bosporus). Of course, it is unlikely that a unanimous approach to interdicting such vessels will be achieved, but heightened pressure in this area could still increase the costs for Moscow and contribute to enabling subsequent negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most crucially, however, Ukraine must be able to limit the Black Sea Fleet’s ability to operate out of Sevastopol. The threat of Ukraine accomplishing this could be sufficient to compel Russia to re-enter a settlement. We might consider, for example, how the Houthi movement’s ability to impose costs on its opponents and effectively shut down key ports and cities such as Marib with ballistic missiles played an important role in driving the anti-Houthi coalition towards a settlement in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the current lines stay broadly stable, the Ukrainians would need either cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of over 300 km to achieve this. While it is presently unlikely that the US-made ATACMS will be provided to Ukraine, other options exist. For example, a concerted effort could be made to expand production lines for Storm Shadow – a weapon already in Ukraine, but one that the country must use sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to use the soil of friendly states to commence the production of indigenous designs such as the Grom-2 ballistic missile in sanctuaries safe from destruction by Russian airpower. More immediate means of contesting Russian commercial ports could include low-cost UAVs, which appear to have been used in Russia itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another capability which could conceivably abet a counter-blockade but which would presently be difficult to manufacture in Ukraine is submersibles capable of carrying torpedoes – something currently being prototyped by, among others, a UAE-based Ukrainian firm. Production lines for such capabilities could be set up on the territory of NATO members which currently sit within the Black Sea, enabling their transfer without the need to violate article 19 of Montreux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are legitimate concerns regarding the escalatory risks involved in giving Ukraine the capacity to act against Russian interests at reach. That being said, generating the capacity to – for example – manufacture missiles for Ukraine will be time-consuming, and could thus give both parties the diplomatic space to re-enter a settlement. Even a latent threat to reinforce Ukraine’s offensive capacity could be useful, irrespective of whether it is acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are no ideal solutions to the challenge posed by Russia’s blockade. Though appealing, the obvious immediate palliative of a convoy system is likely to be unworkable in practice. Though many issues impede such a solution, as discussed, its primary flaw is the fact that it does not obviate the most significant challenge facing Ukrainian exports – the fact that high war risk premiums will likely remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate term, it will likely prove more viable to mitigate the effects of the blockade by circumventing it. Though costly, circumvention via routes such as the Danube offers the most immediately viable method of limiting – if not quite eliminating – the impact of the blockade. Alongside this, allied navies can make genuine immediate contributions in areas such as mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium to long term, the most viable route to a resumption of Black Sea shipping from Ukrainian ports is a campaign to progressively increase the pressure on Russia’s own maritime posture in the region, as well as to impose costs in other areas, with a view to eventually reaching a durable settlement which at a minimum separates the issue of freedom of navigation from the wider conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成：「五大訴求，缺一不可」精神是鍥而不捨爭取、非求一步登天&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9PSRQLV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第103天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示受邀出席抗爭派記者會，理解「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而會上除讀出的立場聲明外並無共同發言。就岑敖暉會上指若「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，相信不論內容也會否決預算案，鄒認為岑並非主張無差別否決，因岑曾向他提過「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，鄒亦認為只要政府於預算案有回應五大訴求已足夠。法官陳慶偉指，但「五大訴求」口號是「缺一不可」而非「一個即可」，鄒回應「五大訴求，缺一不可」的精神不是要求「一步登天」，而是即使政府回應一個或兩個訴求後，仍鍥而不捨繼續爭取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成主問，續接受控方盤問，表示雖認為35+不可能，但無於初選論壇表明，是因論壇始終由一班「相信35+有可能」的人舉辦，故想「禮貌少少」，「費事搞禍人哋個場」。而就《國安法》後帖文稱「有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講」、但相信過去理念已表達清楚，鄒同意當時仍擁抱過去表達過的理念，無論《國安法》有否落實，其理念也一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&quot;&gt;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會、標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第5日作供，辯方就2020年7月15日抗爭派記者會發問。鄒同意，本土抗爭派於初選有很好的成績，召開記招是為了多謝選民，並向泛民主派「伸出橄欖枝」。法官陳仲衡問記招由誰發起，鄒認為「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而他是前一日受邀出席，印象中是張崑陽、岑敖暉、黃之鋒其中一個，「但我真係唔肯定係邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/asM8jKk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指邀請他的人有提及出席人士的標準，他理解是「非傳統泛民嘅初選勝出者」，而該人無特別講為何想開記招，鄒亦覺得，選舉完結後開記招向民眾宣布一些訊息「係好正常嘅事」。法官陳慶偉提及陳志全無被邀請（陳早前稱獲朱凱廸邀請但拒絕），因他不是傳統泛民，鄒指他不知道陳有否被邀請，但「我自己唔會將佢咁樣分類」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言會上發言僅代表發言者自己&quot;&gt;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言、會上發言僅代表發言者自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，於同月14日約好時間、地點，並於翌日早上約10時到達記招場地學聯會址，指有關記招事宜「全部都係嗰日朝早先至一齊傾」，他們首先討論當日發布、後於會上讀出的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」。陳仲衡問誰帶領討論？鄒說「其實冇㗎，大家有意見就講出嚟」，而他們當時使用「Google Doc」，「有幾個人一齊打（字）緊」，認為每個出席者均看過該篇聲明，「大家都同意咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑問，那除了該聲明，記者會上還有否任何共同發言（joint announcement or statement）？鄒指「除咗呢個聲明冇喇」。鄒並指，記招前有討論如何處理記者提問，「除咗指名道姓之外，其他問題呢就大家想答就自己答⋯⋯如果自己想補充，就自己攞支咪去講。」陳世傑問，會上回應是代表在場所有人抑或發言者自己？鄒說：「佢自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意王百羽梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&quot;&gt;鄒同意王百羽、梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就其他人發言回應，法官陳仲衡問到王百羽提及：「我哋嗰個最大公因數就一定係講緊堅決反對財政預算案，如果五大訴求無落實嘅話，依個係我哋共同嘅諗法」，是代表所有人發言？鄒說：「其他人我唔知，我自己個立場一直都係話，如果財政預算案我見唔到關於五大訴求嘅內容，我個人都係會投反對票」，指他同意王的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3A1obQr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁晃維強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利…我哋亦都繼續提倡議會攬炒嘅路線，係逼使政府係向人民低頭」，鄒表示「我同意呀」，其後在盤問下稱與梁從無就「攬炒」有任何討論，故不完全知道梁當時意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決指岑曾反問唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴也反對&quot;&gt;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決、指岑曾反問「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴」也反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而被問會否否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，岑敖暉回答如能進入議會，「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係：是嘅。」鄒指不同意岑這句話，認為他「答得唔係好清楚」，不過指岑其後被追問「即係無論嗰個財政預算案嘅內容係咩嘢都會否決？」時，有提到「唔係㗎」，並重新再答：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間；但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話，我相信我哋係無論咩嘢內容都係會否決呢一個財政預算案嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JQsSrgy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，認為岑不是談及「無差別」否決財案，而他同意岑此說法。惟陳慶偉指岑雖無用「無差別」一詞，但提及「無論咩嘢內容都係會否決」，實際上傳達了該訊息。鄒不同意，認為岑當時提到「暴政當道、魔警橫行」是指政府不回應五大訴求的表現，如政府有回應五大訴求，這些情況應不會出現，而如果繼續出現，則代表政府無回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠非一定全落實才不反對&quot;&gt;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠、非一定全落實才不反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，岑敖暉是指否決預算案的決定性因素（determining factor），是五大訴求有否「落實」？鄒同意，但補充就他而言「我覺得係『回應』已經夠」，「唔一定要五個（訴求）齊晒之後先⋯⋯」李運騰打斷，質疑岑要求五大訴求「落實」、但鄒只是要求「回應」，二人立場是否不同？鄒指「可能因為我識佢」，故認為岑用「落實」一字「唔係話一定要晒五大訴求先會再同政府傾」，並在李追問下稱不同意岑說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑指，鄒早前稱同意，現在又說不同意。鄒重申，理解岑敖暉該句表達如政府無回應五大訴求，即「暴政當道、魔警橫行」繼續持續的情況下，「budget 入面都唔會見到關於五大訴求嘅內容，咁就投反對票喇」。而他記招前無與岑就預算案有任何討論，但記招後岑曾向他提及：「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，令他知道岑並非主張無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&quot;&gt;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天、為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉即指，「五大訴求」的口號並非只有「五大訴求」，是「五大訴求，缺一不可」，而非「五大訴求，一個即可（only one met）」。鄒回應：「我覺得『五大訴求，缺一不可』背後嘅精神，並唔係要求一步登天，而係一個即使政府回應咗一個或者兩個（訴求）之後，一種鍥而不捨繼續爭取嘅精神。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，最後政府永遠也不能滿足他們的要求（appetite），指「你看，政府已經落實了其中一個訴求，即撤回《逃犯條例》」，鄒說「同意做咗」，陳說而撤回修例後又發生了這一連串事件。不過陳指理解鄒的回應，相信岑敖暉當時不是指落實所有訴求，而是如政府將回應部分訴求、部分訴求有機會落實，就不會否決，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者-官打斷稱毋須深究&quot;&gt;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者 官打斷稱毋須深究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑敖暉其後再提到立法會議員「絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，鄒表示同意，並理解岑只是強調「立法會議員係可以投反對票」、是《基本法》賦予立法會議員的權利，「佢並沒有話佢將來要每一樣嘢都投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦問及鄒家成會上提到「我哋係時候要向世界，向香港人展示，我哋同呢個極權搏鬥嘅決心」，「極權」的意思。鄒指「我覺得極權係一個狀態嚟嘅，一種不受制約嘅有權勢者欺壓無權勢者嘅狀態，形成呢個狀態有兩個條件⋯⋯」，不過陳慶偉打斷說對政治看法無興趣。陳世傑追問「極權」與香港有何關係，惟陳慶偉再打斷說不認為需深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支-會向政府提問談判&quot;&gt;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支 會向政府提問談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問，同意2020年時已知道，議員可向各部門就預算案開支提問，而他曾提及以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案，是將五大訴求與預算案連繫，並同意至少就成立獨立調查委員會、及重啟政改達至雙普選兩個訴求，均「需要用錢」，他打算當選後於討論預算案時就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉庭上早前提及「鉛水事件」獨立調查委員會，指無出現在預算案。沈士文續展示2016至17年度立法會財委會時任議員單仲偕就預算案的查詢，以及行政署長的回覆。主控萬德豪質疑，鄒當時並不在立法會會議，為何要就文件發問，沈士文指想問鄒當時是否打算入議會後利用此機制問這類問題。陳慶偉指太空泛，並認為毋須深入這些細節，指他提到鉛水事件獨立調查委員會，只因該調查突然出現，而他意思是如果調查委員會突然出現，預算案不會為該項目有所準備，但明白如預算案有項目是查警暴，鄒家成當然會表示小心審視預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文回應，展示該文件是指出鉛水事件獨立調查委員會的開支，於翌年預算案反映，陳慶偉指那與現時要裁決的議題無關，指鄒已表明會審視財案有否五大訴求的內容。鄒續同意，2020年時政府無回應成立獨立調查委員會等訴求，而他一旦當選，會優先向政府施壓要求成立調查委員會和落實雙普選，如政府回應會預期在2021年預算案反映，如看不到相關開支便會向政府提問，「到底對於呢兩個訴求，佢哋會點樣處理」，亦可謂在財委會與政府的「談判」階段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指不認識柯耀林不知李永成是沙田區政成員&quot;&gt;鄒指不認識柯耀林、不知李永成是沙田區政成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表區政聯盟前召集人柯耀林的大律師唐樂山其後盤問，鄒同意，首次新東會議上人們「出出入入」，他不認識柯耀林，不知道他有否出席會議。而鄒第二次會議有與兩名民主黨代表就「會運用」否決權字眼爭論，辯方問鄒是否認得李永成是其中一個反對其動議的人？鄒指「如果坐喺我對面嗰個人係李永成，咁佢係有反對嘅」，又指「其中一個（反對）一定係林卓廷嘅代表」，但不知另一人身分。鄒又指，不知道李永成自2018年已不再屬民主黨，亦不知他是「區政聯盟」下「沙田區政」的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意國安法後仍擁抱過去理念&quot;&gt;鄒同意《國安法》後仍擁抱過去理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受主控萬德豪盤問，就鄒家成7月5日帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「国安法過咗，或者有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講，以前準備嘅好多文宣、易拉架都已經用唔著，但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，萬德豪指鄒沒有表明放棄過去理念，鄒說：「的確冇呢個意思。」萬問，因此當時鄒仍擁抱過去表達過的理念？鄒答「係」。萬指而不論《國安法》有否落實，鄒的理念也一樣？鄒再答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方追問有否提過dq-官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&quot;&gt;控方追問有否提過DQ 官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成又同意，於參選宣言提到「我唔奢望喺殖民者嘅制度下可以議會過半奪取政治權力」，是表達35+不可能，因政府會以DQ阻民主派取35+，又指就個人會否被DQ，「我唔會評估為低（風險）嘅」。鄒續指，無在協調會議向人表示他會被DQ、也不記得有無人這樣提及，而他認為DQ議題貫徹整個初選，「一定有」參選人提過，但講不到是在何時何地由誰提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪欲追問，陳慶偉打斷指看不到為何要就此盤問，指替補機制一直是協調會議的議題，因此肯定有提到DQ，並着控方直接問問題。萬追問，有參選人提及會有DQ風險？惟陳慶偉打斷指「當然，不然呢？」。萬遂問，而沒有人說過他一定會被DQ？鄒答：「黃之鋒一定有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2rnCED4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35不可能因費事搞禍人哋個場&quot;&gt;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35+不可能因費事「搞禍」人哋個場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂同意，於初選論壇提過35+的可能性「非常之低」，但「的確冇用呢個『不可能』嘅字眼」。萬質疑若鄒一直認為35+不可能，為何不直接在論壇說出，鄒說「因為我諗住有禮貌少少，即係個論壇始終都係由一班相信35+有可能嘅人搞嘅，費事去人個場，好似搞禍人哋個場咁，所以就講非常之低」，並指「如果睇返成個初選論壇嘅 transcript，應該唔會覺得我覺得35+有可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱與團隊較專注香港民族論述無看過戴耀廷文章&quot;&gt;鄒稱與團隊較專注「香港民族」論述、無看過戴耀廷文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於有否看過戴耀廷文章，鄒盤問下指當時較少留意時事，因準備選舉時與團隊較專注「香港民族」的論述、花較多時間製作單張。而他知道戴是知名政治人物，但案發時不知道他在《蘋果日報》和Facebook專頁撰文，沒有「like」戴Facebook，亦從沒讀過戴3至4月發表的文章，沒聽過戴談及有關「攬炒」的意思。控方追問沒有人告訴鄒？鄒說「真係冇」，指與團隊成員「傾香港民族比較多」，他與協調會議參與者亦「冇乜交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成早前承認與張可森和梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」聲明，今指4月時知道二人有興趣參與立法會選舉，遂「friend 搭 friend 咁樣見吓面、傾吓偈」，但初時無特別留意他們有否參加協調會議、無就此討論，只是「傾吓閒偈」，但在討論「墨落」的「嗰一刻」，「我肯定佢哋有出席過協調會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mmqthIs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章提運用否決權&quot;&gt;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章、提運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東協調會議情況，萬德豪引述趙家賢證供，問首次會議是否有一名本土抗爭派向戴耀廷表示，曾讀過他在《蘋果日報》的文章並支持其主張。鄒指首先他不認同當時已有「本土抗爭派」的概念，其次他無留意當時有與會者提及戴耀廷的文章。惟萬續追問該人發言取態、戴之後是否再介紹「攬炒」文章，鄒重申無聽到亦無印象有介紹，戴亦無提及會運用基本法權力否決預算案、以此作為籌碼與中共談判，亦無印象戴提及當選後任期或只有7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱一直理解否決veto為投反對票vote-against&quot;&gt;鄒稱一直理解「否決（veto）」為「投反對票（vote against）」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒稱於第二次會議動議「會運用」否決權，萬指鄒在協調會和在「墨落無悔」都用了「否決（veto）」，鄒同意中文是用「否決」。萬指，但「否決」只能在立會過半後達到？鄒說「否決呢個中文字對我嚟講，一直都係 vote against（投反對票）呢個意思，唔係得我一個咁諗嘅，前立法會議員都一直係咁樣形容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬遂問，鄒曾否告訴公眾，「否決」不是指取得過半後否決議案？惟法官陳仲衡打斷，指如鄒家成一直認為兩字意思一樣，如何向公眾解釋，萬終指留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對墨落已向選民交代對財案立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對、「墨落」已向選民交代對財案立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就抗爭派記者會岑敖暉的發言，法官陳慶偉問及若今天仍「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，鄒家成會否不論內容仍否決預算案。鄒指最重要的核心是政府有否在預算案回應人民訴求，「如果有，我相信都唔會暴政當道、魔警橫行」。陳慶偉指那不是其問題，並重複問題，鄒指「咁要首先處理咩係暴政，咩係魔警」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指其問題非常直接，認為鄒不想答他問題，鄒說「唔係」。陳問那是否要就他問的每隻字下定義？鄒說「如果有疑問我會照問」。陳說所以鄒不明白他的問題，鄒說「問多一次，唔好意思」，陳指他已問了兩次，鄒續說「答案係不會」。陳說因此鄒完全明白他的問題，鄒稱「我想嘗試吓進一步……」，但遭法官陳仲衡打斷，再問如到了辯論預算案時，政府和警察仍與舉行抗爭派記者會時的一樣，鄒會否否決，鄒重申：「審視完財政預算案之後，如果入面都係冇同五大訴求相關嘅內容，我都係會投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後問，鄒有否告訴選民他不同意岑敖暉的說話，鄒說沒有，並指「『墨落無悔』已經係其中一個地方話畀選民知道，我會點樣處理財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後就6月17日鄒家成與張可森和梁晃維受訪片段發問，並指片中顯示訪問問題，但無寫在謄本，望即場播片截圖。法官陳慶偉後下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱倡「香港民族」並非港獨 指一國兩制下港人理應享自主權&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第102天。鄒家成繼續作供，就初選論壇提到「對抗中華民族嘅入侵」，鄒指民族是建基於文化、價值等形成的共同體，「中華民族」與「香港民族」有別，是合理化損害港人利益和干預港人自主權的宣傳工具，他宣揚「香港民族主義」旨在高舉族群利益。法官質疑鄒稱無推動港獨，但又提自主是有矛盾，鄒不同意，指港人在《中英聯合聲明》下除國防、外交，理應享有一系列自主權，惟在無落實雙普選下，一國兩制無真正落實過。鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨不同，法官李運騰今指鄒是否實際上推動港獨或屬爭議點之一，法官陳慶偉亦指明白兩者分別，但不代表不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念是意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另就論壇提到議員應入議會「打交」，鄒指意指「自衛」，從無想過開會期間「主動冚佢（建制派）一巴」，「呢個太痴線喇」；至於用任何手段癱瘓每個會議，他只是望盡力阻止「惡法」通過，承認「誇張咗」。鄒又同意帖文故意以簡體字陳述「国安法」是表達反對，但無想過違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法後調整選舉文宣-刪香港民族殖民字眼&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》後調整選舉文宣 刪「香港民族」、「殖民」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第4日作供，鄒昨提及《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，但哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去。」鄒今甫開庭向代表大律師陳世傑表示：「唔好意思陳大狀，我琴日表現有啲失禮」，陳笑着叫他向法庭道歉，法官陳仲衡笑說記不起鄒有什麼失禮，陳慶偉亦笑說要喚醒記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引鄒2020年7月5日發布的帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張，唔單止我，我嘅團隊成員，幫手派 leaflet 嘅義工，同埋幫我貼海報嘅黃店都一定會出事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指當時擔憂過往發表的言論會否有機會違反《國安法》，亦憂如果繼續參選，「被捕嘅未必只係我自己，而係我嘅團隊成員、我嘅義工等等，都可能受到牽連」，故當時除了調整選舉文宣、嘗試避免違反《國安法》，亦安排團隊成員聯絡義工表示：「如果你感到恐懼嘅話你就退出，我哋唔會介意嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱過去宣揚過係一個事實-但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&quot;&gt;鄒稱「過去宣揚過係一個事實」 但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，鄒提到「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張」，是提出假設、抑或實際放棄某些主張？鄒指是後者，並重申如他繼續派原有文宣「全部都有機會被捕」。李追問那除了口號，實質內容（substance）有否改變？鄒指有，指整套選舉文宣口號有更改，所有旗幟、易拉架、傳單亦全部重新印過，主要減少用一些對體制批評較尖銳的字眼，亦無再談及「香港民族」或「殖民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，但帖文最後提及「但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，指鄒不是說會改變政綱，而是過去已表達清楚。鄒同意，表示「即係過咗去嘅嘢我都捉唔返㗎啦，過去宣揚過係一個事實，我改咗啲文宣係一個事實」，而「喺一個咁肅殺嘅環境底下，其實香港人會知道點解參選人會做呢啲調整」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字国安法-指表達反對但冇諗過違反國安法&quot;&gt;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字「国安法」 指表達反對「但冇諗過違反《國安法》」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，理解鄒指推動「香港民族」不代表推動「香港獨立」，若這一直是其理念，為何帖文不解釋清楚他不是推動香港獨立。鄒解釋，因認為「香港民族主義」會被理解為分裂國家或港獨言論是來自部分人的「誤解」，而他於選舉如此提出主要是想「高舉族群利益」；而他與團隊當時思考繼續參選的意義，「我哋覺得係堅持埋最後呢十日左右嘅選舉嘅日子已經足夠喇，所以喺啲政治理念上面我哋唔想再解釋太多、講太多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到帖文全部用繁體字，只有在提及「国安法」時才用簡體字，問是否故意（deliberate），鄒答「係」，解釋因《國安法》經「附件三」立法，並非經立法會立法。惟李運騰質疑《基本法》也沒有經立法會立法，鄒停頓了一下續回應：「我唔鍾意用返繁體字去講《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在法官陳仲衡追問下，同意提及「国安法」可理解為抗議的標誌（sign），並指「我的確反對《國安法》」，當時其中一個繼續參選的意義亦是「表達一種反對《國安法》嘅聲音，但冇諗過違反《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱中華民族是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具香港民族與中華民族不同&quot;&gt;鄒稱「中華民族」是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具、香港民族與中華民族不同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就6月28日的新東初選論壇發問，就鄒提及「我諗我今次參選嘅目的非常之旗幟鮮明，我就係要宣揚香港民族主義，因為要建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」，陳仲衡問「中華民族嘅入侵」是否指中國共產黨，鄒否認，指「中華民族對我嚟講，係一個用嚟合理化損害港人利益、干預港人自主權嘅宣傳工具」，又指「我認為喺殖民統治之下，背後操控嘅人，正正就係擁抱中華民族思想嘅人，而呢種殖民嘅統治方式係會弱化一個民族嘅根基，所以我就喺選舉入面宣揚香港民族嘅理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指他概念上有困難，問鄒是否認為「香港民族」作為一個族群（ethnic group），與「中華民族」是不同，鄒說：「我認為係嘅，因為一個民族係建基於語言、文化、價值、歷史、命運而形成嘅共同體，香港人喺歷史上面對於價值嘅追求……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指不認為需要深究（“I don’t think we have to go into all these.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱港人理應享自主權-除非落實雙普選-否則一國兩制無真正落實&quot;&gt;鄒稱港人理應享自主權 除非落實雙普選 否則一國兩制無真正落實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，鄒一方面說並非推動港獨，但一方面又提到「自主權」，是否有矛盾（inconsistency）？鄒不同意，表示認為在《中英聯合聲明》和一國兩制下，「除咗國防同外交之外，香港人理應係享有一系列嘅自主權」，法庭傳譯一度未能譯出《中英聯合聲明》，被告欄的林卓廷即說：「Sino British Joint Declaration 呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，認為中國與香港之間的關係，基礎是建基於《中英聯合聲明》，而一國兩制是源於兩地族群的利益和所擁抱的價值均不同，因此認為「除非落實雙普選，否則一國兩制都冇真正落實過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別-但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&quot;&gt;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別 但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指鄒可能是對、可能是錯，法庭毋須判斷，但鄒同意《中英聯合聲明》只是由英國和中國政府決定，而非香港人決定嗎？鄒說「呢個亦都係好多香港人耿耿於懷嘅地方」，李運騰即打斷指可以問下一議題，並指被告到底是否實際上推動香港獨立，或是一個當前爭議的問題（live issue），問辯方是否需澄清。陳世傑續問鄒，香港獨立和自主權概念的分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳慶偉打斷指認為已聽夠了，指辯方只是問同一問題，鄒家成亦只會重複答案，並指鄒已表示他不是提倡香港獨立、或香港應成為獨立的主權國（sovereign），只是認為一國兩制無按《中英聯合聲明》完全落實、香港無被給予完整的自主權；不過陳慶偉亦指，李運騰說法或許也有道理，因本案是控告被告意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續補充，一如既往，無論控方或辯方證人的說法也不一定能當成真實（taken as face value）。而鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨「唔一樣」，陳慶偉指他們明白「香港獨立」和「香港民族」的分別，但與此同時，這不代表他們不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念，是意圖顛覆國家政權（“We are not saying that we would not take into the evidence that in order to build up the Hong Kong Ethnic idea, that he was intending to subvert the state power.”），指這是兩回事。陳世傑最後再問，鄒有否意圖提倡香港獨立，惟陳慶偉指鄒已答過他從無此意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱擁護基本法同時指屬殖民工具-鄒如忽略現實考慮-信仰只淪為自我麻醉&quot;&gt;稱擁護《基本法》同時指屬「殖民工具」 鄒：如忽略現實考慮 信仰只淪為「自我麻醉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒昨供稱擁護《基本法》，惟法官李運騰指，鄒論壇亦提及「一國兩制、基本法、立法會通通都係精心設計嘅殖民工具」，與其說法如何一致。鄒說「呢個有啲複雜嘅，等我用好簡單嘅方式講解吓」，續指擁護或效忠是從「信仰」的角度去看，「信仰能否強化，必須結合現實嘅考慮，如果忽略現實嘅考慮，你嘅信仰只會淪為一種自我麻醉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，人大釋法和不落實雙普選，是令一國兩制、基本法和立法會被視為殖民工具的「條件」，他反對這些條件，並認為要落實雙普選，一國兩制、基本法和立法會「先至能夠產生佢哋本身應該產生嘅功能」，又指「當我哋見到佢落實得唔完美嘅地方，再受到我哋信仰嘅驅使，我哋先會調整我哋當下嘅決定，令到自己嘅信仰得以實踐」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問是否支持想像中基本法-鄒支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&quot;&gt;官問是否支持想像中《基本法》 鄒：支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即鄒支持一個不存在的、或只存在於其想像中的《基本法》（exists only in your imagination）？鄒回應：「我係支持佢本身應該要產生嘅功能。」陳慶偉說，或許不是想像，而是鄒的解讀（interpretation），並舉例不同人對聖經也有不同解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，鄒論壇提及立法會仍是港人「覺得要維護嘅一個制度」，李運騰問，即鄒對立法會功能和工作有自己看法，並認為當時立法會無行使其正當功能？鄒表示，議會理應產生的功能是「普世」的，就是「制衡行政機關」，但他之所以說是殖民工具，「係因為佢嘅制度並不民主，行政機關亦都會用一啲唔公義嘅手段去阻止人參選」，並依賴立法會「去落實好多損害香港人利益同意願嘅政策、法案、議案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權-鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&quot;&gt;論壇稱「不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權」 鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提到想以議會制衡，但論壇亦提及「更加重要就係唔可以再畀泛民主派繼續主導呢個香港嘅話語權」。鄒解釋，話語權是透過立法會原本的「反抗格局」而形成，如立法會只有泛民主派一把聲音，「市民大眾就會接收到啲乜嘢嘅聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，當時是針對議會內議政內容的數量及質素，指如只是審視一些「鎂光燈」下的議案和法案，再加上提出的私人草案或修正案不足，「話語內容就會變得單調乏味」，故他一直望選出最多抗爭意志的代議士，就是「希望透過改變原本立法會入面嘅反抗格局，從而產生一股更加強大制衡行政機關嘅力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即鄒認為傳統泛民主派做得不好，想有人取代他們？鄒答「有好有唔好」，並指「我認為當時時代嘅改變，市民大眾要求立法會議員做得更多……」李打斷指，簡言之當時泛民並非代表主流聲音，鄒不同意，指正因覺得他們「代表緊好多市民嘅聲音」，才說他們主導香港的話語權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，但若大部分人支持傳統泛民，有什麼問題？鄒指：「2020年就出現緊呢個巨變」，簡單而言「係世代更替，經歷緊、演變緊、進化緊」。陳仲衡問，而鄒認為應由像他的人取代傳統泛民？鄒說：「我當然唔能夠取代，但我希望我係其中一把可以改變嘅聲音」，認為泛民「可以做得更好」，採取更主動的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱2020年dq性質由阻港獨聲音改為阻民主派取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱2020年DQ性質由阻港獨聲音、改為阻民主派取35+&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒論壇提到：「我諗DQ喺2016年嚟講，嗰條實嘅紅線就係香港獨立吖嘛，而家政權就係阻止緊香港獨立嘅聲音去進入呢個議會。但係到今日2020年，呢一個DQ，已經唔再係阻止異見嘅聲音，佢係阻止緊香港人奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，「奪權」是指「奪取議會控制權」，而據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線是主張「香港獨立」的參選人，但2020年DQ性質已改為「要阻止民主派攞35+」、所有參選人都可能會被DQ，「因為有DQ嘅存在，我哋唔會攞到35+㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱入議會打交-鄒指意指自衛&quot;&gt;論壇稱入議會「打交」 鄒指意指「自衛」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了組織者籌辦的初選論壇，鄒家成稱於7月初亦出席了由將軍澳居民舉辦的新東初選民間論壇。鄒的 Facebook 於7月7日發布該論壇片段節錄，提及鄒被問到「有冇做開運動？入到議會會唔會打交？入到去最想揪低邊個？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並於論壇回答：「如果你話喺入面揀一個對手去揪低佢呢，咁我諗，所有嘅親中派，每一個都應該我要砌低佢嘅」，又指「入去會唔會打交，呢一個唔單止係我鄒家成要做嘅事，係每一個今日參選嘅代議士都應該要做嘅事」，而就算有無《國安法》和以言入罪，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，「打交」是網民提問的用字，他的意思是「自衛」，當時腦海浮現陳志全被工聯會（郭偉強）使用暴力的畫面。李運騰指提問者顯然不是指「自衛」，鄒是迴避問題、不想得罪提問者？鄒指當時論壇講求「快問快答」，「真係冇咁多考慮」，而「打交」亦非他入議會的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，帖文並非由他發布、是由團隊成員幫手，因該論壇「應該唔係咁多人睇」，他們想幫他「宣揚得遠少少」，印象中團隊發文前沒告知他，他翌日才知道。鄒又指，7月前所有 Facebook 帖文均由他或團隊另外一兩人幫手執筆，他全部知道亦同意，但7月起競選活動越來越多，故他很少處理 Facebook，當時亦無認為應移除帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱砌低每個親中派-鄒指望多方面取勝&quot;&gt;論壇稱「砌低」每個親中派 鄒指望多方面取勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒稱要「砌低」每一個親中派，鄒解釋在議會辯論上、甚至長遠而言，「我希望佢哋喺場選舉會輸，即係多方面都希望可以贏佢哋。」被問是否指肢體暴力，鄒說：「如果受到襲擊，咁當然都包括埋啦，但我真係從來冇諗過要開開吓會，去主動冚佢（建制派）一巴咁……呢個太痴線喇」，有被告和旁聽人士輕輕發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提癱瘓每一個會議-鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過認誇張咗&quot;&gt;論壇提「癱瘓每一個會議」 鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過、認「誇張咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指是口誤，應是「每一個會議」，並笑言「『癱瘓』呢度個意思係阻止個會議進行啫，呢度的確係誇張咗」，又指要「癱瘓」會議是「因為惡法嚟緊」，但不是指《國安法》，而是議會內政府想推動的「惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但鄒是提到「每一個會議」，意思是政府提出的所有議案也是惡法（evil）？鄒指整句意思是對其他參選人表達一個「期望」，即就算有《國安法》，入到立法會也要盡力阻止惡法通過，又望他們有心理準備、做心理建設，每個會議也有機會面對這種情況。鄒並重申提及「任何手段」和「癱瘓」，「係真係誇張咗」，「只係想表達大家要盡力去做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳慶偉指，鄒家成此前稱立法會是應除去的殖民工具，認為鄒並沒有誇張，實是與其證供符合。鄒回應，「除去殖民工具」是指「反對立法會被視為殖民工具的條件」，主要指不民主的制度和不公義的政治操作；至於阻止惡法「係喺呢一個體制之下會做嘅事情」，兩者有分別。陳仲衡亦指，鄒回答時無提及「惡法」，鄒同意，但指當時面對「入去會唔會打交」的問題時，已預設了是因推動惡法而出現「打交」的混亂場合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續表示，就論壇發問完畢，會問及抗爭派記者會，但關注「共謀者原則」的應用，望再審視相關內容。陳世傑申押至明日續審獲法官批准，並預計明天會完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒家成向步出被告欄的施德來說：「好攰呀！」，並向前彎身。&lt;/p&gt;

This article explores how the Russian armed forces have adapted traditional artillery practices to overcome challenges and achieve greater efficacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery is central to the Russian way of war, so it is beholden upon Western forces to properly understand how it has been applied in Ukraine. Russia’s artillery war is best analysed through two mechanisms: artillery doctrine – which provides the foundation for how artillery use has changed – and what artillery practitioners refer to as the gunnery problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gunnery problem is the same regardless of country, and describes the technical challenges involved in hitting a target with indirect fires. These challenges include accurate acquisition and use of meteorological data, which will impact flight path and speed; and survey data, which is critical to identifying where the firing gun is located and where it is pointing, as well as accurate location of the target. An additional element of the gunnery problem is calibration of the gun and ammunition. This involves measuring the temperature of the ammunition, the barrel wear, and the velocity of each shot if possible. If this information can be paired with sufficiently accurate target coordinates, an artillery battery will be able to fire for effect from its first rounds and will require fewer adjustments. The traditional approach without this is to fire rounds from a single battery and observe their deviation from the target. Corrections are made using forward observers, laser targeting systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery rounds will disperse along the range of fire as well as the line. The range refers to accuracy in front of or behind the target. Line refers to dispersion on either side of the target, as a result of which tube artillery produces a beaten zone that is approximately cigar shaped. It is important to understand the gunnery problem because it dictates what artillery forces must do to affect a target. The willingness of users to understand the gunnery problem, as well as doctrine, dictates efficacy. Because of this, the ability of the Russians to account for these technical limitations and achieve the commander’s desired effect provides a useful benchmark for Russian artillery efficacy in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;doctrine&quot;&gt;Doctrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Russian forces manoeuvre to fire, Western forces fire to manoeuvre” is a neat encapsulation of Russian doctrine compared with the West. Put simply, Russia uses artillery as its primary form of lethality in the deep and close battles. Its combined arms elements are charged with positioning themselves so that the artillery can deliver destructive effects against their opponents. This is a high-level simplification, but it is an important distinction to make. For static operations, the Russian forces should be expected to control artillery centrally and coordinate its actions through the artillery chain of command. A defensive brigade should be assigned a brigade artillery group (BrAG) from its parent army, which consists of two battalions of self-propelled howitzers and a battalion of multiple rocket launchers. The available literature indicates that a BrAG would deploy 2–4 km behind the edge of the defence and occupy an area 3–5 km wide by 1–2 km deep. It would provide additional firepower over organic assets at the frontline to defeat enemy forces on the approach and if they broke through. It is also common for artillery formations up to a battalion to be attached to a tank or motorised rifle battalion and provide immediate fire support. Attachment indicates a strong command relationship and involves the combined arms commander directing artillery fire missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent analysis published by RUSI indicates that on parts of the frontline, Russia has not deviated from this concept. Two batteries of tube and one of rocket artillery were assigned to each battalion tactical group in the opening mobile phases of the conflict. The static nature of fighting that followed has led to the centralisation of artillery under artillery brigades. However, Ukrainian soldiers interviewed for this article indicated that Russian artillery units were laagered up to 12–15 km behind the frontline, and that they spend the night even further away. They only approach the frontline to conduct fire missions and withdraw as quickly as possible, indicating that doctrine on proximity has given way to concerns over survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Russian artillery fire is highly effective, ammunition constraints combined with force dispersion have imposed limits upon its application and driven a reliance upon precision&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attachment of artillery formations to combined arms units is also discussed in Russian military journals covering the war. One article relates a case of an officer skipping the artillery commander altogether and sending his requests directly to battery commanders. This has resulted in articles explaining how a commander should designate and report targets directly to a battery commander. Another example reportedly involved “improvised mortar platoons”, which were temporary mortar teams established by a mechanised commander from regular infantry. This methodology provided immediately available fire support from three mortars that did not require additional clearance or process to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gunnery-problem&quot;&gt;The Gunnery Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it therefore appears that Russian doctrine has been followed in Ukraine, this offers only a partial impression of the Russian artillery war. The methods used to address the gunnery problem help to complete the picture and indicate that Russian artillery fire is highly effective, although ammunition constraints combined with force dispersion have imposed limits upon its application and driven a reliance upon precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia entered Ukraine with several pre-established developments designed to improve artillery accuracy. One example is shock-fire tactics, a principle discussed in 2018, which employs UAVs, artillery-locating radars, tanks and artillery to coax an enemy into firing before conducting counter-battery fires. Shock-fire shortens the targeting cycle and improves the accuracy of fires by combining at least two forms of target location. It was developed through deployments in Syria and Ukraine. It has been used in some form in Ukraine, and Ukrainian artillery officers told RUSI that Russian counter-battery fire is very fast and accurate when conducted using artillery-locating radar and UAVs together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the system works, Russian targeting cycles can be completed in three minutes, while others take 30. The former is essentially the limit of what is physically possible – a 155mm shell fired to 25 km will take 75 seconds to reach the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconnaissance-fire-system&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance-Fire System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconnaissance-fire system (recce-fire) is a development of a Soviet-era concept designed to pair tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets with precision strike artillery in real time. Strelets is the implementation of this concept, connecting sensors to shooters in as close to real time as possible. Recce-fire requires the target to be engaged with precision munitions such as the 2K25 Krasnopol 152mm laser-guided round. Target designation can be provided by ground-based laser systems or the Orlan-30 UAV. Video footage showing precise strikes on Ukrainian vehicles or buildings is likely a result of Krasnopol use. Prior to the war, recce-fire was expected to be critical for counter-battery engagements. Ground-based laser targeting is evident, but some Russian documents indicate that the Russian armed forces have struggled to get forward observers to perform their role in Ukraine. Many prefer to use UAVs, a safer but potentially less effective solution. The efficacy of Krasnopol has also been challenged. One Russian textbook on artillery indicates that Krasnopol’s accuracy is severely degraded by low-hanging cloud cover, variable terrain and a host of other conditions that make it a difficult munition to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia has made extensive use of loitering munitions like Lancet-3, which can be coordinated with a separate UAV to conduct reconnaissance and targeting or flown manually to search for and strike individual targets. This is likely a response to several factors: Ukraine’s use of dispersed guns, the availability of Krasnopol and the associated targeting assets, as well as the presence of electronic warfare, which degrades Lancet considerably. Ukrainian commanders told the author that while Lancet is more prevalent in some areas than artillery, in others it is rarely seen. The use of Lancet also suggests that Russia has struggled to counter dispersion with its pre-existing targeting structures and doctrine. The gunnery problem means that while a single howitzer in a tree line might be quickly identified, the chances of hitting it with unguided munitions are low unless excessive mass is applied. When considered against the backdrop of Russia’s own ammunition challenges, the use of loitering munitions is therefore a logical alternative. However, the lethality of Lancet is often insufficient. it is apparent from videos that crews can hear the munition approaching, as they often have time to disperse before it strikes. One officer also said that although he had seen his gun “destroyed” several times online, it remained alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weight-of-fires&quot;&gt;Weight of Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional artillery practices focused on the weight of fires, which refers to the quantity, density and intensity of artillery fire required to achieve an effect. Accuracy is important – there is no point firing shells into an empty field – but only insofar as it ensures that most shells are having an impact upon the target. The proliferation of reconnaissance and precision strike assets has led Western artillery forces to focus on precision, leading to what Amos Fox terms the precision fallacy. Fox posits that precision strike munitions have led commanders astray with the promise of hitting a target. However, he notes that single precision munitions may fail to destroy their target because they lack the necessary lethality. Russian military academics have echoed this sentiment and note that artillery units have re-learned the value of the weight of fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artillery is a formidable component of the Russian military, with occasionally best-in-breed targeting cycles and a doctrine that allows it to overcome deficiencies elsewhere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet gunners were provided with targeting tables detailing the number of shells needed to defeat different types of targets. For instance, 12 122mm howitzers would require 600 rounds to engage enemy infantry across a 33-hectare area. All 600 rounds would be delivered in 15 minutes, showing the intensity of fire that is needed. Weight of fires is shaped significantly by physics and psychology. The first 45–60 seconds of a fire mission will generally drive infantry into cover, so Soviet and Russian gunners have focused on delivering most of the required ammunition in the first 5–6 minutes. Thereafter, the heat generated by the firing and repositioning of guns generally limits the rate of fire to 1–3 rounds per minute. Firing at a higher rate for longer would degrade the barrel and accuracy. So, to achieve the necessary weight of fires it is essential to ensure that there are enough guns available to engage the target, otherwise the necessary quantity and intensity of fires will not be deployed in the relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian writers have emphasised this principle in journal articles, which suggest that Russian artillery may be struggling to achieve the weight of fires necessary to meet its doctrinal obligations. This may be a result of the extreme dispersion that is evident in Ukraine, as well as the lack of ammunition that has impacted more recent operations. Dispersion makes coordination of massed fires more difficult; in theory, systems like Strelets allow guns to disperse and fire on a single target, but they rely on good communications and training. Accuracy is improved through UAVs, but if Russian forces are struggling to concentrate their artillery, then one would expect their ammunition consumption to increase as they try to destroy targets with fewer guns available. Attrition also plays a role: Russia is likely to have lost many of its guns and most experienced crews. However, Russian attacks are often preceded by extensive indirect fire; Russia’s ammunition consumption and accounts from Ukraine both support this argument. Recent reports indicate that 70% of Ukraine’s casualties are a result of artillery fires. It is clear therefore that despite challenges, Russian artillery is having a significant impact on the Ukrainian armed forces and delivering effects through a combination of innovative tactics and technology, as well as a reliance upon its traditional doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-sum&quot;&gt;In Sum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analysis of Russian artillery practice in Ukraine indicates that while it has demonstrated variable levels of efficacy, on the whole it is a formidable component of the Russian military, with occasionally best-in-breed targeting cycles and a doctrine that allows for artillery to overcome the deficiencies of Russian combined arms forces. It has built a significant ability to find and strike targets over a wide area, and likely retains the ability to mass fires against targets of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirect fire support operates on mathematical principles of certainty. Approaches to this differ: Western forces, for instance, seek an economy of effort and resources in the application of fires. They tend to pay close attention to all aspects of the gunnery problem to ensure that their fires achieve effect with optimal ammunition consumption. The evidence from Ukraine suggests that Russian forces have combined both approaches: the use of UAVs, radar and precision munitions indicates that accuracy is essential for certain tasks, but attaining the weight of fires remains critical.&lt;/p&gt;

But the violence is assuming an uncontrollable momentum of its own, creating exponential difficulties for belligerents and peacemakers alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 100 days in, Sudan’s conflict shows no signs of abating. Across the capital, clashes remain concentrated around Omdurman and Bahri, Khartoum’s sister cities, with a single airstrike killing at least 37 people and Grad rockets saturating residential neighbourhoods. Despite dwarfing Mohamed Hamdan “Hemmeti” Dagalo’s RSF, SAF is on the back foot after failing to relieve the disparate garrisons making up its frontline. Dismissed by many as a “vanity project”, a passable imitation of a working military, the army displays little of the capacity or doctrine necessary to sustain a counterinsurgency, having outsourced such functions to the very group it is now fighting. The top brass appears divided over operational planning, and morale among poorly paid ground-troops is often shaky. Perhaps as a consequence, heavily armed convoys from Hattab Camp were decimated along Al Ingaz Street, a major north-south artery, while trying to reach SAF’s beleaguered Signal Corps – the latest in a series of costly setbacks that have left much of the military’s senior leadership, including Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, seemingly cut off in the nearby General Command complex. With the defenders reportedly short on fuel, “even some army backers suggest the RSF [could be] on the cusp of a decisive victory”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not a foregone conclusion. Hemmeti’s supply lines are stretched, and SAF is still entrenched across Khartoum’s outskirts, with ready access to the Sudanese coastline and support infrastructure further north. Additionally, al-Burhan is only the face of a polycentric “khakistocracy”, a metropolitan syndicate of Islamist elites, corporate cronies and riverain officers – the so-called “community of the state” – desperate to preserve their privilege and social standing from rural revolutionaries. Should the compound fall, it is therefore entirely plausible that the conflict will grind on, bringing with it serious problems for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dangerous-refractions&quot;&gt;Dangerous Refractions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although possibly benefiting from a war of attrition in material terms, the military is experiencing existential pressures that will only worsen over time. Primarily drawn from Awlad Al-Bahr (Ja’aliyyin, Shaigiyya and Danagla) ethnic networks clustered along the Nile, SAF’s generals cast themselves as national custodians, an indispensable arm of the Sudanese state “mid-wifing” modernity, social consciousness and manifest destiny. But battlefield blunders and mounting casualties are taking a toll on their narrative. Having already urged retired soldiers to re-enlist, al-Burhan delivered another televised address in late June demanding a general mobilisation. Despite some evidence of refitted or newly deployed units, manpower shortages persist across the capital, leaving the army reliant on a variety of quasi and unofficial forces – former intelligence operatives, paramilitary groups like the Central Reserve Police, armed Islamists, and rumoured “Shadow Brigades” – to offset its losses. This dependency is not only damaging to SAF’s cohesion but anathema to its internal logic, accelerating the “fragmentation of sovereignty” Sudanese officers have long feared. By trying to reimpose some (imagined) monopoly over the use of violence, the army’s survival could paradoxically now be tied to a steady process of “militiafication”, leaving it one (depleted) security outfit among many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the RSF – a rudimental patchwork of militiamen – have carved out a comparatively strong position in recent months, drawing on fleets of “technicals” and a well-catered stockpile of weapons and munition – mortars, anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank missiles and drones – to consolidate control over most of central Khartoum. Supplemented by armoured vehicles from captured military bases, they can also deploy Man-Portable Air Defence Systems or “man-pads”, presenting a marked risk to civil and military aviation. Furthermore, Hemmeti enjoys strategic depth across South, West and Central Darfur, enabling his forces to conceivably hold out for years. But a protracted conflict raises other difficulties. Much of the RSF is incentivised by “money and clan solidarity [rather] than ideology”, and amid the polyglot membership produced by wartime recruitment, social revolution may not necessarily be bound up under the Dagalo brand alone. With SAF freezing the group’s bank accounts and constraining its cashflow, significant portions of this “force for hire” could become unmanageable, breaking off in pursuit of more lucrative opportunities. Signs may already be discernible as strains on RSF logistics exacerbate pillage and marauding, weakening Hemmeti’s half-baked populist appeal and driving the creation of several field courts to prosecute his own men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sudan’s upheaval should not be considered a binary contest between SAF and the RSF so much as a “welter of complex struggle”, integrating a raft of conflicts from the regional to the hyperlocal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drawn-out hostilities in Sudan’s long-congested political marketplace are likely to accentuate a litany of smaller, localised disputes. Across “resource-rich, drought-prone” Darfur, fighting is assuming an ethnic flavour as Mahamid and Rizeigat gunmen – many affiliated with the RSF – attempt to capture land and water sources. Fur and Masalit civilians have been systematically targeted, with mass killings recycling the same “tactics, techniques and procedures” of the early 2000s. Reports describe not only the deliberate destruction of “homes, schools and hospitals [and] water, electricity and communications infrastructure”, but the torching of local markets and the palace of the Masalit Sultanate. Such is the scale of devastation that Khamis Abakar, Wali of West Darfur, was himself assassinated hours after condemning the attacks as a “genocide”. Police – often “outmanned and ill equipped” non-Arabs – have called on “their communities to arm and defend themselves” in turn, with some appealing to the army for support. Within months, cities like Al-Geneina hosted a medley of rival factions: former insurgents and signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement patrolled the eastern districts; much of the suburbs were ringed by Janjaweed; paramilitaries controlled the governor’s house; and SAF occupied the airport. This decentralisation of violence not only breeds a new crop of spoilers but generates its own momentum, further splintering Sudanese authority into “thousands of fragments and micro-powers of local character”. Porous boundaries; weak institutions; and shared kinship, patronage and political networks also mesh Saharan borderlands together, with Hemmeti’s Rizeigat tribe spanning western Sudan and Chad, and its wider fraternity – the Baggara confederation – stretching to Niger. As a result, conflict is readily exportable, raising the possibility of a regional conflagration that is exponentially harder to regulate or resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign meddling is already evident from reports of Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar – a beneficiary of RSF support during his assault on Tripoli in 2019 – supplying Hemmeti with hardware, medicine and fuel. The US likewise accused the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary company, of exporting surface-to-air missiles from the Central African Republic. Even those nominally pushing for peace have picked sides, with Cairo remaining a staunch supporter of al-Burhan, partly due to close structural linkages with the Sudanese army and a pressing need for allies in negotiations over Ethiopia’s Renaissance Dam. Certain analysts are even going as far as to suggest that Egyptian fighter jets have directly participated in SAF’s bombing campaign. Similar – if more covert – dynamics are playing out in the Gulf. In theory, Saudi Arabia and the UAE share little interest in a prolonged conflict after years of tying over the Sudanese state – and coterminous systems of graft and patronage – with loans, rents and aid. In November 2022, Riyadh’s Public Investment Fund pledged $3 billion to improve economic infrastructure across Khartoum, while months earlier, the Emiratis stumped up $6 billion in construction projects, agriculture and deposits for the Central Bank. Consequently, both – as members of the Quad (alongside the US and UK) and the Arab League – have pushed for a ceasefire and immediate humanitarian access. But many dismiss the UAE’s credibility as a “neutral arbiter”, given Dubai’s regular consumption of Sudanese gold and ongoing ties to RSF companies and media outlets. In April, for instance, footage surfaced of the group using thermobaric shells that reportedly trace back to UAE stockpiles, leading some to speculate that the “Abu Dhabi Express” – a complex web of commercial proxies and illicit arms flows – could in reality extend across Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under such conditions, Sudan’s upheaval should not be considered a binary contest between SAF and the RSF – entities that are themselves volatile composites of different actors and interests – so much as a “welter of complex struggle”, integrating a raft of conflicts from the regional to the hyperlocal, which proliferate far beyond the immediate control of either al-Burhan or Hemmeti. This is not to deny agency or culpability for war crimes and well-documented atrocities, but reflects the increasing difficulty of delivering solutions that can sufficiently address the centrifugal propensities of long-running violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-priorities-and-cautionary-tales&quot;&gt;Immediate Priorities and Cautionary Tales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A credible ceasefire is, of course, paramount. Over a third of Sudan’s population was aid-dependent before the fighting, and an additional 3.3 million are now displaced. Internally displaced persons, refugees and migrants – many of them itinerant farm-hands – face not only insecurity but diminishing labour demand and little in the way of reliable transit, cutting off incomes as market prices “sky-rocket”. The World Food Programme anticipates around 2.5 million more people will experience “acute hunger” in the coming months, pushing the country to a “record high”. Crucially, Susanne Jaspars and Lutz Oette also describe a shift in the “nature and scale” of the crisis, increasing deprivation across urban communities and leaving the conventional modalities for emergency relief obsolete or insufficient. Additionally, international supplies are largely confined to Port Sudan, awaiting clearance from the notoriously apathetic Humanitarian Aid Commission, a regulatory body allegedly associated with Sudanese Military Intelligence. With civil service salaries unpaid and local law and order collapsing, there is not enough capacity or infrastructure to offset these blockages. Where alternatives have been found, either via resistance committees or improvised administrative solutions, they continue to be waylaid or completely derailed by violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The focus on high-level brokerage neglects the breadth, complexity and dynamism of grievances only loosely affiliated with the war’s “master-cleavage”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, external negotiations have understandably focused on suspending hostilities, delivering aid and demilitarising “hospitals and essential public facilities”, albeit to little avail. Among these pressing needs, however, it is vital that mediators avoid their past follies when engaging the “men with guns”. A demoralising track record of foreign peace-making in Sudan not only features the Framework Agreement but stretches back to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and various initiatives in the 1990s, which saw elite-centric bargains repeatedly “displacing civil politics and raising the … currency of violence”. In the process, these “make-do outcomes” tended to side-line or quash the very civic activism necessary for helping peace stick, reproducing (and entrenching) the same structures of violence that precipitated conflict in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, there seem to be encouraging lessons already being learned. The imposition of US sanctions on Al-Junaid, Tradive General Trading LLC, and parastatals like Defence Industry Systems and Sudan Master Technology conforms with recommendations made by NGOs and advocacy groups, as does the appointment of a dedicated Special Envoy from Washington. High-level diplomats routinely emphasise the importance of “civilian leadership”, and there is belated interest in supporting resistance committees. But platitudes and standalone policies do not translate into a “practical plan” for resolving the conflict. Though the UK and EU are launching similar financial measures, it is doubtful that they will find traction without buy-in from the UAE, or be able to stem “localised outbreaks of fighting and Arab mobilisation” across Darfur. At the same time, UK and Emirati officials resented being initially left out of US-Saudi negotiations, undermining the Quad’s collective relevance, and there remains little convergence between the “military-focused” Jeddah talks and parallel diplomatic tracks fronted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the AU, Egypt and Chad. Without harmonisation, or at least efforts to shore up better coherence, international engagement could very quickly become “quixotic”, if not completely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on high-level brokerage also neglects the breadth, complexity and dynamism of grievances only loosely affiliated with the war’s “master-cleavage”. As SAF and the RSF increasingly resemble fragile coalitions, dealings between Hemmeti and al-Burhan may have no real bearing on the myriad of private conflicts now shaping Sudanese violence. As a result, conflict resolution is unlikely to work if involving the generals alone and could undermine much-needed atrocity prevention if “massacres and war crimes…[are] ignored under the exigencies of peacemaking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a renewed appetite for dialogue is emerging, Sudan’s so-called strongmen are caught in a self-destructive strategy, undermining their own authority as they try to build leverage for a carousel of negotiations. In the process, fighting is becoming ever more diffused, distorted and unstable. While a ceasefire is therefore imperative, it is not enough: mediators need a plan for what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;《國安法》頒布後一度考慮退出初選 鄒家成哽咽稱「做唔出」、「無法離群眾而去」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sKnJYrG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第101天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，因當時與團隊研究條文，判斷參選人最多只因過往言論有機會被捕，而他過往對體制及政府批評較「尖銳」，「香港民族主義」亦可能被扭曲成分裂國家和港獨言論，加上條文「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重」，如「盲人摸象」。惟鄒指他終決定繼續參加初選，庭上哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續指，當時與團隊重新尋覓參選的意義，認為「繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，他亦商討如何調整競選工程以繼續參選，遂更改選舉口號和單張，將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就提名表格條款「擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特區」，鄒指他效忠的是理應能產生憲法應有功能的《基本法》，及「會受憲法約束」和「保障市民大眾權利」的政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息-鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&quot;&gt;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息 鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第3天作供，辯方展示初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示趙家賢於6月19日曾轉發署名為「抗爭派立場聲明書」發起人鄒家成、張可森和梁晃維，上款為「致初選籌組平台」的訊息，鄒指由張可森負責發出，由鄒其中一名團隊成員幫手草擬，他負責批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該訊息提及3人發起聲明已逾一星期，共收到39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，意味除民主黨、街工及社民連等外大部分人已簽署。聲明續提及「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結，期望以初選方式讓香港選民選出合適的代表披甲上陣。若無此共同綱領，恐怕初選只會淪為議席的『分餅機』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明又指，戴耀廷決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖大部分參與者有簽署「墨落」重申堅定立場，但亦有原先出席協調會議的參與者明言杯葛初選。聲明又指協調會議的共識及「墨落無悔」亦包括認同若支持度不足須表明停止選舉工程，「這是否代表部分拒絕簽署聲明書的參選人可以無視我們早前的共識，甚至無視初選的結果？有見及此，希望初選主辦單位回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志不如抽籤惟重申否決財案非協調共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志「不如抽籤」、惟重申否決財案非協調共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成表示，當時着團隊成員按「墨落無悔」原文草擬一段訊息予初選籌組平台，告知他們有多少人已簽署，並就「墨落」的兩點聲明寫一些訊息，但無特別指明如何寫，「我由佢發揮然之後我再睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續解釋訊息內容，指「墨落無悔」聲明運用否決權一點是想展現抗爭意志，「我哋認為如果無法向選民展現抗爭意志嘅話，呢個初選就失去一個意義，咁不如抽籤就算啦」，亦是上述恐怕初選只淪為議席「分餅機」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李運騰關注，「初選原設共同綱領」一段似乎談及已達成共識的事項，鄒不同意，重申在新東並無就運用否決權達成共識；而「共同綱領」指協調會議上「原本傾過嘅嘢」，但不代表有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱大黨不簽墨落令素人擔心參選無保障-望組織者提供保障&quot;&gt;鄒稱大黨不簽「墨落」令素人擔心參選無保障 望組織者提供保障&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於杯葛初選，鄒指記得當時新西協調會議，有街工的人想杯葛初選。法官陳慶偉問是否因街工認為不能否決有利草根的預算案？鄒說「應該唔係」，指爭議應是街工「好似係想輸咗初選都繼續選官方選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，訊息是否想向組織者表達應有簽署的協議？鄒不同意，解釋是想發訊息予初選籌組平台，通知他們發起了「墨落」，而較關鍵信息是「墨落」的第二點（「認同若支持度跌出各預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」），因當時不少政治素人擔心，部分大黨不簽署甚至公開批評「墨落無悔」，到底是因為運用否決權一點、抑或是因為第二點，即他們初選落敗仍想繼續參加官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RUpiQQp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月19日，街工舉行記者會宣佈有意參選立法會，6月29日發佈聲明改為表示不會參選。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指這些素人擔心參加初選「好似冇一個保障」，因此發訊息望平台能保障其他參加者。鄒並同意，他與張可森和梁晃維均是政治素人，也有相同擔憂，惟最終組織者並沒有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款-理解目標為攞35&quot;&gt;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款 理解目標為「攞35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格。就表格第二段：「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，鄒指理解是新東協調會議達成的共識，亦沒有將「民主派35+公民投票計劃」理解為一份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問那他簽署時如何理解，鄒笑指「其實我當時冇細心睇呢句句子，我諗住簽個名就參加初選」，又指「我有留意到有呢句嘢喺度嘅，但我冇細緻去逐粒字睇呢一句」。鄒後在法官追問下指，理解「目標」為「攞35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應-鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格聯想埋一齊&quot;&gt;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應 鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格「聯想埋一齊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續提到，鄒家成3人此前發訊息要求組織者保障政治素人的利益，擔心傳統政黨參選人食言、初選落敗仍參加正式選舉，而提名表格第二段，字面上似乎就是回應此關注，問鄒為何不要求組織者澄清該點的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒先回應嚴格而言，他們「冇要求佢哋要做一啲嘢去保障我哋，其實只係問吓佢哋，其他人係咪真係想反悔呀咁樣嘅啫」，又指「當時真係冇諗過」問組織者，因覺得部分傳統泛民主派食言「其實都係佢哋嘅事，初選籌組平台其實都好難控制佢哋嘅」，訊息「純粹係表達擔憂嘅啫」。陳仲衡指，但訊息提到望組織者回應，鄒同意，「但係佢哋最後冇回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，鄒稱組織者沒有回應，但提名表格第二段可能就是組織者的回應，再問鄒有否問組織者究竟談及什麼「共識」？又指區諾軒提過，如有人問他「目標」的意思，他會指是「共同綱領」文件，並問鄒是否明白。鄒回應：「盡力去理解啦，我理解阿陳慶偉法官你啱啱講嘅嘢，只不過係有人問初選平台嘅人，佢哋就會答啦」，但鄒表示：「我冇將當時關於 WhatsApp 入面個擔憂，同呢個 nomination form 聯想埋一齊， 我的確冇呢個聯想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，即使當時有這個「小擔憂」，即其他參選人落敗或仍繼續參加官方選舉，「其實我都係會繼續參加個初選㗎喇」，而即使他們真的這樣做，「已經係初選完結咗之後嘅事喇，既然係咁，不如到時再算啦」，只是6月中時他覺得要向組織者表達此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的基本法會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&quot;&gt;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的《基本法》、會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於提名表格第6點「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，被問為何認同該點，鄒指《基本法》是香港的憲法，「憲法理應產生嘅功能係約束當權者嘅權力，同埋保障市民大眾嘅權利」，而他認為立法會議員所奉行的精神，與《基本法》理應要產生的功能是吻合，「我效忠嘅係會受憲法約束，同埋會保障市民大眾權利嘅政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，鄒有否區分《基本法》應該的說法，和實際上的說法（“… what the Basic Law should say or what the Basic Law in fact says”）？鄒指有。李再問，故鄒說擁護《基本法》，是擁護哪種《基本法》？鄒回答：「我覺得《基本法》喺香港嘅實踐係未如理想嘅。」惟陳仲衡即打斷，指問題並非《基本法》的實踐，又嚴厲指：「不要嘗試迴避問題，面對問題並回答，你有足夠的經驗知道你是否在回答我們的問題。（“You are experienced enough to know whether you are answering our question.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續回答：「我效忠一本，理應能夠產生憲法理應產生功能嘅《基本法》。擁護又好，效忠又好，我覺得係一個好私人嘅情感，同一個人嘅信仰係有密切嘅關係，你要強化一個信仰……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指認為已聽夠了，指簡言之鄒是擁護他所相信的《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權-官稱帖文不證自明&quot;&gt;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權 官稱帖文不證自明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就鄒家成 Facebook 帖文發問。就6月21日的〈繼承民族意志，掀起反殖浪潮——立法會新界東初選參選宣言〉，鄒解釋主要宣布會參加初選和交代政治理念。陳世傑問他想傳遞什麼訊息，惟法官陳慶偉指不認為需要問（go through that），認為帖文內容不證自明（self-explanatory）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問及「生於九七主權移交之年，自我有記憶以來，就只係不斷見證住香港嘅沉淪同赤化」中「沉淪同赤化」的意思，鄒向法官表示：「法官閣下，我知道你哋未必想我好詳細咁樣解釋呢個參選宣言，我用一個好簡短嘅方式快快趣趣講咗佢好冇呀」，被告席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑說他完全明白鄒的聲明，只是辯方大狀問及字詞意思，並指除非字詞是模糊，否則會按字面理解，又指基本上「赤化」就是指「一國一制」、「香港成為中國的一部分」、「香港受共產黨管治」，指「我們全都知道那是什麼意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，那鄒在帖文中的用字，有沒有意圖顛覆香港或中國政府？鄒說：「不論係呢度用嘅赤化又好、殖民又好，撕破畫皮都好，都沒有呢個意圖。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示6月25日帖文〈我只係一個普通香港人〉，指鄒昨提及「攬炒」的意思，並問帖文「同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」一句中，「攬炒到底」的意思與鄒昨提到的有否分別？鄒說「冇分別，『攬炒』同我主張嘅議會抗爭，同剛才嗰篇嘅參選宣言入面嘅『撕破畫皮』，同埋『衝擊體制』一樣意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法頒布後曾考慮退出初選-指字眼模糊刑罰重如盲人摸象&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選 指字眼模糊刑罰重如「盲人摸象」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+計劃新東信息發布區」群組紀錄，顯示由6月24日設立，鄒家成同日加入，但於7月2日退出。被問為何退出，鄒指「因為《國安法》頒布之後，我諗過退出初選」，並指基本上是6月30日《國安法》頒布後已「諗緊呢件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問鄒做了什麼，鄒說「交代少少個背景啦，可能有少少長」，陳問：「可以簡短嗎？」，庭上傳出笑聲，鄒說「盡力」。鄒續說，6月30日晚擺完最後一個街站後，他返回辦公室，與選舉團隊一起等待《國安法》條文，至晚上11時他們已立即看條文，「我哋研究過《國安法》條例，當時嘅判斷係，參選人最多只係因為過往嘅言論而有機會被捕。」陳世傑指這是鄒的恐懼，陳慶偉說或是鄒的印象，鄒說「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他其後與團隊研究過往發表的言論，覺得過往對於體制和政府的批評都「比較尖銳」，加上當時認為「香港民族主義」有機會被扭曲成「分裂國家」和「港獨」的言論，亦因覺得《國安法》「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重，情況如同盲人摸象」，「所以睇完之後，我一度考慮緊係咪要退出初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定-我覺得我無法離群眾而去&quot;&gt;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定 「我覺得我無法離群眾而去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問那他決定是？鄒家成說：「繼續參加初選。咁中間發生嘅嘢我唔詳細去講，主要就係處理完情緒之後，恢復咗思緒……」，說罷微微低頭沒有作聲。陳說：「你選擇繼續（“You decided to press on.”）」，鄒停頓一兩秒後抬頭，略哽咽說「係」，並清了兩下喉嚨。陳續問，而鄒7月2日退出群組時，仍在考慮是否繼續初選？鄒再略哽咽說：「當時考慮緊」，身旁的法庭傳譯主任遞上紙巾，鄒輕輕擦拭眼和鼻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉，問是什麼帖文，鄒續哽咽說：「簡單嚟講，我喺考慮緊初選嘅時候，我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續說：「總之有一晚我就打電話比我團隊嘅成員，我就同佢講，不如繼續，咁佢就話『全部人都ready，爭你一個』，咁我就同佢講，咁你幫我 call 齊人，第二日開會，我今晚返屋企準備一下」，鄒說時聲線持續微微顫抖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義-國安法後改用較溫和口號&quot;&gt;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義 《國安法》後改用較溫和口號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續說，團隊其後開會，主要談及兩件事，他欲談及第一件事時，陳慶偉打斷稱不認為需深究，總之最後鄒決定繼續參選。陳世傑問，但鄒有否做什麼改善在《國安法》下的處境？鄒聲音開始平復：「我下一句就準備講喇，我哋重新尋覓繼續參選嘅意義啦，我哋認為繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，而第二項討論就是「如何調整個競選工程，繼續參選」，他們遂更改了選舉口號和調整一些選舉單張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8zNxgka.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂確認，他將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」，解釋想盡量避免用一些可能會被認為「好尖銳」、或「可能會被扭曲成會違反《國安法》」的字眼。陳世傑問是用較溫和（softer）的字眼？鄒說「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，認為「抗擊暴政」和「民族抗暴」意思大致一樣（more or less the same），但理解鄒是想要令口號變得更溫和（tone down），並問鄒何時決定改口號。鄒說7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉的文章，可理解為「我正式決定繼續參選嘅一個時間點」，他亦是在當時更改口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就該帖文發文，呈堂文件呈黑白，左上角寫有「Telegram」，法官李運騰一度稱該帖文在 Telegram 發布。鄒指左上角的「Telegram」字眼只代表「我開緊 Facebook 前一個 app，我用緊 Telegram」，而「眼前見到呢個 page 其實係 Facebook嚟嘅」。法官陳慶偉其後下令休庭，明續就該帖文發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成步入被告欄前，向旁聽親友說：「好渣呀真係！」，又笑說：「Sorry, unexpected.」，親友發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s relationship with Niger has been anchored by their mutual need – France’s demand for uranium and Niger’s dependence on France’s financial support and military protection. Niger is the source of a substantial portion of the EU’s uranium imports and meets 15% of France’s uranium requirements as well as a fifth of Europe’s uranium needs. This symbiosis, however, is strained with the advent of the coup, challenging France’s continued relevance and influence in Niger and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coup is the physical manifestation of the simmering resentment against “Françafrique”, the contentious economic and diplomatic ties between France and its former African colonies. This isn’t just an outpouring of the Nigeriens’ frustrations; it reflects the broader African sentiment against perceived neo-imperialism. France’s controversial military operations in the Sahel region, including Serval and Barkhane, have not only been ineffective in curbing jihadist insurgency but have indirectly fueled their growth. As Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador, aptly remarks, “every liberating army becomes, after a while, an occupier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contemporary crisis also exposes the EU’s ambiguous Africa strategy. The EU is at a crossroads – escalating tensions in Niger could potentially discourage it from imposing sanctions on Russia, a key uranium supplier, thereby compounding the bloc’s dependence on foreign resources. It’s not just about immediate uranium supply; it’s about reassessing the EU’s broader relationships and strategies in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-approach-in-africa&quot;&gt;Russia’s approach in Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe grapples with the reverberations of its colonial past, another power has stealthily navigated the African political waters, extending its reach and consolidating its influence. This is Russia, operating under the banner of anti-neocolonialism and led during many years by the shadowy businesses of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has massively funded disinformation campaigns in Africa, and supported by its Wagner Group, who has woven its web across Africa, securing interests and leveraging instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s renewed focus on Africa was clearly exhibited in the Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in 2019, and more recently, in St. Petersburg. Russia paints itself as the sturdy backbone of African security. Here, Putin brilliantly exploited soft power, offering debt relief and humanitarian aid to African nations while positioning Russia as a counterbalance to Western influence. His anti-neocolonial rhetoric, combined with gestures of respect towards African sovereignty, are part of a shrewd strategy to recalibrate Africa’s geopolitical alliances. One of the most interesting outcomes of the recent 2023 Russia-Africa Summit was the agreement on the creation of a new permanent Russian-African security mechanism, aimed at combating terrorism, extremism, transnational crime, and ensuring food security. Offering both training to African servicemen and law enforcement and supply of weapons – occasionally gratis – to strengthen African sovereignty and to save African leaders from the pain of former colonial powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group’s actions in Africa reflect the complexity of Russia’s strategy. It has been instrumental in advancing Russian interests in nations like Mali and the Central African Republic, but recent events suggest it might be asserting its own agenda, independently of the Kremlin. The Wagner rebellion fiasco raises questions about the dynamic between Putin and the private military company. Is Putin the puppet master, or is the Wagner Group a beast too big to control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coup in Niger presents a compelling case study in this narrative. The sight of Russian flags waved by coup supporters was an ominous sign of shifting alliances. While there’s no concrete evidence of Wagner or Russia directly instigating the coup, their potential gain from the ensuing instability cannot be ignored. Prigozhin’s offer of Wagner’s services to the coup leaders adds another layer to this geopolitical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;piecing-the-geopolitical-puzzle-together&quot;&gt;Piecing the geopolitical puzzle together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation demands a deeper understanding of the multi-faceted approach of Russia and the Wagner Group in Africa. Each coup, every summit, each show of support or condemnation forms a piece of a grand geopolitical jigsaw puzzle. Russia’s growing influence in Africa, like the mythical Hydra, seems to thrive amidst chaos and uncertainty. However, each new head of this Hydra that emerges offers an opportunity for vigilance and comprehension of Russia’s complex and ever-evolving strategy in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent coup in Niger was not an unforeseen event, but a climactic endpoint of an ongoing political tension that had been building for months. Niger, one of the only two non-military regimes in the G5 Sahel, was balancing on the edge of a precipice, mired in corruption and insecurity. Whispers of a coup had been circulating since February, with the turning point coming from within the presidential guard, instigating other factions to seize control. The capital, Niamey, more exposed to jihadist attacks than its G5 counterparts, buckled under the strain of constant threats and the influx of displaced residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interpret this coup as a step backwards in democracy, but for a nation worn out by years of corruption and mismanagement, it serves as a necessary reaction. It is a bleak tableau where jobless youth and impoverished rural communities are the hardest hit. In such a scenario, any change, including a coup, signals a potential for much-needed reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst Niger’s political tumult, a stark resentment towards France is fuelled in Niamey. While ECOWAS condemns the coup, the West grapples with a diplomatic quandary: how to assist without colonial echoes. Anti-French sentiment, amplified by Russian influences, is not inherently anti-European. The West must pivot: the diplomatic roadmap ahead calls for the West to prioritise authentic partnerships over paternalistic approaches. There must be a shift from merely offering aid to fostering mutual understandings, from imposing conditions, to soliciting African-led solutions. The tri-border region, a migration and extremism nexus, demands stability, especially in the tri-border area of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, crucial for migration routes and vital to countering extremism.Ultimately, the coup in Niger serves as a wake-up call to the international community. It underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive reassessment of relationships with Africa, to move away from the shadows of colonialism and towards equitable partnerships. It also highlights the need to carefully dissect Russia’s sophisticated approach in Africa, which challenges the status quo and dictates the need for a coordinated international response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every move and countermove in this intricate game of geopolitics, the international community must remain alert and adaptive, ready to confront Hydra’s next gambit. After all, it is not just about surviving the immediate storm but navigating the complex currents of power, influence, and survival in a world that continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic recalibration is not a choice, it is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

The continued economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s more insular nationalism, the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and widening U.S.-China strategic competition are shuffling U.S. and Chinese comparative advantages across the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local attitudes toward the United States and China — and views of their respective strategic and economic roles in the region — are a vital component in this strategic competition. They constitute the metrics of soft power and influence and need to be considered when predicting where regional governments are likely to align on any given issue. But there are huge gaps in country-by-country opinion polling on these fronts, and there has been little rigorous analysis of the elite and public opinion polls that do exist. Instead, policymakers in Washington and regional capitals alike tend to make assumptions about Southeast Asian opinion using anecdotes or tiny elite samples, often from just a couple of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper collates and weights available country-level polling data to provide a more rigorous assessment of elite and public opinion regarding the United States and China. To find comparable data across a range of polls, the analysis is limited to just three questions for both public and elite opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the (elites/public) of this country have warmer feelings toward the United States or China?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which of the two do they consider the most important strategic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which do they consider the most important economic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these assessments is assigned a level of confidence — low, medium, or high — based on sample size, national representativeness, and volatility in the available polling. The table below shows the assessments that can be made with medium or high confidence. In all other cases, there has either been no polling or assessments can only be made with low confidence — meaning pronouncements that “Country X thinks Y” should be treated with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ErMwqfj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asian Public and Elite Opinion toward the United States and China.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: P indicates public opinion, E indicates elite opinion. Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country section below details the available polling, along with a brief overview of the state of U.S. relations and a survey of relevant economic indicators to provide context for some of the polling data. In all cases, China is the leading trading partner (often by a very wide margin) and in many cases the leading investor. The United States is a significant provider of development assistance as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but this pales in comparison to the trade and investment figures, as well as nontraditional loans and other forms of assistance. This economic imbalance is reflected in public and elite opinion that China is the leading economic power in the region — a finding shared in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that in most of the countries for which there is insufficient data, publics and elites would identify China as the region’s leading economic power. But no such assumptions can be made about which nation they would deem the region’s leading strategic power or which they have warmer feelings toward. In the available data, Chinese economic influence is not correlated either positively or negatively with overall public and elite attitudes toward it, nor are public and elite feelings about China and the United States necessarily aligned. Of the three countries for which the data allows confident assessments, public and elite preferences for one power over the other only align in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program hopes to expand this research in the future with additional polling data and other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion&quot;&gt;PUBLIC OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public opinion polling, this white paper relies on a range of surveys conducted either by international organizations that cover a broad span of countries or country-specific public opinion survey institutions or think tanks. Both use nationally representative samples and are generally reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that most public opinion polls are country-specific limits their utility for cross-country assessments of attitudes toward the United States and China. The surveys ask different questions of respondents, many of which are rooted in specific cultural or linguistic contexts. This is why the analysis in this white paper is limited to just three broad questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/interactives/international-methodology/all-survey/all-country/all-year/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled nationally representative samples of 1,003 adults in Malaysia and 1,001 in Singapore. The margin of error was 4 percentage points in Malaysia and 3.7 percentage points in Singapore. The 2019 Pew Global Attitudes survey polled a nationally representative sample of 1,035 adults in the Philippines with a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points. Findings from these surveys are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/08/01/globally-people-point-to-isis-and-climate-change-as-leading-security-threats/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults in Vietnam. The margin of error was 5.2 percentage points. Findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence because of their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://6389062.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6389062/Canva%20images/Democracy%20Perception%20Index%202023.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democracy Perception Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,053 online respondents from Indonesia, 1,054 from Malaysia, 1,057 from the Philippines, 1,007 from Singapore, 1,051 from Thailand, and 1,053 from Vietnam. The poll was commissioned by the Alliance of Democracies and conducted by Latana, which describes itself as “an AI-powered brand tracking solution.” The sample sizes in each country were large enough to be statistically rigorous, and results for each were weighted by age, gender, and education level. But as an online-only poll that reaches respondents using third-party news, shopping, sports, and gaming apps and websites, its samples are unlikely to be as representative as those from traditional pollsters. The poll likely overrepresents those who are wealthier, live in urban and suburban areas, and are the most online. In addition, Latana does not make clear whether the polling questions were asked in local languages or only in English, and the exact role of its machine-learning technologies in collecting and analyzing results is unclear. For these reasons, the findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://interactives.lowyinstitute.org/features/indonesia-poll-2021/topic/global-powers-and-leaders/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowy Institute’s 2021 Indonesia Poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; surveyed a nationally representative sample of 3,000 Indonesian adults across every province. The margin of error was 1.8 percentage points. Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence except where a plurality of respondents chose “don’t know,” in which case they are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://merdeka.org/v2/download/china-poll-2022-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merdeka Center’s 2022 public opinion survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on perceptions toward China polled a nationally representative sample of 1,204 adults across all Malaysian states, with a margin of error of 2.9 percent. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://egfound.org/2023/06/modeling-democracy-caught-in-the-middle/#Specific-Findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 500 Singaporean adults and a sample of 500 Filipino adults representative of the online population in the country. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence for Singapore, and medium confidence for the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion&quot;&gt;ELITE OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to public opinion polling, elite opinion surveys center specifically on policy experts, academics, civil society representatives, business leaders, and in some cases, government officials. For elite opinion, this report relies mainly on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/state-of-southeast-asia-survey/the-state-of-southeast-asia-2023-survey-report-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Southeast Asia survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. ISEAS polls a mixture of academics, business leaders, civil society and media representatives, government officials, and personnel at international organizations. Its surveys are extremely valuable to policymakers and analysts of Southeast Asia, and they provide data points that cannot be found anywhere else. But as with any survey, it has its limitations and does not claim to be equally rigorous for every country in the region. To the contrary, ISEAS presents its results as a reflection of elite opinion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an institution, rather than that of Southeast Asia as a region or of its constituent countries. It drives home that point by weighting each country’s responses not by population or number of respondents, but as 10 percent of the total, reflecting their coequal status within ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 ISEAS survey included 1,308 individuals, down from 1,507 in 2022. The largest number of respondents, 208, came from Singapore, where ISEAS is based. The smallest number, 99, came from the Philippines. In all other cases, the number of respondents was over 100. The size of these response pools relative to each country’s population, and therefore the extent to which they are representative of each country’s elite, varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no agreed-upon standard for how large a response pool must be for an elite survey to be considered representative. And given the nature of elite surveys, it is impossible to create truly representative samples. But as one point of comparison, the East-West Center’s 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://asiamattersforamerica.org/uploads/publications/2022-Asia-Matters-for-America-Public-and-Elite-Opinion.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asia Matters for America survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. government and business elites included 1,446 respondents, or 1 for every 230,000 Americans. For 2023, the ISEAS survey appears most representative of elite opinion in Brunei, where it surveyed roughly 1 out of every 4,000 residents, and Singapore, where it surveyed roughly 1 in every 30,000. Answers for these two countries are assigned a high confidence score in this white paper. After that, the ratio of respondents to population was about 1:75,000 in Laos, 1:125,000 in Cambodia, and 1:275,000 in Malaysia. These countries’ answers are assigned medium confidence scores except in cases of extreme year-over-year volatility, which reduces some to low confidence. Answers for the remainder of countries are assigned low confidence due to the small ratio of respondents to population, which was about 1:500,000 in Myanmar and Thailand, 1:740,000 in Vietnam, 1:1,200,000 in the Philippines, and 1:2,300,000 in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amadorresearchservices.com/publications/national-security-survey-2022%3A-results-%26-findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amador Research Services poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines included 1,249 respondents, mainly from academia and the military or security services, with a much smaller number from civilian government, business, and civil society. It surveyed roughly 1 in every 90,000 residents of the Philippines, for which it is assigned a medium confidence score. By combining this with the ISEAS 2023 and 2022 surveys (the latter having surveyed 1 in every 285,000 residents, warranting a medium confidence score), it is possible to assess with high confidence whether Philippine elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program is aware of other elite opinion polling conducted in the region (e.g., the Foreign Policy Council of Indonesia’s annual ASEAN-China Survey) but none that ask comparable questions about both China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-toss-ups&quot;&gt;ASSESSING TOSS-UPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper determines public opinion on each question to be a “toss-up” if the findings are within the margin of error. Since elite polls do not have margins of error, toss-ups are assessed if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the results for the United States and China on a given question are within 5 percentage points;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;different polling questions touching on the same issue provide contradictory answers; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responses to a specific question alternate between the United States and China in consecutive years. Responses that alternate in consecutive years between one power and a toss-up are still assessed to favor that power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For trade statistics, this report relies on the UN Comtrade Database. Where discrepancies exist between reported import and export flows between the United States, China, and Southeast Asian countries, this report relies on the figures reported by Southeast Asian countries; this not only allows for a common base from which the authors can assess Washington and Beijing’s trade engagement with a country relative to its overall trade balance, but one rooted in Southeast Asian economies’ perspectives. Meanwhile, for statistics related to foreign capital investment and aid, this report relies on the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index and Southeast Asia Aid Map, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brunei&quot;&gt;Brunei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ ties to Brunei are underdeveloped, but the sultanate is a key partner in regional diplomacy and economic affairs; the 2021 Myanmar coup took place during Brunei’s chairmanship of the ASEAN, whose initial approach to the crisis was shaped by Bruneian interlocutors. In terms of economic affairs, Brunei remains forward-leaning on trade issues: It was a party to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (P4) agreement that eventually expanded into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is now a signatory to both the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and is participating in negotiations on the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g0qwJXW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Bruneian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-1&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MS1DCIC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite opinion surveys conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore suggest an ongoing shift in Bruneian views among government, business, media, and academic experts toward power dynamics in the region. When asked about a hypothetical scenario in which the region was forced to align with one of the two strategic rivals, a slim majority of Bruneian respondents in the 2023 survey, 55 percent, selected China over the United States. This is down from 64.2 percent in 2022 — but the Bruneian sample size of 53 respondents in the 2022 survey was problematically small and should be treated with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crosscutting piece of evidence, Bruneian elites in the ISEAS survey evinced more negative feelings about China than the United States. In 2023, 21.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a steep fall from the (again, to be treated skeptically) 67.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 13.3 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 50.9 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruneian elite opinion is much clearer when it comes to which power has more influence in the region. Just 13 percent of respondents in 2023 identified the United States as holding the most political and strategic influence in the region, down from 34 percent the previous year. By contrast, 45 percent of respondents identified China as the primary political and strategic power in Southeast Asia, up from 39.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS survey respondents were even more lopsided on economic issues. About 44 percent of Bruneian respondents viewed China as the most influential economic power in the region, though this is way down from 85 percent in 2022. By contrast, less than 7 percent identified the United States as the most economically influential in 2023, up from the 2 percent who said so in 2022. These sentiments accurately reflect China’s outsized role in Brunei’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Bruneian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to just 53 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-1&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN Comtrade Database, trade in goods between Brunei and the United States amounted to $230 million in 202l, or just 1 percent of Brunei’s trade volume that year. This was down from $359 million in 2019 and $373 million in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Brunei stood at $2.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the sultanate’s total trade that year. This is a sharp increase from $1.1 billion in 2019 and $1.75 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also Brunei’s most important source of foreign direct investment, according to the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index, accounting for an astounding 94 percent of the country’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. By contrast, the United States accounted for only 1 percent of all foreign capital investment into Brunei over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brunei does not currently receive Official Development Assistance (ODA) from the United States, as categorized by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. China does not provide ODA in the traditional sense but does offer loans and other assistance that may be interpreted as aid by recipient governments and publics. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Aid Map, between 2015 and 2021 China spent and committed $1.08 million in assistance to Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cambodia&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and the United States have maintained a strained, often tense relationship in the decade since Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on political opposition, independent media, and organized labor in the country. The deteriorating state of human rights and democracy in Cambodia, exemplified by opposition figure Kem Sokha’s recent sentencing to 27 years’ house arrest under spurious charges of treason and the banning of the opposition Candlelight Party ahead of national elections, complicate Washington’s efforts to forge closer ties with Phnom Penh. And while the United States should continue to emphasize human rights concerns in its engagement with Cambodia, it also should constructively engage with Cambodian leadership, not least because of the kingdom’s growing political and economic reliance on China. This reliance — and the perception that Cambodia has irrevocably aligned itself with China — masks the fact that Phnom Penh still sees significant value in enhancing ties with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Cambodian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-2&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1R67Lkc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey provides a window into the thinking of at least some Cambodian elites. Surprisingly, 73 percent of Cambodian respondents selected the United States when forced to choose between one or the other great power. This was one of the highest levels of elite support for the United States among the countries surveyed by ISEAS — and a complete reversal from 2022, when only 18.5 percent of Cambodian respondents chose the United States. Such a huge swing in opinion needs to be taken with an equally large measure of caution. Rather than signaling a radical shift in worldview within Phnom Penh’s elite circles, it seems more likely that respondents are treating the question as a barometer for their feelings about recent events, such as Hun Sen’s 2022 visit to Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 18.6 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight increase from the 17.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, among Cambodian elites in 2023, only 9.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 28.4 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other responses to the ISEAS survey were more consistent over time and therefore seem more illuminating. A meager 17.9 percent of elites surveyed in the 2023 survey identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, compared to 17.3 percent in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 72.4 and 75.3 percent of elites who identified China as the most significant political and security power in 2023 and 2022, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, 75.4 percent of Cambodian respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in Southeast Asia. This was the largest share of any country in the region and reflects Cambodia’s growing economic dependence on China. This figure represents a slight dip from 84 percent in 2022 but still far surpasses the percentage of respondents who believe the United States is the predominant economic power in the region (2.2 percent and 4.9 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 133 Cambodian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 80 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-2&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary U.S. economic weakness in Cambodia is investment — not trade, where it remains competitive. Trade in goods between Cambodia and the United States amounted to $7.8 billion in 202l, or 17 percent of Cambodia’s trade volume that year. This is a substantial increase from $4.7 billion in 2019 and $5.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Cambodia stood at $11.2 billion in 2021, or approximately 24 percent of the kingdom’s total trade. This is up from $8.6 billion in 2019 and $8.2 billion in 2020. But the directionality of Cambodia-U.S. and Cambodia-China trade is reversed. An overwhelming majority of Cambodia-U.S. trade — $7.5 billion out of $7.8 billion in 2021 — consists of Cambodian exports to the United States. By contrast, Cambodia exported just $1.5 billion in goods to China in 2021 while importing $9.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2021, U.S. foreign capital investment into Cambodia amounted to just 5 percent of the country’s inbound foreign investment. China accounted for 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $912 million and committed $1.04 billion in assistance to Cambodia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.27 billion and committed approximately $6.25 billion in assistance to Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by its longstanding “free and active” foreign policy and history of nonalignment, Indonesia has sought to maintain balance in its relations with Washington and Beijing. While the presidency of Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has seen significant developments in Sino-Indonesian cooperation, primarily due to congruity between the president’s development and infrastructure agenda and Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, Indonesia has also boosted security ties with the United States and its allies. This includes Indonesia’s participation in the Garuda Shield exercises, which expanded last year to the Super Garuda Shield, now “one of the biggest joint, multinational exercises in the Indo-Pacific region.” Yet while the Indonesian public is more inclined toward the United States than China, Indonesian strategic elites appear more divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-3&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nsXtnh1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lowy Institute’s Indonesia Poll 2021, a nationally representative survey of Indonesian public opinion, demonstrates a modest preference for the United States among the public. Only 42 percent of respondents trusted China to act responsibly in the world, a decline of 18 points since 2011, while approximately 56 percent signaled that they trust the United States, a decline of 16 points over the past decade. However, the surveys were taken 12 years apart, so there have probably been a lot of ups and downs not captured in those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has risen to the top of the Indonesian public’s threat perception, with 49 percent of respondents believing that China poses a threat to Indonesia over the next 10 years. And when asked to rank perceptions toward countries on a “feelings thermometer” scale ranging from 0 degrees (coldest feelings) to 100 degrees (warmest feelings), Indonesian respondents ranked the United States at 60 degrees and China at 53 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which country will be the leading military power in Asia in 20 years, 36 percent of Indonesians identified the United States, down from 58 percent in 2011. Just 22 percent expected China to be the region’s leading military power, largely unchanged from 25 percent in 2011. Those who lost confidence regarding the United States moved to the “don’t know/refused” category, which accounted for 36 percent of responses, up from 11 percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter of Indonesian respondents in 2021 expected the United States to be the leading economic power in Asia in 20 years, basically the same as the 23 percent who answered this way in 2011. Slightly more, 31 percent in 2021, expected China to be the leading economic power in 20 years, which is significantly less than the 52 percent in 2011. As with the question about military power, the number of Indonesians saying they don’t know which country will be the leading economic power leapt, reaching 36 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to military and economic power, the Indonesian public seems to give a slight edge to the United States and China, respectively. But a plurality in both cases is unsure. This suggests that the balance of public opinion on either question could change; in fact, it may have already in the year and a half since Lowy conducted its last poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other recent poll of Indonesian public opinion on China and the United States appears to be the 2023 Democracy Perceptions Index, conducted by Latana on behalf of the Alliance of Democracies. This online-only, artificial intelligence-driven poll is not as rigorous or representative as Lowy’s but provides useful data points. Respondents were evenly split, with 27 percent holding a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +3 percentage points. In comparison, 27 percent held a positive view of China and 22 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +5 percentage points. This difference is within the margin of error, and nearly half of respondents held a neutral view or had no opinion about each power, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-3&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EaQFdH7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opinions of the Indonesian elites surveyed by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Indonesian elite opinion with confidence. The 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that if forced to choose between major powers, only 46 percent of Indonesian respondents would side with the United States, down from 56 percent the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same Indonesian elites evinced stronger negative feelings toward China than the United States. Approximately 57.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight rise from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, 50.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” a difficult-to-explain swing from the 29.8 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 35.5 percent of surveyed elites identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, effectively unchanged from 35.1 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, 29.8 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified China as the region’s primary political and security power, a fall from the 38.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. The narrow margins and year-over-year reversal of fortunes suggest these should be treated as a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 71.1 percent of Indonesian strategic elites surveyed by ISEAS in 2023 identified China as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia (up from 67.9 percent in 2022), with only 5 percent selecting the United States (down from 8.4 percent in 2022). This is an accurate reflection of their respective levels of economic engagement in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Indonesian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 130 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-3&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Indonesia and the United States amounted to $37.1 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of Indonesia’s trade volume that year. This reflects a boost in trade flows between the United States and Indonesia, up from $27.2 billion in 2019 and $27.3 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with Indonesia, at $110 billion in 2021, was triple that of the United States and accounted for approximately 26 percent of Indonesia’s total trade. China-Indonesia trade rose sharply since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, up from $72.9 billion in 2019 and $71.4 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also lags far behind China on the investment front. Between 2012 and 2021, the United States provided foreign direct investment amounting to 8 percent of all of Indonesia’s inbound foreign investment. China more than doubled that, accounting for approximately 20 percent of inbound investment in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.89 billion and committed $1.42 billion in assistance to Indonesia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $15.1 billion and committed a whopping $18.2 billion in assistance to Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;laos&quot;&gt;Laos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Laos relations are underdeveloped, although Vientiane is an active player in both ASEAN and the latticework of Mekong-related subregional arrangements, including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership. Its proximity and economic exposure to China has led to assumptions that Laos is closely aligned with Beijing. This perception is heightened by Laos’s debt crisis, which is driven mainly by loans from China and gives Beijing enormous leverage over Vientiane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OaLxkas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Lao views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ieeXnWk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that 59 percent of Lao respondents would favor the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers. This is a significant reversal from 2022, when only 18 percent responded this way. The scale of this shift warrants skepticism, especially because the size of the Lao response pool in 2022 was problematically small and more than doubled between the two surveys. It might indicate the directionality of a shift in Lao elite feelings about China or the United States but should not be taken at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to negative perceptions, 16.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a significant drop from the 40.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 5.6 percent of Lao respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 50 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 13.1 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, a slight increase from 9.1 in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 30.8 percent of respondents who believed that China is the most important political and security power, a steep decline from the 75 percent who responded this way in 2022. This nearly 45-point swing warrants caution, but the gap between the responses for China and the United States remains large enough to say with some confidence that Lao elites view China as the predominant strategic power in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 20.6 percent of Lao respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, an immense drop from 86 percent in 2022. The enormity of this change is highly suspicious, especially given China’s continued economic dominance in Laos. Rather than an honest assessment of China’s economic power, respondents may have been signaling their growing unease with the degree of Vientiane’s dependency on Beijing amid the debt crisis. In terms of Lao views of U.S. economic influence, only 5.6 percent of respondents believed that the United States is the region’s predominant economic power, up slightly from 4.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 107 Lao individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 43 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-4&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Laos and the United States amounted to only $334 million in 2021, or 3 percent of Laos’s trade volume that year. This is a significant improvement from $108 million in 2019 and $155 million in 2020. But it is less than a tenth of China’s trade with Laos, which stood at $3.6 billion, or 27 percent of Laos’s total trade, in 2021. Trade volume between China and Laos that year narrowly exceeded its 2019 total of $3.4 billion after having fallen to $2.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is nearly as dominant on the investment front. It accounted for 25 percent of Laos’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. The United States provided only 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $366 million and committed $427 million in assistance to Laos between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $6.48 billion and committed $8.08 billion in assistance to Laos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;malaysia&quot;&gt;Malaysia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Malaysia cooperation remains robust, but domestic political instability and successive changes in government have impaired Washington’s ability to forge deeper ties with Putrajaya. Defense cooperation has become routinized, including through the Keris Strike and Bersama Warrior exercises, and economic cooperation remains a key area of opportunity, including through Malaysia’s participation in IPEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PmH6FTR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although views toward China have declined worldwide, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Malaysian public generally favors China over the United States. Approximately 60 percent of Malaysian respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 44 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. And 62 percent of Malaysian respondents trusted Xi Jinping to “do the right thing regarding world affairs,” compared to 53 percent for Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Merdeka Center’s 2022 survey of Malaysian public opinion toward China found that approximately 39 percent of respondents viewed China favorably, compared to 45 percent with a neutral impression of China, and just 12 percent with a negative impression. Moreover, approximately 70 percent of respondents perceived the current relationship between China and Malaysia to be “good,” a slight increase from the 67 percent who responded this way in 2016. The Merdeka Center has not conducted recent public opinion polling of Malaysian attitudes toward the United States, but these results provide greater confidence in Pew’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Malaysians were more evenly split. This poll found that 37 percent of Malaysian respondents held a positive view of the United States and 25 percent held a negative view, for a net approval of +11 percentage points. By comparison, 39 percent held a positive view of China and 26 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +14 percentage points. The difference is within the poll’s margin of error, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AUEzl6k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 54.8 percent of Malaysian strategic elites selected China and 45.2 percent selected the United States. This is an inversion of 2022, when 43 percent selected China and 57 percent selected the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does moderately better when it comes to negative perceptions. Approximately 48.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight decrease from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, 38.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 34.1 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slim plurality of Malaysian respondents in 2023, 35.5 percent, believed that China is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, while 33.9 percent believed the same for the United States. This represents a decline for China from 51.1 percent in 2022 and an increase for the United States from 24.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 65.3 percent of Malaysian respondents believed China is the predominant economic power in the region, down from 72.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, just 13.7 percent of respondents believed the United States is the primary economic power in Southeast Asia, up slightly from 11.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 124 Malaysian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 135 Malaysian respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-5&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China nearly doubles the United States in both trade and investment flows in Malaysia. Trade in goods between Malaysia and the United States amounted to $52.4 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Malaysia’s total trade volume that year. This reflects a general upward trend in recent years, with trade up from $39.9 billion in 2019 and $42.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Malaysia stood at $101.6 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Malaysia’s total trade that year. That is a substantial increase from $76.4 billion in 2019 and $78.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of foreign direct investment, the United States accounted for approximately 15 percent of Malaysia’s inbound foreign investment between 2012 and 2021, while China accounted for 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $57.7 million and committed $79.1 million in assistance to Malaysia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.96 billion and committed $17.1 billion in assistance to Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myanmar&quot;&gt;Myanmar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. ties with the military junta in Myanmar have been all but nonexistent since the February 2021 coup. The United States has frequent informal engagements with the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) but limited contact with the various ethnic armed organizations and Peoples’ Defense Forces that make up the bulk of the country’s resistance forces. The junta has turned toward China — along with India, Russia, and a few others — in the face of isolation by the wider international community. China also maintains informal contacts with the NUG and some ethnic armed organizations, though probably with limited ability to reverse widespread anti-China narratives among the opposition. These shifts mean that the generals in Naypyidaw have shifted decisively toward Beijing, while most of the opposition likely prefers the United States. But given the civil war, these assumptions are impossible to test rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CRRzMxu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any rigorous public opinion polling of Myanmar views on the United States and China either before or since the coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-6&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YtKzzvJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most elites polled by ISEAS in 2022 and 2023 were likely to have been either part of the civilian government ousted in 2021 or affiliated with media, academia, business, and nongovernmental organizations sympathetic to the opposition. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Myanmar elite opinion with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 67.8 percent of Myanmar respondents selected the United States, a fall from 92 percent in 2022. On this and all other Myanmar responses to the ISEAS survey, the opinions of broadly defined “elites” are likely very different from those of the narrower band of military, government, and business elites running the current junta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, about 80 percent of these respondents said they had little to no confidence, a slight decline from the 88.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, approximately 30.5 percent of respondents stated that they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 11.5 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in terms of political and strategic significance, approximately 49.6 percent of Myanmar respondents believed the United States is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, up from 19.7 percent in 2022. This compares to 40 percent who believed China is the primary power, a precipitous drop from 70.9 percent in 2022. These huge swings seem to reflect a significant shift in the kinds of elites ISEAS surveyed. The Myanmar sample size in 2023 was less than a third of 2022’s, and it had a much larger proportion of businesspeople — 29 percent compared to just 3 percent — and a much smaller proportion of self-identified government officials — 26 percent compared to 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given the scale of China’s economic engagement in Myanmar, 72 percent of respondents to the 2023 ISEAS survey identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, compared to only 14 percent for the United States. By contrast, in the 2022 ISEAS report, 83.4 percent of respondents selected China as the region’s primary economic power, with only 6 percent selecting the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 115 Myanmar individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 350 Myanmar respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-6&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to $799 million in 2021, or less than 3 percent of Myanmar’s trade volume that year. This figure is reflective of the overall collapse of U.S. engagement and the country’s economic tailspin since the coup. But trade flows were not that much larger before the coup — $1.2 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Myanmar, by contrast, stood at $8.7 billion in 2021, or 29 percent of Myanmar’s total trade that year. This is a marked decline from $12.2 billion in 2019 and $11.9 billion in 2020 but shows that the junta remains reliant on China amid international isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with trade, China was a much larger investor in Myanmar before the coup and remains one today. Over the past 10 years, the United States has accounted for less than 4 percent of foreign direct investment into Myanmar, while China has accounted for more than 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.18 billion and committed $1.41 billion in assistance to Myanmar between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.23 billion and committed $10.9 billion in assistance to Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philippines&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the United States’ Southeast Asian partners, the Philippines has received the most time and attention from Washington under the Biden administration. Political and security cooperation with the United States has grown during the first year of the Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. government, resulting in the recent expansion of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, as well as more serious thinking in Manila on how to better network with the broader web of U.S. alliances in the region. Major shifts in U.S.-Philippines relations reflect not only longstanding support for the alliance among strategic elites and the public, but also growing anxieties about China and its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-7&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ncWkfWv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public opinion polling conducted by PulseAsia in June 2022 found that 89 percent of respondents evinced either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of trust in the United States. This represents an upward shift of 5 percentage points from the last time Pulse Asia conducted this survey in September 2019. By contrast, only 33 percent of respondents expressed trust in China, a slight increase from 25 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are largely consistent with public opinion polling conducted in December 2022 by Social Weather Stations (SWS). The SWS survey found that the Filipino public broadly trusts the United States, which holds a net trust score of +74 percentage points, calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents selecting “little trust” from the percentage selecting “much trust.” These results mirror SWS’s past findings, with the United States not having dipped below +55 net percentage points since the start of the Benigno Aquino III administration in 2010. By contrast, China’s net trust score was -6 percentage points, a slight rise from recent years but still significantly lower than that of other regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results in turn echo surveys conducted by Pew on Filipino attitudes toward the United States and China. Pew’s 2019 Global Attitudes Survey, the last to ask Filipinos about their opinions and which surveyed 1,035 Filipinos from May–June 2019, found that 80 percent of Filipino respondents held a favorable opinion of the United States, compared to the 42 percent who held a favorable opinion of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Democracy Perception Index found a similar preference for the United States among Filipino respondents. In that poll, 67 percent of Filipinos held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent negative, for a net approval of +61 percentage points. In contrast, 31 percent each held positive and negative views of China, for a net approval of 0 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a survey of 500 Filipino respondents representative of the online population in the Philippines, approximately 81.6 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to the 18.4 percent who held a negative view. This stands in stark contrast to the 30.2 percent of Filipino respondents who held a positive view of China and the 69.8 percent of respondents who held a negative view. Approximately 64 percent of respondents who held negative views of China attribute this sentiment to Beijing’s military destabilization of the region. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Philippine military cooperation, 85 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 33.5 percent of respondents who believed that China-Philippines military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 49 percent of Filipino respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 22 percent of respondents who selected China. While a plurality of Filipino respondents selected ASEAN as the region’s predominant economic power, approximately 24 percent of respondents selected the United States, while roughly 20 percent selected China, assessed here as a “toss-up.” The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 10.3 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Filipino respondents, compared to 6.4 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CvxSrZo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite polling by ISEAS in the Philippines provides useful data points, but the sample size involved in 2023 is not sufficient to assess Filipino elite opinion with confidence. Comparing its findings to other elite surveys with larger sample sizes, however, allows a confident assessment of the topline question of whether Filipino elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China. When forced to choose between the two in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 78.8 percent of Filipino respondents selected the United States, a slight fall from 83.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, approximately 62.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence, a drop from the 82 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, among Filipino elites in 2023, only 20.2 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” roughly on par with the 22 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey of approximately 1,200 Filipino strategic elites — including policy experts, uniformed personnel, and academics — conducted by Amador Research Services in November and December 2022 provides greater confidence to the finding that Filipino elites prefer the United States to China. Asked with which countries the Philippines should strengthen partnerships, 69 percent of respondents said the United States, compared to just 39 percent for China. This survey represents a much larger number of elites but is more heavily weighted toward academia (44 percent of respondents) and the military (38 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plurality of Filipino respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 44.4 percent, identified the United States as the primary political and strategic power in the region, down slightly from 51 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, about 30.3 percent of respondents believed China is the predominant strategic power in the region, down from 37 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a plurality of 36.4 percent of Filipino respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a significant drop from the 65.8 percent who answered this way in 2022. The size of this swing should be treated with a high degree of skepticism, especially because the number of Filipino respondents to the ISEAS survey plummeted by more than 75 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 99 Filipino individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 400 Filipino respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-7&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between the Philippines and the United States amounted to $20.1 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of the Philippines’ trade volume. This represents a return to pre–Covid-19 levels, which stood at $20.1 billion in 2019 before dipping to $17.4 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with the Philippines is nearly double that of the United States. It reached $39.7 billion, or about 20 percent of the Philippines’ total trade, in 2021. This surpasses the $36.6 billion in bilateral trade in 2019, after which there was a sharp drop to $31.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is more competitive with China on foreign direct investment in the Philippines than in most of the rest of the region, though it still lags. The United States provided 15 percent of the Philippines’ inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, compared to 22 percent provided by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.40 billion and committed $1.27 billion in assistance to the Philippines between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent only $262 million in assistance to the Philippines, a figure that pales against the $6.28 billion it committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a formal treaty ally, Singapore is of critical importance to U.S. interests in the region. The city-state’s longstanding defense partnership with Washington is vital to U.S. forward presence, providing access, basing, and overflight privileges. Singapore has also played a leading role in shaping the region’s economic architecture, exemplified by its participation in the CPTPP and IPEF, in addition to its efforts to forge a web of digital economy agreements with partners worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-8&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rm9WE0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While views toward China have slumped in much of the world, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Singaporean public favors China over the United States. Approximately 67 percent of Singaporean respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 51 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. These findings are largely consistent with Pew’s data from 2021, in which approximately 64 percent of respondents held favorable views toward China and 51 percent held favorable views toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Pew Global Attitudes Survey also asked Singaporean respondents with which country it is most important for the city-state to have close economic relations. Respondents chose China more often than the United States (49 and 33 percent, respectively). Given the context, it is reasonable to treat this as analogous to asking which country Singaporeans see as the leading economic power now and in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Singaporean respondents were more evenly split, but still favored China slightly. This survey found that 44 percent of Singaporeans held a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +20 percentage points. A slightly higher 49 percent held a positive view of China and 20 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +29 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a nationally representative survey of 500 Singaporean respondents, approximately 47.8 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to 52.2 percent who held a negative view. This falls short of the 55.7 percent of Singaporean respondents who held a positive view of China and the 44.3 percent of respondents who held a negative view. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Singapore military cooperation, 81.7 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 71.9 percent of respondents who believed that China-Singapore military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 42 percent of Singaporean respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 38 percent of respondents who selected China. Moreover, some 52 percent of Singaporean respondents also hold the view that China is the most influential economic power in Asia. The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 7.7 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Singaporean respondents, compared to 7.9 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gpfMAmz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singaporean elite opinion as reflected by the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey is markedly different than that of the public. Considering that ISEAS is a Singapore-based institute, its elite network in the city-state is probably its most robust, and the answers for Singapore therefore the most representative of any country in its dataset. About 61 percent of Singaporean respondents favored the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers, though this is down from 77.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, 56.3 percent said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, compared to the 69.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, only 38.5 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 31.1 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of political and strategic importance, 33.2 percent of Singaporean respondents viewed China as the region’s primary political and strategic power, down from 48.2 percent in 2022. Approximately 48.1 percent of Singaporean respondents selected the United States as the region’s primary political and strategic power, up slightly from 46.8 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their neighbors, most Singaporean elites view China as the primary economic power in Asia, with 70.7 percent of respondents to the State of Southeast Asia saying as much in 2023, down from 81.1 percent in 2022. This is in stark contrast to the mere 13.5 percent who selected the United States as the primary economic power in Asia, up slightly from 12.2 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 208 Singaporean individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 222 Singaporean respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-8&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains more competitive when it comes to trade with Singapore than it is in most of the region, but the gap is widening. U.S.-Singapore trade amounted to $79.8 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of the city-state’s total trade volume that year. That was largely unchanged from $78.3 billion in 2019 and $75.4 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Singapore stood at $122.3 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the city-state’s total. That was up substantially from $100.7 billion in 2019 and $98.7 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States maintains a sizeable advantage when it comes to investment in Singapore, providing 27 percent of the country’s inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years. China provided just 11 percent during this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore does not currently receive ODA from the United States as categorized by the OECD, nor does it seem to receive anything that might be considered aid from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thailand&quot;&gt;Thailand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Thailand is one of the United States’ five Indo-Pacific allies, the U.S.-Thailand relationship has stagnated in recent years, partially due to ongoing political instability following Thailand’s 2014 coup. Although cooperation at the operational level remains robust, Thailand receives less attention from the Biden administration than non-allies such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yfUGr4K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Thai views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence for reasons explored in the methodology section. The 2023 survey found that 49 percent of Thai respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 9 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +40 percentage points. By comparison, 49 percent held a positive view of China versus 18 percent negative, for a net approval of +22 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Thai elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Thai elite opinion with confidence. A narrow majority of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll, approximately 57 percent, picked the United States in a hypothetical scenario in which the region were forced to choose sides between the two powers, which is unchanged from 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 56.9 percent of Thai respondents said they had little to no confidence, up from 47.9 percent in 2022. In contrast, 34.7 percent of respondents in 2023 had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 26.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 45.8 percent of Thai respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 55.6 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 36.1 percent selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, though this is up from 27.4 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 74 percent of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight rise from 69.2 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 9 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 13.7 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 114 Thai elites responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 91 Thai respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-9&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Thailand and the United States amounted to $55.8 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Thailand’s trade volume that year. This was up from $45.8 billion in 2019 and $49.5 billion in 2020. China’s goods trade with Thailand was nearly twice as large, at $103 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Thailand’s total trade and nearly a quarter of its imports. This was up substantially from $73.9 billion in 2019 and $79.6 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the larger investor in Thailand by a narrow margin. It provided over 13 percent of Thailand’s inbound foreign direct investment in the past decade, during which China accounted for approximately 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $374 million and committed $473 million in assistance to Thailand between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.27 billion and committed $21.6 billion in assistance to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has been a focal point of U.S. diplomatic engagement during the Biden administration. Its status as a claimant in the South China Sea disputes and the harassment the country regularly faces at the hands of the China Coast Guard and its maritime militia have led Hanoi to take incremental steps to boost security cooperation with the United States. And Vietnam’s emergence as a hub for high-end manufacturing makes it an attractive destination for companies seeking to diversify away from reliance on China, meaning Hanoi will inevitably play a key role in the region’s increasingly complex economic architecture, including the Biden administration’s IPEF. While Vietnam maintains strong ties with China, particularly at the party level, historic animosity and current tensions limit the level of influence Beijing has over Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hx7oC7O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Vietnamese views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence. The 2023 survey found that 70 percent of Vietnamese respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +65 percentage points. Meanwhile, 35 percent held a positive view of China, compared to 25 percent negative, for a net approval of +12 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This echoes the older but more rigorous findings of the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, in which Pew found that about 80 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China’s power and influence as a major threat to global peace and security, while only 21 percent said the same of the United States. This far surpassed the second most identified threat, climate change, which was selected by 61 percent of Vietnamese respondents. Vietnam was the only country polled in which China was identified as the top global threat, suggesting a unique and deep-seated antipathy. But without more recent polling, the Vietnamese public’s preference for the United States over China can only be assessed with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fbSXwAz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Vietnamese elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Vietnamese elite opinion with confidence. When forced to choose between the two major powers in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 77.9 percent of Vietnamese respondents selected the United States, an increase from 73.6 in 2022. This was second only to respondents from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 78.7 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence, up from the 64.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, only 19.8 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 12.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 55.2 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, up slightly from 52.8 percent in 2022. Only 27.2 percent of respondents in 2023 selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 32.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 69 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, down slightly from 71.5 percent in 2022. Only 9.6 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 16.7 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 136 Vietnamese individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 112 Vietnamese respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-10&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Vietnam and the United States amounted to $111.5 billion in 2021, or approximately 17 percent of Vietnam’s trade volume that year. These trade flows are growing rapidly, up from $75.8 billion in 2019 and $90.8 billion in 2020. But they are also imbalanced, consisting of $96.3 billion of goods flowing from Vietnam to the United States, or 29 percent of Vietnam’s total exports, and $15.2 billion flowing the other direction, less than 5 percent of Vietnam’s imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade with Vietnam stood at $165.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 25 percent of the country’s total trade that year. It is not outpacing the United States in Vietnam as badly as it does in most of the region, but this trade is also growing rapidly, up from $117 billion in 2019 and $133 billion in 2020. And it is imbalanced in the other direction, with $55.9 billion in Vietnamese exports to China in 2021, accounting for 17 percent of Vietnam’s total export volume, and $109.9 billion in Chinese imports, or 33 percent of Vietnam’s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two great powers are on par with each other when it comes to investment in Vietnam. Over the past decade, the United States was the source of approximately 7 percent of Vietnam’s inbound foreign direct investment, while China accounted for approximately 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $896 million and committed $1.10 billion in assistance to Vietnam between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.37 billion and committed $7.29 billion in assistance to Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia resides at the forefront of U.S.-China competition. The region has significant leverage to shape those relations, but country-by-country variance in Southeast Asian perspectives toward the United States and China helps explain why regional institutions such as ASEAN struggle to navigate great power rivalry. This variance also carries important implications for whether Washington and Beijing can successfully carry out their agendas. The one who is more responsive to intra-regional differences is likely to find more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available polling indicates that the United States enjoys more soft power and popularity than China across most of the region. Even with major gaps in public polling, majorities in the most populous states — Indonesia, and especially the Philippines and Vietnam — prefer the United States to China. Whether that is still true of most elites in Southeast Asia is unclear. In any case, the overall preference for the United States among regional publics is a significant advantage for Washington as it endeavors to coax governments into aligning with it on a range of issues, or at least keep regional states from aligning with China on issues that would damage U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft power and popularity matter, but so do perceptions of hard power and the ability to deliver concrete benefits. Elites and publics in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines, see China as the predominant economic power in Asia. Most of their counterparts in places where the data is lacking probably do too. And the reality is that on most metrics, China is widening the economic influence gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Indonesian and Philippine publics still views the United States as the leading strategic power in the region, but who knows whether their counterparts in the rest of Southeast Asia agree. The same is true of most elites. Other than in Singapore, it is unclear whether elites among the United States’ most important Southeast Asian allies and partners — Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam — still see it as the predominant strategic power in Asia. This would accurately reflect the United States’ still considerable military advantages, as detailed for instance by the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index. But perceptions do not always match reality; more polling is needed on this front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington needs to be more attuned to how individual countries perceive their relations with the United States and China and shape its levers of engagement accordingly. Growing concern regarding China’s behavior and intentions create diplomatic and economic openings across the region, and Washington should advance a positive political, security, and economic agenda to meet the moment. One component should be an expansion of public and elite opinion polling in Southeast Asia so the United States can better understand how it is being perceived, target initiatives where they can have the greatest impact, and judge year-over-year progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱發起「墨落無悔」為展抗爭意志 聲明無約束力亦非協調會議共識&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱不信「35+」、惟有「政棍」明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZBBPqXG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成今就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，表示戴耀廷2020年6月9日記者會宣布參選人毋須簽文件以免製造「DQ紅書」，是他和張可森、梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，他質疑戴做法「有冇咁兒戲」、是「退縮」表現，望透過聲明展現抗爭意志、防範初選落敗者繼續參選，而參選人是自願簽署，自行承擔DQ風險。鄒又指，「墨落」並無約束力，如簽署者反悔發起人「咩都做唔到」，但聲明面向公眾，故如違承諾「要接受問責嘅對象都係選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落聲明」的結構是由他制定，再由張可森草擬，當中談及會運用否決權的字句是來自戴耀廷在新東協調會議上的說法。惟鄒強調，該點雖會上有討論，但無達成共識、亦非初選協調會議共識，而參選人簽署「墨落」後，是就「墨落」所寫聲明形成表面共識，但無提倡無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件-為他與張可森梁晃維發起墨落無悔導火線&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件 為他與張可森梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」導火線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新界東的鄒家成今繼續作供，步入法庭後向旁聽席微笑揮手。鄒在大律師陳世傑主問下表示，無收過「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件。法官李運騰關注文件提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，問新東是否有協議使用「會運用」，鄒不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就「墨落無悔」發問，鄒家成表示，理解戴耀廷6月9日記者會表示毋須參選人簽文件，因不想製造一個「DQ紅書」予藉口行政機關DQ候選人，而「我認為6月9號個記招，係一條導火線，令到我同埋另外兩位，即係張可森同埋梁晃維，發起『墨落無悔』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定有冇咁兒戲係一個退縮&quot;&gt;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定「有冇咁兒戲」、「係一個退縮」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他約於6月10日中午才從網媒得知戴耀廷曾於6月9日召記者會，當時他有兩個想法，首先戴在協調會上一直表示，能達成共識的項目「會變成一份文件畀參選人簽署」，亦是他接收到的訊息，但戴在無通知過參選人的情況下，突然開記招指不需要簽署文件，「我就覺得：有冇咁兒戲呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，其次是戴耀廷稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，但鄒認為據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線應是「主張香港獨立」，但協調會上無討論與港獨有關，「所以我唔明驚啲乜嘢」。鄒並指，「如果係因為一啲消息人士去施壓又好、定唔知點樣啦，而選擇突然宣布唔需要簽署文件呢，係一個退縮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維-表示要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維 表示「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續指當時約為下午3時，「我記得我係先同張可森聯絡」，分享上述想法，張有看記招亦同意其想法，鄒續指「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」，張同意；鄒其後再聯絡梁晃維說相同的話，梁也同意，三人遂開設一個 Telegram 群組討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EQlFcM5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何鄒家成會聯絡參選新界西的張可森，鄒指他大概4月時已認識張可森和參選港島的梁晃維，「我哋見過面、傾過偈，覺得幾啱傾」；至於為何要找其他區的參選人，「其實冇諗咁多嘅嗰一刻」。鄒並同意法官陳仲衡指，他是為整個初選、而非只是其選區做一些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力-如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力 如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，三人很快決定要發起一個網絡聲明，主要有三個目的：一，向公眾展現抗爭意志；二，防範其他人初選落敗都繼續參加官方選舉；三，「呢份聲明係比大家自願去簽嘅，咁就由得其他參選人自行去承擔返可能會被DQ嘅風險」，這亦是回應戴耀廷6月9日記招的擔憂。陳世傑問，該聲明是一份聲明抑或協議？鄒答「佢只係一個聲明」，如人們同意就可選擇簽署，他一度指「情況類似民建聯喺街頭搞一個簽名活動咁樣」，惟法官指不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落無悔」是一份「無約束力」的聲明，「事實上佢簽完『墨落無悔』，佢最後係反悔嘅話，其實我哋三位發起人，咩都做唔到。」法官陳仲衡指，但聲明提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒同意，指「墨落」是一份「面向公眾」的聲明，「如果參選人違反承諾，佢要接受問責嘅對象都係選民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後-由張可森執筆起草&quot;&gt;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後 由張可森執筆起草&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」的草擬過程，鄒家成解釋「負責執筆起草嗰個，係張可森」，而張正式草擬前三人曾討論了約一小時，張約於4時開始「閉門草擬」，草擬途中遇到問題也會再問，最終他們6時半左右收到初稿，三人修改一次後，接近8時完成最終版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，3人一早決定晚上9時發文，並於8至9時期間嘗試分別私下將「墨落」的最終版本發給他們認識的參選人。鄒解釋，此做法一來「純粹禮貌上，早少少通知我哋認識嘅參選人」，二來亦因「正式出街嗰一刻，我哋都想多返少少人名喺呢度，唔係淨係得我哋三個」，而他們只是通知而非諮詢他們意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發布墨落前曾各自通知非同區參選人&quot;&gt;鄒稱發布「墨落」前曾各自通知非同區參選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他只曾將聲明發給黃子悅，解釋「只係因為我電話有佢 number 啫，冇咩特別」，他並不知道張和梁分別私下發給誰。鄒並指當時向黃指聲明於9時會「正式出街」，問黃有否興趣簽署，黃說「好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何參選新東的鄒，會聯絡參選新西的黃子悅，問鄒沒有其他新東候選人的聯絡電話嗎？鄒指，三人事前已表示不想將聲明私下發給同區參選人，「因為始終覺得好似係同區嘅競爭者，咁就唔想好似私底下 send 畀你好似教你點樣選舉咁樣」，形容是「刻意安排」。鄒並指就其他新東參選人，「如果我話係咪要搵佢哋搵唔到呢，唔係」，但當時無特意將新東參選人加入電話簿。鄒並在法官追問下指，三人就聯絡其他人沒有分工，「只係避免 send 畀自己同區。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，不記得張可森和梁晃維聯絡了什麼人，而他們各自聯絡參選人後將收集到的名字整合，並於9時一起在 Facebook 發布，但聲明發布時有多少名字他「真係唔記得」，不過連同三人在內「應該係10個內」。鄒亦指沒有指示過其他人要在自己 Facebook 發布，供他們自行考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒供述簽署流程-包括在google-doc加名及聯絡發起人&quot;&gt;鄒供述簽署流程 包括在Google Doc加名及聯絡發起人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」加名的方法，鄒家成解釋，當時「反應都叫做幾踴躍，啲名都好亂」，故他於6月10日晚或11日早上曾開設一個所有人都可以編輯的「Google doc」檔案，讓自己整理名單，而張可森和梁晃維有向其他人私下發布該文件的連結，他亦會「隨緣」在 Facebook 看有沒有人發布聲明，並更新「Google Doc」的名單，間中就會按名單編輯 Facebook 的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，為何聲明最底有「*如希望參與聯署，請聯絡鄒家成/張可森/梁晃維」一句，鄒答：「咁搞得一個公開嘅聲明，都叫做打開門做生意，咁就梗係想越多人簽越好啦，因為個目的係要展現抗爭意志啊嘛。」鄒同意，除上述兩方法，亦可透過聯絡發起人簽署，當時亦有人私下 Facebook inbox 他表示想加名，但並非參加初選的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落是以五區為基礎的聲明-曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」是以五區為基礎的聲明 曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「墨落無悔」的內容，鄒家成表明「『墨落無悔』個結構，係我制定嘅」，即包括第一至四段和兩點聲明，但不包括第五段。鄒其後就聲明內容解釋，就「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，鄒稱是指五個地區的初選協調會議，「『墨落無悔』係一份以五區作為基礎嘅聲明。」至於「共同綱領」，鄒指是五區協調會議上的「議程（agenda）」，即協調會議上「所有傾過嘅項目」，但不一定有取得共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，聲明發起人只來自3個選區，他們如何得知其他區都有討論同樣的綱領？鄒指三人有各自分享自己區協調會議的情況，而九西的資訊由張可森提供，但不知道他聯絡誰，而張可森或梁晃維亦有告知他九東的資訊，但他不記得是誰說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點-惟亦有未達共識項目存差異&quot;&gt;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點 惟亦有未達共識項目、存「差異」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問協調會議達成什麼共識，鄒指有4點：辦初選、辦初選論壇、以靈童制為替補機制、及「贏咗有得選、輸咗冇得選」。法官陳慶偉問，最後一點即與「墨落」的第二點聲明「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一樣？鄒指「唔完全一樣」，指前者是「棄選機制」其中一個分支，另一分支是目標議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就聲明「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」一句提到的「差異」，鄒解釋「喺初選協調會議上面，大家係有啲爭拗嘅」，可理解為在討論「墨落無悔」一刻「暫時未有共識嘅項目」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱兩點聲明為焦點所在引張可森稱畫龍點睛處在向選民交代&quot;&gt;鄒稱兩點聲明為「焦點所在」、引張可森稱「畫龍點睛」處在向選民交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句，鄒解釋是一個「過渡句」，「根據張可森嘅講法，佢係話想產生一種承上啟下，同埋畫龍點睛嘅作用」，林卓廷、陳志全和施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，是否即想令讀者注意到該句之後出現的兩點聲明為重點？鄒同意，亦同意因此聲明標題為「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」。鄒並指，該兩點「當然係聲明嘅焦點所在」、「當然係聲明嘅重點」，而據張可森的說法，「嗰個畫龍點睛嘅精要之處，在於向選民交代。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若協調會議的共識只是鄒家成所說的4點，究竟有什麼爭議（controversial）令戴耀廷不想人簽署有該些共識的文件？並笑指戴也宣布了會有初選、之後也會有論壇直播、「贏咗有得選」亦是協調根本概念，該4點有什麼如此秘密（secretive）或具爭議性，令戴不想簽文件？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成回應，看到6月9日記招後「的確係有少少詫異嘅」，他亦不清楚各區達成了什麼共識。但就「墨落」第一點聲明：「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」，他指並非共識，舉例戴在新東會議只表達他個人對五大訴求的看法，但並非大家「真係 round 一圈」去討論的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子-自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬墨落&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子 自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬「墨落」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，就「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」這一部分字眼，「係我喺 Telegram 打（字）畀張可森嘅」；至於之後「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」的部分，他則不知道，應是張自己寫，但他們曾討論五大訴求的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續展示新界西的協議文件，指會運用否決權一句與「墨落」幾乎一樣。鄒同意兩者有相似之處，並解釋戴耀廷有在第二次協調會議讀出該句。法官關注李運騰是從文件讀出、抑或是憑記憶讀出，惟鄒沒有正面回應，並指不記得當時有否抄低整句句子，但該句在協調會議有重複數次，他是「憑記憶打返出嚟畀張可森去寫呢句嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件-稱與墨落字句一致問是否巧合&quot;&gt;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件 稱與「墨落」字句一致、問是否巧合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑着問，會上重複的次數足以令他記清楚該句？鄒說「其實呢句好好記㗎」，後答「係」。李亦問，因此該段其實是受戴耀廷影響，即鄒是跟隨戴的說法？鄒指戴耀廷讀出該句時有提到「積極」，但他就根據新東爭拗改為「會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再要求展示新東協議文件，用字為「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，問「墨落」出現相似句子，是否只是巧合？鄒重申「墨落」用「會運用」是他在第二次新東協調會議的動議，因此「未必稱得上為巧合，而係嚟自我嘅經驗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落聲明起源並非共識簽署後是就墨落聲明形成共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」聲明起源並非共識、簽署後是就「墨落」聲明形成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，因此鄒家成是將一些並無達成共識的內容放進聲明？鄒說「我的確係想推銷聲明裡面第一點」，重申目的是聲明所列「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指但那會減低彈性，因戴耀廷曾稱加入「積極」是為保留彈性。鄒指戴無特別提「係唔係想保持彈性」，只提到意思是「可以否決、可以唔否決」。李指那正是彈性，鄒即說：「可以否決可以唔否決嘅話，咁我唔知寫嚟做乜嘢。」李運騰笑指他同意，並指因此鄒是想展示抗爭意志，望用最清楚的寫法，避免模棱兩可？鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒再同意，就運用否決權的第一點聲明會上有討論，但沒有達成共識，強調「墨落無悔」聲明起源並非來自共識，「當有人同意兩點聲明，佢簽署之後，我哋就會形成一個表面上嘅共識，就係有某一個數量嘅人同意呢兩點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落無悔向組織者施壓重申無提倡無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落無悔」向組織者施壓、重申無提倡無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，而鄒是想將聲明通知組織者？李運騰亦問，鄒是想透過聲明的簽署人數，向組織者施壓？鄒不同意，並同意李運騰指聲明是面向公眾，無意向組織者施壓。不過鄒亦同意，之後曾將聲明及簽署人數發給組織者，陳問是想讓組織者知道情況？鄒說「呢個係之後嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒早前供稱，會以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視預算案，他今同意認為議員的責任是爭取五大訴求，而以五大訴求為審視預算案的基礎，亦是恰當履行議員職責。鄒亦指，他在「墨落」並無提倡無差別否決預算案，亦對簽署者沒有任何約束性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示與發起「墨落無悔」聲明的張可森和梁晃維均不相信「35+」，而初選意義是選出最多具抗爭意志代議士，「墨落」與「35+」無關，只是將參選人政治理念帶到選民面前，展示抗爭意志。鄒又提及，有三類人表面主張35+有可能，包括明知35+不可能但仍「販賣假希望」的「政棍」、覺得35+有可能的天真理想主義者、及覺得35+無可能，但有政治勇氣和承擔望讓全世界知道，無論如何努力「當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又表示，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民要求戴耀廷勿要大家簽文件，認為戴稱毋須簽文件是來自傳統泛民意思；而他直至收到審訊文件夾前無聽過「攬炒十步」，並理解「攬炒」為「側重於自我犧牲」的態度，從不是禁忌，反而很常見，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，而攬炒目的是拉近雙方政治勢力，為和談帶來可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落並無以35作為前提遵守棄選機制不代表能取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」並無以「35+」作為前提、遵守棄選機制不代表能取「35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，他今早供稱發起聲明為展示抗爭意志，惟並無約束力。鄒下午被問及聲明與「35+」的關係，他同意「35+計劃」目的是取得立會過半，但「墨落無悔」並沒有以「35+」作為前提。法官陳仲衡指，但就聲明支持度不足須停止選舉工程的一點，與「35+計劃」很有關。鄒不同意有很大關係，指棄選機制概念的確來自「35+計劃」，但參選人遵守不代表會取得「35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，「墨落」的主要目的是「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」，法官李運騰即質疑，棄選機制與「抗爭意志」無關。鄒承認兩者的確無直接關係，放在聲明是因認為這是初選的「基本邏輯」，以保障出線者勝出的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發起人俱不信35選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&quot;&gt;鄒稱發起人俱不信「35+」、選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到鄒將「35+計劃」和「初選」進行區分，鄒同意，並同意初選是「35+計劃」的一部分，而35+計劃「只係一個名嚟㗎啫」，「35+」代表議席的目標、亦是組織者想達到的目標，但這不是他的目標，並強調「個議席目標點樣決定，唔會影響到初選個意義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑續問，那初選是否用來達到「35+」的手段？鄒指「個人認為唔係」，指「選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士，先係（初選）最大嘅意義」，同意其看法與組織者不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭惟不知其他簽署者動機&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭、惟不知其他簽署者動機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，因此無論「35+」或「35-」，對鄒家成來說也是沒有分別，他仍然會繼續發起「墨落無悔」？鄒回應，「基本上我哋三位發起人，都唔相信35+」，而正因他們對未來議會想像都是「35-」，在此前提下，他們認為選出最多具備抗爭意志的代議士才是比較「合情合理」和「實際可行」，並覺得要用一些方法向選民展現抗爭意志，「將參選人嘅政治理念，帶去選民面前競爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑言，而結果是差不多所有人都有簽署聲明。鄒續指，「墨落」是初選競選時其中一個有爭拗的議題，「其他簽署人簽嘅動機係咩，我的確唔知」，「我哋三個做嘅嘢就係提供一個聲明畀大家去簽署，佢哋點樣用呢個聲明，我哋亦都唔知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱表面對35積極有三類人-包括明知不可能仍販賣假希望&quot;&gt;鄒稱表面對35+積極有三類人 包括明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後在法官追問下重申，以他對張可森和梁晃維的認識，他們3人均不相信「35+」。李運騰笑言，似乎有很多參與者均不相信35+，那鄒協調會上聽過人向戴耀廷稱35+是不可能、或說戴天真嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說沒有，並主動表示認為對35+採取「比較積極」態度的人，主要分為三類，第一類是「明知35+冇可能，但佢不停去講35+，然之後講35+之後，好似民主會立即降臨咁樣」，鄒並指曾於傳單和街站形容該些人「販賣假希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而第二類人「可能真係覺得35+有可能嘅，帶住一絲嘅希望睇吓可唔可以搵到一個攞到35+嘅機會」，鄒認為他們「類似一種帶一點天真嘅理想主義者」，但當時沒有直接這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三類人，鄒指是「有一啲嘅政治嘅勇氣或者政治嘅承擔」，認為他們「覺得35+係冇可能，但佢哋都會盡力去完成呢個任務，目的其實係想話畀全世界知道，無論我哋點樣努力都好，當權者都係唔會比我哋攞到35+」，亦即「撕破假象嘅表面」。鄒並指他是因應第一類人而有自己的主張。李運騰問，所以他將自己視為第三類人？鄒說：「我係第四類人」，即引來哄堂大笑，惟鄒欲再解釋時被法官打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官追問時着鄒想清楚-鄒自言諗得好清楚並稱墨落與35無關&quot;&gt;官追問時着鄒想清楚 鄒自言「諗得好清楚」、並稱「墨落」與「35+」無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉要求鄒再想清楚共有多少類人，鄒笑言「其實數唔晒嘅」，因每個小區也可產生一類人，並指頭三類「表面上都會主張35+係有可能」，惟陳慶偉指不是，指頭一類人是認為35+不可能但「販賣假希望」，而「假希望」即是不真實的。鄒苦笑說：「我知、我知……我明呀，我啱啱所講嗰三類人……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉打斷說：「聽着，想清楚」，鄒說：「我諗得好清楚㗎喇。」陳再說：「因為我不想你現在捏造（make up）證據」，鄒反問：「咁我而家，要點？」旁聽席傳來笑聲，陳遂要求鄒給出最後答案。大律師陳世傑一度問鄒有關第四類人，鄒微笑說「搞掂頭三類先啦」，重申表面上會看到他們主張35+，李運騰問即告訴人35+是可能？鄒說「exactly!」，並指上述純粹是他對他們內在想法的分析。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後說，鄒是指第一大組可分成三個小組，而他們都是相信35+是可能？鄒兩度重申只是「表面上」。陳追問，即他們是否相信35+是可能？鄒說：「不如我哋掉走個大組啦。」陳說：「聽着，我沒有建立大組，是你建立」，又指「我不想你亂說話和一時衝動（“… say something randomly and at the spur of the moment”）」，並嚴厲說「我再給你多一次機會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒其後再次重複對3類人的看法，並形容首類人「係政棍嚟嘅呢類，我形容呢一類係政棍、販賣假希望嘅政棍」，至於第3類人，鄒重申雖然他們明知35+不可能，但目的是想讓香港人或世界知道，「無論我哋點努力都好，當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+。」鄒最後指，「墨落無悔」與35+沒有關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件-是來自傳統泛民主派意思&quot;&gt;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件 是來自傳統泛民主派意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就約於6月17日後進行、由媒體「Spark」對「墨落無悔」3名發起人的訪問發問。被問到是哪家媒體，鄒指有些模糊，記得是由「張可森搵返嚟」、應是某大學的媒體，張向他和梁晃維稱記者想找他們「講一講『墨落無悔』」，和順便介紹自己和講述政治理念，而訪問中「我哋自說自話，事前冇夾過嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示謄本，鄒家成在訪問被問為何發起「墨落無悔」聲明時，提及開會時一直指有共同綱領要大家簽署，但在無通知他們情況下就召開記招指不需要簽：「我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章……撕毀緊成個香港民族對於未來嘅想像。」鄒解釋是指戴耀廷稱會讓大家簽文件，其後又突然稱「唔畀簽」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提及不可讓「泛民」單方面撕毀約章，是不視自己為「泛民」一部分？鄒指此處「泛民」是指「傳統泛民主派」，並指6月9日戴耀廷開記者會前，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民主派約見戴耀廷，並要求戴勿要求大家簽文件，故認為戴記者會所說「其實係嚟自傳統泛民主派嘅意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評墨落是夾人&quot;&gt;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評「墨落」是「夾人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續引張可森訪問提及「如果佢哋係可以了解到呢個時代係需要啲咩，係回應到呢個時代要前進嘅方向嘅話，其實你唔會覺我哋係夾你嘅」，被問「夾」是什麼意思，鄒指張當時是回應就「墨落無悔」是「夾緊人」的批評，該些批評來自部分傳統泛民主派，他當時意識到或留意到的是社民連岑子杰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱攬炒為自我犧牲態度目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&quot;&gt;鄒稱「攬炒」為自我犧牲態度、目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森訪問亦提及「攬炒」，陳世傑問鄒對「攬炒」的理解，鄒指「『攬炒』對我嚟講係一種態度、一種側重於自我犧牲嘅態度」，並認為2020年初選要延續這種「攬炒」精神，有兩種具體表現，第一是他早前提及實踐議會內「寸土必爭」，第二是「不惜自我犧牲都要阻止惡法」，即「盡力喺議會裡面阻止」的態度。鄒並認為，上述兩種實踐均是在2020年立法會有機會被政權針對、DQ、追討薪金，而行政機關要付出的代價就是「受到制衡」和「推動唔到佢哋想推動嘅惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，「『攬炒』從來都唔係一個禁忌」，而且很常見，舉例勞工向資方提出一些改善工作環境的條件，如加薪或減低工作時數，並表明如資方不改善工作環境就會罷工，鄒認為罷工本身就是「攬炒」。鄒又指，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，並認為「攬炒」目的，就是「拉近雙方嘅政治勢力，為和談帶來可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷攬炒十步&quot;&gt;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷「攬炒十步」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，鄒家成當時留意到戴耀廷提倡「攬炒十步」嗎？鄒說「我冇睇過」，亦不知道戴當時有關「攬炒」的主張。鄒並指，首次聽到「攬炒十步」是在收到審訊文件夾時，陳指是2021年，鄒稱不記得當時是否已收到文件夾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒-鄒都可以呀&quot;&gt;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒 鄒：都可以呀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後要求播片，被問到為何發起「墨落無悔」，梁晃維提及如初選協議在如此鬆散情況下定下、無確切文件證明大家也同意，實在不能估算初選後各派人會否繼續堅持參與，甚至入議會後是否會履行當初對港人的承諾，而既然戴耀廷不希望令到多人被DQ，「咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森則表示，「墨落無悔」四字是他所寫，望港人或從政者意識到「我哋有啲嘢根本上係唔同咗」，現時不再是討論政治、妥協的藝術、或一開始說要「攬炒」但「回一回價」又不「攬炒」，現時討論的是「抗爭」，而抗爭是不妥協的藝術，「當你簽咗呢張嘢應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢後法官陳仲衡問，因三人是一起發起「墨落」，張可森和梁晃維談及為何發起「墨落無悔」的部分，也是代表鄒所說？鄒答：「都可以呀。」陳慶偉亦指，留意到鄒在另外兩人說話時不時點頭，鄒說「我有留意到」。陳續問，那鄒是否不同意他們說法？抑或指他們只是在表達自己意見？鄒回應：「唔會唔同意佢哋嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱主問大約到一半&quot;&gt;辯方稱主問大約到一半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後問到，鄒訪問提及初選論壇「係唯一一個場地去同泛民主派一個交鋒」，問他為何這樣說，鄒稱因以往也沒試過有一個像初選論壇的平台「畀各門各派嘅人去交流」，而論壇可讓大家就不同政治理念交鋒，繼而尋找民主運動出路。陳仲衡指鄒訪問不是提到「交流」、而是「交鋒」，鄒認為「差唔多啫」，指在論壇語境就是「交鋒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，已完成就「墨落無悔」的盤問，並指現時大約已到主問一半。法官陳慶偉笑言只到一半？李運騰亦關注下一個議題。陳指會問及提名表格、Facebook 帖文、選舉論壇、WhatsApp 群組等，預計星期四或之前完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，只於下午開庭。散庭時，鄒向親友說：「好鬼攰、真係好鬼攰。」&lt;/p&gt;

How groups, whether nonstate actors or states party to a conflict, construct norms, which includes expectations of femininity and masculinity, is crucial to understanding violence.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;These constructions impact the roles imagined, the behaviors normalized, and the treatment of different gendered groups. Traditional gendered narratives have often been resurrected by all sides to the Ukraine conflict, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s appeal to women, mothers, sisters, and fiancées to support their loved ones in battle; the image beamed around the world of a wounded, pregnant Ukrainian woman curled on a stretcher; and comments made by the UK defense secretary that President Putin is suffering from “small man syndrome” providing just some examples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these narratives are flawed, reductive, and unhelpful for long-term conflict resolution. They also undermine advancements in the field of women, peace, and security. The presentation of men as defender-warriors and women as fragile and requiring protection contends with the reality of Ukrainian women taking up arms, masks the existence of other potentially vulnerable identity groups, and ultimately impedes the adoption of an inclusive approach to the conflict and any postconflict settlement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proven much more adept at producing unconventional gendered war propaganda, refusing to denigrate Russian troops and emphasizing women’s active participation in the conflict. Yet, the imagery of female “gun-strapped blonde soldiers” still exceptionalizes women’s participation in the war. Meanwhile, there are some concerns that Ukrainian women are not treated as equal to men in terms of military mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analyzes the ways in which gendered narratives have been employed during the war in Ukraine. It reflects on the traditional use of gendered narratives in the field of security and draws on the author’s research on the role of gender in the field of terrorism. It then explores how these narratives have been deployed by parties to the conflict in Ukraine and the implications of this approach. It does not provide a detailed gendered analysis of the Ukraine conflict or a comprehensive linguistic analysis of the various traditional and social media datasets available. Instead, it aims to demonstrate the hypothesis that gendered narratives used in the conflict and security space, including by those working on counterterrorism issues, often promote flawed understandings about the nature and impact of violence, which can have counterproductive policy implications. The recommendations are aimed at policymakers working in the fields of conflict, security, and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-power-of-gendered-narratives&quot;&gt;THE POWER OF GENDERED NARRATIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How leaders use strategic narratives is widely accepted as a soft power in the realm of global politics, conflict, and terrorism.9 Strategic narratives are a means for political actors to construct a shared meaning of international politics and a tool to articulate a position on a specific issue and to shape the perceptions, beliefs, and behavior of domestic and international actors. Their “narrators” are primarily elites (government leaders, security experts, consultants, policy analysts, etc.) who construct and communicate them to the general public through speeches, press conferences, official documents, and more. Narratives have grown in significance in particular due to the introduction of social media, which provides another arena to demonstrate power, critique, and even mockery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians routinely employ gendered metaphors in foreign policy legitimation. These rely on often preexisting essentialist understandings of women in national culture and mythos and on stereotypes prevalent in the foreign policy and security realms, which are shaped by and assumed to be the realm of men and male actors. This contributes to a gendered framing in which masculinity is superior to femininity. Military institutions, among others, may present women as victims, “damsels in distress,” in need of protection and as ancillary to conflict due to their physically “inferior” attributes and maternal or peaceful disposition. Countless examples of these narratives can be found, throughout history, more recently deployed by policymakers and terrorist groups alike during the “Global War on Terror.” The international intervention in Afghanistan was accompanied by images such as the liberation of Afghan women from the Taliban, indelibly associating the two ideas in the public imagination. Narratives of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targeted men as soldiers of war while messages for women focused on their roles as mothers, sisters, and lovers. Similar images and narratives appear in the development field and are visible even in the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives are underpinned by the assumption that physical strength is associated with masculinity, which trumps the alternative, physical weakness, which is associated with femininity or effeminate men. Masculine men are often described as war-fighters possessing traits such as leadership, heroism, physical dominance, and aggression. Similar narratives have also been deployed by violent extremist groups drawing on notions of violent masculinity, including feelings of entitlement and supremacy, and gendered grievances, such as shame and emasculation, in their propaganda to recruit and retain committed members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reductive-or-just-false&quot;&gt;REDUCTIVE OR JUST FALSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narratives have implications, a fact that is often poorly understood by policymakers. If a strategic narrative is a tool for leaders to shape perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors, it is understandable that it is not always entirely accurate and may even be harmful. As a result, the rhetoric can clash with the local reality. Justifying interventions in Afghanistan on the rationale of the liberation of Muslim women reflected ignorance of critical information about Muslim women, Afghanistan, the Taliban, and the realities of the U.S. invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Russian foreign policy propagated through mass media has presented Ukraine as a neo-Nazi state in need of defeating. The war is therefore presented as a holy crusade in defense of the motherland. In fact, Russian leaders use “motherland” when it is something to be protected, “fatherland” when the situation calls for aggression. Russian narratives intimate Ukraine’s supposedly subordinate role in geopolitical terms by describing Ukraine as a “loose woman in need of saving by its older brother.” Ukrainian male politicians are presented as “sissy boys” and no match for “real men” of pro-Russian politics. President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are presented as the masculine ideal, compared to the seemingly deviant male (sissy boys) and female protagonists (damsels in distress), to legitimize the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives have been undermined by unfolding events on the battlefield and challenged by President Zelenskyy’s success at presenting his country as “a progressive, gender-egalitarian, LGBTQ-friendly, 21st-century democratic power.” These narratives also rarely acknowledge that conflict creates a range of lived experiences for different identity groups. Popular Western narratives referring to the horrors facing women and children in every address urging support of the conflict are not the full picture. Some women may indeed be more vulnerable during conflict, particularly those who are from ethnic minorities or poorer communities. Yet, people with disabilities may also lose access to vital infrastructure or public services, while sexual violence toward all people is exacerbated by conflict. LGBTQ+ groups also face risks in this conflict. President Putin has mentioned “gender freedoms” more than once to justify Russia’s war against Ukraine and simultaneously crack down on its own citizens. Over the last decade, gender and LGBTQ+ issues have become central targets of repression in Russia aimed at protecting President Putin’s regime from perceived domestic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gendered stereotypes depicting women as civilian victims also clash with the reality of Ukrainian women’s active participation in conflicts. Women became eligible for the draft in December 2021, and by 2022, more than 13,000 women were assigned combat status for their service in Donetsk and Luhansk. It is unknown how many women currently serve in the armed forces, although estimates range from 10 to 25 percent, but there is evidence of a growing recognition of women’s ability to contribute to the war effort in a variety of ways. This gives Ukraine a way to buttress its military in numerical terms relative to Russia, which confines the majority of women in its military to noncombat roles. Approximately 41,000 women serve in the Russian military and constitute 4.3 percent of active duty forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelenskyy’s narratives have also resisted conventional wartime militarized sexist stereotypes. One analyst observed that “rather than denigrate the Russians by implying they mistreat their women or demonizing their men as monsters, for example, he has blamed the war on Putin directly.” First lady Olena Zelenska’s use of social media includes pictures of women in military uniform in the trenches or women as part of rescue crews with the caption “Our new opposition has a female face to it.” Women combatants are also visible in international media coverage. Headlines shout, “Women Rush to Ukraine’s Defence” and “Ukrainian Women Stand Strong Against Russian Invaders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If women are not purely damsels in distress, the alternative narrative of gun-strapped blonde soldiers is just as reductive. These types of images in Western and Ukrainian media emphasize the significance of Ukrainian women fighting, which reinforces the notion that women’s participation in wartime violence is exceptional and therefore newsworthy. Women’s participation in armed conflict therefore becomes characterized as abnormal or even “monstrous.” Ukrainian women, however, express similar motivations as men for fighting, that of defense, preservation, survival, and continuity of the state. The Ukrainian military’s claim of being a champion of gender equity also falls short of reality, evidenced by the leadership’s refusal to allow women into senior ranks and most notably by restricting women from command positions outside of women-specific roles or placing them in roles that are distanced from actual combat. Female soldiers also complain of shortages of gear in appropriate sizes and lack of access to military education and training programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military recruitment posters and politicians’ adoption of military-style clothing reflect that the government’s more recent efforts to mobilize its citizens for war are infused with masculine narratives. Focusing on men’s masculine status as soldiers, protectors, or fathers “reinforces masculinist and heteronormative gender ideologies.” This focus ignores the fact that, despite universal forced conscription, many men do not wish to fight and have left the country illegally or are hiding from local military recruiters in plain sight among the roughly 7.1 million people who are internally displaced, 40 percent of whom are male. Those who have left legally because, for instance, they have three or more children are subject to sexist ridicule from fellow Ukrainians and often have trouble renting housing and getting work because landlords and employers may not trust their military exemptions. Meanwhile, men also experience sexual violence during conflict but may deliberately use words such as “abuse” or “torture” rather than recount the sexual aspect of the violence they have incurred for fear that this may compromise their masculinity. Male sexual violence disturbs gender relations for its tendency to strip men of their masculine status as soldier or protector and deliberately feminizes them or labels them as homosexuals in the eye of the perpetrator. This, in turn, further “feminizes conflict-related sexual violence, trauma and vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-the-insecurity-of-men-and-women&quot;&gt;INCREASING THE INSECURITY OF MEN AND WOMEN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greater concern is the clash of President Zelenskyy’s progressive narratives with certain Ukrainian military policy. “Forced universal conscription of men in Ukraine and Ukraine’s breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk [is] resurrecting binaries of men as defender-warriors and women as fragile and needing protection.” Although exemptions to conscription were permitted, an immediate effect of this provision was that refugee flows from Ukraine overrepresented women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has serious human rights implications. There are indications that Russian forces appear to be operating under the assumption that all males are combatants, even though unmobilized men retain their civilian status under international law. Men are disproportionately represented in the civilian casualties of the war. Of the 6,595 adult civilian fatalities where the individual’s sex was known, 2,575 were identified as men while 1,767 were identified as women. This pattern was witnessed during the Bosnian war, the most infamous example being the Srebrenica massacre of 7,000 unarmed men and boys. A true gender-integrated military would deconstruct the idea that the distinction between civilian and combatant is based on gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration of martial law has also reinforced the ambiguous position of women who want to serve and the traditional gender norms that position women primarily as victims of rather than participants in armed conflict. This has implications because it determines the international legal regime under which women are protected and affects their access to wartime and postwar resources such as rations, veterans’ benefits, and rehabilitation programs. Similar concerns have been noted in the terrorism field where experts have observed serious implications in the prosecution, risk assessment, and management of women violent extremists in prison (e.g., more lenient sentences for female returnees or insufficient facilities in prisons for women, especially for mothers). Women may also struggle to access rehabilitation and reintegration programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;undermining-the-potential-for-resolving-conflict-and-violence&quot;&gt;UNDERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR RESOLVING CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of responsibility for conflict resolution does not fall on narratives alone. As one international relations expert observed, “Conflict generated by aggressive or militant leaders with vested interests in escalating conflict is generally not amenable to reduction unless intentions change.” Yet, changing images and narratives are part of conflict resolution. Policymakers and commentators point to soft power as one way to reduce tensions, mitigate conflict, and find common ground in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts by some Western leaders to undermine President Putin through ridicule are therefore contentious. President Putin is pivotal to Russian narratives. Political legitimacy is centered around a patriarchal understanding of President Putin as a hypermasculine “real” man. In June 2022, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace hit out at President Putin’s “macho” view of the world, which he said was based on “small man syndrome.” His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that President Putin’s war in Ukraine was a “perfect example of toxic masculinity.” At the Group of Seven summit around the same time, leaders also mocked President Putin over his infamous bare-chested picture on a horse. Deploying belittling gendered narratives may rally domestic audiences but could constrain political action in the longer run. In fact, ridiculing President Putin feeds into Russia’s own narratives that the West does not respect or understand Russia, which strengthens the Russian leader’s position. If conflict is to be reduced and resolved, hostile imagery eventually must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither are Russian narratives intrinsically linking militarism with masculinity helpful. Male endorsement of traditional masculinity can be associated with negative outcomes in relation to conflict resolution. It follows that men endorsing beliefs about manhood might avoid the use of conflict resolution strategies perceived as feminine. The Ukraine war has also witnessed a return to gendered narratives about NATO as a “muscular military power,” with “less attention paid to the human stories underpinning the war, particularly the voices of Ukrainian women and their agency, or a concern with how to reach beyond audiences primarily interested in military power.” The WPS agenda has been entirely missing from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s briefings following the numerous high-level meetings and summits that NATO has held in response to the war. Despite commitments in policy, the United States, NATO, and the European Union have done little to demonstrate the mainstreaming of gender in addressing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This undermines the possibility of a lasting, inclusive peace reflective of the whole of Ukrainian society. Women and other marginalized groups have been largely sidelined from real decision-making at national and global levels in the conflict. An acknowledgement of the gendered impact of armed conflict, as well as the impact on LGBTQ+ communities, is also missing. This draws attention to what many feminists had feared: the disjuncture between the rhetoric and the reality of the global commitment to the WPS agenda. As a result, certain groups and tools that NATO has at its disposal to support a more inclusive response to the war are being sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some steps have been taken, particularly on the Ukrainian side, to move away from conventional, stereotyped gendered narratives in the conflict. This is reflective of the reality on the ground, which has mobilized the entire Ukrainian population against the Russian invasion. Yet, reductive gendered narratives are still prevalent, including among NATO and other Western actors. These narratives have real-world implications that can undermine the safety and security of Ukrainian men and women and are an impediment to longer-term peace and stability in Ukraine and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terrorism field, the value of narratives and strategic communications to counterterrorism is widely accepted by governments. In academia, research has increasingly focused on how terrorists communicate and what works in response. In part inspired by a desire not to reproduce the narratives of terrorist groups, pushback has been seen in the counterterrorism field. Policymakers and practitioners increasingly recognize the importance of avoiding gender misconceptions and stereotypes, which can ignore women’s capabilities to contribute to counterterrorism and countering violent extremism (CVE) efforts in a range of areas, including as policy shapers, educators, community members, and activists, and acknowledge that a better understanding of the relationship among gender, terrorism, and counterterrorism can help improve counterterrorism and CVE efforts. The Islamic State group’s successful recruitment of women has also challenged perceptions that women are always vulnerable, peaceful, or moderate. This progress is just one of the reasons why it is disappointing that parties to the Ukraine conflict are deploying traditional gendered narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following conclusions and recommendations draw on some of the lessons from the counterterrorism space over the last two decades and are aimed at policymakers and practitioners involved not only in Ukraine but in the wider field of conflict and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders should avoid using gender-stereotyped narratives to legitimize military operations. With regard to Ukraine, gendered narratives may strengthen President Putin’s justification for the invasion while ridicule may enhance Russia’s claims that the West does not respect or understand Russia. In the field of terrorism, policymakers need to avoid emulating the narratives deployed by violent extremist groups and promote women’s active role in efforts to counter terrorism and prevent and counter violent extremism. Reductive narratives are damaging to people of all genders and potentially undermine longer-term conflict resolution and efforts to defeat terrorist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers could draw on the Ukrainian experience to normalize women’s participation in conflict and to emphasize that unmobilized men are civilians. A gender-integrated approach to security must deconstruct the idea that there is a difference between civilians and combatants based on gender. This normalization also needs to address the gender norm stereotypes that are often reproduced around women’s participation in violence and conflict. Additionally, the narrative normalization must be accompanied by the expansion of resources for female or other often marginalized participants, including ensuring access to rehabilitation and reintegration packages for women combatants and women terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and media should avoid exceptionalizing women’s participation in the conflict. How the media portrays women’s participation in conflict and terrorism can influence public opinion. For example, media attention on the case of Shamima Begum in the United Kingdom entrenched the public, possibly political viewpoint that Begum was “exceptional” and that “extraordinary” measures should be taken against her, including the deprivation of British citizenship. Media training is key to combating sensationalism and polarization while maintaining independence and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should adopt an intersectional approach to understanding conflict and terrorism. Countries such as Canada, Finland, France, Spain, and Sweden say they have a feminist foreign policy. Yet, mentions of the deeply gendered harms inflicted by this war and how to better protect people of all genders have been limited. Greater efforts are needed to identify the specific humanitarian needs and the lived experiences of all individuals experiencing conflict and terrorism-related violence in order to more fully account for how inequalities of all kinds influence how and why people engage in violence and how they are impacted by it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite commitments in policy, the United States, NATO, and the EU have done little to demonstrate the inclusion of gender in addressing the conflict. NATO should publicly acknowledge the relevance of a gender perspective and uphold commitments to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 beyond emphasis on the deployment of women as part of NATO’s Response Force. NATO should also explore the use of instruments, such as the NATO Civil Society Advisor Panel, to reach out to Ukrainian civil society and ensure a diversity of voices are heard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
