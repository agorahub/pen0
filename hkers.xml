It identifies the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Canada as the most competitive jurisdictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States led global production of rare earth elements (REEs) until the mid-1990s, when China emerged as the dominant supplier. China maintained near-total control of the market until 2012. This monopoly began to face limited competition with the entry of two commercial producers: U.S.-based Molycorp, which later declared bankruptcy, and Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Today, REEs are once again in the spotlight as China has leveraged its market dominance by imposing export restrictions that limit U.S. access to these key minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions pose significant risks to U.S. national, economic, and energy security. REEs are essential components in numerous advanced defense systems, including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator drones, and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) smart bombs. For instance, an F-35 contains more than 900 pounds of REEs, an Arleigh Burke–class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia-class submarine uses about 9,200 pounds. On the civilian side, REEs are essential for cancer treatment, MRI and PET scanners, automotives (both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles), and consumer electronics such as phones, computers, and other products that contain semiconductors. All these industries are acutely affected by REE shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated a willingness to weaponize REEs over the last 15 years. In 2010, it banned the export of REEs to Japan over a fishing trawler dispute. More recently, in 2023, it imposed a global ban on the export of technologies for rare earth processing and separation, aiming to obstruct the development of midstream capabilities outside its borders. This move had particularly severe consequences for two key reasons: First, China holds unmatched technical expertise in rare earth processing, especially in solvent extraction—a critical and complex step in REE separation—whereas Western companies have struggled due to limited workforce capabilities, research and development, and environmental regulations. Second, while several REE separation and processing facilities are under construction in other countries, these projects require substantial time to complete and fully operationalize, leaving a prolonged gap in global capacity outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s recent imposition of export controls on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) has underscored the dire reality for the United States, which remains almost entirely dependent on Chinese supply. As of 2023, China accounted for 99 percent of global HREE processing. On the other hand, China has refrained from restricting exports of light rare earth elements (LREEs), which are processed by a more geographically diverse set of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the world’s second-largest producer of REEs—thanks primarily to operations at Mountain Pass, California, which account for about 15 percent of global supply—the United States has long depended on China for REE separation. Until early 2024, the United States was shipping most of its domestically mined REEs to China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a resilient REE supply chain—which the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) calls the “mine-to-magnet” supply chain—will require close collaboration with international partners. No single country currently possesses the financial resources or technical capabilities to independently outpace China’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China accounts for approximately 60 percent of global REE production, it is responsible for 90 percent of processing, a dominance achieved through deliberate strategies to source REEs globally and consolidate midstream processing domestically, including overpaying for acquisitions. For example, in May 2025, Shenghe Resources, through its subsidiary Ganzhou Chenguang Rare Earths New Material, announced a binding agreement to acquire full ownership of the Australia-based Peak Rare Earths project in Tanzania. The deal, which was announced on May 25, was a $158 million AUD transaction, with a cash offer of approximately $0.359 AUD per Peak share—representing a nearly 200 percent premium over Peak’s May 9 closing price of $0.12 AUD and a 160 percent premium over the 20-day volume-weighted average price of $0.138 AUD. The substantial premium underscores the lengths to which Chinese companies are willing to go to maintain their global dominance in the rare earths supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-hubs-are-a-strategic-approach-to-building-capabilities&quot;&gt;Why Hubs Are a Strategic Approach to Building Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mineral processing hub is a centralized location or facility where raw mineral ores are transformed into refined materials suitable for industrial use. These hubs typically manage several key stages of the value chain, transforming raw ore into high-purity metals suitable for manufacturing. Mineral processing hubs leverage economies of scale by streamlining regulatory requirements, including reducing the number of permits and environmental impact assessments necessary for operations. Additionally, they capitalize on the concentration of key resources, including energy, transportation, and water infrastructure; specialized human capital with advanced technical expertise; and greater access to financial capital. This integrated approach enhances operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness across the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hubs can also provide prime ground for research and development (R&amp;amp;D), which is essential to supporting the growth of a nascent rare earth processing industry. At the height of the U.S. REE industry, substantial and consistent investment was directed toward the R&amp;amp;D of REE separation technologies. The Ames Laboratory was founded by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 following its success in solving a key problem for the Manhattan Project: how to purify uranium metal by separating REE impurities. The groundbreaking uranium work positioned the Ames Laboratory to become the premier REE research facility, pioneering a cost-efficient method for separating REEs in the 1950s. This research paved the way for the development of new defense technologies including radar instruments and lasers for guided weapons, as well as consumer technologies like color televisions and fiber-optic cables for long-distance telephone calls and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, government investment in the Ames Laboratory and other research groups and laboratories provided the intellectual infrastructure to support technological breakthroughs in the private sector. The Ames Laboratory established a loan program to supply high-purity rare earths for research to scientists in the public and private sectors and created the Rare-Earth Information Center to disseminate key research. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the United States deprioritized REE technology R&amp;amp;D as the industry shifted to China amid the economy-wide trend of transferring manufacturing capacity overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply diversifying sources of mined rare earth ore is not enough to break China’s stranglehold on these critical supply chains. Last year, the U.S.-led Minerals Security Partnership backed Brazil’s Serra Verde rare earths project—the only mine outside Asia currently producing both light and heavy rare earths. Yet despite this strategic investment, the ore is already locked into offtake agreements with China for processing. This is because China’s overwhelming dominance in midstream processing left no viable alternative. Without urgently building global processing capacity, new mining projects will continue feeding directly into China’s control, perpetuating the very dependency the United States is seeking to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must develop a strategy to rebuild REE technical expertise and establish midstream processing hubs beyond China’s control. Given the high cost and complexity of operating processing facilities profitably, consolidating operations into large-scale hubs is essential to achieving economies of scale. To be effective, these hubs should not only advance domestic innovation and industry but also leverage the resources and capabilities of U.S. allies and partners who are best positioned to lead in midstream processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-united-states-is-currently-doing&quot;&gt;What the United States Is Currently Doing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government recognizes the urgency of building midstream capacity outside China for REE separation, processing, refining, and manufacturing into permanent magnets for the defense industry. In 2023, the DOD announced its goal of securing a complete mine-to-magnet supply chain by 2027. Achieving this goal will require significant investments in REE processing capacity, a nascent industry in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In efforts to swiftly scale up processing capacity, the DOD deployed significant funds to rare earths projects via the Defense Production Act. Since 2020, the DOD has awarded over $439 million to companies like MP Materials, Lynas USA, and Noveon Magnetics for building LREE and HREE separating and processing and permanent magnet manufacturing capabilities. Most of these midstream investment dollars are headed to Texas; Lynas is building an LREE separation facility in Hondo and an HREE processing facility in Seadrift, MP Materials is constructing its first rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, and Noveon Magnetics is opening its first REE magnet manufacturing facility in San Marcos. With this influx of investments, Texas is on track to become the U.S. hub for rare earth processing and magnet manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2025, MP Materials unveiled a landmark public-private partnership with the DOD aimed at accelerating the development of a vertically integrated rare earth magnet supply chain within the United States. Backed by a multi-billion-dollar package of federal investments and long-term procurement commitments, the initiative will enable MP Materials to scale its annual magnet manufacturing capacity from 1,000 metric tons in 2025 to 10,000 metric tons over the next decade. As part of the agreement, the DOD will acquire $400 million in preferred stock—becoming the company’s largest shareholder—and extend a $150 million loan to support HREE separation expansion. Critically, the U.S. government will establish a price floor of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium, offering direct payments to MP Materials when market prices fall below that threshold (which stood below $60 per kg as of June 2025). In addition, the Pentagon has committed to purchasing 100 percent of the permanent magnets produced at the new facility, providing a guaranteed demand signal to anchor long-term production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strategic significance, the partnership faces two key limitations. First, the Mountain Pass facility primarily contains LREES rather than HREEs. Second, near-term production capacity remains limited: MP Materials is expected to produce only 1,000 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron magnets by 2025—representing less than 1 percent of the 138,000 metric tons China produced as early as 2018. Achieving full-scale capacity will require a gradual and sustained ramp-up over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complementing domestic capabilities with allied capabilities will be critical to meeting the DOD’s urgent targets for secure, resilient supply chains—and meeting future demand growth. While the United States accelerates efforts to build domestic capacity, establishing rare earth processing hubs with international partners will unlock critical feedstock, fast-track scalable production, and reduce dangerous dependencies. The most effective partners will combine access to rare earth resources with world-class infrastructure, reliable and affordable energy, a strong commitment to research and innovation, low operating costs, political stability, and regulatory environments that actively encourage industrial investment. Without these global partnerships, the United States risks falling behind in the race to secure the materials vital for defense and advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is already forging strategic international partnerships to strengthen and diversify its rare earths supply chains. In a landmark move, President Donald Trump prioritized mineral diplomacy during his first state visit with Saudi Arabia, laying the groundwork for a critical minerals partnership between the two nations. Building on this, U.S.-based MP Materials signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to collaborate across the entire rare earths value chain—from mining and processing to the production of permanent magnets—marking a significant step toward building a resilient mine-to-magnet supply chain outside of China’s control. Construction of the mine is expected to begin in 2025—subject to a final investment decision—and production is expected to commence mid-2028. As Maaden CEO Bob Wilt emphasized, “Through a potential partnership with MP Materials, and our deepening ties with the United States, we aim to create a global hub for a fully integrated rare earth value chain supporting advanced manufacturing in the Kingdom.” MP Materials CEO Jim Litinsky called the agreement a critical milestone in “deepening the strategic alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Arabia is expected to begin producing heavy rare earths in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been a prominent focus in President Trump’s foreign policy, primarily because of its rare earth resources. In June 2025, the U.S. Export-Import Bank announced its intent to provide up to $120 million in nondilutive financing for Critical Metals Corp.’s Tanbreez rare earth project in southern Greenland. This would mark the Trump administration’s first international mining investment of this term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-ideal-partners-for-investment-in-international-midstream-hubs&quot;&gt;Identifying Ideal Partners for Investment in International Midstream Hubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing and sustaining rare earth processing hubs require massive financial investment, advanced infrastructure, and specialized technical expertise—capabilities few countries possess on their own. Concentrating resources into a select number of strategically located hubs offers the greatest chance of success and long-term resilience. This paper presents a data-driven analysis, evaluating 10 quantifiable criteria across 10 countries to analytically identify the most viable locations for these critical hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-government-commitment-to-developing-ree-capabilities&quot;&gt;1. Government Commitment to Developing REE Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the financial capital, technical know-how, permitting, and infrastructure required to create a REE processing hub, government support is a crucial enabler in the form of direct financing, policy reforms to create an enabling environment, support to developing R&amp;amp;D capabilities, and other mechanisms. In addition to the partnership between the DOD and MP Materials and the $439 million the DOD has awarded to companies building domestic REE processing capabilities, the Australian government has given $1.25 billion in financing to build a domestic rare earths refinery. Moreover, Japan has heavily invested in non-Chinese rare earth projects abroad and domestic technical capacity since 2010, and Saudi Arabia has committed to developing a mine-to-magnet REE supply chain with support from the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. Without active government support, getting an REE processing hub off the ground can be both difficult and cost prohibitive, given the limited support from capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-commercial-cooperation-on-ree-hubs&quot;&gt;2. Commercial Cooperation on REE Hubs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that establish commercial partnerships with U.S. companies to develop rare earth processing capabilities are well positioned to secure long-term strategic cooperation and offtake arrangements. Notably, the Australian firm Lynas Rare Earths is constructing an REE separation facility in Texas, backed by U.S. government support. Similarly, U.S-based MP Materials has signed a memorandum of understanding with Maaden to jointly develop REE separation infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, reinforcing bilateral commercial and strategic ties in critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-proximity-to-feedstock&quot;&gt;3. Proximity to Feedstock&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating international partners for potential collaboration on REE processing, it is critical to consider the geographic alignment of processing hubs with available resources. Locating specialized hubs for both LREEs and HREEs close to their respective feedstock sources improves operational efficiency, lowers transportation expenses, and reduces supply chain vulnerabilities. Transportation costs represent one of the most significant expenditures in the mining industry. In the case of industrial minerals, for example, transportation can constitute more than 50 percent of the total delivered cost, underscoring the critical importance of proximity to feedstock in determining the commercial viability of a processing hub. This proximity also strengthens the competitiveness of processing operations, which is vital for ensuring their long-term commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam possess a distinct geological advantage, supported by substantial REE reserves. At the same time, nations including Canada and Saudi Arabia are actively advancing exploration initiatives to identify and develop new deposits. Diversifying sources of supply across multiple jurisdictions is essential. For instance, the United States’ Mountain Pass mine primarily yields LREEs such as praseodymium and neodymium, whereas critical HREE production, including dysprosium and terbium, remains overwhelmingly concentrated in China and Myanmar. However, Brazil represents a key alternative source for HREEs. As the United States builds its HREE processing capabilities in Texas and California, Brazil is geographically closer to the United States than it is to China. In Saudi Arabia, Jabal Sayid, located 350 kilometers northeast of Jeddah, is estimated to have significant deposits of HREEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is emerging as a dominant rare earth producer and processor. The world’s fourth-largest producer of these minerals, it is developing several domestic processing facilities, including Iluka Resources’ Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery in Western Australia, which was backed by a $1.25 billion government loan contingent on offtake agreements with like-minded countries. Iluka will produce separated oxides including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium. The refinery is expected to be commissioned in 2026. Arafura Rare Earths Limited’s Nolans Project has received $840 million in federal funding and is expected to produce 4 percent of the world’s neodymium and praseodymium beginning in 2032. Moreover, Australia is set to triple its mined rare earth oxide supply between 2025 and 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Australia’s Lynas achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first company outside China to produce commercial quantities of dysprosium oxide—one of the world’s most critical HREEs—at its Malaysian facility. Production volumes were not disclosed. Lynas sources its feedstock from the Mount Weld mine near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, which holds an estimated 2 million tons of total rare earth oxides in reserves. Lynas also signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia’s Kelantan state government to jointly develop the state’s rare earth deposits as potential future feedstock for Lynas’s processing facility. However, a substantial portion of its output continues to be sent to China for refining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-infrastructure&quot;&gt;4. Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mineral processing hub requires comprehensive infrastructure, including transportation networks, water supply systems, and waste management facilities. Mineral processing operations require well-developed transportation infrastructure—specifically major railways and ports—to enable the efficient movement of materials. As stated, transportation costs are one of the most significant costs in the mining supply chain. Australia, Canada, and Japan rank highly in terms of developing the infrastructure needed for any large manufacturing project: roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rare earth production also demands substantial water infrastructure. On average, producing one kilogram of rare earths from monazite consumes 11,170 kilograms of water. Water usage varies by element, from 3,803 kilograms of water per kilogram of samarium or gadolinium to as high as 29,902 kilograms of water per kilogram of yttrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even countries with a strong record of water management must innovate to meet the water needs of REE processing. Canada has access to nearly 20 percent of the world’s fresh water but is still investing in efficient water management systems for rare earth processing. The Saskatchewan government and Saskatchewan Research Council are developing an REE processing facility that will recycle and reuse all water within the plant. Saudi Arabia is combating its water challenges with the construction of desalination facilities to meet demand. In 2023, Saudi Arabia announced a plan for 12 desalination projects and 40 water tanks valued at $1.3 billion to address water needs for industry. Since Indonesia’s mineral export ban, the country has invested $1.7 billion into its water infrastructure to meet the increased water demand from processing facilities. Namibia and South Africa face greater water challenges: Namibian water resources are stretched thin amid severe droughts, and South Africa experiences frequent water interruptions. British mining company Anglo American attributed a 9 percent drop in platinum production at its Rustenburg operations in 2023 to a five-day water stoppage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is also essential for handling waste gases, wastewater, and radioactive by-products generated during production. For each ton of rare earths produced, the process generates approximately 13 kilograms of dust, between 9,600 and 12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-energy&quot;&gt;5. Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is among the most energy-intensive industries worldwide. It accounts for approximately 38 percent of global industrial energy use and around 15 percent of total electricity consumption globally. The complexity of separating and processing rare earths makes it especially energy intensive. Separating a single ton of rare earths can require 9–13 times initial extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a rare earth processing hub will require significant energy investments. While Australia has substantial energy capacity, its high energy prices remain a barrier to low-cost processing. In contrast, Saudi Arabia is rapidly positioning itself as a global leader in energy affordability and availability, underpinned by record-breaking investments in renewables. Its Al Ghat wind project holds the world record for the lowest electricity cost from wind power at just 1.56558 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the Wa’ad al Shamal project follows closely at 1.70187 cents per kWh. Saudi Arabia also holds the world’s lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar photovoltaics, making it unparalleled in affordable renewable power. These strategic investments have positioned the kingdom to emerge as a major player in mineral processing, with ambitions to rank among the world’s top seven mineral processors by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-ease-of-doing-business&quot;&gt;6. Ease of Doing Business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing and manufacturing facilities are subject to a number of permits, taxes, and regulations that can increase the complexity and overall cost of operating. Countries with opaque laws, burdensome red tape, and export restrictions make long-term investments in large-scale mineral refining more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the development of a commercially viable rare earth processing hub faces two regulatory challenges. First, permitting delays continue to hamper project execution. For example, Lynas Rare Earths has halted construction of its planned HREE processing facility in Seadrift due to delays in securing a key wastewater disposal permit. Without this authorization, site development cannot proceed, placing the project’s target of becoming operational by 2026 in jeopardy and risking further delays to production. Second, recent revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit create uncertainty for long-term investment. In 2024, MP Materials received $12.2 million in benefits through this credit. However, the recently passed federal budget includes a phaseout of the 45X credit by 2033—a timeline that does not align with the multi-year development horizons typical of rare earth processing facilities. This limited incentive window weakens the commercial case for expanding domestic rare earth capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Australia score highly for having regulatory systems that encourage business investments. Australia has taken significant strides to create an enabling tax environment: In early 2025, Australia’s parliament passed a law to give production tax credits worth 10 percent of processing and refining costs for 31 critical minerals, including REEs, with the intent of attracting more minerals processing to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has also implemented a new regulatory regime for the mining sector to foster the industry. In 2021, it implemented a new Mining Investment Law, a comprehensive set of reforms designed to support the country’s critical minerals ambitions laid out in its Vision 2030 and, specifically, to attract foreign private investment. The legislation includes a streamlined licensing process whereby exploration licenses are issued for up to 15 years and mining licenses for 60 years. Under the law, Saudi Arabia has seen a 138 percent increase in exploration licenses since 2021. The Mining Investment Law is further supported by new incentive programs. For example, the Global Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative offers $2.7 billion in incentives to strengthen critical domestic mineral supply chains. The initiative has already led to over $9 billion in investment deals, including a partnership with Australia’s Hastings Technology Metals to establish a fully integrated rare earth downstream processing supply chain in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Brazil’s minerals licensing processes are a major impediment to the development of its minerals sector. The regulatory landscape is complex, as companies are required to navigate federal, state, and local regulations that are sometimes inconsistent. Due to burdensome red tape, obtaining a mining license in Brazil takes an average of 16 years. The CEO of the Brazilian Mining Association has noted that other countries take half to one-third the time Brazil does to approve licenses and believes that minerals investments in Brazil could be even greater if the processes were streamlined. In January 2025, Brazil announced $815 million in financing for projects aimed at boosting development of critical minerals and rare earths in the country, but rare earth company Meteoric Resources is still struggling to finance its Caldeira project in Brazil. Unless bureaucratic challenges are addressed, these financing incentives will not catalyze the amount of private investment needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-exploration-investment&quot;&gt;7. Exploration Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rare earth deposits are being actively mapped and discovered worldwide, fueled by growing investment from mining companies focused on geologically promising regions. Exploration spending plays a vital role—not only in identifying commercially viable deposits, but also in sending important signals to midstream processors about which jurisdictions are advancing as future sources of reliable feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia currently leads the world in REE exploration, accounting for 42.9 percent of global exploration spending aimed at identifying new mining opportunities. This sustained investment has played a key role in recent discoveries of dysprosium, a heavy rare earth vital to reducing global dependence on China’s supply chains. Outside Australia, countries like Brazil, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia are also seeing increased interest in REE exploration. Across Africa, rare earth exploration is gaining momentum, with South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, and Namibia ranking among the top 10 destinations for exploration investment in 2024. This trend signals a strategic shift as these nations actively prepare for future production and seek to strengthen their role in global critical mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-operation-costs&quot;&gt;8. Operation Costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor, water, energy, processing materials, and technology costs make rare earth processing a high-cost endeavor with slim profit margins. This price environment creates additional challenges for REE processors struggling amid such tight margins, and low operation costs are a significant determinant of whether a hub can be competitive. Chinese rare earth processing operations remain the most cost-efficient in the world due to lower labor costs, fewer environmental and regulatory hurdles, and the achievement of large-scale operations that absorb large volumes of feedstock and sustain profitability. While little data exists on the exact costs of rare earth processing due to limited facilities outside of China, operating costs for other commodities offer a benchmark to estimate comparative costs for REE operations, given they require similar inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s lowest-cost rare earth producers can make a kilogram of rare earth oxide for $11 or less. These are mostly hard rock mines, which tend to have higher concentrations of LREEs. Many of these mines are already in operation, including China’s Baiyun Ebo and the Sichuan hard rock projects, which are among the largest global suppliers. The U.S.-based Mountain Pass mine and Australia’s Mount Weld also operate at competitive costs, though they produce smaller volumes. A cost-competitive mineral processing hub depends on more than just securing competitively priced raw material feedstock; it also requires reliable access to low-cost energy, efficient transportation infrastructure, advanced processing technologies, and affordable, skilled labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-research-and-development&quot;&gt;9. Research and Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing R&amp;amp;D is essential for advancing innovative technologies that improve the efficiency of rare earth separation and refining processes. Continued investment in R&amp;amp;D enables the development of new methods that consume less water and energy, reduce environmental impacts, and maximize the recovery of high-quality materials from lower volumes of raw feedstock. As global demand for rare earths intensifies—particularly for use in advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and defense applications—enhancing processing efficiency and reducing associated costs will be critical to ensuring long-term supply security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that make significant R&amp;amp;D investments are better positioned to lead in the development of next-generation rare earth processing technologies. These nations are more likely to allocate resources to specialized REE initiatives, including advanced material science research, the deployment of cutting-edge separation technologies, and the exploration of alternative, environmentally sustainable refining techniques. Japan and Australia lead the way in total R&amp;amp;D investment as a percentage of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few countries lead the way in developing critical minerals and REE-specific R&amp;amp;D initiatives to support the development of the strategic sector. The Australian Critical Minerals R&amp;amp;D Hub is working to boost international cooperation on critical minerals R&amp;amp;D. The hub includes rare earth and downstream processing initiatives led by government agencies working in partnership with industry and universities to boost technical capacity. Japan has the Center for Rare Earths Research within its Muroran Institute of Technology, as well as a joint initiative with Vietnam to improve REE extraction and processing at the Rare Earth Research and Technology Transfer Centre in Hanoi. The initiative was launched in 2012 as Japan looked to strengthen and diversify its REE supply chains in response to a 2010 Chinese REE export ban. In July 2025, Japan announced that it would begin “test mining” for REEs extracted through deep-sea mining near Minamitori Island, 1,900 kilometers off the coast of Tokyo, as early as January 2026. These initiatives are critical to unlocking the next generation of processing technology and finding innovative ways to boost profitability and compete against Chinese adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-political-stability&quot;&gt;10. Political Stability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, political stability is crucial to the success of any long-term business venture but especially in the mining and minerals industry, which is prone to social unrest, asset seizure, and export bans. Rare earth processing hubs are most effectively established in countries with a low risk of political violence or instability that could disrupt operations. Stable, predictable policy environments also provide investors with greater assurance that regulatory frameworks will remain consistent, reducing the risk of unexpected policy shifts that could negatively affect business operations. In the 2023 Fraser Annual Survey of the mining industry, 54 percent of Canadian respondents and 52 percent of Australian respondents indicated that political stability was a key factor encouraging investment in their countries. In contrast, only 5 percent of respondents expressed the same confidence regarding South Africa, highlighting the challenges of attracting investment in regions with political instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper applies the 10 previously outlined criteria to systematically assess and quantify the performance of 10 selected countries in each area. The objective is to provide a data-driven evaluation of which countries are best positioned to develop into cost-competitive hubs for rare earth processing. Each country was assigned a score from 1 to 3 across all ten categories, with the specific quantitative thresholds used to determine these scores detailed in Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By analyzing these countries across a standardized framework, the authors aim to highlight comparative advantages and identify critical gaps that may facilitate or hinder their ability to attract investment, establish competitive processing infrastructure, and integrate into global REE supply chains. This approach not only supports strategic decisionmaking for policymakers and investors but also offers practical insights into where future development efforts and policy initiatives should be concentrated to strengthen global rare earth processing capabilities. Ultimately, this analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based ranking of countries based on their potential to emerge as leading centers for rare earth processing, taking into account both current capabilities and future opportunities for growth and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States emerges as the front runner as a global rare earth processing hub, scoring 2.7 out of 3.0. Several factors position the U.S. as an ideal location for rare earth processing: In addition to adequate infrastructure, ample feedstock, and significant R&amp;amp;D investment, recent policy developments position the U.S. to become a leader in REE processing. First and foremost, the U.S. government has made a firm commitment to develop REE processing and magnet manufacturing capabilities in the form of the DOD’s $400 million equity investment in MP Materials with price support and guaranteed offtake of its permanent magnets. LREE and HREE processing facilities under construction in Texas and California will be well-suited to process rare earth feedstock from around the world for secure magnet supply chains independent of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia (2.6/3.0), Saudi Arabia (2.6/3.0), and Canada (2.5/3.0) are also top performers in the index. Australia and Saudi Arabia are strengthening commercial ties to the United States to co-develop rare earth magnet supply chains through firms such as Lynas Rare Earths and Maaden. These three countries also possess strong infrastructure, regulatory environments, and exploration budgets that are creating enabling environments for rare earth supply chain development. These countries will be key partners for the U.S. to build rare earth supply chains outside of China capable of meeting both defense and commercial industry needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed breakdown of how each country performed across the 10 indicators can be found in Appendixes A and B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing resilient and cost-competitive rare earth supply chains is one of today’s most pressing strategic imperatives. As global demand for REEs accelerates—driven by their critical role in defense systems, advanced technologies, and the clean energy transition—the United States and its allies must take decisive action to reduce their dependence on China’s dominant midstream processing capabilities. Without significant investment in both domestic and international processing hubs, as well as renewed focus on R&amp;amp;D, the West will remain vulnerable to supply disruptions and economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis demonstrates that no single country possesses all the necessary factors to independently establish a fully competitive and resilient rare earth supply chain. A successful strategy must therefore combine domestic efforts with targeted international partnerships. Countries such as Australia, Canada, and Saudi Arabia offer strong foundations for processing hubs thanks to their financing commitments to develop REE processing capabilities, stable political environments, advanced infrastructure, and robust R&amp;amp;D ecosystems. While not all of these countries are currently producing large quantities of rare earths, they have the characteristics that provide promising opportunities to develop new hubs, supported by favorable investment climates, abundant energy resources, and increasing REE exploration activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing midstream hubs in strategic locations will provide essential economies of scale, reduce transportation and processing costs, and facilitate greater collaboration between mining operations and advanced manufacturing sectors. Equally important is the need to revitalize R&amp;amp;D initiatives to drive technological innovation in processing methods, improve resource efficiency, and reduce environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet urgent national security and economic objectives, the United States must pursue a dual-track approach: (1) rapidly building domestic REE processing and magnet manufacturing capacity while (2) working with trusted allies to establish global processing hubs. This integrated strategy will strengthen supply chain resilience, promote innovation, and ensure that the materials critical to modern economies and defense capabilities remain secure and accessible. Without swift and coordinated action, the window to counter China’s entrenched dominance will continue to narrow, placing critical technologies, industries, and security interests at ongoing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from the work of Alexis de Tocqueville, CSIS Futures Lab sees an emergent role for artificial intelligence (AI) benchmarking—independent studies that test and evaluate AI performance in domain-specific tasks—as a new mechanism for ensuring accountability in a free society. Through adapting Tocqueville’s concept of association, AI agents can be held accountable, thus ensuring a more open and transparent society. For Tocqueville, association was the “mother science” of life in a democracy that illuminated moral truths, fostered public virtue, and guarded against social isolation. In a world of algorithmic reasoning, association is no longer confined to human debates in the public square: It has taken on a technical dimension that involves testing and evaluating AI foundation models to help the body politic understand their strengths and weaknesses as well as push firms to fine-tune their models to meet specific user needs. This process must be independent and transparent to ensure the free exchange of ideas in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, AI benchmarking is a central task in a free society that embraces AI technology. Furthermore, to preserve its independence, the process should be open and free of direct government or business sector control. True association is bottom-up and maximizes transparency and accountability. In an era where individual actors—whether analysts or citizens—are increasingly reliant on opaque agentic workflows, collective action through transparent, domain-specific model evaluation is essential. Without such associations to mediate the influence of AI in national security and foreign policy, decisionmaking risks becoming centralized, brittle, and divorced from democratic oversight. Worse still, the polarization that defines online discourse in the modern United States will be overrun by narrow, self-interested factions convinced of the rightness of their causes by never-ending feedback loops of tailored information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in this light, there is a mix of public and private sector action needed to create a world where technology and democracy are co-constituted and thrive, a new town square where algorithms help mitigate—as opposed to reinforce—bias and create the possibility of open dialogue and civic association. First, the public sector needs to pursue legislation that encourages private sector, independent model benchmarking. This push should include a mix of funding for efforts at nonprofits, including universities, and exploring which congressional committee has the authorities to call for routine hearings on model benchmarks. Second, legislators should encourage collaboration between civil society and AI firms through experimenting with legal incentives. Third, and most importantly, the United States’ foundations need to come together to fund multiple benchmarking initiatives to preserve the independence of this modern form of association and accountability. To ensure its role in holding algorithms accountable, benchmarking should be free of both government and industry interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. A defense analyst struggles to keep up with the array of incoming information on adversary troop movements near a contested border region. A combination of autonomous systems, infantry units, and air assets are already in the area. Moreover, some reports suggest that the adversary may be preparing precision long-range strike capabilities targeting the contested border, should a conflict break out. Pressured to demonstrate their resolve by an array of computational propaganda bots amplifying extreme nationalist views, political leaders on both sides have implied that they will not back down in the dispute. However, the analyst has been made aware that backdoor negotiations are underway in an attempt to avoid further crisis escalation. Circumstances are unfolding rapidly, uncertainty is high, and defense leaders are demanding a recommended course of action from the analyst immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyst is equipped with a decision support agent leveraging live intelligence feeds, other relevant information, and a large language model (LLM)-enabled natural language chat interface. Based on the current information and its underlying training data, the decision support system recommends that an escalatory policy, in which use of force occurs, is the best course of action. The analyst, however, is hesitant. Her gut says to avoid escalatory behavior, but the decision support system is pushing for the exact opposite. Her superiors are increasingly demanding of her recommendation due to tight operational timelines, but she is unsure of the exact reasoning behind the decision support system’s recommendation to use force. Moreover, she is not abreast of the data and training processes the system has undergone. While the final decision on what to recommend does lay in her hands, she is worried that her decision is being nudged toward a course of action by a complicated system she does not entirely understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily in this case, the situation was simply a crisis simulation helping benchmark a new decision support agent within an AI-enabled military command system. However, the tensions that are a part of this fictional scenario are increasingly very real. And they extend beyond national security to economics, energy policy, and even online discourses that shape how people mobilize in their communities and exercise their right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both citizens and government institutions around the world are experimenting with integrating AI agents into their daily lives, including in decisionmaking contexts. AI agents that perceive the environment, make decisions, and recommend actions are increasingly ubiquitous, further blurring the line between human and machine. As a consequence, it is likely that, in the near future, defense and foreign policy analysts, as well as city councils and even individual voters, will be faced with the question of whether to trust AI agents in critical circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting situation leaves society at large with a choice. Citizens and institutions could passively rely on opaque and complicated systems that harness AI agents to augment decisionmaking. Alternatively, a free people could endeavor to achieve an active approach to broad and robust civic engagement with such systems to better understand, evaluate, and shape human-machine interactions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues for the second option and suggests that it is unwise to leave either the public or the private sector to be the sole arbitrators for evaluating the use of AI agents, especially when such agents inform political and national security decisions. A fundamental element to implementing this approach will be successfully developing methodologies for continuous and robust benchmarking and evaluation of AI foundation models and derivative agents in contexts where ground truth may not exist, information is subject to abrupt change, and uncertainty reigns. Moreover, such approaches must be transparent, plural, and feature shared responsibility across a broad spectrum of U.S. society. No one party, no one government agency, and no single corporate cabal should control the ability of free people to exchange ideas and shape their society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes of benchmarking and evaluation can be developed and practiced not only as abstract technical or regulatory tasks, but also—and primarily—as a form of civil association essential to preserving democratic judgment in an era of increasing digital dependency. That is the core proposition of this report and its recommendations for ensuring that the benchmarking process is free from government or industry control and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make its case, this report revisits Tocqueville’s arguments about U.S. society from his work Democracy in America, as well as other writings in democratic theory, political philosophy, and governance, suggesting that such perspectives can inform an approach on model benchmarking and evaluation that incorporates civil society and leverages the associative potential of different forms of actors across the United States to build a robust and accountable space for agentic AI to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tocquevilles-warning-and-the-civil-society-imperative&quot;&gt;Tocqueville’s Warning and the Civil Society Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though first published in the nineteenth century, Tocqueville’s Democracy in America holds contemporary relevance for thinking about how to ensure democratic accountability in the era of agentic AI. Two related factors are most pertinent to this report: (1) the possible detrimental effects of isolation, and (2) the corrective and beneficial consequences of associations. These factors are relevant in the context of AI agents in that delegating social action to AI could increase isolation and reduce human agency in governance decisions absent proper benchmarking and fine-tuning. However, robust collective human involvement within processes of agentic AI development and evaluation hold the potential to make the integration of agentic AI into society an associational process, thus reducing isolation rather than exacerbating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his study, Tocqueville expressed concern regarding isolation in democratic life. Because democracies emphasize equality among citizens, each person is free to pursue their own interests and desires. The result is a generally individualistic social structure. Individualism, in the context of agentic AI, further incentivizes the risk of abdicating governance decisions to technology as citizens see to their own individual lives and daily priorities. The consequence could include leaving technological development and implementation to private companies and government actors with little-to-no public input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Tocqueville, despite citizen equality, left to their own devices, equity and individualism can also lead to isolation—and isolation can lead to weakness and the threat of despotism. As he argued, “the vices fostered by tyranny are exactly those supported by equality. These two things are complementary and mutually supportive, with fatal results.” Moreover, apart from the risk of tyranny, Tocqueville wrote that isolation leads to impotence in that alone, “citizens can achieve almost nothing.” As AI agents are increasingly deployed across public and private life, further isolation could easily lead to a public that simply—even unconsciously—accepts a version of AI’s integration into practices of governance that challenge democratic principles and limit human capacity to exercise political agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Tocqueville, the counterweight to the consequences of isolation and its threat to democratic governance was the formation of civil associations between citizens to take on problems of mutual concern, generate social cohesion, and foster care for others within an otherwise individualistic context. The goals of associations can range from building local community centers to variable commercial interests, among many others, in which citizens realize and pursue common bonds. Tocqueville emphasized the critical nature of associations, writing “in democratic countries, the knowledge of how to form associations is the mother of all knowledge since the success of all others depends on it.” Thus, the fear is a surrender to a despotic state if associations, and their various positive effects, fail to form. Accordingly, within the context of agentic AI, associations can serve as a key check against the narrow interests of society’s most powerful actors and even foster collective democratic practices guiding the technology’s development and deployment in a fashion that has diffuse benefits across the U.S. public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tocqueville’s discussion of the risk of isolation and the need for association creates a framework for thinking about how to balance the efficiency gains of AI agents with the desire to maintain a free society. In a range of contexts, AI agents are replacing expert judgments and determining important life outcomes, including in the domains of medicine, bank loans, and even governance decisions, among others. If broader society passively—and uncritically—accepts algorithmically shaped decisionmaking procedures, it risks surrendering to an antidemocratic version of algorithmic governance, or a way of “social ordering” that incorporates algorithmic procedures into decisionmaking in which these computational systems may opaquely shape government processes and life outcomes. As one assessment suggests, “advances in machine-learning—or artificial intelligence—portend a future in which many governmental decisions will no longer be made by people, but [rather] by computer-processed algorithms,” presenting an “emerging threat” to liberty and democracy. To map this on to Tocqueville’s framework, instead of surrendering to the pull of tyrannical government, absent the corrective forces of associations, broader democratic society risks surrendering to an antisocial, nondemocratic version of algorithmic governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, scholars have shown that civil society can act as a pillar of accountability and an additional form of checks and balances within governance structures. For this reason, a brief review of social scientific work on the relationship between civil society and governance, as well as the possible impact of technology, is a useful exercise. While the modern version of the term “civil society” has been deployed at least as far back as the late eighteenth century, more contemporary expressions of the term, particularly in the work of U.S. political scientist Robert Putnam, have had broader impact in popular discussions of modern democracy. As U.S. sociologist Larry Diamond argued in 1994, “no phenomenon has more vividly captured the imagination of democratic scholars, observers, and activists alike than ‘civil society.’” For the purposes of this discussion, following Larry Diamond’s definition, civil society refers to sets of organized social groups that members voluntarily join, create, and support, and that are generally autonomous from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have attempted to demonstrate the important role that civil society can play in shaping political outcomes. For example, Putnam’s work on civil society in Italy argues that robust networks of civic engagement hold a range of benefits for social cooperation, including increasing defection costs, fostering norms of reciprocity, and demonstrating the benefits of community collaboration. In turn, he suggests that this form of civic activity—and the subsequent development of social capital—supports high-functioning democratic institutions. Putnam expands his argument beyond Italy. Drawing from Tocqueville, Putnam argues, “Tocqueville was right: democratic government is strengthened, not weakened, when it faces vigorous civil society.” As summed up by sociologist Sydney Tarrow, Putnam’s basic argument is that “for where there is no social capital … democracy cannot flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other scholars also emphasize the important links between civil association, democracy, and the spread of liberal norms and values. The study of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) is a prominent example of the relationship between governance and civil society organizations. Scholars focusing on international politics have argued, for instance, that NGOs work as key norm entrepreneurs for the expansion of liberal human rights regimes. Moreover, NGOs can constrain government action by applying public pressure through advocacy (i.e., naming and shaming), increasing the normative costs for pursuing policies that result in things such as human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from internationally oriented NGOs, researchers contest that, under the right conditions—such as sufficient levels of free press and political competition—robust and active civil society organizations can reduce government corruption and increase accountability. Moreover, civil society organizations can participate in processes of public oversight and information sharing that can increase the transparency and accountability of governing institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture, however, is not always so clear, and the impact of technology, particularly digital technology, on civil associations and democracy remains murky. Spanish social theorist Manuel Castells, for example, notes that technological changes have introduced a “networked society” that has fundamentally altered communicative practices and transformed “space and time in the human experience.” As such, technological changes have altered the basic ways in which individuals and groups in societies are linked together. Scholars express different perspectives on how technological factors will shape the role and structure of civil society. Some, such as technology expert Lee Rainie and sociologist Barry Wellman, suspect that such technological changes, particularly in the form of information and communication technologies (ICTs), improve the prospects of robust socialization and community building. Others argue that ICTs offer the prospect of more impactful activism in restricted political environments due to ICTs’ capacity to “facilitate open and inclusive participation.” Still other scholars express concern over the role that technology will play in social organizations and democratic structures. Returning to Castells, he suggests that one consequence of the networked society could be a destruction of organizations and the “delegitimating” of institutions, leading to the prospect of social alienation. Moreover, research finds that, in some contexts, social media can decrease satisfaction with democracy, and scholars studying authoritarianism have argued that digital technologies can increase state capacity for repression of democratic freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of additional importance is the co-constitutive relationship between science, technology, and society. All too commonly, technology is treated simply as a variable (or tool) that impacts the social world in a direct way. Thus, in terms of civil society, technologies such as the internet will either help or hurt such organizations. Yet, the relationship is far more dynamic and dependent “on a complex pattern of interactions” between the social and technological. The majority of peoples’ interactions with each other and their environment are increasingly mediated through technology in general, and AI agents in particular. Humans may have made AI, but AI agents shape how people interact with their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few examples from the daily practices of scientific laboratories as well as broader implementations of technology in public policy domains will help to illustrate this point. Social theorists Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar demonstrate that even within the most pure scientific location—i.e., the laboratory—social factors still shape and direct scientific findings. Others, such as political theorist Langdon Winner, discuss how technologies are not neutral artifacts, but, in fact, can have crucial implications for power relationships and political outcomes within broader society. The intentional construction of bridges in Long Island, New York, to be too short for buses to pass under illustrates the role technology can play in power (and political) relationships. The goal in limiting the availability of public transportation in this way was to restrict poorer, typically minority, populations from accessing beaches and public areas served by the roads, as these groups commonly relied on public transit over more expensive modes of transportation, such as the automobile. Moreover, technological discoveries are not divorced from the social structures of power in which they are produced, and broader social imaginations of technology can shape the direction of technological developments. The upshot of these wider effects is that there are critical choices to be made in technological design, implementation, and execution that, as those decisions are shaped by broader social structures and sequences of interactions, also have far-reaching social and political impacts. As Winner writes, “technologies are ways of building order in our world.” Thus, when applied to the question of the relationship between AI—specifically agentic AI decisionmaking—and civil society, associational politics can play a crucial role in building socio-technical orders that favor democratic outcomes and processes. However, this will not happen automatically. In simple terms, it is imperative to proactively create a relationship between AI and society that enables democracy and responds effectively to the political interests of everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between robust civil association and democracy is further complicated by empirical work that responded to Putnam’s initial arguments suggesting robust civil society was the tonic for democratic governance. For example, a range of studies have documented cases in which civil society organizations have had detrimental effects on democratic outcomes. U.S. political scientist Sheri Berman’s work on civil society in the German Weimar period, for example, illustrates how the Nazi party was able to co-opt aspects of robust German civil organizations in a fashion that supported the rise of fascism. Further research demonstrates similar dynamics in Spain and Italy during the end of the nineteenth and into the twentieth century. Consequently, contextual and historical factors matter in how strong civic associations shape democratic outcomes. While Putnam did emphasize this fact, he was perhaps wrong in then generalizing the relationship of civic association, social capital, and democracy to other cases so deterministically. Yet, while we might not be able to isolate a consistent democratic effect of associations across time and space, this does not mean that civic associations and civil society cannot serve as practical tools in a larger tool kit for addressing broader issues of accountability and transparency related to artificial intelligence. Here we can draw lessons from the political theory of American pragmatism, which emphasizes social problem-solving oriented around joint public goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism highlights the “diversity of perspectives that different individuals and organizations bring to the definition of the problems, and to the generation of possible solutions.” As U.S. political scientist Christopher Ansell notes, “pragmatism is usefully described as a philosophy of evolutionary learning. It emphasizes the ability of both individuals and communities to improve their knowledge and problem-solving capacity over time through continuous inquiry, reflection, deliberation, and experimentation.” While pragmatism is dynamic in its broader philosophical commitments, a constant thread, particularly when connected to public-oriented governance, is an “emphasis on the open-ended process of refining values and knowledge.” In addition, this line of theory suggests the critical nature of learning through encountering tangible problems that require resolution, sometimes referred to as a “problem situation,” a context in which actors must creatively and experimentally find resolutions to new dilemmas. In fact, some scholars have emphasized how pragmatist philosophy can link practical, solution-oriented approaches to “grand problems” with high levels of complexity and uncertainty by offering a “situated, distributed, and processual approach to problem solving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deliberative, action-oriented, experimental view can be supported by associational politics emphasized by Tocqueville, as well as by more contemporary lessons from scholarship on civil society. Consequently, it’s worth synthesizing some of the above discussion into more concise takeaways. Fundamentally, from Tocqueville to modern research on democracy, under the right conditions, civil society groups have been shown to be important component parts of governance due to their capacity to unify citizen interests and improve the accountability and transparency of governing organizations. As a caution, however, research also demonstrates that civic organizations are not simply vacant objects of social good; they need specific social forces oriented toward democratic action. To draw on U.S. philosopher John Dewey, democracy is not something that perpetuates itself automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, civil associations need to be positioned around democratic goals and social action. One way is to orient organizations toward joint problems facing large cross-sections of democratic society, including the case of governing and evaluating AI systems. Deliberation and communication will be fundamental to this form of associative politics, as through these processes actors can realize joint interests and civil associations can vocalize and propose creative solutions to communal problems. While technology can complicate these relationships, experimental problem-solving can create a link between society and technology that nudges the development of AI toward accountability, transparency, and democracy. Critically, if people, firms, and government entities are going to use AI agents to inform decisions, of paramount importance is transparency and accountability related to the information and technological systems used to make those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;model-benchmarking-as-a-new-art-of-association&quot;&gt;Model Benchmarking as a New Art of Association&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New forms of association can play important roles in combating the consequences of a passively accepted version of algorithmic governance, and its subsequent detrimental impact on democratic society. One such connection is in the practice of benchmarking and evaluating AI models. Though this report leverages the empirical domain of national security as an example because it is the research team’s area of expertise, this argument applies to other areas of governance and society more broadly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin this conversation, it’s worth reviewing what benchmarking is. Benchmarks are datasets designed to evaluate model performance on a specific set of tasks. The processes of benchmarking and evaluating models have become increasingly important as models are deployed in a range of situations that have real-world consequences. Successful benchmarking and evaluation of models not only allow for tracking model improvements but can also identify risks of models that do not perform at an adequate level for the desired use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, benchmarks have been developed to test model performance on tasks such as knowledge recall, quantitative reasoning, and other academic tasks. Other benchmarks focus on harmful social biases with respect to gender or race. Additionally, the research team at the CSIS Futures Lab has developed a benchmark, and associated methodology, for tracking model preferences with respect to critical foreign policy decisions in contexts such as crisis escalation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful evaluation processes can be made more robust through associative practices that unite diverse teams of researchers, policymakers, and civil society actors to steer technological development away from opaque technological systems and toward a form of social organization in which AI public literacy is high, and a wide range of players have a say in the form of technology that is deployed in the public domain. In more tangible terms, this will require ongoing processes of domain-specific data creation and the testing and evaluation of models before and after deployment in contextually relevant scenarios. Key to the practice of benchmarking is the fact that, as Raji et al. argue, “the imagined artifact of a ‘general’ benchmark does not actually exist … presenting any single dataset in this way is ultimately dangerous and deceptive.” Moreover, issues of construct validity—“the degree to which a test or measurement tool accurately measures the construct it intends to measure”—and certain private sector actors successfully gaming benchmark results can problematically skew the reality of model performance. Such conclusions point to the critical nature of having a wide range of experts and actors in the evaluative process of benchmarking highly specialized, yet broadly critical, domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, such processes must be overseen by organizations with the public’s interest at heart. Here, the information environment will be fundamental. Returning to Tocqueville, information sharing is critical for successful association to occur. Only through making interests and opinions of individuals available for consumption in the public domain can joint interests be realized and successful associations forged. In Tocqueville’s era, local newspapers, as well as townhalls, were the key vector for information transfer. While a broader range of communicative technologies exists today, a core lesson is clear—without communicating facts of interest to broader publics, the risk of isolation increases. When applied to AI, and specifically the task of benchmarking and evaluation, this means transparency and broad-based communication of technological risks and uses are essential to ensuring the public’s interest. Binding interested actors into a dense, yet transparent, web of association has the potential to shape AI’s use in governance away from the consequences of “dead hand” algorithmic governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent a form of Tocquevillian association related to AI development, the risk is that social passivity gives way to co-option and control of this general-purpose technology to private interests, ceding technological development to a narrower set of goals driven by a select few. Robust associative politics centered around the technology of AI, specifically with respect to evaluation and benchmarking, increase the probability of a strong democratic process working in coordination with efforts of integrating and developing new technologies. This is important as research illustrates that socio-technical relationships structure human agency and can have path-dependent effects as certain relational structures become stabilized, a process in science and technology studies frequently called closure. Because the contemporary era is one in which socio-technical relations with respect to AI are still somewhat flexible, broader U.S. society has its greatest opportunity to structure a relationship more favorable to public—democratic—interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-general-review-of-us-ai-policy&quot;&gt;A General Review of U.S. AI Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to initiate a process of associational benchmarking must embed itself within ongoing policy developments in AI. The last three presidential administrations have proposed a range of approaches to both governing AI and incentivizing its integration across the private and public sectors. A review of these developments will provide a basis for building out the associative model of benchmarking governance discussed below. In 2019, Trump signed an executive order (EO) entitled “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.” This order had a number of goals, including providing a foundation for AI innovation; integrating AI across federal agencies; fostering collaboration between government, the private sector, and academia; and developing technical standards, with the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) acting as the coordinating agency. The order sought to balance an innovation-friendly context for AI with the need to protect civil liberties and U.S. values. While the EO established a set of AI-related objectives, some criticized it for lacking details on both funding and practical implementation. That said, later in 2019, the Trump administration released the National AI R&amp;amp;D Strategic Plan: 2019, which outlined a strategy of federal investment into the research and development of AI. The plan included eight specific goals supporting the earlier EO: making long-term investments in AI research; better understanding how AI and humans can work together; addressing ethical and societal implications of the technology; advancing the security and safety of AI; developing data sets for technology development; evaluating AI through standards and benchmarks; seeing to workforce implications; and fostering public-private partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first Trump administration’s efforts related to AI policy mention the need to establish fair, transparent, accountable, and ethical AI, the Biden administration furthered such efforts through the release of what the administration termed a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in 2022. This framework underscored the threats advances in AI posed to democratic processes and the rights of U.S. citizens, specifically related to bias and privacy. To attempt to address such issues, the Biden administration, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, identified five principles guiding “the design, use, and deployment of automated systems.” These principles were that AI systems should be safe and effective, that AI systems should not propagate biases or discrimination, that there must be protections from abusive data practices, that users should be aware when they are interacting with an automated system, and finally, that there should be clear human alternatives and fallbacks for any problems users have when interacting with AI-enabled systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This served as a platform for the eventual signing of the Biden administration’s 2023 EO “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The 2023 EO focused on ensuring that the United States remained the leader in “safe, ethical, and responsible” AI use and, to that end, directed federal agencies to establish processes “managing dual-use AI models, implementing rigorous testing protocols for high-risk AI systems, enforcing accountability measures, safeguarding civil rights, and promoting transparency across the AI lifecycle.” An additional key event occurring alongside the Biden EO was the establishment of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (U.S. AISI), a part of NIST, which was tasked with testing models, conducting red-teaming, and attempting to identify risks from increasingly advanced systems, including those with national security implications. Moreover, following guidance from the initial EO, in 2024, the administration released a memo focused on integrating AI into the national security enterprise in a fashion that both leveraged technological advances while also protecting human and civil rights. The Biden administration’s efforts continued through the final days of his presidency, with a second EO released in January of 2025, focusing on AI infrastructure and directing federal agencies to find eligible lands that could be used for “frontier AI” data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Trump’s election to a second term, the new administration quickly sought to stamp its authority on the direction of U.S. AI policy. The Trump administration quickly revoked elements of the Biden administration’s executive action, suggesting that the latter had imposed “onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI.” The Trump team replaced Biden’s executive guidance with an EO entitled “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.” This late-January 2025 EO positioned the Trump administration, at least in terms of rhetoric, as far more innovation friendly than its predecessors. Furthermore, the EO provided guidance that relevant agency heads, as well as various presidential technology advisers, should review actions described within the Biden EO for revision or rescindment. The 2025 Trump EO, while short and relatively scant on details, directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to release additional guidance on AI implementation throughout the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this directive, in the spring of 2025, the OMB released two memos further laying out the Trump administration’s approach to AI policy. In general terms, the memos contain guidance for federal agencies to speed up AI innovation and adoption in relevant use cases while also improving public trust in the technology. Moreover, and in contrast to initial indications from the Trump administration, the OMB memos shared many elements with previous Biden policies. One significant change in the policy, however, is the combining of issues related to “rights” and “safety” impacting AI into a single category called “high-impact AI.” That said, as described by a Brookings report, “the continuity [between administrations] is more striking than the change” as both administrations’ approaches appear similar on issues such as technology acquisition and the promotion of AI use throughout government. Yet, a June 2025 change may illustrate the Trump team’s desire to appear more innovation friendly with respect to AI: The AISA has been renamed the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI). According to the CAISI, the organization will act as the “primary point of contact” for industry members in the U.S. government to assist with testing, securing, and implementing AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as indicated by the above review, AI policy in the United States is progressing. However, civil society and robust benchmarking practices must serve as checks and balances to ensure that the technology functions as intended for broader society. Positioning the United States as a leading AI superpower should be accompanied less by regulation than by a robust benchmarking effort that brings civil society into the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-case-of-ai-in-foreign-policy-decisionmaking&quot;&gt;The Case of AI in Foreign Policy Decisionmaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this more tangible, the following section relies on an empirical discussion of the Futures Lab’s efforts at benchmarking model preferences in foreign policy decisionmaking contexts as well as a review of literature in the field of international relations focusing on the relationship between civil society and foreign policy decisionmaking. Research in international relations has long explored the links between democratic regime type and foreign policy outcomes. For example, democratic peace theory suggests that democracies, whether as a result of institutional structures or normative elements, tend to not go to war with one another. Other scholars have illustrated that, due to fear of electoral punishment, public opinion related to foreign policy can shape leader preferences, particularly when issue salience is high. However, research has also illustrated that the type of information environment—specifically how information flows from political elites to publics—is critical to the extent to which publics can constrain decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, advances in digital technology have led some to argue that the constraining effects of democratic publics on elite decisionmakers may be eroded as constituents are further “fragmented and siloed” so that voters support their leaders, regardless of the leaders’ policy decisions. Thus, drawing on the field of international relations, research illustrates that mechanisms for constraining foreign policy decisionmakers can be created within democracies; however, information environments, particularly in the context of the internet, can challenge these processes of constraint. To put this into simple terms, while there are ways to ensure that democratic publics can influence foreign policy decisions, digital technologies present novel challenges to that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, advances in AI have the potential to further erode feedback mechanisms between democratic publics and foreign policy experts as the technology is integrated into foreign policy decisionmaking. The Futures Lab’s findings related to its benchmarking of LLMs in foreign policy decision contexts can assist in illustrating this point. Results from the Critical Foreign Policy Decisions (CFPD) benchmark demonstrate that some LLMs are significantly more escalatory in decision scenarios when compared to other models. For example, models such as DeepSeekV2, Qwen2 72B, and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct all tend to prefer recommending the use of force when compared to other LLMs included in the study. These escalatory preferences are particularly salient in scenarios where models are prompted to recommend courses of action for democratic countries, like the United States and United Kingdom, versus autocratic countries, such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario in which models are integrated into decision pathways (and are not continuously and robustly evaluated for their risk profiles in a transparent fashion) and nudge decisionmakers toward escalation, in the context of, for example, a Taiwan Strait crisis. While it is highly unlikely that LLMs would ever make such a critical decision alone, if models are leveraged to generate possible courses of action, and they are primed to favor the use of force, decisionmakers could be unknowingly constrained in looking for more peaceful pathways to crisis resolution. Moreover, consider a situation in which private organizations and government institutions are left to evaluate model performance, without any oversight. Absent robust transparent processes of evaluatingmodels, such circumstances could lead to pathological outcomes as private companies seek to overpromise on system performance for financial gains and government institutions endeavor to avoid political consequences from deploying unreliable systems. For example, scholars have noted that private companies may be incentivized to keep critical information, such as code, in machine learning algorithms private both to increase profit and to avoid regulatory roadblocks. Moreover, bureaucratic organizations can, at times, have issues with accountability due to political calculations and the pursuit of narrow institutional interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Tocqueville’s warning about the adverse effects of isolation and passive obedience, broader civil society, in a nonassociative form and restricted from involvement in practices of evaluating AI agents, may be left to believe claims that systems work reliably and in an unbiased, rational fashion. In such a situation, the public may lack the capabilities to go behind the curtain and access data in a transparent and accountable way. Or, to draw on Tocqueville, “a tyrant is relaxed enough to forgive his subjects for failing to love him, provided they do not love one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding on Tocqueville’s analysis, the solution will involve tightly binding together civil society actors (ranging from local organizations to mainstream think tanks, research organizations, and beyond) into the processes of benchmarking and evaluating models for use cases relevant to their interests. While regulations, in terms of incentivizing government and private organizations to participate in the process, will be an element of such a vision, a more critical factor will be establishing a culture of civil involvement in influencing how the technology of AI will shape governance in the United States. This applies to cases as diverse as foreign policy to issues of local government. As the following section will outline, a civil culture dedicated to open and transparent forms of AI development is more likely to shape technological—and social—developments in a direction more conducive to robust democratic governance in a context in which AI permeates many decisionmaking domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-society-in-the-age-of-ai-indirect-impacts-and-democratic-renewal&quot;&gt;Civil Society in the Age of AI: Indirect Impacts and Democratic Renewal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tocqueville argued that “as soon as communal affairs are treated as belonging to all, every man realizes that he is not as separate from his fellows as he first imagined.” This broad social realization is key to driving the development of associative action and the building up of a plural set of actors in U.S. society that are involved in the iterative and transparent evaluation of models. Associative behavior, however, must be cultivated. That said, its impacts can be recursive in form. Not only do associations mitigate the threats of isolation, but they also train citizens to be engaged in issues of joint concern and to hold a civic mindset. To draw on John Dewey, such practices must become “a way of life,” or as Tocqueville put it, “an imperceptible influence of habit.” In other words, a collective effort of Americans to ensure technology works for the average citizen must be encouraged and normalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his work on U.S. civil society, Robert Putnam asked, “is technology … driving a wedge between our individual interests and our collective interests?” This is a critical question, and while technology certainly can have this effect—see for example research illustrating that social media can contribute to problematic political polarization—there must be room for an alternative path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking thus can serve as a practical vector for cultivating an associative, civic mindset related to the technology of AI and its relationship with governance to achieve meaningful results. In other words, benchmarking holds the potential to become a critical site of association in which collaborative spaces are generated for policy experimentation matched with public oversight through robust and dynamic evaluation methodologies. Simply put, benchmarking is a tool to ensure the public is aware of the impact that AI is having on their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if AI is going to be involved in making decisions on how certain social benefits are provided, there is no reason why interested members or representatives of the community should not be involved in the evaluative process of system development and be kept abreast of what evaluation results mean for the AI-enabled decisions that could shape life outcomes. This claim is not new; some researchers have already committed to a vision of community-oriented AI development in which AI systems are cocreated with local communities. This vision will undoubtably require a substantial measure of civic responsibility. Therefore, the benefits for communities of interest should not only be made clear; they must also be tangible. AI-enabled systems must feature accountable and transparent feedback loops that are responsive when algorithmic decision systems are failing. Absent such processes, broader democratic society is likely to fail the “tragic double bind” of governing algorithms while “governing by algorithms,” as technology researchers Maciej Kuziemski and Gianluca Misuraca put it. In such processes, large private tech organizations cannot be ignored. Yet, it is possible that, despite economic interests and with the right incentives, companies may prove to be amenable partners. Large AI firms have already set up industry organizations to share best practices in model assessment and agreed to a set of voluntary commitments regarding model performance in public domains, although issues of transparency and accountability remain. Mapping market incentives to civic responsibility will undoubtably be a future challenge in generating an open, plural, and transparent evaluation environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is potential for domain-specific, diverse associational methodologies of evaluation to emerge from below. As suggested by literature focusing on the role of civil society, such associations can serve as an injection of collective democratic spirit into the adoption of AI. These practices must be focused on collaboratively ensuring that governance-related decisions involving AI are continuously evaluated in a fashion that demystifies technological outputs and that ensures that citizens are not driven to simply “accept” algorithmic outputs out of either a lack of understanding or the absence of social structures that allow them to meaningfully contest seemingly unjust or incorrect algorithmic decisions. Moreover, people must feel that they receive some practical benefit of working within such associational models, implying that the socio-technical governance structures that are developed need to actually work for people at all levels of government and must respond to their feedback, ideas, and concerns. The results of evaluations cannot simply be meaningless reports left to rot in untouched data repositories. Importantly, research has demonstrated that there are consequential benefits both in terms of social trust and in terms of economic development for communities with high levels of civic engagement. There are thus clear advantages to achieving this collaborative ideal through AI benchmarking and to cementing benchmarking’s role in empowering new forms of civic association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;democratic-ai-governance-lessons-from-tocqueville-and-today&quot;&gt;Democratic AI Governance: Lessons from Tocqueville and Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many mainstream conversations related to AI, scaling is presented as the fundamental solution to advancing the technology. In technical terms, scaling can refer to increasing model parameters, the amount of training data, or computing capabilities to achieve performance benefits. Scaling models in such a fashion takes significant financial resources, and, as a result, has contributed to the centralization of AI development in the hands of private organizations that already have the capacity to collect data, develop larger models, and afford significant computing resources. As a result of this understanding of scaling, the technical capabilities, model development, and overall direction of AI development are concentrated. This form of socio-technical relationship, and its political and economic results, presents a challenge to a more democratic vision for how AI can be integrated into governance. It is also misaligned with Tocqueville’s preference for local initiative and community leadership to address issues of public concern. More democratic-focused efforts surrounding AI will require local participation and association that can assist in generating the robust—and democratically oriented—civil society that this report’s approach highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS Futures Lab researchers are not the first to recognize this issue. Civil society organizations have already called for more distributed models of AI research and deployment. Legislative activity in the United States, such as the CREATE AI Act, is attempting to democratize access to computing resources. Moreover, a robust community of open-source AI development is highly active, illustrated by organizations such as Hugging Face, which hosts a repository of open-source models available for public use. Within open-source AI development, some level of model weights, code, and model parameters are available to the public. Proponents of an open-source approach suggest that it is far more likely to democratize access to the technology and, furthermore, is more in line with scientific practices of transparency and the evaluation of research findings. In addition, within the research community, scholars have begun to pose the question: “How can scientists co-create AI systems with local communities to address context-specific concerns?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges centers on a range of actors, operating within a regulatory environment that incentivizes participatory action and a democratization of access, coming together to address and experiment with solving practical governance problems that are both posed by AI and, potentially, solved through the targeted use of the same technology. Such a view is supported by modern legal theorists suggesting that a diverse set of actors with clear, vocal interests can contribute to localized policy innovation. Moreover, this methodology emphasizes the associational and civic-minded approach that scholars such as James and Deborah Fallows have revealed through their writings on the United States. Thus, experimentation on, and subsequent technical evaluation of, how AI will interact with democratic governance cannot simply be a top-down driven process but instead must pursue associational pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the domains of international relations and foreign policy may seem too abstract for such an associative politics related to general AI development, and the evaluation process specifically, this does not have to be the case. Much mainstream international relations research—particularly from the 1970s and 1980s—treated states as like units, or billiard balls which interacted to either cooperate or compete. Complicating the picture, more recent work, such as that cited above on the relationship between democracy and foreign policy, as well as other research in international affairs emphasizing notions of “human security”—i.e., the desire to shift the lens of security away from states and toward the needs of individuals—has expanded the aperture for what, and who, counts when it comes to international affairs. Moreover, there exists a diverse array of actors with a stake in the field, ranging from citizen organizations, universities, think tanks, NGOs, and others. The point is that even the domain of international relations—at times called the realm of high politics—has an existing grammar and set of actors with which to discuss and experiment with the issues addressed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, this paper advocates for a set of AI governance and model evaluation procedures that are multi-scalar, participatory, and grounded in civil society—not simply rooted in top-down regulatory regimes that, although well meaning, may fail to understand the complexity of certain local or domain-specific problems, or that are corporate controlled, and thus driven by market incentives rather than through robust civil involvement. This effort should be independent of government institutions and corporate interests and should be nonpartisan in form. The goal is to promote the maximum exchange of information by holding providers that power agentic systems accountable. Illustrating problematic tendencies or biases can pressure firms to correct and improve model performance, thereby creating a feedback system that incentivizes open information exchange. This argument is not without basis, as research on corporate social responsibility has demonstrated that, in some circumstances, firms respond to public pressures and update business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toward-an-associational-model-of-ai-benchmarking-governance&quot;&gt;Toward an Associational Model of AI Benchmarking Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the prior sections on the critical nature of civic associations in forming more publicly accountable, transparent, and effective practices of AI benchmarking, this section develops a model for associational practices related to AI governance, specifically focusing on AI evaluation and benchmarking. Many proposed AI governance models are broad based and offer wholistic views of the governance environment. They do so by incorporating elements or layers that are as general as categories such as society, technical factors, and ethics. Though these concepts are useful for identifying key considerations for successful AI governance, without more direct conceptualization, they are less practical in terms of generating practices in specific contexts. The broad scope of ethical AI is a good example, as scholarly reviews of the emerging AI governance literature have noted that some discussions of AI ethics struggle to identify the details of real-world implementation, possibly limiting ethical AI’s practical effectiveness. Yet, problematically, some proposed governance approaches fail to discuss ethical dimensions at all, including fairness, transparency, and trust. In fact, some reviews illustrate a general failure to broadly operationalize processes related to AI governance. Thus, focusing on tangible practices within governing structures can help to illustrate what broader categories, such as ethics, mean for practical implementation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers address the specificity of organizational governance, offering important insight as to how organizations, such as private firms, play a role in governance structures. However, due to their focus on the level of the organization, these approaches can miss the critical set of players that must be involved in successful governance beyond how individual organizations set up and implement their own AI-related standards. For example, levels of AI governance touch on a range of players (frequently referred to as stakeholders in the governance literature) as diverse as small teams within organizations, large international governing bodies, and even individuals impacted by the technology. Moreover, a diverse array of actors has been instrumental in proposing various models and principals of AI governance, including the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Framework, the EU AI Act, private organization frameworks from the likes of Microsoft and Google, and civil society groups, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, not only are there multiple levels in which AI governance occurs, but there are also multiple domains of practice in which AI governance must be implemented. As some have noted, governance solutions must be implemented at all stages of the AI development lifecycle, from model development to deployment. This includes factors in which benchmarking plays a role, for example, those related to testing, evaluation verification, and validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this discussion more practical, the following section focuses specifically on the critical area of benchmarking and its possible role in AI governance, while also acknowledging the complex array of actors involved in any truly associational model of governance. The fundamental focus here is grounding benchmarking in transparency and accountability based on domain-specific, expert-crafted data, whether the context of the evaluation process be benchmarking model reasoning capabilities on tasks such as foreign policy decisions or evaluating model performance on local community implementation of AI to assist in providing efficient services. It is through increasing transparency and accountability that U.S. citizens will be able to better decide how (and if) the technology is working to improve their lives in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than merely suggest that critical factors such as transparency are important in AI governance, this report posits a model for implementation that puts transparency and accountability into practice, thus contributing to calls from researchers to ensure that there is a “how for every what” involved in the governance of AI and ML technologies. In other words, this report attempts to translate abstract principals into specific practices, roles, and benefits. Thus, the proposal outlined here is both micro-focused in that this model isolates one aspect of AI governance (evaluation and benchmarking) and macro-focused as it applies to a general range of domains from local community organizations to the governmental level. Simply put, it is a model that, while focused chiefly on benchmarking, can apply to many real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 depicts this model. It starts by describing the constituent elements located at the central part of the model and then laying out their interactions—the most fundamental piece of the associational model. Three component parts contribute directly to the proposed model’s main purpose—a robust AI evaluation and benchmarking cycle—which is further described below. Table 1 summarizes the roles and functions of the various elements involved in this cycle, as well as the benefits each element receives from participation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civil Society.&lt;/em&gt; The first component part, as emphasized most directly in the above discussion, consists of civil society actors. With respect to a technology like AI that is largely a general-purpose technology, actors comprising this constituent part of the model are intentionally diverse. For example, civil society actors with interests in the evaluation and benchmarking of AI could range from think tanks to universities and to local community organizations concerned with mitigating adverse impacts of poor performing AI on local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this associational model, civil society serves three key roles. The first is through the expression of interested community actors and organized groups in shaping technological performance. Due to the likely wide impacts of AI integration (from computer vision to language models), there are obvious incentives for civil society groups to become engaged in signaling their interests regarding model performance. Groups interested in AI evaluation also provide inputs related to how civil society organizations see the technology as benefiting their specific communities, along with the worries and concerns the same groups have regarding possible technological abuse and undesirable performance. As a result of this relationship, public institutions and technology companies receive important inputs on what broader social groups want—and do not want—from AI-enabled technology. These lines of communication between civil society and government and technology developers will be fundamental to ensuring that technology firms and government are aware of how civil society organizations imagine AI integrating into their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1SRXLe7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Associational Benchmarking Concept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because civil society organizations can operate outside the incentive structures of private businesses and public institutions, they are able to provide important checks and balances by demanding transparency and accountability from other constituent parts of evaluation processes. Of course, transparency and accountability do not come from external demands alone, thus requiring important legislative enablers, but they can provide pressures for governments and private organizations to act or change behavior due to, for example, invoking reputational concerns or illustrating broad social desires for action. Additionally, civil society organizations can serve as key interlocutors for publishing evaluation metrics, writing public-facing reports on benchmarking studies, and conducting reviews of evaluation results related to real-world use cases. In basic terms, civil society can push the development and deployment of AI in a direction that serves broader social interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as discussed above, valid benchmarking datasets and evaluation processes require coherent, domain-specific knowledge that can be updated and refined as contexts change. In many circumstances, civil society organizations can assist in providing domain-relevant expertise and knowledge that typically cannot be replicated within governing institutions and private technology providers. Moreover, the organizations can serve as key partners in generating specific metrics and operationalizations of domain-specific knowledge that can be integrated into benchmarking procedures. Without valid metrics, the construct validity of any evaluation process will be dubious. For instance, academic and scientific organizations retain a great deal of critical systematic knowledge relevant to real-world AI use cases that, absent transparent dialogue, cannot be obtained in a manner workable for designing model evaluations. The basic point is that expert-created data and evaluations will improve the quality of AI models and better demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses. To facilitate access to this data, government institutions, such as the Library of Congress, could serve as publicly accessibly data repositories for high-quality, curated, pooled data training that public organizations can access for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, as discussed in greater detail below, government must invest in broader AI literacy to improve the feedback mechanisms between civil society and other constituent parts of the model. Not all relevant civil society organizations with interest in participating in associative processes related to model benchmarking will have the specific skill set to make necessary contributions from the onset. If the U.S. public does not have a basic level of AI literacy, as well as access to resources to experiment with AI, civil society will be a less effective form of checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical Providers and Systems.&lt;/em&gt; The second component part comprises technical providers and systems. As with civil society addressed above, this component can be multidimensional, including, first off, the critical actor set of private technology organizations. These organizations include the major AI developers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, XAI, Google, and others. These private businesses are in the unique position of having the financial and compute resources, as well as the technical expertise, to build, train, and offer public-facing AI products. Here, the commonly discussed “black box” of AI- and ML-related technologies poses the highest risk, as these actors at times have incentives to restrict outsider access to algorithms, model weights, and the like. There is also generally a wide gap between technical knowledge within these organizations compared to the general public. The consequence is high levels of opacity due to technical literacy differences between communities. Moreover, these companies typically offer application programing interfaces (APIs) that allow businesses and individuals to integrate high-performing models into their own workflows, which then may be converted into consumer-facing products, making technical providers key actors in broader business (and other organization) processes in which AI is increasingly deployed. Yet technology companies are not the only actor that could qualify within this constituent part of the broader model. Open-source approaches to AI development allow for individuals and institutions to host models and to train them to their own specific purposes without access to a particular corporation’s API, thus complicating the direct roles of technology provider and system developer. The basic point is that developers of AI products must be involved in governance processes for them to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within evaluation processes, the role of these groups is critical as, in general, companies will likely continue to retain the highest degree of combined technical expertise in crafting model evaluations along with the related financial resources. Moreover, from an operational perspective, owing to their technical expertise, the technical providers and systems are important in offering guidance on converting local domain and institutional knowledge into a data structure on which a benchmark can be created and model performance measured. Due to the aforementioned motivations driving many private companies comprising this element of the model, the enabling legislative environment, discussed in greater detail below, must structure incentives in a fashion that drives benefits for technology providers toward open and accountable participation in the benchmarking and evaluation processes. This effort at associational benchmarking will be most effective if friction between technology providers, government, and civil society is minimized through the right legal incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Institutions.&lt;/em&gt; The third component part of the associational model presented here is public institutions. This includes organizations ranging from federal departments that are part of the executive branch to local governments that may be interested in implementing AI tools in their own daily workflows or service provision. Although organizations can pursue their own bureaucratic political interests, the ideal function of public institutions, at least in a democratic context, is to implement policy in service of the public. What these institutions contribute in the context of this governance model is that they are likely integrating AI into service provision and thereby impacting governing practices and policy implementation in a range of domains. In fact, recent executive guidance has directed federal departments to develop institutional policies and procedures for implementing AI. The involvement of public institutions is unlikely to decrease. As such, these institutions will serve as a major touchpoint between the public and AI’s real-world use cases in circumstances ranging from obtaining government benefits to courts making decisions on the likelihood of recidivism. Moreover, such institutions retain significant public data on which institutional models are likely to be trained (and privacy concerns made acute) as well as specific expertise related to the institution’s particular purview (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency on environmental issues or the National Institutes of Health on issues related to public health). As such, they will be critical in developing relevant benchmarks and metrics associated with public service performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, public institutions, such as NIST, are critical in creating regulatory and standard-setting apparatuses in many scientific and technical contexts from which private organizations will derive their own institutional policies. In this space, CAISI (previously the U.S. AISI), as part of NIST, will play a key role as it operates as a standards-setting body and works with industry members to set voluntary commitments on model evaluation and security. CAISI has already been an active participant in model evaluations. For example, in late 2024, alongside the UK AI Safety Institute, CAISI conducted a pre-deployment evaluation of Open AI’s o1 model, focusing specifically on cyber, biological, and software and AI development. Moreover, in early 2025, CAISI released a technical report related to initial evaluation results on how AI agents risk being subject to “high jacking,” in which malicious actors inject unwanted instructions into AI agent workflows. NIST and CAISA must continue to play a meaningful part within this benchmarking governance model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in terms of the associational evaluation model presented here, public institutions play a fundamental role. First, they are key targets of transparency and accountability feedback loops that are driven by civil society and civic association. If effective AI governance is to be implemented, it is up to such institutions to act on and respond to benchmarking results in meaningful ways by updating training data, workflows, and other relevant practices in response to feedback. Second, such organizations are likely to act as key data brokers in their specific domains as they work with private companies to train and deploy models on institutional use cases. In simple terms, without the commitment of public institutions, effective implementation and governance of AI agents will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f4VazX4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Summary of Model Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaluation cycle.&lt;/em&gt; The three constituent parts discussed above are linked within the associational evaluation cycle, with each element providing feedback and incentives to the other component parts. Links between these component parts are representative of both communication and accountability. Responsiveness to impacted communities is fundamental to this associational model. This section will briefly outline this recursive relationship along three parameters: (1) benchmark creation; (2) implementation, analysis, and dissemination of results; and (3) real-world responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, benchmark creation requires critical inputs from all constituent parts of the evaluation cycle. Civil society groups, for example, can be instrumental in expressing local interests, and, in certain circumstances (particularly in the case of think tanks or universities where specified knowledge is available), creating scenario-specific data on which to evaluate model performance. Thus, along this parameter, information flows to both technical providers and public institutions (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1). Civil society groups transfer information in the forms of expressing a civil association’s specific interest when it comes to model performance, assisting in generating data for a benchmark, and providing input on which metrics account for a fair and realistic measure of performance on the relevant task. For benchmark creation, technical providers and systems offer important technical knowledge on how to design benchmarks valid for domain-specific data structures that they can share with partners in civil society and public institutions. Moreover, they can provide feedback on how technological progress in AI, largely driven by private firms, may shape requirements for updating relevant benchmarking practices. Finally, public institutions will be key in both listening to and engaging with relevant civic groups interested in involvement in benchmarking. Moreover, due to domain expertise and data access, public institutions will be crucial in generating contextual knowledge to include in benchmarking and, working recursively with interested civil society groups, in developing relevant metrics on which to assess evaluation results. Proper metrics thus will be the outcome of deliberative processes between stakeholders and based on domain-specific knowledge. Importantly, without the participation of multiple stakeholders in benchmarking, the results of benchmarking studies may lack real-world applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with respect to implementation, analysis, and information dissemination, civil society interacts with the other constituent parts largely in terms of interpreting benchmarking results according to their own local or domain-specific knowledge, as well as by acting as a key driver of transparency and accountability. Within the context of associational benchmarking, civil society organizations should participate in public advocacy and serve as essential providers of data and metrics to the public, particularly through creating and disseminating accessible information relevant to both their own association members and to the broader interested public. Moreover, because civil society operates outside of the for-profit incentives of private corporations and the bureaucratic pressures of public institutions, civil society organizations (particularly universities and think tanks) can offer objective analyses of evaluation results and their implications. During implementation and analysis, technology providers and systems typically should offer compute, model hosting, and other related technical skills to make evaluation processes methodologically consistent and relevant for the most advanced AI technologies (whether in computer vision, natural language processing, or others). Finally, public institutions within this parameter should focus on analyzing results specific to institutional goals based on agreed upon metrics. Along these lines, they should provide access to information to civil society organizations on evaluation results to ensure transparency and accountability to public interests. As with benchmark creation, meaningful participation of all stakeholders is crucial. This means matching local expertise with technical experience in interpreting benchmarking results and government actors maintaining awareness of how results link to their institutional goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as emphasized above, benchmarks should not be seen as simple technical resources, but rather as a set of socio-technical relations. As such, linking evaluation results to real-world processes of responsiveness by updating social and institutional practices as well as data resources is fundamental to this associational model functioning outside of theoretical terms. Thus, civil society actors must provide indicators to technical systems and providers, as well as public institutions, regarding how downstream AI applications are shaping their specific interests. In addition, such groups must be prepared to apply pressure to public institutions and technical providers who may fail to commit to transparent practices and who lack accountability. When applicable, technology providers and systems must be prepared to share how their models perform on benchmarks relevant to a broad range of civic actors. In the long run, the technology providers and systems will benefit from group feedback on how their products perform in a range of contexts, thereby allowing them to make product improvements and increase user trust. Lastly, public institutions need to be responsive to updating and curating relevant institutional data while also retaining enough institutional and technical flexibility to adapt practices according to the results of evaluation. This is critical, as maintaining a stagnant approach within the highly fluid context of governance will likely lead to undesirable technological performance, and thereby worse public services. Notably, it is perfectly possible that evaluation results may demonstrate technological limitations, thus illustrating that certain use cases are not appropriate, or remain too high risk, for AI integration into institutional practices at this stage. Even with all the technical best practices imaginable, if evaluation results do not result in required change, AI will likely fail to have a positive impact on broader society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the constituent elements of the central evaluation cycle, two constraining and enabling conditions feature in the model: the domain and the legislative environment. While each will vary based on the context in which benchmarking is needed, both will necessarily exist in some form. Moreover, both generate the type of data that will be needed for evaluation purposes and for the incentive structure under which key actors operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domain.&lt;/em&gt; All benchmarking and evaluation processes, particularly those in contexts relevant to governing, must be shaped by domain-specific considerations. These specific considerations should orient and guide the entire benchmarking and evaluation cycle discussed above, including the technical processes of implementing evaluations; different use cases will require unique considerations as well. Moreover, the domain will influence what sort of organizations (e.g., environmental, legal, and human rights organizations) participate in the evaluation processes of AI technologies. Data curation and subsequent model evaluation should include a range of domain-specific experts, depending on the desired AI use case. In addition, this should involve leveraging civil society associations, among other possible pools of experts, in the entire evaluation lifecycle. Ignoring this critical element risks evaluation results not properly corresponding to the real-world contexts in which the technology may be used, thus seriously threatening a benchmark’s construct validity, or put simply, its applicability to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legislative Environment.&lt;/em&gt; All elements of the model are embedded within the legislative environment and, therefore, this environment must serve as an enabler of the associative model proposed here. While legislation and regulation are unlikely to solve all governance issues related to AI, they can create incentive structures that give value for participation to a broad range of stakeholders. Moreover, legislation can enable civic groups to have a real impact on model benchmarking and, thus, on how models are deployed. This includes supporting efforts aimed at increasing AI literacy among civil associations in local government contexts in order to ensure more robust and effective benchmarking processes and creating funding pools to enable expert civil society organizations to commit labor and other resources to creating robust evaluation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a truly enabling legislative environment must manage power differentials between organizations that may be involved in benchmarking processes. Technological development and deployment take place within large social power structures, and the gap between the financial resources of exsisting AI companies and, for instance, locally oriented civil society groups will be vast. Thus, it is important to create an environment in which civil associations, the heart of this model of governance, do not get steamrolled by more powerful interests, compromising the validity of evaluative processes and their benefits. Within this model, truly robust benchmarking can only take place if civil organizations’ concerns are heard and acted upon rather than ignored in favor of more powerful corporate or political interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the model centers on the components that emphasize the process outputs and the requirements of updating inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process outputs.&lt;/em&gt; The evaluation cycle, per the stated goals of transparency and accountability, will result in multiple outputs, including publicly available metrics and reports that indicate model performance on domain-specific tasks. However, process outputs must also lead to iterative updating of institutional practices that align AI workflows and use cases with evaluation results. Moreover, new technical methodologies in domain-specific evaluation are likely to emerge through this process, and civil society organizations will gain insight into how AI impacts their direct interests, along with increasing their organizational knowledge about evaluation and benchmarking as a practice. That said, as discussed below, leaving these outputs stagnant sets up the broader process for failure; as such, recursive updating of process inputs is key. The data and metrics that result from evaluation studies must be leveraged to inform future AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updating Inputs.&lt;/em&gt; At its heart, the model presented here emphasizes associational politics, deliberative processes, and experimentalism. Each aspect has roots in the literatures of democratic political theory, philosophy, and experimental governance. As such, this model includes the essential function of updating inputs recursively, underscoring the need for constant analysis and iterative learning through reaction to prior operations and deliberation between constituent components of the evaluation cycles. Moreover, this model emphasizes experimentation in that it calls for “ongoing, reciprocal readjustments of ends and means.” Actors must reflexively learn and scrutinize their own actions and interests in pursuing the collective goal. This model builds these requirements as new inputs as the process cycles through continuous iteration. Without adapting to new information, actors risk deploying technology to use cases it is not built for, resulting in undesirable consequences for everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, each component part of the model described above must work in conjunction with the others to achieve the desired outcome of responsive, domain-specific, benchmarking efforts. By including the proper legislative incentive structures and tangible benefits, each actor within the model can be incorporated into a cycle of positive feedback loops that can sustain the model’s relevance and success. The following section will identify three recommendations that could serve as enablers to implementing this model in real-world contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth linking the above discussion to ongoing developments in U.S. AI policy. As addressed in more detail above, recent guidance from the Trump administration has rearticulated much of the work done by the Biden administration in establishing national AI policy. In doing so, the Trump administration, particularly in terms of rhetoric, has preferred a more innovation-forward approach to implementing AI across the U.S. government. This is seen in a range of policy guidance from the administration, including the aforementioned executive order entitled “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” as well as guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the form of “Accelerating Federal Use of AI through Innovation, Governance, and Public Trust” and “Driving Efficient Acquisition of Artificial Intelligence in Government.” While innovation and adoption of AI throughout the U.S. government may be a priority of the Trump administration, the current approach risks failure without reliable and iterative evaluation practices that emphasize input from civil actors. Voices from the bottom-up need to be key drivers of technology implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the above-mentioned federal guidance appears to be amenable to many of the items proposed in the associational evaluation model of this report. For example, the OMB’s memorandum on “Accelerating Federal Use of AI through Innovation, Governance, and Public Trust” notes the importance of protecting civil rights and liberties and developing responsible AI, and it calls out the critical nature of transparency, governance, and public trust. Moreover, it identifies the need for continuous monitoring of AI systems, particularly in high-impact use cases, along with supporting broader AI literacy among agency employees. Finally, in line with aspects drawn out in the model discussed here, this OMB memo highlights the importance of numerous and diverse stakeholders, including private actors and external experts in AI, along with the need for the independent review of AI systems, particularly in high-impact use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few issues within the OMB guidance worth further assessment, as well as discussion regarding how the model proposed here can support and improve recent policy guidance. For example, independent reviews within the OMB document are stated to be conducted by a reviewer “within the agency” who has not been a part of system development. While this is certainly an important step, within-agency review may not sufficiently isolate the reviewer from political and bureaucratic pressures. As such, incorporating civil society organizations into the process of model assessment and evaluation can add an additional layer of separation between bureaucratic political pressures and AI evaluation, thereby contributing to more objective and transparent analyses of benchmarking results. Additionally, while innovation is key, emphasizing this factor to too great a degree may undermine other components of federal guidance, including developing and implementing AI responsibly, improving public trust, and avoiding harm to U.S. citizens. Depending on the domain, incorporating a range of civil society actors into the evaluation cycle and integrating robust and transparent feedback mechanisms could facilitate a pragmatic balance between technological innovation and building systems that work as intended within specific contexts. Importantly, increasing trust and accountability within AI governance will lead to more robust and sustainable development of AI-associated technologies. Finally, while sensible in general terms, proposed efforts at improving efficiency and reusing elements of AI development through agency coordination could lead to issues in downstream technology deployment. Unrestrained efforts at improving implementation efficiency and the reuse of technical systems could lead to circumstances in which systems and data designed for one context are applied to a different, non-applicable case, increasing the risk that the system will not perform as desired due to contextual variation. This is why continuous benchmarking on domain-specific tasks, including constant iteration and feedback loops, is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion leads to three substantive recommendations (summarized in Table 2 below). &lt;strong&gt;First, legislators at the federal and state levels should pursue legislation that encourages and enables civil society actors to become involved in independent benchmarking efforts, while working with private technology providers and public institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; This could include offering funding resources for think tanks, universities, and even local community organizations to become meaningful stakeholders in the process of benchmarking and evaluation. This could also incorporate increasing resources for upscaling broader AI literacy in existing civil society organizations and encouraging these organizations to position themselves as key stakeholders within conversations on AI governance, benchmarking, and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Congress should begin to explore which congressional committees have the authority to hold routine hearings on model benchmarking and evaluation to ensure that iterative, inclusive, and robust processes remain in play across private and public sector contexts. Currently, a range of committees have at least some form of jurisdiction related to AI policy development, including committees as diverse as the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House, reflecting the wide impact AI will have on questions of governance. Congressional committees with interests in AI should begin the process of holding benchmarking-related hearings to hold AI firms and federal agencies accountable, while also looking to the best interests of the people they are elected to represent. Within such a process, civil society organizations can leverage their traditional advocacy roles to make local interests heard by congressional representatives, as well as offer expert testimony on the evaluation results and technological impact they observe in their local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, legislative bodies at all levels of government should pursue creating meaningful incentives for AI firms and public institutions to coordinate their benchmarking efforts with civic society organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; This can help to match civil society organizations’ domain expertise, local concerns, and user feedback with any deployed AI agent. Incentives could include formal legislation requiring AI companies to operate in specific ways or incentives which hope to shape corporate behavior without specific standards. Legislators could even use state or federal tax law in order to manage AI firms’ incentives. Historically, these tools have been used successfully in other contexts, such as influencing corporate hiring practices. Of course, such a strategy would forgo tax revenue from some of the United States’ largest companies, requiring a careful legislative strategy that balances desired corporate behavior with necessary tax revenue. Moreover, legislation should encourage open, transparent, and accountable evaluation practices, and could even establish standard practices for benchmark reporting. Similar reporting incentives have been used with regard to corporate disclosures of supply chains and labor abuses, although their effectiveness remains a point of a debate. Private firms have already offered a variety of pledges toward building more robust and safe AI systems, for example, in the form of creating nonprofit industry groups and voluntary commitments to shared safety practices in model development and deployment. Additionally, legislation could encourage these private organizations to pursue additional commitments aimed at integrating civil society actors—as well as committing to greater degrees of transparency—within the evaluation processes in line with the general model of associational benchmarking proposed here. A key consideration in legislative processes needs to be harmonizing local, state, and federal AI policies into a functioning mosaic of governance. Excessive fragmentation of AI policy could lead to difficulties as organizations attempt to navigate different rules for model evaluation and deployment in different localities. Efforts to disincentivize state-level regulations on AI look to address this issue; however, these efforts challenge core components of the U.S. federalist system. Moreover, lawmakers will need to balance the need for oversight with the desire for further innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, and perhaps most critically, the United States’ philanthropic foundations can play a fundamental role in coordinating the funding of multiple major cross-disciplinary benchmarking initiatives to enhance and preserve the independence of a modern form of accountable, associational model evaluation.&lt;/strong&gt; Without independent financial support, there is a risk that evaluation processes will be co-opted by narrow interests, thus turning a potentially productive tool of measuring the technologies’ performances into something far more superficial. In fact, recent research has demonstrated that some model leaderboards related to popular AI benchmarks can be gamed by large private companies, which are incentivized to present their products as the best-performing models. Involving independent actors with interests in the public good and not financial profit, and providing them with the resources to meaningfully participate, could help to mitigate such problems and make evaluation practices more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is important to recognize that foundations, and their philanthropic contributions, have a more complex history than can be explored here, there is a clear precedent for their inclusion in this process. Researchers studying foundations suggest that philanthropic contributions commonly focus on the creation of “something new,” whether that be related to social arrangements, the arts, or science. Moreover, foundations can serve as social entrepreneurs that “respond to needs or problems that are beyond the reach” of current market incentives or government capacity. While the grant-making capabilities of foundations are key, particularly in the specific contexts of supporting research initiatives, these organizations also have the ability to leverage social mechanisms that legitimate new forms of organization and that develop professionals to support that same organizational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations also play a key role in supporting civil society actors, such as NGOs. For example, the MacArthur Foundation and the Mott Foundation both provide grants to various NGOs working in the United States and globally. The grants range from support for organizations working on managing global crises to those addressing climate change. Historically, foundations have enabled key research in the social and hard sciences. The Rockefeller Foundation played a key role in the establishment of biomedical research and molecular biology. Grants by the MacArthur Foundation helped to build up a range of research institutions working on managing risks from nuclear weapons, such as Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation and Harvard’s Belfer Center. The Russell Sage Foundation has focused on supporting social science researchers and contributed to the development of “social indicators” to help inform data-driven social policy. The editors of a foundation-supported volume asserted that such indicators are “imperative for the guidance of social policy.” As a final example, the Gates Foundation is a critical cog in foundation-based global health and development initiatives. Foundations thus support a wide range of pursuits in the social and hard sciences across a range of domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical for this discussion is that the broader fields of computer science and artificial intelligence also have roots in foundation support. As a significant example, the Macy Foundation contributed to a series of conferences beginning in the 1940s that set the stage for the development of the field of “cybernetics.” While the field is far reaching in scope, impacting disciplines as diverse as neuroscience and various social sciences, cybernetics was highly influential in early research into computing and AI. Its influence largely lies in the introduction of concepts such as feedback mechanisms, control theory, and complex systems. In basic terms, cybernetics focuses on how feedback loops shape behavioral patterns in both human and machine systems. Key attendees of the Macy conferences included Norbert Wiener, generally considered the father of cybernetics; John von Neumann, the creator of the Von Neumann architecture, which remains an influential paradigm in modern computer design; and Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, key figures in the development of the initial model of the neural network. Foundation support can be said to have helped create the conditions for today’s advances in AI and computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundation grants in the domain of AI continue to be influential across a diverse spectrum of viewpoints. Philanthropic organizations, such as Open Philanthropy and the Future of Life Institute, provide grants for AI-related research, particularly focusing on managing “existential risks.” Moreover, established foundations such as the Ford and MacArthur Foundations have funded AI-related organizations, including the AI Now Institute, which focuses on issues of AI-related surveillance and power consolidation in the hands of technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history and current funding profile of U.S. foundations have clear relevance for the CSIS Futures Lab’s proposed associational model of AI evaluation and benchmarking. While the foundation approach to funding is not perfect, it does play a critical role in how research organizations and civil society groups gain support for their initiatives. For example, foundation contributions could encourage the emergence of new civil society organizations oriented toward transparent benchmarking practices across a range of domains. This type of foundation support could fill in the gaps where market or government incentives for such funding may be limited. Moreover, foundation-based funding efforts could assist in creating new research fellowship streams that are focused directly on bringing domain-specific experts into benchmarking processes, whether these be individuals from small local organizations focused on community issues or experienced researchers with specific disciplinary skills and knowledge. However, effective relationships will need to result in long-term funding commitments to avoid funding gaps and to reduce the risk that funding organizations rapidly change priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined above seek to create a policy environment that enables AI firms and civil society groups to work together in a productive fashion to produce more robust and dynamic benchmarking outputs. Such cooperation will improve the likelihood that AI works for broader segments of society on tasks that require specific expertise and knowledge. Moreover, it suggests that U.S. foundations can play a crucial part in establishing civil society groups that have the talent and resources to participate in this associational model of AI benchmarking and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zp22agC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Policy Recommendations Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, AI agents will not simply function as a tool but will shape (and to a degree already are shaping) how decisions are made and who gets to make them. Whether it be in the context of national security and foreign policy decisions or related to getting access to government benefits, decisions shaped by AI systems are set to influence people’s life outcomes. To avoid a scenario in which society relinquishes a detrimental amount of agency to opaque AI systems, thereby challenging democratic principles of governance, a renewed form of associative action is required. This form of association must bring many stakeholders to the table—including policymakers, researchers, civic leaders, and interested members of impacted communities—to generate robust, dynamic, and responsive benchmarking practices. Critically, this process must be transparent and open. As others have argued, “transparency is an essential precondition for public accountability, scientific innovation, and effective governance of digital technologies. Without adequate transparency, stakeholders cannot understand foundation models, who they affect, and the impact they have on society.” Moreover, researchers have suggested that transparency can be fundamental for “reducing the mystique and opaqueness of AI to the general public.” While research has shown that transparency is not a direct cause of accountability, it is a necessary condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with this goal and drawing from the work of Tocqueville, scholarship in deliberative democracy, and experimentalist approaches to governance, this analysis has presented an associational model of benchmarking to assist in visualizing our broader argument. Moreover, this report has offered a variety of recommendations related to government and foundation policy that could assist in enabling this vision to become a reality. Fundamentally, in an open and democratic society, it is not enough to build powerful and capable models—we must also build the civic institutions and practices capable of questioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lithuania engages with the evolving EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulatory architecture, a recent workshop in Vilnius, co-hosted by Lithuania’s Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering (AML Center) and the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI, provided a forum for diverse financial and regulatory stakeholders to reflect on national readiness, implementation challenges and regulatory clarity. Discussions centred on institutional coordination, regulatory feedback mechanisms, supervisory expectations, sector-specific implications and the anticipated role of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the workshop sought to build understanding of how a major new AML framework (described below), designed in Brussels in light of significant AML policy failings in the traditional banking sector – most notably in the Nordic-Baltic region a decade ago – is viewed in a diverse financial community such as Lithuania, and the extent of the understanding and implementation gap that exists between Brussels and EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion took place against the backdrop of the ongoing cross-European efforts to implement the legislative package adopted by the European Commission in May 2024 (the EU AML Package). This comprehensive framework comprises several key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AML Regulation (AMLR), which introduces a single rulebook for AML/CFT (countering the financing of terrorism), establishing uniform rules that are directly applicable across all member states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD6), which addresses the structural aspects of AML supervision and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation (EU) 2024/1620, which established the AMLA, mandated with direct supervisory and coordination responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transfer of funds regulation (TFR), which extends the so-called “travel rule” to all financial transactions, irrespective of the amount. Under the revised TFR, the travel rule is now applicable to not only traditional financial institutions but also crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable changes observed by workshop attendees is the expanded scope of obliged entities. New sectors such as crowdfunding platforms, investment migration operators, mortgage credit intermediaries, non-financial holding companies and football clubs/agents will fall under the regulation. This broadening of scope will have limited relevance in Lithuania, but it will affect Lithuania’s vibrant fintech community, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country hosts an innovative and expanding fintech ecosystem, facilitated by a streamlined licensing process that has attracted over 260 fintech firms, positioning Vilnius as a regional fintech hub. Key financial players in the country include both domestic and international banks such as SEB, Swedbank and Luminor, as well as a growing number of electronic money institutions (EMIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, workshop participants characterised private sector engagement on the EU AML Package as an area of mixed progress. Some participants noted proactive steps by larger institutions to familiarise themselves with the EU AML Package – particularly the more detailed technical standards – and conduct gap analyses. However, others (particularly smaller entities) reported uncertainty regarding how and when their input is expected, raising concerns about uneven representation in shaping the implementation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussion focused on a number of key issues facing the financial sector as it confronts the reality of the EU AML Package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-institutional-collaboration-and-feedback-to-the-european-banking-authority-eba&quot;&gt;1. Institutional Collaboration and Feedback to the European Banking Authority (EBA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) noted their close and continuous engagement with the EBA, highlighting participation in relevant EBA committees alongside the Ministry of Finance. The EBA is an EU regulatory agency that works to ensure effective and consistent supervision of the banking sector across all member states. As a part of its mandate, it has been proactive in supporting the rollout of the EU AML Package across the bloc in relation to financial institutions. However, one participant noted that the supervision of and collaboration with non-financial institutions that are heavily impacted by the package is beyond the EBA’s mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to BoL representatives, the Bank’s engagement involved multiple interactions with the EBA regarding the EU AML Package, particularly as it relates to the development and dissemination of Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS). With four key RTS documents now published for comment by the EBA, the BoL has proactively communicated with the Lithuanian market to solicit feedback, with special attention to customer due diligence (CDD). Authorities present at the workshop stressed the importance of market-level feedback to the EBA, noting that input from private sector actors complements the supervisory perspective and can shape regulatory adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of collective, market-driven feedback was also stressed by the representative of the National Development Bank of Lithuania. The BoL had requested feedback from the National Development Bank, particularly to provide commentary on the AMLD6. In response, the National Development Bank engaged with industry associations to collect inputs from across the board – in the hope that collective responses offer greater leverage, while unilateral action may reduce the ability to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-sectoral-readiness-and-technical-adaptation&quot;&gt;2. Sectoral Readiness and Technical Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants expressed strong and divergent views on their ability to prepare for the reality of the EU AML Package. A representative of one of the biggest banks in Lithuania reported a recent assessment of the technical developments required to meet the demands of the new package. This assessment included multiple workshops and detailed workstreams, highlighting the considerable burden the industry will face. From a Baltic perspective, several significant gaps were identified by the representative which will need to be closed in order to comply with the demands of the EU AML Package. While the changes are not viewed as transformative, they will demand extensive system and procedural adjustments. Compliance and monitoring functions will face an increased workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of regulated entities under the new rules was also raised by workshop participants. A broader array of clients will now qualify as obligated entities, imposing additional compliance responsibilities on the banks, too. Institutions are actively analysing scenarios to prepare pre-emptively. During the workshop, it was noted that over 60 new legislative instruments are under development. While not all are directly relevant to market actors, many pertain to AML oversight. Participants said that while some instruments arise from EU-level harmonisation efforts, others are linked to initiatives by the AMLA or the EBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from fintech associations and legal consultancies strongly emphasised that, for smaller entities, the primary challenge does not lie with the Level 1 legislation of the EU AML Package – that is, the core legal instruments such as regulations and directives adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. These foundational texts establish the general principles and objectives of the AML framework and have largely been understood and incorporated by the market. The greater concern arises from the Level 2 legislation, which consists of more technical and detailed rules – particularly RTS and Implementing Technical Standards – adopted by the European Commission based on proposals from supervisory authorities. These secondary measures are intended to operationalise and provide guidance on how to comply with the Level 1 framework. However, representatives of the fintech sector stakeholders noted that these provisions often extend or clarify obligations in a way that adds complexity, especially in critical compliance areas such as CDD and transaction reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a growing concern among participants that Level 2 technical implementation measures, by becoming overly prescriptive, will undermine the risk-based approach – a core principle of EU AML policy – by imposing uniform obligations that may not adequately account for the size, risk profile or capacity of smaller market participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one representative of the fintech sector noted that while the AMLR seeks to establish a harmonised regulatory environment, its real-world impact may diverge significantly from this objective – particularly for digitally-native financial service providers operating across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representative underlined, for instance, that article 22(6) of the regulation, which restricts remote customer identification to methods that satisfy the electronic identification and trust services regulation’s assurance levels of “substantial” or “high”, effectively precludes the use of biometric technologies such as facial recognition. The problem, as noted by the representative, is that these are currently deployed by many fintech firms – not only in Lithuania – to ensure secure and efficient cross-border onboarding. Traditional banks, which typically operate within national boundaries, don’t face this challenge and therefore may encounter fewer operational disruptions when aligning to the new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker emphasised that this regulatory constraint presents a significant structural challenge. They said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What everyone should start thinking about now is: “What tools could possibly comply with those requirements? Are there even such tools in the market that meet this criterion and can verify all EU citizens? And how much will ID verification services cost under this regulation?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there was a strong view around the table that the EU AML Package was designed with big banks in mind. Describing the package as being rooted in the failings of big banks a decade ago, participants argued that it had overlooked the needs and implementation challenges of the fintech community – one of the key pillars of the Lithuanian financial services industry and overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-risk-based-vs-rule-based-approaches-and-innovation-constraints&quot;&gt;3. Risk-Based vs. Rule-Based Approaches and Innovation Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants expressed concern that the EU AML Package represents a shift away from a risk-based approach towards a more rules-based regime which may stifle innovation, particularly in remote onboarding processes. They noted that the Level 1 regulation encourages a risk-based approach, but Level 2 provisions appear to go further by prescribing detailed operational procedures, thereby restricting flexibility. For example, new requirements to collect place of birth – including the city rather than only the country – raise practical challenges. Whether or not the collection of birth certificates is required for this is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory burden is anticipated by participants to disproportionately affect the fintech sector and smaller institutions. Larger banks have had time to adapt, whereas newer market entrants often lack resources to effectively participate in consultations or anticipate regulatory shifts. Some warned that the cumulative effect may create a reinforcing loop, whereby only large institutions are adequately represented, skewing regulatory outcomes in their favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to this threat, Lithuanian fintech stakeholders are actively contributing to the consultation process led by the EBA. However, these financial stakeholders noted a lack of fintech industry representation at the EU level. A representative of the fintech sector stressed the importance of ensuring that fintech-specific operational realities are reflected in the final regulatory instruments. “The question remains whether a uniform, rules-based approach can adequately accommodate the diversity of financial service models across the EU”, the speaker concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-supervisory-coordination-and-beneficial-ownership&quot;&gt;4. Supervisory Coordination and Beneficial Ownership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants elaborated on the AMLR’s requirement for firms to verify beneficial ownership (BO) information when an individual holds more than 25% ownership or exercises control exceeding 50%, and to report any discrepancies within 14 days. EU member states must also revise their laws in line with the 2022 Court of Justice of the EU ruling, which found that unrestricted public access to BO registers breaches privacy rights under the EU Charter. The Court held that only those with a “legitimate interest” — such as journalists, civil society groups, and certain financial institutions — may access BO data. Member states must therefore clearly define this interest and ensure access is granted with proper safeguards. Together, these requirements significantly shape the regulatory landscape. Participants representing financial institutions pointed out that the inconsistent application of those rules across the EU harms cross-border information sharing. For example, participants reported difficulties retrieving information from registers in Scandinavian countries, citing national differences in access protocols. There was consensus among participants that such disparities necessitate harmonisation, although the implementation of AMLD6 at the national level may limit the effectiveness of EU-wide alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BO registers in Lithuania have access restricted to public institutions, law enforcement, obliged entities and journalists. The new rules on BO introduced in the EU AML Package prompted the BoL to conduct a gap analysis. Assessing deficiencies in the functioning of BO registries to improve their utility and relevance is regarded globally as a cornerstone of effective AML efforts, so the proactive approach taken by the BoL speaks to Lithuanian commitment to strengthening the integrity of its financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervisory coordination in Lithuania is currently ad hoc, according to financial stakeholders present at the workshop. The Lithuanian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) leads AML coordination in the country and represents Lithuania at MONEYVAL (Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism), but there is a recognised need for a more institutionalised approach. A proposal has been submitted to the government to formalise cooperation of all Lithuanian supervisors. Financial stakeholders also suggested establishing a dedicated coordination group, beyond existing ad hoc forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-crypto-gambling-and-emerging-sectors&quot;&gt;5. Crypto, Gambling and Emerging Sectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the cryptocurrency sector highlighted their complex regulatory positioning within the evolving EU framework. While some may not fall under the definition of CASPs as defined in the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) – if, for example, they do not provide specific services such as custody, trading platforms or exchange services – they may still be subject to AML obligations under the EU AML Package. This is because the new AML obligations apply to a broader range of entities involved in the exchange, transfer, safekeeping or issuance of crypto-assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sector representatives noted that many of these entities based in Lithuania, especially those facilitating merchant payments through crypto-wallets, may operate outside traditional financial service classifications. However, they often still require registration or licensing according to national legislation, even if they are not fully captured under MiCA’s scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant noted that Lithuania is not expanding its licensing framework; rather, it is narrowing the criteria for obtaining licenses. For example, the BoL continues to discourage entities from combining cryptocurrency and payment services under a single licence. According to the same participant, representatives from crypto-native companies operating in a manner similar to payment service providers believe that they do not fully fall under the current regulatory regime. This reflects an ongoing, informal debate in Lithuania regarding the range of permissible services and corresponding obligations. The BoL was described by participants as a particularly strict regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another participant, representing a Lithuanian gambling supervision authority, highlighted ongoing efforts to educate regulated markets. New EU legislation will impose significant changes in how they operate. For example, a representative of this sector noted that, know your customer processes, particularly around data collection such as place of birth, pose operational difficulties. The sector is also examining best practices internationally, particularly in Latvia and Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-amla-supervision-and-future-prospects&quot;&gt;6. AMLA Supervision and Future Prospects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participants, the newly established AMLA, created under Regulation (EU) 2024/1620, represents a cornerstone of the EU’s updated AML framework. AMLA will serve as the central supervisory body tasked with ensuring consistent implementation of AML/CFT rules across member states. It is empowered to directly supervise selected obliged entities, coordinate cross-border enforcement efforts, and intervene where national supervision is insufficient, thereby aiming to reduce fragmentation and reinforce the credibility of the EU’s AML regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the Vilnius workshop noted that Lithuania will have a direct presence within AMLA’s leadership, with Simonas Krepšta, until recently a board member of the BoL, joining the authority’s executive board. Krepšta has overseen financial market supervision and digital development and has been instrumental in promoting Lithuania’s fintech ecosystem. His expertise in digital finance and supervisory oversight is expected by participants to contribute significantly to AMLA’s mandate, particularly in fostering innovation-compatible compliance strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders reflected on the dual implications of AMLA supervision. While the aim of harmonisation is broadly supported, questions remain about how dual supervision by AMLA and national regulators will function. Stakeholders anticipate that at least one Lithuanian bank may fall under AMLA’s direct supervision. Questions persist regarding the interplay with MONEYVAL assessments and the supervisory burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the BoL noted that initial expectations of reduced supervisory intensity under AMLA have shifted, with increased resource deployment now anticipated. While the goal of greater consistency is welcome, it was observed that practical differences between member states remain stark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-information-sharing-and-technological-solutions&quot;&gt;7. Information Sharing and Technological Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, some participants argued that regulation should be outcome-focused and technology-agnostic. The extent to which the EU AML Package will encourage IT adoption remains uncertain, but article 75 of the AMLR incentivises the development of such tools. It calls on member states to promote the development and use of secure, privacy-compliant digital tools supporting information sharing, typology development and automated suspicious transaction detection. While AMLD6 sets out this ambition, effective implementation will depend on national legislative frameworks and institutional readiness to operationalise these tools. In this context, the participants noted that the gap between national legislative frameworks and EU mandates remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since summer 2024, Lithuania has had a legal basis for private-to-private information sharing. The country has initiated a process aimed at enhancing the ability of financial institutions to share information regarding suspicious financial activities. At the beginning of April 2024, the Lithuanian Parliament approved amendments to Lithuania’s money laundering and terrorist financing prevention law. Article 15 (1) of the revised legislation stipulates that financial institutions are permitted to exchange information concerning their clients. Participants stated that the introduction of this framework marks a significant step in strengthening the country’s AML efforts, promoting greater collaboration among financial institutions, and aligning with EU-wide initiatives, including the EU AML Package. The AML Center is developing IT solutions to enable this exchange, though the complexity and the number of stakeholders involved makes implementation challenging. A representative of the AML Center, which supports the development of a strong public-private partnership in the country, explained that the system includes two core components: first, entities may request information when there is a suspicion; and second, a pre-defined criteria list from the FIU guides suspicion thresholds. All data exchanges are to be encrypted, in line with data protection regulations. The platform facilitating private-to-private data exchange is currently under development, with an estimated launch timeline of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vilnius workshop revealed a high degree of engagement from Lithuanian authorities and financial institutions with the EU AML Package, while also highlighting areas of concern and ambiguity. The implementation of secondary legislation, the evolving role of AMLA, and the tension between harmonisation and national flexibility are critical issues for Lithuania. The workshop indicated that ensuring the inclusion of smaller actors, preserving innovation and enhancing cross-border cooperation on BO will be essential to the success of the EU AML framework in Lithuania and across the EU. There was a clear sense that the EU AML Package is, while well-intentioned, (as one participant put it) “the right idea at the wrong time” and out of step with the “deregulation zeitgeist”, and risks stifling innovation at a time when Europe should be seeking ways of accelerating, not restricting, development.&lt;/p&gt;

A European containment strategy reworked for the present particularities can help Europe unify around a common approach to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States appearing to move away from its traditional lead role in deterring Russian power in Europe, the European Union and European capitals need a unified strategy for filling the gaps left by a potential American disengagement from the continent. The Cold War–era strategy of containing the Soviet Union, originally articulated by George Kennan, could prove firm enough to be effective, while flexible enough to maintain European unity in confronting Russian power. This strategy of containment should be updated to reflect the particularities and complexities of the present day and reframed to avoid the pitfalls of its twentieth-century predecessor. Then as now, containment should aim to constrain the projection of Russian power and influence, while avoiding a direct conflict between Russia and the Western alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has marked a paradigm shift in how Europe must conceptualize relations with Moscow. After three decades of seeking to reconcile the expansion of the Euro-Atlantic security space with reassurance and engagement with Moscow, European states now find themselves the principal backers of Ukraine’s effort to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty as the United States looks to reduce its transatlantic commitments. Amid this crisis, Europe must grapple with the longer-term implications of an era of protracted confrontation with Russia, one that will almost certainly outlast the fighting in Ukraine. Whatever end state it achieves in Ukraine, Moscow will likely maintain its adversarial posture toward Europe, insofar as Europe remains committed to Atlanticism, liberalism, and European integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three years of the conflict saw consistent transatlantic cooperation, with Washington providing substantial military assistance—including actionable intelligence—and working closely with European capitals, the European Union, and NATO to ensure a coordinated response. Despite frictions over weapons deliveries, strikes on Russian territory, and other issues, Europe and the United States maintained a common outlook on securing a favorable outcome to the war. The arrival of the Trump administration in 2025 has raised new questions about the nature and extent of transatlantic comity, with the White House calling for a concentration of resources in the Indo-Pacific theater. While some of these shifts could stall or be reversed after the next U.S. election, they testify to a new strategic reality facing Europe, which must now bear more of the burden of keeping Ukraine in the fight and ensuring a stable postwar settlement on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater strategic clarity and unity is paramount. Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe was divided in its posture and policy toward Moscow. In Europe’s east, former Warsaw Pact states viewed Russia as a hostile actor and advocated a hawkish approach toward Moscow. However, splits emerged as far-right leaders in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria took a softer line. Western Europe, meanwhile, tended to adopt a more transactional approach toward Russia, embodied by Germany’s support for the Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines, the United Kingdom’s embrace of Russian oligarch wealth, and decades of efforts by Western European leaders to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin. The stark split between Western and Eastern Europe on Russia policy left the European Union divided and without a coherent policy toward Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States now playing less of a deterrent role, it is paramount that Europe develop a common strategy toward dealing with the threat and challenge posed by a revanchist Russia. It is often difficult for “Europe” to reach a common foreign policy approach, as Europe often exists in slightly different formats—the European Union and NATO have overlapping but not identical memberships. However, it will be vital for the future of European security that Europe, meaning the European Union plus the United Kingdom and Norway, adopt a common long-term strategy toward Russia. There has been considerable talk of power shifting eastward within the European Union, demonstrated by two prominent Baltic political leaders gaining top foreign and security positions within the grouping. Yet a common strategy toward Russia can only be forged through the support and backing of Berlin, given the size and importance of Germany within the European Union. Thus, the future of German foreign policy toward Russia will set the tone for the bloc. Furthermore, EU and UK alignment on defense and foreign policy is critical and has become a cornerstone of rebuilding cross-channel relations post-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and Russia will likely remain antagonists for years to come. The Kremlin possesses immense disruptive global power and is willing to take great risks to advance its geopolitical agenda, including potentially even risking a land incursion into NATO territory. Coping with Russia will demand a long-term strategy for Europe, one that echoes containment, which guided the United States through the Cold War—what President John F. Kennedy called a “long, twilight struggle” against the Soviet Union. More than 75 years have passed since the U.S. diplomat George Kennan first formulated that strategy in his famous “Long Telegram” from Moscow. In his ensuing 1947 Foreign Affairs article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” Kennan described containment as a political strategy reinforced by “the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points.” The goal was to avoid direct conflict with the Soviet Union while halting the spread of Soviet power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennan was writing for an American audience at a moment when much of Europe remained prostrate from World War II. Today, however, a wealthy, democratic Europe will have to take on more of the burden of containing Russia’s renewed campaign to expand its influence and weaken the West. This report calls for a new European containment strategy for Russia in full recognition of Europe’s structural complexities. What is critical is that European states, the European Union, and Europe’s NATO members adopt a common strategic approach toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new containment strategy must account for the novelty of the present moment in other ways as well. Kennan’s vision of containment focused primarily on Central and Eastern Europe. While the lands and peoples lying between the European Union and Russia will again be central to the success of a containment strategy, European leaders will have to account for the fact that Europe itself is no longer the pivot for global geopolitics. A modern containment strategy must grapple in particular with the role of China, which is both an enabler of Russia’s war effort and a rising global power that will remain the central focus of U.S. foreign policy during the Trump administration and beyond. It will also have to account for the shifting, perhaps unpredictable role that the United States itself will play in European security in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A refashioned containment strategy would presume that Russia will continue trying to dominate Ukraine. Containing Russia in Ukraine means keeping the line of contact as close to the Russian border as possible, thereby constraining Russia’s expansionist tendencies. But containment will remain necessary irrespective of how the war in Ukraine ends. As in Kennan’s day, a containment strategy seeks to check Moscow’s aggression without risking a direct conflict. But it is not enough to dust off Kennan’s prescriptions. The past is a guide, but new times call for new thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawing-lessons-from-the-containment-strategy-toward-the-soviet-union&quot;&gt;Drawing Lessons from the Containment Strategy Toward the Soviet Union&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-led-to-containment&quot;&gt;What Led to Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War containment strategy arose in response to two basic circumstances. The first was the recognition, after 1945, that the Soviet Union was expansionary. Moscow was projecting its military power into new theaters—from East Germany to Iran to the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, Moscow’s political influence was spreading via the international communist movement, whose different parties were loyal to the Soviet Union to varying degrees. The rise of a communist China supercharged the task of managing an ascendent and ambitious Soviet Union. The second circumstance was the advent of the nuclear age. Although the United States had a monopoly on nuclear weapons from 1945 to 1949, Washington could not assume that there would be only one nuclear power in the world. From the beginning, it had to presume that the Soviet Union might join the ranks of the nuclear powers, though by the measurement of its remarkable conventional power in 1945, even a non-nuclear Soviet Union was effectively undefeatable. This condition of having an undefeatable adversary forced creative ways of thinking on the United States, which had entered World War II with the explicit (and militarily traditional) goal of defeating Nazi Germany and imperial Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment answered the dilemma of what to do about the Soviet Union. Key to containment was the refusal to accept widening spheres of influence for the Soviet Union, particularly in Europe. Containment was about holding the line, as evidenced by Washington’s unwillingness to concede West Berlin to Soviet control in the late 1940s. Containment also led to the Korean War in 1950, when Soviet and Chinese power combined to produce a military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. Well into the 1950s, containment demanded high levels of military expenditure, part of which was used to hold the line in places like West Berlin and South Korea, and part of which was used to deter the Soviet Union directly. The establishment of the NATO alliance must be understood within the strategic parameters of containment. In addition to holding the line, containment entailed the management of conflict with the Soviet Union; it eschewed regime change in the short to medium term (with some expectation that the Soviet Union’s internal contradictions may lead the country to defeat itself, or “mellow,” in Kennan’s words, over time); and it did not threaten the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union itself. Nor did containment threaten the territorial integrity of the Warsaw Pact states, which were under Soviet control throughout the Cold War. If NATO existed within the strategic parameters of containment, so too did arms control and negotiation with the Soviet Union. Occasionally at risk of being contradictory, containment was at its best a flexible strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;versions-of-containment&quot;&gt;Versions of Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different versions of containment crystallized around the influential figure of U.S. diplomat George Kennan. At first, Kennan argued against any kind of diplomacy with the Soviet Union: He judged Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to be too deceptive and intransigent for normal diplomatic back-and-forth. Especially after Stalin’s death in 1953, however, Kennan came to feel that containing the Soviet Union could be combined with conventional diplomacy. Kennan also emphasized two particular aspects of containment. The first was that it was primarily a political doctrine and that stemming the spread of Soviet communism had to be practiced through support for democracy (among allies) and by the setting of a good political example. The second was that covert methods were preferable to anything resembling direct military confrontation. As with diplomacy, Kennan would change his mind about covert action in later phases of the Cold War, coming to feel that the United States had too zealously embraced covert action in its struggle with Soviet communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennan’s intellectual rival in the U.S. government was Paul Nitze, his successor as director of policy planning at the State Department and later a U.S. deputy secretary of defense. Nitze placed a higher premium on military confrontation with the Soviet Union, an ideological reading of the Cold War as a titanic struggle between liberty and tyranny, and the use of fear to mobilize the American population into supporting high levels of defense spending. Nitze won many of his bureaucratic arguments with Kennan in the 1950s. The American president who revived Nitze’s thinking, after the catastrophe of the Vietnam War, was Ronald Reagan. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, three years after Reagan left the White House, many Americans concluded that Reagan’s robust language and actions, along with high levels of military spending, had won the Cold War for the United States. But with the overreach of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and then again with the deterioration of relations between Moscow and Washington since Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Kennan’s version of containment began getting a second look by policymakers in Washington. The intellectual battle between Nitze and Kennan continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War containment was never anything other than a transatlantic venture, even if the strategic tone was initially set in Washington. Over time, France and the United Kingdom would join the United States as nuclear powers, holding up a nuclear umbrella over Western Europe. West Germany engaged in serious rearmament in the 1950s and 1960s, joining the United States and a host of other NATO member states to balance out the conventional military superiority that the Soviet Union had in Europe throughout the Cold War. On the cultural and political plane, Europe and the United States were in agreement about the imperative of stopping the spread of Soviet power, which Moscow attempted to disseminate across Europe through structures designed to promote sympathy for Soviet communism. Through espionage and subversion and through active measures, Russia attempted to weaken the underpinnings of European and transatlantic unity. But while Europeans at times chafed at certain Cold War decisions made in the United States—which sat far removed from the frontlines of Soviet campaigns—on balance they were deeply committed to containment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;problems-of-containment&quot;&gt;Problems of Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment led to two core problems. The first was its potential to spill over into regional wars. Historians have increasingly rethought this aspect of the Cold War. Not only did the Vietnam War end in failure for the United States, and at enormous cost to the people of Vietnam, but Washington found itself embroiled in many bloody conflicts throughout what was then called the “third world.” A large price was paid for these conflicts, even when U.S. forces themselves were not the ones doing the fighting. For one, they damaged the United States’ global reputation, leaving millions upon millions of people skeptical about the claims made in Washington about democracy and human rights. In a different sense, these wars and conflicts undermined support for a strong Cold War policy within the United States itself. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States experienced a great deal of civic unrest, some of which was derived from the sense that what Washington was doing abroad—particularly in Southeast Asia—was morally questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment’s second, and related, problem was its lack of nuance. Too often the strategy was pursued as a one-size-fits-all approach. In Vietnam, U.S. policymakers fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the conflict, precisely because they viewed it through a containment lens. They failed to see the significance of Vietnamese nationalism and the resentment of foreign interference in the country’s domestic affairs; the different political patterns in the nations and cultures of Indochina; and that China too could be perceived (in Vietnam and elsewhere) as a source of foreign interference. The Vietnam War provided a microcosm of a core problem of U.S. Cold War foreign policy. When containment shaded over into regime change, as it occasionally did in U.S. Cold War policy, it led to unpredictable and negative consequences. For instance, U.S. efforts to topple the Iranian government in the 1950s created layers of resentment that directly enabled the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Containment needed to be balanced with careful and precise analysis of local and regional dynamics. Yet such analysis was more the exception than the norm. Again and again, the simplistic application of containment to situations of great internal complexity led to policy failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;containment-as-a-strategic-success&quot;&gt;Containment as a Strategic Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all its problems, containment was a remarkably successful strategy that accomplished three goals. First, it did not overstretch the United States and its European partners. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, all were still committed to containment, and all were economically viable states: There was enough political will, enough financial backing, and enough societal agreement on the validity of containment for the strategy to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Soviet Union was contained—not everywhere and not perfectly to be sure—but sufficiently. Western Europe remained free from Soviet domination. So too did Greece, Turkey, and much of the Middle East, along with Japan and South Korea. Latin America and Africa had checkered histories in this regard, but in no sense were they overrun by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there was no nuclear conflict. It came close during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and there were other moments of high tension, but ultimately the worst was avoided. Because containment had left room for diplomacy, there was an elaborate architecture of arms control in existence by 1991. It would endure for about three decades after the Cold War, which is more surprising than the recent unraveling of arms control between Russia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-case-for-containment-of-russia-in-ukraine-and-globally&quot;&gt;The Strategic Case for Containment of Russia in Ukraine and Globally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;containment-strategy-today&quot;&gt;Containment Strategy Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment has three advantages as a contemporary strategy toward Russia. First, because Russia is expansionary, the spread of Russian political and military power can either be accepted as unavoidable, or it can be contained—within and outside of Ukraine. To accept an expansionary Russia in Europe (and elsewhere) would be to undermine the foundations of liberal international order based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states big and small, which has been instrumental in Europe’s post-1945 peace and development. A collapse of this order will be followed by multiplying threats to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, containment, if carefully pursued, will keep escalation in check. It will not tip over into calls for regime change, and it will take into account the reality that Putin’s Russia is a nuclear power that also maintains the conventional capacity to inflict enormous damage on Europe. There is sufficient evidence that Russia is, indeed, containable. It is a myth that Putin always fights to the finish. When faced with a superior force and resistance, Putin often backs down, as he has from multiple threats of retaliation over U.S. and European support for Ukraine. Containment is not the absence of escalation—it is escalation within strategic and discursive limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, containment meets the fundamental needs of Europe, pinning outcomes to preventing the spread of Russian military power within Ukraine. It is anything but appeasement. It also can be communicated as a strategy that does not amount to a blank check, that honors the imperative of restraint, and that helps with the prioritization of foreign policy problems and budgeting. Policymakers can present containment to European citizens concerned about costs, escalation, and other risks as a strategy that emerges from the political center and that, if successful, could strengthen that center. It is a strategy that is neither quiescent or passive on the one hand, nor extreme or militaristic on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor does it require a large investment of U.S. financial or military resources over the longer term. While Europe will not be able to fully replace U.S. capabilities, it can do enough to make a containment strategy viable with limited U.S. backstops. Europe taking the lead on devising and implementing a new containment strategy could reinforce transatlantic relations by allowing the U.S. government to prioritize other strategic challenges such as China, while limiting Russia’s assertiveness as long as the existing restrictions and their enforcement remains in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nature-of-the-russian-threat&quot;&gt;The Nature of the Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a global strategy to diminish Western influence within existing international institutions, develop and expand new nonliberal or illiberal multilateral institutions, reassert its hegemony in much of Eurasia, and roll back Western power from strategic regions of the globe (as well as outer space). This strategy of revision and expansion is now central to the Putin regime’s ideology and domestic legitimation. It also has strong echoes in Russian and Soviet history that will make it likely to endure even after Putin departs the stage. Russia is not the only expansionist, revisionist power challenging the West and the world order it prefers, but in many ways Russia is the most ambitious and aggressive adversary Europe faces because of its willingness to use force to disrupt the existing international order and its long-standing strategic focus on maintaining a sphere of influence around its borders. It is also the principal driver of an emerging autocratic axis encompassing Iran, North Korea, and (to some degree) China that presents the democratic West with the most complex strategic challenge it has faced since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has consolidated the preeminence of this worldview inside Russia, while exacerbating anti-Western resentment. The war has also forced the Kremlin to confront many of the weaknesses facing its military and defense industrial base, including outdated technology and production bottlenecks. Following massive wartime investments in the defense industry, the Russian military is projected to come out of the Ukraine war with greater material capabilities than it went in with. Shortages of personnel will likely present the Kremlin a greater challenge; nevertheless, its policy of paying large bonuses to recruits has reinvigorated the economy of formerly derelict regions and ensured a minimally adequate flow of recruits. Moscow has been able to compensate for its shortage of personnel with mercenaries and troop contingents from North Korea and elsewhere. Even if the cost of these expedients makes them impractical over the longer term, they demonstrate how the Kremlin can improvise solutions to its vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three years of the ongoing war in Ukraine, Russia has demonstrated remarkable agility, defying many pessimistic forecasts. Having become the most sanctioned country in the world, it has managed to maneuver around many economic constraints, keeping revenues from energy sales high and its budget balanced, investing in the military and defense industry, ramping up domestic production of weapons and equipment, and boosting economic growth. At the moment, Russia appears economically and socially resilient and has adjusted to the sanctions-induced disruption of its ties with the West. Although defense spending is set to reach a post-Soviet record of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 (7.2 percent including related expenditures) and is expected to rise further despite growing signs of economic slowdown or recession, Russia’s economy appears sustainable for the next few years. Despite having suffered around one million casualties and losing hundreds of armored vehicles and artillery pieces per month on average over the last three years, Russia is estimated to be able to continue waging the war at the current level of attrition at least until 2027. The Kremlin has maintained social stability thanks to its efforts to create a wide pool of stakeholders among the elites and working classes and to boost domestic repression, propaganda, and ideological indoctrination, as well as the exodus of opposition-minded Russians and the popularity of triumphant propagandistic narratives in contemporary Russian culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war-induced socioeconomic changes have been so significant that the process of societal militarization is unlikely to stop even if the war in Ukraine were to end. Because military spending has by now become the main driver of economic growth, the end of hostilities will not lead to a radical cut-off of military investment. Russia will likely continue inflating its military industrial sector, and by most assessments will be able to reconstitute its army within the next decade. Besides conventional capabilities, Russia’s sophisticated and persistently evolving tool kit of aggression includes cyberattacks, coordinated disinformation, artificial migration crises, proxy actors, airspace violations, assassinations, political interference, and operations against critical infrastructure. This hybrid tool kit allows the Kremlin to move swiftly, run higher risks, and act aggressively across various domains. Accordingly, despite being inferior to NATO in terms of its conventional capabilities, today’s Russia represents a bigger challenge to European security than it did at the start of 2022. The Kremlin is learning from its past mistakes, upgrading its methods, and growing more emboldened by what it perceives as a Western inability to confront and contain it. Moscow’s ongoing large-scale military reforms signal that Russia could be preparing for some kind of future confrontation with NATO within roughly the next decade—including even a large-scale conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementing-containment&quot;&gt;Implementing Containment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraine-and-the-containment-of-russia&quot;&gt;Ukraine and the Containment of Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest way for Europe to contain Russia is by assisting Ukraine. As of now, there are three plausible scenarios for how the war in Ukraine could play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russian victory. In this scenario, tension and hostility would move closer to the borders of NATO. The fear of Russian invasion would percolate throughout Poland and the Baltic states, and the mistrust and friction between Russia and the West might well increase. Ukraine itself would be a failed state and source of chronic instability for Europe, or it would be a de facto Russian protectorate, like Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is a long, inconclusive war. In this case it would be in Europe’s interest to keep the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia as close to Russia as possible, and prevent it from moving westward. In this scenario, Kyiv could consolidate a functioning state in much of the country, acting as a buffer between Europe and Russia. Long-term consolidation of a prosperous, democratic Ukraine could exert a magnetic pull on Russian-occupied regions of eastern Ukraine (and on Russia itself), much as West Germany did with East Germany during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and preferred, scenario is Ukraine’s victory and recovery of its occupied territory. While this is unlikely at the moment, a Russian defeat in Ukraine may trigger a wide variance of outcomes, such as precipitating regime collapse or, conversely, causing Moscow to “lash out” more aggressively elsewhere, necessitating further containment. Russia might lose the war but not necessarily the intent of occupying Ukrainian territory or of sponsoring regime change in Kyiv. So long as the intent and the capacity for such meddling and aggression remain, containment will be strategically salient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fate of Ukraine remains fundamental to Europe’s security and to the success of a new containment strategy writ large. While a new strategy does not depend on Ukrainian victory, it should still retain Ukrainian victory as a long-term strategic goal. Forcing Russia to abandon most or all of its conquests will push the Russian threat further from Europe’s borders, forcing the Kremlin to grapple with the consequences of a failed war of aggression—much as the Soviet Union did after the Afghanistan debacle in the 1980s. A Ukrainian victory would encourage other countries to push back against Russian malign influence, especially across Europe and Eurasia. Conversely, a conclusion of the war on Russia’s terms could result in a new division of power and spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will require sustained Western military assistance. Importantly, the need to aid Ukraine will not stop when the fighting stops, as Kyiv will be in a race to rearm and rebuild its military capacity to deter future Russian aggression. It will also have to rebuild huge amounts of infrastructure, housing, and other assets destroyed during the war. Therefore, Europe will be asked by Kyiv to provide sustained military support, similar to that provided by the United States to Israel. Should Western governments prove willing to provide durable security guarantees to Ukraine, including potentially NATO membership, the urgency of the task to recapitalize Ukraine’s military will be reduced, since it would then have an effective deterrent to future Russian aggression. But without Western security guarantees, Ukraine will need to sustain a massive military force for the indefinite future, with deleterious effects on its civilian economy and standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, European militaries will also need to significantly rearm to deter Russia. The shambolic state of the European defense industrial base is an acute military vulnerability vis-à-vis Russia, in addition to being a major source of tension with the United States. Thus, Europe should focus its efforts on ramping up defense industrial production, both to support Ukraine and to rearm itself. This will require not just significant outlays of funding but also greater integration and coordination of European procurement efforts, ideally involving Ukraine and Ukrainian firms as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-russias-economic-achilles-heel&quot;&gt;Energy: Russia’s Economic Achilles’ Heel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their significance to the Russian economy, the dynamics of the global oil and gas markets should be taken into account in any containment strategy. While there is no way to predict the future of global energy prices, at some point global oil prices are likely to fall, creating significant economic and potential regime difficulties for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the Soviet economy, former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar explained in 2007 that in the late 1970s, “The hard currency from oil exports stopped the growing food supply crisis, increased the import of equipment and consumer goods, ensured a financial base for the arms race and the achievement of nuclear parity with the United States, and permitted the realization of such risky foreign policy actions as the war in Afghanistan.” Conversely, the drop in oil prices in the 1980s damaged the Soviet economy, prompting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms. Low oil prices in the 1990s added to Russia’s troubles and helped precipitate the 1998 financial crisis and the ruble’s collapse. The dramatic increase in oil prices in the 2000s bolstered Putin’s government and gave the Kremlin the resources necessary to modernize the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian economy was buoyed by the increase in global energy prices. Yet future changes in the oil market and the acceleration of the green transition create real vulnerabilities for Russia that can be exploited by the West. The Russian economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports. Over the past decade, the oil and gas sectors together have contributed to 30 to 50 percent of Russia’s total federal budget revenues and amounted to 20 percent of GDP on average, with oil constituting about 70 to 80 percent of that total. Oil prices futures will continue to have a dramatic effect on Russia’s ability to amass and project power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw the West impose significant economic sanctions, but these only mildly targeted the energy sector. The West has feared that aggressive action against Russia’s energy industry would trigger a global economic crisis and worsen inflation in the United States and Europe. The throttling of gas exports to Europe by Russia and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines have effectively closed off much of the European gas market to Russia. This development hit Europe’s economy hard, but it may hurt Russia more, stranding much of its gas supply in western Siberia. Russia has tried to involve China in building the Power of Siberia II pipeline to redirect stranded gas, but Beijing has shown little interest. In response, Russia is seeking to build up its liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity, but this has proven easier said than done, especially as sanctions and perceptions of political risk have caused foreign investment to practically dry up since the start of the full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of natural gas on Russia’s budget is minor relative to the role of oil. The West’s efforts to impose an oil price cap to force Russia to sell its oil below global market value have had mixed results. The Group of Seven (G7) price cap and the corresponding European oil embargo put in place in December 2022 did impact Russia’s energy revenue, forcing Russia to procure a “shadow fleet” of tankers and alter its supply routes to Asia. Recent efforts to crack down on the shadow fleet have stalled deliveries and pushed Russian oil prices further below the G7 cap, cutting into the country’s budget revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in energy prices from the spike in 2022, the loss of the European gas market, and the extra costs to redirect oil to Asia have had some impact on the Russian economy. Russian gas output has fallen by more than 15 percent since the war began thanks to the loss of the European market. Alongside Russia’s efforts to diversify its revenue by increasing non-energy taxes, these factors contributed to the share of oil and gas in government revenue falling from 42 percent in 2022 to about 30 percent in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s fossil fuel exports have kept its economy and therefore its war effort afloat, time is likely not on Russia’s side. Aside from the impact of war and sanctions, there are various economic and energy trends that could gravely impact Russia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the world may have an oil glut of new production. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected that global oil production capacity will far outpace demand, with the latter plateauing by 2030. A world of excess oil supply could lower prices and slow the energy transition. Prospects for a global economic slowdown are putting additional downward pressure on oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, the clean energy transition should reduce global oil demand. More than 50 percent of global oil demand comes from the transportation sector, with 25 percent of total demand—or about 25 million barrels per day—due to passenger travel. Road freight, aviation, and shipping make up the other half and will be harder to abate. Encouraging and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) globally will impact Russia’s economic prospects, making the energy transition a key part of any containment strategy. The IEA predicts that oil demand in advanced economies will fall sharply by 2030. The West will then be less politically and economically sensitive to global oil prices, which may have a significant impact on the willingness of Western, and particularly U.S., policymakers to target Russia’s oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the green transition accelerates not just in developed but in developing markets, it could further lower global demand. In China, for instance, new data shows that 50 percent of new cars sold this year are EVs or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Chinese overproduction of EVs may also flood developing markets in Asia and Latin America, not to mention Europe itself, accelerating the adoption of EVs in emerging economies that would put additional downward pressure on the global demand for oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a major consumer of oil and gas, Europe has some ability to shape these price dynamics through its investments and regulatory actions. Figuring out ways to deprive the Russian state of critical export revenue will weaken its ability to wage new wars, modernize its military, and maintain social services critical to sustaining public support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nuclear-factor&quot;&gt;The Nuclear Factor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has successfully deterred more intense Western intervention in Ukraine in part because of its substantial nuclear arsenal, which is roughly equal to that of the United States. Russia has gradually raised the nuclear temperature vis-à-vis the West by (1) engaging in nuclear “saber-rattling”; (2) taking additional steps up the escalation ladder, such as moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, hinting at the possibility of a nuclear test, and announcing revisions to its nuclear doctrine; (3) rejecting offers to return to nuclear arms control talks with the United States; and (4) reducing its support for nuclear nonproliferation efforts, especially in relation to North Korea and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraints on Russia’s actual use of a nuclear weapon remain real: Moscow’s risk aversion vis-à-vis NATO in the context of the Ukraine war suggests that nuclear deterrence with the United States continues to hold. Russia’s key partners in the Global South—as well as China—have also warned the Kremlin against using nuclear weapons. Still, a containment strategy with regard to Russia should assume that Moscow will remain comfortable with a higher level of systemic nuclear risk than Western states. Containment should also prepare for the fact that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear actions will have a cumulative impact over the medium term. Moscow is establishing a more dangerous nuclear environment. Within it, nuclear escalation may become more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-regionally-and-globally&quot;&gt;Russia Regionally and Globally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is doubling down on its long-standing effort to diminish Western influence in the heart of Eurasia. Russian-backed gray zone operations aim to destabilize pro-Western governments in Moldova and Armenia. Moscow is also using a mixture of carrots and sticks to contest or squeeze out Western influence in states like Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, and Serbia. All of these states are in or closely tied to Europe, and Russia’s ability to influence them has a direct impact on European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Eurasia, Russia is taking advantage of disillusionment with the West to establish outposts of influence in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere. Many of these interventions are opportunistic and of limited strategic importance. Others, though, pose a challenge to Western counterterrorism campaigns—for instance, in the Sahel region—or access to critical resources. And efforts such as those in Libya and Sudan could allow Moscow to imperil vital lines of communication in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Russian intervention in the Global South aligns with steps to transform the liberal international order to one more favorable to authoritarianism and regional blocs. Along with China, Russia is at the forefront of efforts to promote alternative institutions of global governance. Institutions such as the BRICS alliance and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) lack the binding rules and commitment to liberal principles underpinning much of the international system crafted in the West at the end of World War II and given global remit by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc between 1989 and 1991. As Moscow emphasizes the lasting nature of its break with the West, it is increasingly pushing for these organizations to both expand their geographic scope (e.g., allowing Iran to join the BRICS and the SCO as a full member) and take on new functional capabilities to duplicate or replace many of the global governance tasks performed by legacy multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WESTERN EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the Russian security threat to the European continent above and below the threshold of war. These Russian actions, variously described as “active measures,” “hybrid warfare,” or “gray zone activities,” will pose a major challenge to European security in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s aim with these actions is two-fold: To undermine support for Ukraine and pursue a broader long-term revisionist challenge to Europe and the U.S.-led global order. The Kremlin views both conventional and unconventional military means as tools of national power and applies them in combination. The basic characteristic of this Russian line of effort is actions to harm or undermine its adversary that possess a degree of deniability, making these actions unlikely to trigger a wider war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s goal with these efforts remains to erode European political and societal cohesion, test European focus and resolve, and serve as an asymmetric deterrent—imposing costs or threatening to impose costs on Europe for actions taken against Russia. More broadly, these efforts strive to cause death by a thousand cuts. Each action viewed in isolation may appear rather limited in significance, but taken together they have the potential to have strategic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia may not be able to retaliate with sanctions, it can impose costs through active measures. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns and Richard Moore, chief of the UK Secret Intelligence Service, described a “reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe being waged by Russian intelligence, and its cynical use of technology to spread lies and disinformation designed to drive wedges between us.” A spate of unexplained attacks on gas pipelines and data cables in northern Europe have demonstrated the threat and inspired a range of European Union and NATO initiatives to protect critical infrastructure. Russia has been accused of being responsible for reports of explosive devices in DHL packages and aircraft, and a number of industrial arson attacks and drone usage targeting sensitive facilities. Russia has also stepped up its sabotage campaign across the European Union, as demonstrated, for example, by weaponization of immigration, a wave of attacks on gas pipelines and data cables in northern Europe, and the “Operation DoppelGänger” disinformation campaign disseminated through a network of cloned websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also assassinated defectors. From the use of a chemical weapon to attempt to kill Russian defector Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom to killing a Russian helicopter pilot who defected to Spain, Putin’s Russia has used assassinations as a tool of foreign policy. These assassinations serve to both intimidate and deter. The foiled plot to assassinate the head of Rheinmetall, one of the main producers of weapons being sent to Ukraine, would represent Russia taking its efforts a step further and actively seeking to punish those in the West supporting Ukraine and therefore to intimidate and deter others from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia may prioritize political interference in particular. Russia sees this as a key vector to erode Europe’s political cohesion and undermine transatlantic relations with relatively low risk of significant blowback. Moreover, the shock of Russian political interference in the West has subsided and even become somewhat normalized, thus making Russia fear little in terms of reprisals. Reduced U.S. commitment to European security would further ease these fears, making the escalation of such attacks increasingly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of European politics may make Europe more vulnerable to Russian interference than the United States or other countries. The regulated nature of European politics—with the amount of money, advertising, and campaigning often being more tightly controlled than elsewhere—means that covert financial or campaign support may have a more sizable impact. Relatively small amounts of money and effort, especially related to online influence campaigns, can have significant political effects. Indeed, there have now been numerous credible allegations of Russian actors seeking to provide financial support to far-right and far-left political figures and parties across Europe. Increasing support for antiestablishment parties and parties seeking a rapprochement with Russia is a cost-effective way to impact European cohesion. Europe, with its frequent elections, is a target-rich environment, where even a small country’s vote can shift EU or NATO dynamics through a Trojan horse leader or party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Washington potentially reducing its focus on European security, Moscow may further escalate its activities. The present dynamic may soon resemble the early days of espionage in the Cold War, where seemingly few clear redlines existed, with each side pushing the boundaries of what the other side could tolerate. Given the resurgent and emboldened Kremlin, the risk of hybrid escalation in Europe will increase rapidly in the coming years. As the Russian hybrid threat to Europe continues to evolve and intensify, Europe should be prepared to understand, mitigate, and prevent an inadvertent and uncontrolled escalation scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for Europe, however, is that its tools for deterring and responding to Russian hybrid attacks and political warfare are no longer clear. Europe has already used many of the tools at its disposal to respond to Russia’s invasion. Sanctions have been put in place, “diplomats” have been expelled, and Russian economic and oligarchic interests in the West have been seized or evicted. Thus, Europe now has fewer means left to retaliate and impose direct costs on Russia short of military force, meaning Europe’s ability to deter has weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must now be hypervigilant and call out Russian active measures and interference efforts. Counterintelligence efforts and pan-European coordination and solidarity will be important. One way to deter these attacks is to raise awareness of their wide-reaching impacts, thereby turning them into political rallying points that can build support among European publics for a long-term containment strategy. However, European leaders need to guard against creating a new “red scare” like that seen in the United States in the 1950s, when Senator Joseph McCarthy fanned societal fears of the Soviet-backed communist movement to target internal political enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe therefore needs to think about the tools it has to impose costs on Russia for its hybrid attacks. The most obvious method is direct support for Ukraine, whereby exposure of Russian measures could prompt European leaders to approve a new aid package or introduce a more advanced system to the battlefield. Alternatively, a Russian cyberattack or kinetic attack on critical infrastructure could prompt Europe to diplomatically or economically pressure China to reduce its support for Russia. In addition, Europe could escalate its existing efforts at sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Europe may need to think about developing tools and means to respond in kind. Such tit-for-tat responses may not have equivalent impact, as a hypothetical European cyberattack on a Russian hospital system may not have the same political impact on the Kremlin as one in Europe. Nevertheless, to deter Russia, particularly without the backing of the U.S. intelligence community and U.S. Cyber Command, Europe may need to develop its ability to respond unilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EASTERN EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has positioned Central and Eastern Europe on the front line of the new strategic competition between Russia and the West. While states along NATO’s eastern flank—including Poland, the Baltic countries, and Romania—worry about the expansion of the Ukraine war or Russian gray zone escalation, it is “in-between” states like Moldova, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and even Serbia that are most exposed to Russian-backed destabilization. Both eastern flank states and “in-between” states need reinforcement as part of a containment strategy. Containment will, however, look vastly different for countries in each of these two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s military capabilities along its eastern flank have been shored up over the past decade, beginning with the Enhanced Forward Presence adopted in the aftermath of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas. Post-2022 deployments have shifted NATO’s center of gravity to the east, with Germany playing a key role, including through the deployment of Panzerbrigade 45 to Lithuania. The challenge for NATO members will lie in ensuring these deployments and commitments are maintained over the longer term. Budgetary pressures and calls to distribute the burden of protecting NATO’s eastern flank more equitably are likely to shape the intra-alliance debate, especially in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indications from the Trump administration that the United States plans to shift the burden of European security to Europe, with the Pentagon planning significant force withdrawals, will leave Europe with a tremendous military challenge. Filling the gap left by departing U.S. forces will require Europe to both spend more and to reorganize itself militarily. In particular, Europeans will need to ensure they are able to fight as Europeans—and have the stockpiles to sustain an attritional war against Russia. European militaries currently lack the ammunition—from high-end long-range missiles to low-end artillery—to sustain a war against Russia. This will require not just procuring weapons from external suppliers but building a robust and capable defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, given the difficulties of dislodging an entrenched force, Europeans will need to ensure they are ready and able to defend every inch of EU and NATO territory at the outset of conflict, because once territory is lost, uprooting Russian forces may prove incredibly costly. NATO’s current posture in the Baltics, with multinational tripwire forces, is not enough of a deterrent. Russia may calculate that it can overwhelm this tripwire force, absorb NATO’s initial barrage of strikes, and then make major territorial gains as European forces run out of munitions and follow-on forces take time to deploy to the region. Thus, Europe needs to worry that its perceived military weakness will invite Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the European Union and NATO, Moldova and the non-NATO states of the Western Balkans are uniquely vulnerable because of their location, institutional weaknesses, and Russian influence among disaffected segments of the population, especially ethnic minorities. In Moldova, the 2024 election and commitment to EU integration offer a window of opportunity for Brussels and EU member states to encourage anticorruption measures that will root out sources of malign Russian influence and accelerate Chişinău’s path to EU membership. In the Western Balkans, the West’s leverage is premised on the promise of integration into transatlantic organizations. Given that those integration efforts have stalled, Russia is able to play on dissatisfaction with pro-Western reform efforts and hijack domestic politics by leveraging interethnic and political tensions in countries like Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. Russia exerts its influence in the region through hybrid activities, propaganda, and continuing energy sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE SOUTH CAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow aspires to wall off the South Caucasus from Western influence by leveraging geoeconomic tools and its influence over key political actors in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. These states are critical to Europe because they control access to Central Asia and serve as an important source of hydrocarbons. Even amid rising strategic competition, the South Caucasus—and even more so Central Asia—will remain a low priority for Europe. Still, European leaders should focus on ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these states, including the ability to maintain trade and transit ties with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Second Karabakh War in 2020, Moscow has pursued a strategic alignment with Azerbaijan (and its ally, Turkey) to bypass Western sanctions. It has also forged close ties with the ruling Georgian Dream party to imperil Tbilisi’s pursuit of Euro-Atlantic integration. While Armenia has pivoted toward the West since the Second Karabakh War, Russian influence in Azerbaijan and Georgia risks leaving Yerevan isolated and vulnerable to further aggression. Russia aims to partner with Turkey and Iran to establish a regional condominium in the South Caucasus and isolate the region from Western influence. While Georgia remains a formal candidate for EU membership and has been promised eventual membership in NATO, it is highly unlikely to join either organization anytime soon. Without Georgia, Armenia’s prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration remain slim as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has meanwhile leveraged its economic and energy connections to Central Asia to facilitate sanctions avoidance while bolstering trade ties, particularly with Eurasian Economic Union members Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. These states have also been important destinations for Russians fleeing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has deported large numbers of Central Asian migrants, while press-ganging others into military service. These experiences are likely to erode goodwill toward Russia in much of the region, providing an opening for European outreach. The five Central Asian states have also made real progress addressing the sources of their mutual distrust, leading to greater regional cooperation and integration. Central Asia’s growing interconnectivity provides a hedge against a Russian imperial resurgence and (conceivably) increases the region’s ability to attract Western investors. The European Union’s decision to invest around €12 billion (roughly $14 billion) in Central Asia under the Global Gateway Initiative is a positive step that requires sustained follow-up, as well as coordination with like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge to Russian influence is likely to remain the inexorable expansion of China’s economic and political footprints in the region. As long as Moscow and Beijing remain aligned strategically, Russia will continue to view Chinese influence in Central Asia as an acceptable price for Chinese support in Ukraine and at the level of global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A main difference between a strategy of containment toward Russia today compared to the Cold War is the global role reversal between Russia and China. During the Cold War, the major geopolitical competitor for the United States and its European allies was the Soviet Union, making Europe the geographic center for that competition. Today, China is seen by the United States as the “pacing challenge.” Thus, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has refocused NATO on its original core task of deterring Russia, the United States, as NATO’s key military actor, is focused more on Beijing than on Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is a key partner for Russia, not only in Ukraine, but also as an enabler of Russia’s challenge to the global order. There are reasons to believe Sino-Russian alignment is quite durable. The Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War erupted following Stalin’s death, and at its core was a fight over leadership of the global Communist movement. Modern commentators have often interpreted the Cold War schism as an indicator that there is an unseen fault line that is bound to shake the contemporary relationship at some point. But Russia and China today share a similar global outlook and are willing to set aside potential irritants to the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Sino-Russian partnership is becoming increasingly one-sided, as Moscow has come to depend more and more on Beijing for trade, technology, military, and financial support. Russia’s challenge to global order is more radical than China’s, and a durable containment strategy should look for ways to exacerbate Chinese concerns over Russia’s destabilizing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current circumstances, it is unlikely that the United States, Europe, or their allies will be able to pry Russia and China apart. Both China and Russia share mutual concern over perceived U.S.-backed and instigated “color revolutions” and a desire to make the world “safe for autocracy.” They further share an interest in asserting territorial claims and control over neighboring countries and territories (much of the former Soviet Union for Russia; the South China Sea and Taiwan for China), and in moving away from a U.S.-led and dominated world order toward a multipolar one. If anything, since the start of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the relationship between Russia and China has deepened, with the total value of imports and exports between the two having almost doubled from $141 billion in 2021 to $244.8 billion in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are clear limits to Chinese support for Russia. This is in part because Russia has much less to offer China. While Russia has provided China with high-end military technology and potential access to the Arctic, China has been reluctant to deepen energy ties, continually begging off Russian requests to build a new gas pipeline or boost investment. Deeply tied to the U.S.-led global financial system, China has sought to avoid major diplomatic and economic fallout over Ukraine and has resisted Moscow’s requests for direct lethal support. European leaders conveying to Beijing that providing lethal aid to Russia will have dire implications for its relations with Europe, its largest trade partner, serves as an additional deterrent to China’s more robust support of Russia. China has sought to build relations with Europe in order to maintain access to the European market, but also in the hopes of potentially creating a wedge in the Atlantic alliance. Chinese hopes of exacerbating divisions between the United States and Europe appear to have grown since Donald Trump’s election to a second term. Europe will need to do its part to maintain transatlantic coordination on China, even when doing so comes with definable costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AFRICA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has had success pushing European influence out of Africa in recent years, the Kremlin’s mounting resource constraints and a backlash against the brutality of Russian forces (especially those from the Wagner Group) create new opportunities. Russia’s inroads in Africa are a product of its ability to leverage anticolonial narratives and willingness to work with various unsavory actors, including Sahelian juntas, Sudanese warlords, or criminal syndicates. Its motives are both commercial and strategic, in the sense of displacing France and other postcolonial powers as the partner of choice. Its successes are grounded in the narrative that Moscow is the only partner willing to effectively fight separatism and terrorism in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE MIDDLE EAST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, confrontation with the West has caused Moscow to tilt closer to Iran and its partners in the “axis of resistance” (see below). This trend has intensified amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, in which Russia has adopted a staunchly pro-Palestinian position. While accepting a considerable cooling in its relations with Israel, Russia has continued to balance its growing closeness with Iran by also catering to its partnerships with the Gulf Arab states, which are important to its wartime economic survival. Russia’s military presence in the region remains confined to Syria (for now), though it is also eyeing a deep-water port in eastern Libya and other countries of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containing Moscow in the region requires a clear-eyed assessment of the opportunities—and associated risks—for Russia in exploiting tensions in the Middle East to harm Western interests. In response to setbacks in Ukraine or increased tensions with the West elsewhere, Russian horizontal escalation in the Middle East in the form of assistance to the Houthis in Yemen or other Iranian partners remains a distinct possibility. With ongoing Iran-Israel tensions, the question of Russia’s military support for Iran has added importance. Though Russia has attempted to position itself as a potential interlocutor between Iran and the West, the intersection of the Ukrainian and Middle Eastern conflicts is likely to reinforce the Moscow-Tehran axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE “AXIS OF UPHEAVAL”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recognize the scale of the challenge Russia represents is, first and foremost, to connect the dots of its global foreign policy. An especially urgent task in this regard is understanding the axis of Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—its internal dynamics, objectives, and limitations. Despite its illiberal, revisionist tendencies, the four-way axis lacks a shared, concrete vision for a future global order; there is limited evidence of trilateral or quadrilateral defense cooperation among the countries to date, and the partners differ in their tolerance for “upheaval”—with China likely being more risk-averse than Russia when it comes to fomenting tensions in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. Notwithstanding these limitations, cooperation stands to evolve, with implications for all four countries’ military capabilities, regional conflict dynamics, nuclear proliferation, and their collective potential to fragment the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Western states need to develop a coherent and joined-up approach both within NATO and the European Union toward the axis, including enhanced coordination on sanctions and in multilateral fora, especially on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) issues. The efforts to undermine the growing alignment among the axis powers may enable Europe to bring the United States on board. These measures should include improved intelligence sharing among allies on axis activities, as well as the use of strategic disclosures to warn of impending technology transfers and deter sensitive cooperation, as was previously applied in the case of Iran and Russia. It should also involve planning for a conflict where more than one of the axis powers is a belligerent. While acknowledging that sanctions and export controls alone will be of limited utility due to the axis’s long history of evading such measures, Western states should still target critical “chokepoint” technologies needed by axis members for drones, missiles, and other sensitive systems. Western capitals should also engage with countries on the axis’s periphery to prevent their closer alignment with it, as well as with countries that have leverage over its members (for instance, Saudi Arabia, India, and others). In addition, there are ways to exacerbate existing tensions between the axis members, including by reinforcing existing differences in their geopolitical interests in the Middle East and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pitfalls&quot;&gt;Possible Pitfalls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;underestimating-russia&quot;&gt;Underestimating Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “Russia is never as strong as she looks, nor as weak as she looks.” In the post–Cold War period, several assumptions led the West to repeatedly underestimate Russia’s resilience, newfound assertiveness, and ability to foment international disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, past policy often dismissed Russia as a “declining power,” overlooking the fact that indicators like the country’s shrinking population and resource-dependent economy had limited short-term impact on Russia’s disruptive capacity. A large, commodity-driven economy can remain viable even when isolated from Western markets, if it prioritizes short-term geopolitical power over long-term economic development. Second, the liberal internationalist belief that economic integration would moderate Russia also proved misguided. Instead of restraining its aggression, the Kremlin used energy revenues to elevate Russia’s global standing and attempted to leverage Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. Far from deterring hostility, joining the institutions like the Financial Action Task Force and Interpol allowed Putin to exploit them to serve Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the belief that Russia would eventually become a “normal” power and a liberal democracy reflected the post–Cold War “end of history” mindset. It made the West downplay Russia’s growing assertiveness: overlooking the 2008 invasion of Georgia, responding weakly to the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and blaming Russia’s aggression on NATO enlargement while underestimating the imperialist roots of its actions. These inadequate responses emboldened the Kremlin. Russia’s renewed assertiveness suggests its brief post-Soviet democratization was an anomaly, driven by the Kremlin’s temporary economic weakness. Without strong civil society, institutional constraints, or a break from imperial identity, post-Soviet Russia preserved much of the Soviet elite and mindset. Once it recovered its material capabilities, it resumed its global ambitions. Given the ideological roots of its aggression, appeasement will be futile, and containment remains the only viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;messianic-containment&quot;&gt;“Messianic” Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment is not a passive strategy. It is compatible with proactive approaches to both the war in Ukraine and to countering the spread of Russian power outside of Europe. At the same time, containment should not be a messianic way of conceptualizing foreign policy, as it sometimes was during the Cold War. In the Cold War, containment often led into strategic cul-de-sacs and foreign policy mistakes outside of Europe—justifying regime change (like in Guatemala and Iran), becoming tainted with paranoia when merged with the domino theory of state collapse and communist takeover (in Vietnam), and generating an overly militarized foreign policy in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, containment can be understood as a messianic doctrine, predicated on high defense spending and zero-sum conceptions of global great power competition, and at times aligned with the drive for regime change. It is desirable, however, not to understand containment in this fashion, to be conscious of the potential for strategic overreach, and to be alert to the limitations, an approach that historically and in the present moment has been the foundation for containment’s strategic successes. The proper spirit of containment is patient, resolute, and targeted. Containment is thus compatible with the effort to prioritize that will dominate U.S. foreign policy in Trump’s second term, and an effort that harmonizes with European foreign policy at a time of tight budgets and competing priorities (in both domestic and foreign policies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-takeaways&quot;&gt;Policy Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s resilience and adaptation to the Western countermeasures that have followed its adversarial actions have emboldened the Kremlin, making it double down on its trajectory of intensifying military and hybrid threats to Europe. If the past is prologue, this dynamic will persist as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power, and possibly beyond his rule. Regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will remain an acute security threat to Europe, the transatlantic alliance, and the liberal international order. The hybrid confrontation between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, while the risks of conventional confrontation—possibly with a nuclear dimension—will keep rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, while the Cold War strategy of containment appeared easy to maintain, in reality it was always a struggle. At times, it was too attached to the status quo, too passive, too drab; and at times it shaded into overreach. In the 1970s, many Americans were convinced that the United States was losing the Cold War. They had a hard time seeing a path to victory. Containment’s value as a strategy could only be perceived over time. Kennan acknowledged that Washington had to commit to containment for as long as necessary—until Soviet power had “mellowed” and no longer posed a threat to global stability. Containing Russia in the twenty-first century will require a similar commitment of time and resources. With Europe taking a larger role in devising and implementing containment, it will also require a greater degree of cooperation and unity among the European states, despite their different histories, strategic priorities, and perceptions of the Russia threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-and-paramilitary-tools&quot;&gt;Military and Paramilitary Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UKRAINE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries should fully commit to supporting Ukraine militarily and economically. The fate of Ukraine is fundamental to European security and to the success of a containment strategy. Russia’s victory in Ukraine would bring the threat to the European Union’s doorstep. Conversely, if Russia perceives its war in Ukraine to be a strategic dead end, it could be contained to the point of admitting failure. Europe will have to take the lead in bringing about a satisfactory conclusion to the war in Ukraine and to Ukraine’s reconstruction and redevelopment afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Europe’s investment in Ukraine, while significant, has not been sufficient. As a result, Ukraine is currently in an increasingly unfavorable position on the battlefield. Since January 2024, Russia has captured under 5,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory—averaging about six per day by April 2025, marking slower but persistent gains that reflect the Kremlin’s continued commitment to the offensive. An effective containment strategy requires further investment into provisions of weapons to Ukraine, and higher levels of defense integration within Europe. With U.S. military support for Ukraine likely to end, in the short term, Europe must ensure Ukraine can keep weakening Russia by purchasing U.S. weapons and coordinating aid with third countries like South Korea and Turkey in order to buy time required to address urgent capability gaps, particularly in munitions and coordination. In the long term, Europe must get serious about building a unified force capable of defending the continent without U.S. support and making military assistance to Ukraine sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONVENTIONAL MILITARY CAPABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Europe should urgently ramp up defense industrial production. The importance of boosting European defense is particularly acute in light of the new U.S. administration’s strategic prioritization of the Indo-Pacific and promises to reduce lethal support to Ukraine. Even as war has raged in Ukraine, European production lines have not yet fully maxed out their capacity. This persistent problem is rooted in the European Union’s failure to coordinate procurements and a chronic lack of defense funding, and urgently needs to be resolved. Through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), the United States has coordinated the global effort to aid Ukraine through frequent ad hoc meetings at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. This has helped avoid duplication and focus the assistance efforts of certain countries on particular tasks, such as providing air defense. However, under the Trump administration the United States has transferred leadership to the United Kingdom to convene and coordinate the group, leaving its future uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Europe may have to cope with a United States less engaged at NATO. European militaries should aim to be able to fight together without relying on the United States. Addressing the key capability gaps left by a disengaged United States will not only require more European spending but also—crucially—more European defense cooperation and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC STATECRAFT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs to maintain economic pressure on Russia. Sanctions and lack of access to the global financial system are negatively impacting Russia’s economy and war effort. But Moscow has also been adapting by transitioning to a war economy sustained by vast fossil fuel energy resources, particularly oil, and has found willing customers in Asia. As a result, Russia is unlikely to make major concessions, hoping instead that Western sanctions enforcement and its financial isolation erode over time. Maintaining pressure on Russia economically, and going after its oil revenues in particular, remain crucial to containing and limiting Russia’s current and future military and foreign policy options. Given political sensitivities about energy prices, the European Union should focus on sanctioning Russia’s shadow tanker fleet and otherwise imposing secondary sanctions on third-country firms failing to comply with sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HYBRID RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European governments should become hypervigilant in calling out and responding to Russian active measures or interference efforts. In the next few years, the Russian hybrid threat to Europe will keep growing, with the Kremlin likely becoming more emboldened through a perceived lack of response in kind. Europe should urgently develop coordinated tools to understand, mitigate, and prevent an inadvertent escalation scenario. This includes further steps to enhance resilience and developing bolder asymmetric responses to Russian actions, such as approving new aid packages for Ukraine, introducing more advanced systems to the battlefield, or deepening diplomatic and economic pressure on China in an effort to limit its support to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-and-global-frames&quot;&gt;Regional and Global Frames&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EASTERN EUROPE, THE SOUTH CAUCASUS, AND CENTRAL ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and its members should do more to support vulnerable countries in Russia’s vicinity. Europe should backstop security for countries around Russia’s periphery, offering reinforcement to both the eastern flank and “in-between” states. A new containment strategy should emphasize calibrated levels of political and military support to countries that are vulnerable to Russian aggression. With the exception of Belarus, Europe should help ensure these countries’ security and independence through training, arms sales and security assistance, and exercises. It should also focus on building their resilience against Russian hybrid threats via information sharing, law enforcement, intelligence cooperation, and investment in critical infrastructure. Europe’s strategy should further aim to disrupt Russia’s influence by supporting independent media platforms to counter Russia-backed propaganda in the region. An easy step would be to offer more funding for independent journalism to push back on Russian narratives by supporting outlets such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle, and the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Western states should help the Western Balkan countries and Moldova wean themselves off of Russian energy. This would have to be balanced by active diplomatic efforts to prevent further instability in these countries. European partners and the United States could also offer the investments and support mechanisms for Western Balkan arms companies to meet the needs of the Ukrainian army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment of Russian power in the South Caucasus requires being realistic about both the region’s challenges and the lack of consensus about its future within Europe. With formal integration remaining far off, the European Union should prioritize keeping the South Caucasus free from domination by regional powers. That approach requires maintaining the existing EU missions in Armenia and Georgia; investing in new infrastructure projects, particularly clean energy; and leveraging the interest of specific allies (e.g., France in Armenia and Turkey in Azerbaijan) to promote common objectives. It also means modernizing EU and NATO partnership arrangements to further promote reform and modernization in line with Western standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe and the United States can likely do little to catalyze a rift between Russia and China, they should be prepared in the event of a split to devote resources and attention to Central Asia in order to further pressure the relationship. In the interim, Western powers must remain engaged with the region’s leaders and peoples. They should work with regional leaders and organizations to encourage new investment, especially in projects that promote connectivity away from both Russia and China. They also ought to encourage and promote the role of friendly powers such as India and Turkey to counter any push for a Sino-Russian condominium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe may have some ability to soften Beijing’s approach to Russia. But to do so, Europe would have to make containing Russia a priority in its engagement with Beijing, which may come with an economic price. Currently, Europe’s economic relationship has taken precedence in relations with China, especially given the possibility of a transatlantic rift over trade and tariffs. Officials speak of “de-risking” Europe’s economic ties with China, but have been wary of threatening economic actions over China’s immense and vital support to Russia’s defense industry. Europe—especially Germany—will ultimately have to make a choice: If they accept that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses an existential risk to Europe and the global order that has facilitated the emergence of EU and European prosperity more generally, they will need to use the substantial economic leverage they have to limit China’s contribution to the Russian war effort. Doing so would require not just European states, but the European Union as a whole to think and act strategically, using its geoeconomic weight to achieve geopolitical goals. Being more assertive toward China would also give Europe more credibility with the Trump administration, which has made checking Chinese power a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term, Europe should leverage its trade and investment ties with China to influence Chinese policy toward Russia. While catalyzing a split between Moscow and Beijing is likely not possible, Europe should prioritize reducing Chinese support for Russian imperial ventures against its neighbors. It should also be willing to work with China and its companies on a case-by-case basis to build infrastructure projects—especially in energy and transit—that enhance countries’ resilience in the face of Russian coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GLOBAL SOUTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western states face serious constraints when seeking to limit—let alone roll back—Russian advances in Africa. They should try to contain Russia’s current presence and work to prevent its entry in other vulnerable states, including by exposing atrocities committed by the Wagner Group and other Russia-controlled forces on the continent, devising a security cooperation package that is tailored to the needs of African partners while still observant of transatlantic values, and engaging with African partners to develop their energy infrastructure and natural resources in a mutually beneficial way. Europe needs to show that it can deliver for ordinary Africans, whether by promoting improved governance, facilitating trade, or keeping the door to legal migration open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the reduced engagement and prioritization of Africa in U.S. foreign policy creates a void that Europe should seek to fill. Yet Europe’s colonial legacy, its intense focus on stopping migration flows, and a lack of firm diplomatic, economic, and military tools through which it can productively engage African states has left European engagement wanting. However, Europe’s institutional complexity can be an advantage; while a colonial legacy may haunt some European countries’ engagement, it may not impact others or the European Union as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Russia’s threat lies less in scaling up its military presence and more in using the region for limited horizontal escalation, deepening defense ties with Iran, and undermining Western efforts to reduce conflict. Getting Saudi Arabia to use its leverage with Russia has proven somewhat successful in limiting Russian cooperation with Iran in the past. The fact that Saudi Arabia has continued to hedge on its invite to join the BRICS since 2023 indicates that there may be continued scope to work with Riyadh to curtail Russia, if only on the margins. But Western policymakers should also be cognizant of the reality that as long as the Gaza war and Israel’s campaign against the “axis of resistance” continue, Russia will be able to exploit grievances with Western states in the Middle East (and the broader Global South).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MULTILATERALISM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter Russia’s efforts to chip away at trust in legacy multilateral institutions while boosting the BRICS, Western states should pursue a two-pronged approach: They need to get serious about global governance reform, while also exploiting fissures within the expanded BRICS. The former requires genuine steps toward UN Security Council reform, but also addressing perceived power imbalances in other bodies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Regarding the latter, important powers like Brazil or India do not see BRICS as an “anti-Western” club. They harbor reservations over the pace and scope of BRICS enlargement, and they pursue complicated foreign policy objectives. Western states should ensure that these countries remain interested in cooperation in the G20, which stands at risk of losing its capacity for collective action and sliding into a setting for East-West and North-South recriminations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-frame&quot;&gt;European Frame&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTAINMENT AS GOOD FOR EUROPEAN BALANCING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment can unify Europe’s diverse policies on Russia and Ukraine by addressing security fears in Scandinavia, Poland, and the Baltics, while also acknowledging public concerns, especially in Germany, about war costs and escalation. There is the chance to work toward a synthetic European Russia strategy, and this chance could be missed if the policies embraced are either too militaristic or too passive and reactive. Germany is well positioned to shape such a unified policy: Close enough to the conflict to stay engaged, yet able to connect with countries further from the war that are more concerned about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTAINMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR INTEGRATING UKRAINE INTO EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable containment strategy would not defer Ukraine’s integration into Europe. It would not posit Ukraine’s inclusion in European institutions and structures as something that can only happen when the war is over. This will strengthen Ukraine’s resilience and send a clear message to Moscow: The war launched to dominate Ukraine and sever its ties to Europe is backfiring, as Russia’s control over Ukraine steadily erodes. It is not enough to hold the line militarily in Ukraine. Kyiv’s emergence as a member of the European family would be the crowning jewel of a European and transatlantic containment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-frame&quot;&gt;Domestic Frame&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European publics demonstrate a wide spectrum of opinion on the war in Ukraine. Containment can work well across the political spectrum by balancing between a more aggressive approach favored by some parties and leaders and a more accommodationist stance preferred by others. In the same way that containment can be used as a tool of policy synthesis within Europe, it can be used as a tool of consensus building. It is not the strategy of any one party or any one group of political parties. It should be approached as the baseline policy of European governments and institutions like the European Commission, to which government coalitions can make their preferred modifications. It is helpful in this context that containment is not a strategic dogma, and it is not zero sum. It is a flexible strategy, which means it can be embraced by many different kinds of political leaders and political parties, and by wide segments of the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Containment” was a defining term of the Cold War, but it’s not essential to today’s strategic messaging and can sometimes be counterproductive due to its Cold War baggage. The word matters less than the concept, and the concept matters less than the story that is being told about the war in Ukraine. This story, crucially, is a story of progress since February 2022. Over the past three plus years, the transatlantic allies and partners have succeeded in containing the spread of Russian political and military power in Ukraine and Europe. The story can be woven into strategic communications at many different points. It can be used to underscore the value of the enterprise—the enterprise of containing Russia more generally. It can point to the future, not downplaying the challenges that lie ahead, but elucidating the supreme value of patience, the many long-term vulnerabilities Russia has, and the prospect, if not of outright victory, of achieving that which is most important for Ukraine and Europe—the preservation of an order based upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all European states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 16 July, the Israel Defence Forces launched a series of airstrikes on key sites in Damascus, including the Syrian Ministry of Defence, military headquarters, and areas near the presidential palace. Israel framed the strikes as a warning to the Syrian government against further escalation in Suweida in the south, where clashes erupted between a Druze militia and Bedouin groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the clashes local to Suweida, the Syrian government had deployed forces to restore order. According to Israeli officials, government forces entered a zone that Israel – currently occupying parts of the area – has designated as demilitarised of heavy weapons. The Israeli Air Force subsequently struck Syrian government targets, framing the strike as enforcement of its red lines and aimed at neutralising militias affiliated with the Syrian government responsible for massacres against the Druze minority in Suweida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 1,200 reported fatalities in a highly volatile escalation, there is a credible risk that such violence could recur. As part of a ceasefire agreement, the Syrian government started evacuating Bedouin families (up to 1,500 persons) trapped inside the city of Suweida. The UN International Organization for Migration reported that close to 130,000 people were displaced in the hostilities. Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to protect Syria’s Druze and condemned external intervention aimed at fracturing Syria’s national unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fragility-of-the-post-assad-transition&quot;&gt;The Fragility of the Post-Assad Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) emerged as the dominant force in the fragile new state that replaced the Assad regime, it has yet been unable to sideline other armed, former Jihadist factions with which it had previously collaborated during the anti-regime conflict. The challenges facing the interim Syrian government led by al-Sharaa are formidable: the task of constructing institutional capacity after decades of tyrannical dynastic Assad rule; managing acute financial constraints within a heavily internationally sanctioned economy; and contending with a critical shortage of trained civil administrators and professional security forces. Yet despite these obstacles, the central test confronting Syria’s new governing power has remained constant since December 2024: asserting effective and uncontested political and military authority across the entirety of Syria’s national territory and its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key regions of Syria managed to carve out quasi semi-autonomous spheres beyond the reach of centralised authority during the multisided civil war and the tumultuous years before Assad’s fall. These regions include: the northeast, governed by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); Suweida, with its Druze-majority population; and Deraa, which developed a distinct and negotiated relationship with the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent deadly violence marks the culmination of months of mounting local grievances compounded by inadequate or poorly conceived policies from the central government to respond to local demands for decentralisation in Druze-dominated areas. Recent violence erupted after a young Druze vendor from Suweida was reported to be forcibly stopped and kidnapped on 11 July at a makeshift Bedouin checkpoint on the highway between the province and Damascus. The Druze contend that the Syrian government has allowed the security situation in Suweida to deteriorate intentionally, as part of a broader strategy to reassert full control over the province. Hikmat al-Hijri, the dominant, yet polarising, leader of Syria’s Druze, has been a central figure in the recent violence, accused of endorsing Israel’s intervention on behalf of the Druze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Damascus, the loss of authority in one region could set a legitimacy-testing and undermining precedent, encouraging similar challenges elsewhere in the already fragmented state. Its inability to assert control in Suwayda not only undermines its image as a sovereign central power but also risks emboldening restive constituencies in Latakia, Hasakah, and even in Aleppo – turning isolated defiance into a contagion of fragmentation. For al-Sharaa, the stakes are therefore not just local – they are existential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all Druze factions have been irreversibly opposed to the interim government in Damascus, but a sizeable portion have sought accommodation on their own terms. Demands for special arrangements for the region began in January: Druze armed groups formed in Suweida refused to disarm and community elders insisted that government officials in the province were selected from among local residents. They reluctantly accepted the appointment of Mustafa Bakkour as governor, and only under pressure. Bakkour ultimately resigned in May due to sustained unrest. Until the final week of June, administrative oversight of Suweida was temporarily handled by an official from neighbouring Deraa province. Frequent demonstrations have signalled local rejection of government-affiliated security forces operating in the area. In the lead-up to the recent flare-up, tensions remained high – underscoring the persistent fractures between the centre and periphery and exposing the limits of Damascus’s ability to assert a monopoly on the use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-south-as-precedent-for-the-northeast&quot;&gt;The South as Precedent for the Northeast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has consistently emphasised two red lines regarding Syria: preventing the Syrian military from deploying south of Damascus and protecting the Druze population. These priorities have effectively positioned Israel as a central actor in what might otherwise appear to be a localised internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli policymakers are well aware that if the al-Sharaa government fails to establish control in Suwayda, it could significantly weaken Damascus’ posture – particularly in relation to the Kurds in the northeast. In that sense, Suwayda is not just a provincial contest; it is a strategic fault line with broader implications for Syria’s internal balance and Israel’s regional deterrence architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is not a monolithic entity; it comprises a patchwork of Arab tribal factions that joined the coalition at different points to fight against Islamic State (Daesh) and, in some cases, to oppose the Assad regime following the outbreak of Syria’s multisided civil war in 2011. However, the Kurdish-Arab tribal consensus has been under strain, especially in non-Kurdish majority areas. Now, government failure in the south risks exposing the hollow core of post-war Assad rule and reinforces the image of a fragmented Syria. This raises the risk that the Syrian Kurdish narrative – namely, that Damascus lacks the capacity to govern the entirety of Syria – may gain further traction. However, to date, the SDF have shown no signs of intent to disrupt the ongoing, historically significant disarmament process involving the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel-us-tensions&quot;&gt;Israel-US Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s strikes in Suweida and Damascus have resuscitated speculation that there is daylight between US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Such noise had subsided after what appeared to be a turning point following US strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites in the aftermath of Israel’s operation “Rising Lion”. Now, the flareup in Syria seems to have widened the gap between Trump and Israel’s ruling government over both strategy and timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystalising signs of the divergence, US Envoy for Syria and Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack said, “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defence.” He added, Israel’s intervention “creates another very confusing chapter” and “came at a very bad time.” In a rare critique of Israeli policy, the news site Axios quoted several US officials as being critical of Netanyahu, with one unnamed White House official as saying, “Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time . . . This could undermine what Trump is trying to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s stated rationale for its latest strikes in Syria blends claims of self-defence with a purported commitment to protecting the Druze minority. Israeli officials insist they will not allow hostile actors to establish a foothold along Israel’s northern frontier and have unilaterally demanded the demilitarisation of areas south of Damascus. The effect of this is that the Syrian government must effectively relinquish its sovereign right over its own territory, ceding sovereign rights to its territory and the airspace above it to Israel. This, despite a series of consistent signs from Syrian interim president Al-Sharaa that Damascus is not interested in hostilities with Isreal, even going as far as to indicate the possibility of a non-aggression agreement brokered by the US in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public criticism by Barrack is likely meant to send a warning to Netanyahu that the White House is growing impatient with military action that runs counter to Trump’s vision for a centralised and “back-to-business” Syria. In recent days, the UK and 27 states jointly issued a statement against “drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians” in Gaza. Israel’s actions in Syria have risked alienating Israel further. In a notable show of regional solidarity, Turkey and ten Arab states issued a joint declaration on 17 July condemning the strikes as violations of Syrian sovereignty. They reaffirmed support for Syria’s unity and territorial integrity, rejected foreign interference, and welcomed the ceasefire between the Syrian government and Druze militias in Suweida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-ceasefire-realities-and-constraints&quot;&gt;Post-ceasefire Realities and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fragile ceasefire in Suweida is holding, for now. But what will this deadly chapter of the post-Assad transition, the failure of Al-Sharaa’s forces to prevent violence against Druze civilians and the local Sunni Arab population, mean for US support for the man that Trump described as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key conclusions can be drawn from the recent conflict. The first is the sheer difficulty Damascus faces in asserting authority across the entirety of Syrian territory. Countering Hikmat al-Hijri and his group – comprising only a few thousand armed fighters – should have been a straightforward task for the al-Sharaa government. Yet, Damascus has demonstrated a weak hand in projecting and sustaining control, particularly when it ignores local power dynamics and communal grievances. The Druze have been a persecuted minority for a long and fraught history. Al-Sharaa inherited this problem; he did not create it. However, his interim government could have done more to foster national consensus around the new governance framework, pairing calls for militia integration with genuine efforts at political inclusion. His forces – already under-resourced and lacking in cohesion – appear to have overreached by attempting to reassert control over Suweida through pro-government tribal militias, without adequately addressing the province’s specific grievances or its expectations from the post-Assad order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and related, lesson is the risk that violence can erupt elsewhere in Syria should Damascus try to forcefully gain territorial control in fragmented areas by mobilising armed Arab tribal factions in lieu of negotiated agreements with local communities to promote integration with the Syrian state. Should the attempted uprising that occurred between Latakia and Tartus in March be repeated, for example, the Syrian government may face a renewed challenge to its force projection across volatile intra-communal and cross-regional fault lines inside Syria. It is worth bearing in mind that it was not only regime forces that were compelled to withdraw from Suweida: Arab tribal militias – many of whom had deployed thousands of fighters to the area to support the regime or avenge killed kin – were also forced to pull back in the ceasefire agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being at a structural disadvantage, the Druze managed to expel both state forces and their tribal allies from Suweida. This outcome is likely to have been noted by other actors in comparable circumstances and may well influence future challenges to Damascus’ authority. The most consequential issue on the horizon is the question of how, whether and under what terms the SDF will integrate with Syrian Ministry of Defence forces, and how this will impact the balance of power in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Damascus needs to urgently build up a professional and centralised security force with a recognisable command and control structure and effective deployment capabilities. The current approach that relies on regional armed group integration is slow and contingent on shifting militia interests and loyalties. Even more concerning than the challenge of security sector reform (SSR) and force institutionalisation is the possible emergence of an alternative armed movement – formed outside the control of the state – consisting of thousands of tribal fighters mobilised under the banner of restoring stability or exacting revenge. ;Moreover, some leaders of Sunni Arab tribal factions have openly declared that the ceasefire applies to the government – not to them – highlighting the fragmented nature of authority on the ground. Complicating matters further, although the tribal council claims to represent southern tribes, there is credible evidence that the clashes have also drawn in tribal fighters from Deir ez-Zor, Hama, Idlib, and Aleppo, as well as a number of foreign-trained militants with a history of involvement in intra-communal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third conclusion drawn from this conflict is that should al-Sharaa’s government delay in a process of accountability to deliver justice in the aftermath of the atrocities that were committed in Suweida by all sides. This requires public procedures against those affiliated with Sheik Hijri as well as pro-government militia and rebel factions drawn from ex-Jihadi fighters (including some foreigners) to investigate killings, torture and kidnappings that are reported to have taken place. There needs to be a swift, credible and transparent investigation and the perpetrators held to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief but deadly bout of fighting resolved none of the underlying triggers that drove the escalation. On the contrary, both Druze forces and Sunni Arab tribal fighters employed severe violence against one another, deepening inter-communal animosity and heightening minority insecurities. With memories of the massacre in Latakia still fresh, the reciprocal abuses reported in Suweida are magnifying fear across communities – and rising fear is delaying disarmament. Taken together, these dynamics suggest that another round of violence in Syria – beginning in Suweida but potentially spreading more widely – may not be far off. It is conceivable that in the coming months we may witness a series of new clashes – possibly extending into Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between January and March 2025, the United States indicted or sanctioned individuals and companies linked to Chinese state-sponsored threat actors known as APT27, Red Hotel, and Flax Typhoon – labels used by cybersecurity researchers to group entities with similar tactics. Many of the individuals behind these groups trace their roots to an earlier community of elite hackers known as “red hackers” or “Honkers”, active in online forums during the mid-1990s and 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following two decades, these Honkers evolved from informal hacker collectives into key architects of China’s cyber apparatus. Many founded security startups, helped build cybersecurity teams at major tech firms such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei and helped shape a cybersecurity market driven by attack-defence capabilities. Today, these capabilities likely serve as key enablers of China’s advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, as cyber operations are increasingly carried out through private-sector proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6CRVHmT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ From Grassroots Hacktivism to the Professionalisation of Red Hacker Groups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report by the Cyber Defense Project at the Center for Security Studies (CSS) at ETH Zurich titled “Before Vegas: The ‘Red Hackers’ Who Shaped China’s Cyber Ecosystem,” charts this evolution. It focuses on 40 influential figures – referred to as “The Red 40” – and traces how informal talent was gradually absorbed into a tightly integrated ecosystem: one where informal networks, private enterprise, and state interests intersect through a mix of grassroots experimentation, strategic alignment, and increasing institutional control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-making-of-the-red-40&quot;&gt;The Making of the Red 40&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red 40 came of age during China’s early internet era. After China connected to the global internet in 1994, universities became key hubs for connectivity and experimentation, helping foster hacker culture before widespread internet access. By the late 1990s, red hacker groups began to emerge, driven by nationalism, technical curiosity, and rising geopolitical tensions. Groups like the Honker Union, Green Army, and China Eagle Union gained prominence during a wave of “cyber wars” between 1998 and 2001 – targeting foreign entities perceived as hostile to China, including the US, Taiwan and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations were both offensive and defensive, offering hands-on experience in real-world conditions at a time when China’s cybersecurity ecosystem was still in its infancy and formal training pathways were limited. Universities offered few dedicated programs, and mechanisms like Capture the Flag competitions (competitions are simulated cybersecurity challenges where participants apply offensive and defensive skills – such as exploiting vulnerabilities, reverse engineering, or cryptography—to solve problems and retrieve hidden “flags” for points) or bug bounty platforms (structured initiatives where organizations invite security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in their systems, offering financial rewards for valid findings) remained nascent throughout the 2000s, only gaining traction in the early 2010s. Red hacker groups filled this gap. Self-organized and technically rigorous, they developed skills through trial-and-error – often by probing real-world targets, driven by the belief that mastering offensive techniques is essential for effective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7MlXlfo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The Red 40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While groups like the Honker Union and Green Army attracted thousands of users, it was their inner circles that drove real technical innovation and gave rise to the Red 40. These 40 technically advanced individuals played a central role in laying the foundations of China’s domestic cybersecurity industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-the-industry&quot;&gt;Building the Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 2000s, an increasing number of prominent red hacker groups fractured under growing pressure. Internally, many faced leadership disputes, diverging goals, and an aging member base. As one former Honker Union member put it, “Above all, most of us who were students had to find practical things to do after our graduation.” Externally, the government had become increasingly wary of hacking group activities. The 2009 Criminal Law Amendment VII criminalized unauthorized intrusions and the distribution of hacking tools, leading to arrests and online forum closures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the same period, China’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector was undergoing rapid growth, driven by telecom expansion, rising internet penetration, and the rise of major tech firms. This environment attracted many Red 40 hackers. Some founded cybersecurity start-ups, such as NSFOCUS and Knownsec, while others joined established cybersecurity firms such as Venustech and Topsec or helped build cybersecurity teams at Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite this growth, the cybersecurity industry remained underdeveloped. As Chinese tech outlet PingWest noted, “before 2010, cybersecurity had not received the attention it deserved from any perspective.” The 2013 Snowden leaks marked a turning point. They confirmed long-standing fears of US surveillance and accelerated a national push to strengthen China’s cyber capabilities. Investment surged and regulatory frameworks were overhauled, boosting economic incentives by a lot. In this context, Red 40 led the transition into a new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PqFtyVo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Trajectories of the Red 40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-2010s, companies founded by Red 40 members, such as NSFOCUS and Knownsec, had become national leaders. Some Red 40 figures went on to lead cloud security efforts at major tech firms like Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. Others launched startups in emerging fields such as APT tracking and cybercrime intelligence. Labs such as Tencent’s Keen Lab and Xuanwu Lab, led by Red 40 members, gained global recognition in vulnerability research through elite hacking competitions and bug bounty platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embedding-into-state-operations&quot;&gt;Embedding into State Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s cybersecurity industry matured in the 2010s, so did its ecosystem of highly sophisticated and persistent state-sponsored cyber actors, increasingly built around private-sector proxies. Parallel to their contributions to the private sector, Red 40 members have also become key figures in China’s state-sponsored cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures such as Tan Dailin (wicked rose), Zeng Xiaoyong (envymask), and Zhou Shuai (coldface) transitioned from online forums to front companies conducting cyberespionage for government security agencies, becoming central actors in groups such as APT41, APT17, and APT27. From January to March 2025, not only front companies but also established firms led by Red 40 members have been linked to state-sponsored operations. Among them are i-SOON—led by Wu Haibo (shutdown) and Chen Cheng (lengmo) – and Integrity Tech, headed by Cai Jingjing (cbird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These firms, which have associated with threat actors Aquatic Panda and Flax Typhoon –reportedly responsible for compromising victims within a wide range of industries globally – place a strong emphasis on commercial cybersecurity training. This distinction is important: unlike front companies, which often have minimal commercial activity and serve primarily as operational cover, real businesses are profit-driven, scalable and embedded in the broader cybersecurity sector. For instance, Integrity Tech leads China’s cybersecurity training market with a 20.4% share. Leveraging such firms enables more persistent, better-resourced and more innovative cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Red 40 networks and tool sharing in Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many of the Red 40 members involved in state-sponsored operations were personally acquainted and maintained long-standing professional and informal networks that helped shape how talent and tools are shared across China’s APT groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-the-red-40-to-the-next-generation&quot;&gt;From The Red 40 to the Next Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red 40 laid the foundation for what has since evolved into a structured and institutionalized cyber ecosystem, anchored by an industry increasingly driven by innovation in attack-defence capabilities. Unlike earlier generations who came of age reading hacker magazines and teaching themselves online, the country’s cyber workforce is now shaped by hacking competitions, specialized university programs, and attack-defence exercises. Today, companies rooted in capture the flag culture are regarded as a primary engine of innovation, offering offensive and defensive services like red teaming, penetration testing and threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Old school vs. new school commentary 22/07/25.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders like Chen Peiwen (Boundary Unlimited), Kevin Shen (Yunqi Wuyin), and Shu Junliang (Feiyu Security) led top university CTF teams before launching startups built on offensive capabilities. Their firms focus on fuzzing, application security, and secure software development – fields where offensive skills offer a strategic edge. Others, such as Zhang Ruidong (NoSugar) and Yang Changcheng (Zhongan Netstar), apply similar techniques to fraud detection and law enforcement support. As this ecosystem grows, it likely plays an increasingly central role in enabling China’s APT activity, given the state’s growing use of private-sector actors to conduct cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of China’s red hackers is a case study in how informal cyber communities, given the right incentives – can evolve into core enablers of state capability. The Red 40 didn’t merely staff China’s cybersecurity ecosystem; they shaped it from the ground up. As other nations consider how to cultivate cyber talent and strengthen public-private partnerships, China’s experience offers a powerful lesson: what begins in anonymous forums can end in boardrooms and on digital battlefields. Ignoring this emerging civilian talent comes with strategic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last decade, the United States has maintained that it is a “Pacific power,” and multiple administrations have affirmed the importance of the vast Pacific Islands region to U.S. national security. Increased engagement with the Pacific, which began under the first Trump administration, has broad bipartisan support as a security priority. As the first 100 days of the second Trump administration drew to an end, rhetoric coming out of the administration echoed this trend, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visiting Guam and Hawaii on his first trip to the Indo-Pacific, during which he stressed the critical nature of Pacific U.S. territories at the “tip of America’s spear” of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pacific leaders have consistently stated that they look to actions, and not just words, as proof of a nation’s commitments. Here, recent cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the pausing of U.S. foreign assistance, enacting tariffs on small and vulnerable island economies, and deprioritizing climate change—the top priority for the region—have had a decidedly negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of U.S. intent, the perception across the Pacific of the United States as a disinterested and mercurial partner undercuts the country’s ability to build meaningful and lasting partnerships in the Pacific and simultaneously opens space for China to displace U.S. influence and presence in this critical region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region that has quietly become a stage for great power competition, this perception of U.S. disinterest not only opens new entry points for Beijing’s influence but also puts wind in the sails of a new narrative: that it is China, not the United States, that is the committed partner and protector of global rules and norms. While it is too soon to understand the full implications of the United States’ recent actions, early signs in the Pacific suggest that the trajectory is counter to U.S. interests. Reversing this trend will require quick action, sincere engagement, and creative diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-stage-for-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;An Emerging Stage for Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long engaged with the Pacific Islands region for trade, access to Asia, and security purposes. While U.S. engagement in the Pacific was arguably deepest during World War II—a period that proved without a doubt the strategic importance of the region—U.S. engagement both predates that war and has persisted since. Building and maintaining strong relationships with the many nations that make up this broad swath of the globe has always been in the national interest of the United States, but maintaining this hard-fought presence and influence requires demonstrating the value of such a partnership. Yet, in the post–World War II era, Washington’s attention to the region was periodic at best—and dominated primarily by defense and security agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1twNeuQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, China has increased both its interest in and its capacity to deepen relationships across what it views as a highly strategic region—one in which a permanent Chinese presence would significantly alter the U.S. and allied strategic calculus. Largely in response, the United States began to ramp up its Pacific engagement under the first Trump administration with the hosting of three Pacific leaders at the White House and the establishment of a team to renegotiate the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau. The agreement has direct security benefits for the United States as it allows for unilateral U.S. defense access across the north Pacific, from the Philippines to Hawaii. The Biden administration accelerated this trend, twice hosting the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders for a summit at the White House, launching the first-ever U.S. government strategy for the Pacific Islands, opening several new embassies, increasing USAID presence across the Pacific, and completing the critical COFA agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overarching characteristic of this reengagement was relationship building, demonstrating a growing appreciation in Washington for the importance the Pacific places on consensus, mutual respect, and dialogue—also called the “Pacific Way.” But building and maintaining relationships—a prerequisite for influence—requires not just sincere engagement, but also follow-through. As 2024 ended, several commitments from the recent U.S.-PIF summits were incomplete, and 2024 concluded with many Pacific nations still skeptical that the United States was truly back as a committed partner—and still questioning the value of U.S. engagement versus that of an ever-present and willing China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soft-power-in-the-service-of-hard-power&quot;&gt;Soft Power in the Service of Hard Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has never been the largest donor in the Pacific, it has become increasingly clear in recent years that meeting the region’s needs while effectively countering China’s influence requires coordinated and sustained efforts by all likeminded allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was the fifth-largest aid provider to the Pacific between 2008 and 2022, behind Australia, China, Japan, and New Zealand, according to the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Aid Map. In that period, the United States spent $3.4 billion and committed $4.4 billion to the region, although much of this was through the COFA agreements. Beyond COFA, U.S. assistance has been a more limited, but still critical, component of funding to the vulnerable region. For example, in 2022, the Solomon Islands received the most of any non-COFA country from the United States at $24.6 million, but that was still dwarfed by Australia’s $116 million and China’s $40 million spent in the Solomon Islands that same year. In 2023, outside of COFA funds, the United States provided $57.6 million in development assistance to the region. This money went toward a range of areas, including supporting education, infrastructure, climate initiatives, disaster response, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3uqrC6Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Top Foreign Aid Donors to the Pacific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, USAID has been the primary implementer of U.S. foreign assistance programs, but select programs are also executed by the U.S. Department of State. For example, in 2014, the department implemented roughly $4.4 billion of the total $12 billion allocated for economic assistance (USAID implemented $5.4 billion). On 30 June, USAID as an independent agency was officially shuttered. Responsibility for USAID-related development now falls under the Department of State; however, the Trump administration plans to cut 90 percent of USAID programs, and currently almost all USAID and State Department foreign assistance programming has been indefinitely paused pending a full review (the initial 90-day review deadline has been pushed back twice). Cutting 90 percent of projects will entail eliminating 5,800 out of 6,200 multi-year USAID contract awards globally, resulting in a $54 billion reduction, along with cutting 4,100 out of 9,100 State Department grants globally, leading to a $4.4 billion decrease in programmatic funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs with a climate change nexus—considered a top national security threat for the Pacific Islands—are most likely to be axed. For example, a $2.5 million grant for the Pacific Islands Ambassador Self-Help Small Grants Program, which included tackling climate change, has already been terminated, as was a $905,487 grant to support the Pacific Islands Emergency Management Alliance. Taken in combination with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, U.S. credibility as a global leader on a climate change or clean energy has been significantly undercut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the extent to which USAID programming was a central part of U.S. engagement in the Pacific, small island nations have been hit particularly hard by these pauses and cuts. While specific figures on the amount of funding cuts per region are not available, the overall effects to the Pacific are significant. According to the Center for Global Development, these cuts amount to 100 percent of USAID country programming for Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Palau, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. Even in the Compact states, some critical funding lies outside of COFA and has been affected. For example, the Palau Red Cross Society has cited the loss of nearly $600,000 in humanitarian aid due to USAID cuts. As one local project manager in Papua New Guinea stated shortly after the initial announcement in late January, the team was “devastated” by the freeze of HIV and health related projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OEqgxZu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: USAID Cuts to Select Pacific Island Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects are not limited to recipient countries: Fellow donor partners and allies are affected as well. Countries such as Australia, which has a deep appreciation of the importance of development assistance to its own national security, are racing to assess the extent of the fallout and recalibrate their own work in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic behind these changes is that U.S. foreign assistance spending should be in support of U.S. national security objectives. That premise, in and of itself, is not flawed. However, the method of first fully halting and then proceeding with a full review not only deprived partners of valued programming—with some particularly harmful results—but also fed into the narrative of the United States as a fickle, unreliable partner. Such measures weaken, not bolster, U.S. national security by diluting U.S. presence, influence, and relationships around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tariffs-the-one-two-punch&quot;&gt;Tariffs: The One-Two Punch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While halting the majority of USAID and State Department foreign assistance programs will no doubt have a larger tangible effect on the everyday lives of Pacific Islanders, the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements also caused shock and confusion in a region that has long looked to the United States as global economic leader with which countries sought closer trade ties. The high rates on these small and often struggling economies—where in some islands over 25 percent of the population lives below the poverty line (see Figure 4)—appeared disconnected with both reality and common sense. The United States has a trade surplus with all but two of the Pacific Islands—Fiji ($208 million trade deficit) and Tuvalu ($168,000 trade deficit), the latter of which has a population of around 11,000—and yet almost none escaped liberation day unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RzUuuAg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Tariff Rate Placed on the Pacific Island Countries by the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has framed these tariffs as both an attempt to level the playing field and as a tool for negotiation. Neither of these justifications makes sense for the Pacific. As small island states with limited markets and opportunities, trade plays an outsized role in bolstering small economies—and yet, overall, U.S.-Pacific trade is almost insignificant on the U.S. ledger. U.S. two-way trade with the Pacific Islands totals around $1 billion, just a small fraction of the more than $7 trillion in global trade conducted by the United States. In other words, there is no “leveling of the playing field” between, for instance, Tuvalu and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fBcExML.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Total Trade Volume Between the United States and Select Partner Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither does the idea that tariffs are a bargaining chip with the Pacific hold strategic logic. Not only do Pacific countries have little to bargain with, but after the imposition of tariffs, it remains unclear what benefit they would accrue from entering such negotiations. Even factoring in ramped-up U.S. engagement in recent years, the United States remains far behind other countries in terms of what it contributes to the region (see Figure 1), a point which is further underscored by Washington’s exiting from the Paris Agreement and shuttering of most of its development assistance programming. Rather than offering limited inducements, many of these pragmatic countries will increasingly look to other partners and markets. As Fijian Prime Minister Rabuka recently stated, “The world is bigger than the United States. . . . We don’t have anything to counter with so we will have to weather the storm and roll with the punches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rBsUawU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-national-security&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. engagement with the Pacific has never simply been blind support for partners and allies, nor even solely of bolstering these small democratic states. It has always had a strong strategic rationale, and that is as true now as it was in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet U.S. actions are not just leaving space for China to fill. They are also elevating the narrative of China as a responsible, predictable global partner. As the United States eliminates every argument for the Pacific to look to it over China, Beijing has ramped up its carrot-and-stick diplomacy throughout the region. In a side-by-side comparison, the United States was already less present and offering less than China by almost every metric. There had, however, remained in the Pacific a persistent discomfort with the manner of China’s engagement, with the sense that, ultimately, Chinese interest, at the expense of the Pacific, would always win out. But as the United States reduces programming in the region and China demonstrates its ability to evolve into a reliable partner, this narrative is shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has been quick to capitalize on negative perceptions of Washington and amplify its own messaging of China as the great global stabilizer. Shortly after the global U.S. tariffs were announced, China’s ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Yang Xiaoguang, called U.S. tariffs “economic bullying” and emphasized that China, as Papua New Guinea’s “most reliable partner,” would remain consistent and open to trade with the island nation. That same week, China’s ambassador to Fiji reinforced the same message, emphasizing that China remained committed to enhancing trade and investment ties with Fiji, despite external trade and tariff tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been focusing much of its Pacific ramp-up on Fiji. Total two-way trade between Fiji and China increased from just $145.2 million in 2010 to $532.2 million in 2023, and in 2024 the two agreed to a $300 million infrastructure development project through the Belt and Road Initiative to construct 22 bridges and improve roads on Vanua Levu. China announced in April 2025 that it would establish direct flights between Shanghai and Nadi, Fiji. In making the announcement, Chinese ambassador to Fiji Zhou Jian noted that the U.S. trade war could present an opportunity for enhancing China’s trade with Fiji. The subtext, of course, is that China is ready and willing to strengthen engagement across a range of sectors in contrast to perceived U.S. withdrawal. Further reinforcing this message, in late May 2025, China hosted the third China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Xiamen, Fujian Province, bringing together senior officials from 11 Pacific Island countries. At this meeting—the first time the Pacific Foreign Ministers have gathered in China—China announced plans to launch over 100 climate-related projects for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Republican professional staff member of the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services said at an April 2025 committee hearing on military posture and national security challenges in the Indo-Pacific, “we have built very strong relationships…and this has been the greatest thing that has really frustrated China, it’s now surrounded by a group of nations that don’t want to be bullied by China, so they’re looking to us for support . . . and now we are trying to out bully China . . . and show [our partners] that we can punch them just as hard as China can punch them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drivers behind this multifaceted push by China are clear. For Beijing, the Pacific presents an exceptionally low-cost, high-yield opportunity. For relatively small monetary commitments, China can pursue major strategic, diplomatic, and economic gains. Strategically, Chinese activity in the Pacific has the dual benefit of pursuing its own potential foothold while forcing the United States, Australia, and others to block Chinese influence everywhere at once. Some have likened this to a game of whack-a-mole, where the United States along with other likeminded countries must work to maintain presence everywhere, whereas China only needs to find one security foothold to drastically alter the calculus of its adversaries. Whatever the game is called, it is clear that it is being played to Beijing’s advantage. And with the United States looking like it might be stepping away from the region, the cost-benefit calculus for China just became that much more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific, where relationships are the currency of influence, the perception of the United States as a disinterested partner is steadily increasing. Making up this perception gap will require careful diplomacy—and real action—that is aimed at the Pacific, instead of relegating the region to collateral damage in sweeping executive orders. To ensure it does not lose further ground in this critical arena, the United States should embrace the opportunity to emphasize its commitment to the region through the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the use of soft power for hard objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Department of State completes its review of foreign assistance, it should ensure that proper weight is placed on the importance of aligning with Pacific priorities, as that is the most effective way to build and maintain these critical relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The business-minded, transactional approach to international relations risks promoting a zero-sum mentality, which hampers effective diplomacy by deprioritizing the significant gains that can be made through relationship building. Framing an effective strategy for the Pacific region must, as with all national strategies, be aimed at protecting U.S. national security interests. However, creating a national-security centered strategy and working with Pacific partners to meet their critical health, infrastructure, and maritime security are not mutually exclusive—in fact, doing the latter directly bolsters the effectiveness of the former.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As one senior U.S. official put it to the authors, much of America’s engagement constitutes “soft power in the service of hard power,” and is a recognition that building trust and relationships in the Pacific is ultimately tied to broader strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize follow-through on existing commitments.&lt;/strong&gt; Even as the Pacific waits for the Trump administration to finish its review of foreign assistance, concern remains that other agreements—even those already funded by Congress—may be in peril. Ensuring full and proper implementation of the COFA agreements and the much heralded Tuna Treaty will be critical as both are viewed as baselines of U.S. commitment to the region. Additionally, attention should be given to following through on promises made, such as opening new embassies in Tonga, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Kiribati—the first three of which have been officially opened but still lack a resident ambassador. This may be a tough sell amid a State Department push to reduce diplomatic presence globally, but in a region where China has more outposts than the United States and Chinese diplomats often outnumber U.S. ones by 10 to 1, it must remain a top priority for the department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote a realistic trade agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; Even outside of back-and-forth tariffs, there are other ways the United States can help bolster Pacific economic growth. Despite having small and somewhat narrow economies, Pacific nations possess niche markets and business opportunities. Yet, most Pacific embassies in the United States are too small to host economic councilors or trade attaches. Supporting the establishment of a Pacific trade representative in the United States—perhaps in multiple locations such as Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, California—would not only allow Pacific countries to have a central node through which to engage economically with the United States, but would also allow U.S. businesses access to valuable markets and opportunities abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To further enable U.S. industrial engagement in the Pacific, the U.S. government should reauthorize and reconfigure the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to be better fit-for-purpose to meet its strategic mandates. Allowing the DFC to work in middle income countries, for example, and streamlining processes for working with state-owned companies would go a long way toward bolstering the U.S. toolkit as it looks for ways to counter massive Chinese inroads in the economic and infrastructure space in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue new opportunities based on administration priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Some Trump administration priorities are well aligned with Pacific concerns and provide the opportunity for specialized and welcome engagement. Drug trafficking, a top priority for the Trump administration, is a growing threat in the Pacific and is poised to quickly overwhelm small and fragile Pacific communities and governments. With its vast law enforcement and transnational crime assets, the United States is well positioned to provide training and assistance on an issue of top concern to all countries involved.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Relatedly, problems such as drug trafficking are amplified by the immense challenge Pacific Islands have in monitoring their vast maritime domains. Collectively, the Pacific Islands’ exclusive economic zones are over a third bigger than that of the United States, even though their collective land mass is just a fraction of the United States’. Using foreign assistance programming to bolster Pacific security professionals and architecture and leveraging exceptional assets such as the U.S. Coast Guard to bolster Pacific maritime domain awareness has the dual benefit of meeting U.S. and Pacific security needs and further displacing China from entering the security sector across the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalize on interest from partners and allies.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. policymakers have long understood that the United States cannot go it alone in the Pacific. The region is too vast, the challenges too broad, and U.S. attention is often needed elsewhere. At the same time, more and more partners around the world see the Pacific Islands region as one that directly affects their own strategic interests. In its effort to have partners and allies do more for their own security, this interest should be welcomed and encouraged. Bolstering work through multilateral groupings not only coordinates and spread loads resources, it maximizes each partners’ strengths in the service of collective objectives. The Quad is particularly suited for working in the Pacific, given its focus on health, infrastructure, and connectivity, all top priorities for Pacific nations. Following through on the Quad Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness initiative, which has a particular work stream aimed at bolstering Pacific nations’ ability to monitor their vast maritime domains, would be an excellent way to meet both Pacific and U.S. security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The trilateral U.S.-Australia-Japan partnership has had success targeting critical infrastructure projects such as financing the East Micronesia Cable. This grouping should double down on these efforts by pinpointing and pursuing strategically critical infrastructure projects such as ports, airfields and roads, where China is already making significant inroads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take action at the congressional level.&lt;/strong&gt; The importance of the Pacific Islands region remains an area of strong bipartisan agreement in Washington, as demonstrated when the Congress succeeded in passing COFA funding legislation in the spring of 2024, even during a highly partisan election season. As the Trump administration continues to craft its strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the time is ripe for Congress to signal its priorities to the administration and move forward with legislation that protects remaining U.S. engagement and programming in the region. For example, Congress should pass the Pacific Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill that requires the administration to create a Strategy for Pacific Partnership, consult more closely with regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum, and collaborate with other regional development partners such as Australia and Japan. Congress should leverage its ability to provide oversight on the executive branch by requiring follow-through on expanding critically needed diplomatic presence in the region and ensure that the Coast Guard—one of the United States’ most effective tools for countering Chinese influence in the security space—continues to be present and engaged in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-partnerships&quot;&gt;Strategic Partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day, Prime Minister James Marape of Papua New Guinea diplomatically stated, “Our trading partners in Asia—including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others—have treated Papua New Guinea with respect, honor, and fairness. These are our closest neighbors and represent proximity markets that continue to offer growing opportunities for our producers.” And, in case the diplomatic niceties obscured his point too much, he concluded, “We will continue to strengthen our trade relations in Asia and the Pacific, where our produce is welcomed. If the U.S. market becomes more difficult due to this tariff, we will simply redirect our goods to markets where there is mutual respect and no artificial barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real influence in the Pacific depends on meaningful relationships, and meaningful relationships are built through partnership, mutual respect, and joint purpose. This can seem harder than making unilateral decisions on U.S. foreign policy, but it is a more long-term—and ultimately more effective—way to do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the State Department foreign assistance review reaches its conclusion, now is the time to push forward with initiatives that can strengthen U.S. presence, influence, and reach in this critical region. Doing so is not hard, nor is it necessarily expensive. But it requires commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the current discourse around state threats has been poorly and loosely defined, however, and has failed to ask basic questions such as why state threats are so important now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This briefing note summarises research that addresses these and other concerns, looking to provide firmer definitional boundaries and explore the scale, scope and character of modern state threats within them. Certainly, there is much that is familiar about state threats; many of the actions that fall under its broad umbrella are well-known covert and clandestine acts such as espionage, repression, sabotage, subversion and malign influence, and are closely associated with long-term adversaries of the West, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. However, the research notes that besides the apparent explosion in the volume and range of hostile activity, much is new in their execution and operationalisation. Contemporary state threats combine traditional intelligence tradecraft with new technologies, exploit vulnerabilities that never existed before in societies and economies, and are increasingly outsourced to non-state actors with niche skills, physical access and higher risk tolerances than state agencies. State threats are also not just the preserve of familiar adversary states, with “middle powers” using them as tools of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research finds that state threats’ relative cheapness and deniability allow states to attempt to undermine, coerce and influence their opponents, with limited risk of starting a major war, making them attractive tools for politically assertive states in a time of rapid geopolitical change. Although the impact of hostile actions on Western states has so far been mixed, they have the potential to become more damaging over time as societal resilience wears down, new technologies emerge, hostile actors’ risk tolerances increase and more states participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the UK faced a wave of state-linked hostile actions within its borders and against its interests. These hostile actions included, but were not limited to, extensive Chinese cyber espionage against UK political, military and commercial targets; Russian espionage, cyber attacks and physical sabotage against supplies to Ukraine; and Iranian attempts to harass and assassinate dissident journalists living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to officials, state-linked hostile activity in the UK has risen dramatically over the past decade. In March 2023, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Matt Jukes, stated that his force’s casework on foreign interference and espionage had increased fourfold since March 2018, with the attempted poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. This experience has been mirrored across liberal democracies in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Consequently, many of these countries’ governments have begun to develop specific policies to respond to the threat of statebacked hostile activity. The problem these policies seek to tackle has been described in various ways, with the UK choosing the term “state threats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the growing importance of state threats and a limited body of research on the issue, the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence research programme worked with the Royal United Services Institute to set up the inter-disciplinary State Threats Taskforce (STT) in 2023. The STT convened two workshops comprising former practitioners and experts from Europe and Five Eyes countries, which sought to scope the threat landscape faced by the UK and its allies, and current and potential policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While helping to sketch the outlines of the challenge, however, the workshops revealed uncertainty – even among those deeply immersed in relevant fields – about fundamental questions, such as the meaning of the term state threats. To address these issues, this research was developed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify the meaning and coherence of the term state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand why state threats have emerged as an issue now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Map out the scope and nature of current state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess the effectiveness of hostile activity as a tool of state policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the potential development in the state threats landscape in the short-to-medium term (two to five years, following definitions of duration common in government and business).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence was collected through a desk review of research literature, publicly available official documents, and credible media reports published in English over the previous decade, supplemented by 50 semi-structured interviews with academic experts, researchers, journalists, current and former government officials, and practitioners the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. Interviewees were selected based on their knowledge and expertise on state threats or related areas, specific domains such as cyber or disinformation, and/or specific countries and regions, and provided new insights, further case studies and examples, and validation of emerging findings as the research progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-state-threats&quot;&gt;Defining state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments and international organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) use various terms for hostile activities by states; unsurprisingly, these meanings vary. While terms such as “state threats” or “hostile activity by states” sound identical, their scope can differ; for example, the UK government includes overtly hostile acts, whereas several other governments do not. Moreover, all current government definitions have ambiguities, especially around the importance of hostile intent and levels of state responsibility. Some harmful acts are not necessarily hostile as such – failing to meet climate change commitments, for example – and harmful acts undertaken by non-state actors with state links are not always undertaken at that state’s behest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify these issues, the research sets out a new “working model” definition for state threats that combines the most common elements of existing definitions and seeks to draw pragmatic boundaries where uncertainties exist. Four criteria are identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are hostile acts that fall short of the internationally defined nature of war and/or distort and subvert peacetime international rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are initiated or encouraged by a state actor and executed by a state or non-state actor for the initiating state’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are underhand and, by nature, covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive and threatening. They may also abuse international rules and norms to achieve hostile ends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intention and effect&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats cause intentional and politically motivated damage to the interests and assets of another state (or states).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition makes clear that state threats must include an intention to cause harm. Certainly, negligent or anti-social behaviour by states, or even positive behaviour which creates dependencies, can be “weaponised” for nefarious purposes at some future point. These types of behaviour should thus be seen as potential vulnerabilities that might become future targets for hostile action. But they should not be treated as immediate threats unless there is evidence of malign intent. Moreover, while all harmful acts of non-state actors cannot be ascribed to states with which they have links, if there is evidence of interaction between a non-state actor and a state, combined with an alignment in hostile behaviours – whether in method, target choice or timing – there are reasonable grounds for seeing non-state actions as state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-state-threats-moment&quot;&gt;The state threats “moment”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason for state threats’ increasing prominence is mounting hard evidence. Where quantitative data about state-linked hostile actions are available – in the fields of cyber espionage and offensive operations, or online disinformation, for example – the consistent indications are that state involvement is on the rise, with states such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea playing major roles. These quantitative data are reinforced by numerous qualitative assessments from officials, and intelligence and law enforcement officers in Western countries. However, this is not the only reason why governments are paying attention now. The geopolitical context of the past decade, with events such as Russia’s seizure of Crimea in March 2014 and its fullscale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have forced Western governments to look at these states’ hostile activities in a new light. What were previously treated as bearable frictions to be downplayed in the interests of maintaining good political and economic relations have increasingly been seen as indications of deep-seated aggressive intentions. Other shifts in the security environment over the past decade have also played a role. While terrorist attacks have continued, government efforts to degrade terrorists’ operational capabilities have helped reduce their impact in comparison to the attacks of the early years of the 21st century. The relative decline in the scale and lethality of such attacks has helped open “policy space” to address the challenge posed by state-linked hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mapping-state-threats&quot;&gt;Mapping state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research provides a survey of current threats in practice, outlining key areas of hostile activity, examining the methods or vectors of hostile action, and highlighting common targets and purposes behind attacks. Some types of hostile activity are overt. China has employed public diplomatic threats, commonly referred to as “wolf warrior diplomacy”, which imply dire consequences for states that do not comply. Similarly, Russia has made verbal threats against its European neighbours, supported by blatant displays of military force near international boundaries, termed “heavy metal diplomacy” by Russia expert Mark Galeotti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Covert and clandestine measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary state threats are more frequently clandestine or covert, however. The research identifies seven key areas of covert or semi-covert hostile activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; against state, military and political targets, as well as commercial and knowledgefocused espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intimidation&lt;/strong&gt; of dissidents and critics, including harassment, surveillance and “lawfare”, through to kidnapping and assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage&lt;/strong&gt;, including offensive cyber operations and the “systemic overload” of social systems through the weaponisation of criminal activities such as illegal migration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subversion&lt;/strong&gt; of the information environment to shape the views, actions and decision-making of audiences within a targeted state or states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malign influence&lt;/strong&gt; over elite figures and groups with the power and position to guide the public policy of a targeted state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsorship of groups&lt;/strong&gt; seeking to destabilise the existing political order of a targeted state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestration of regime/government change&lt;/strong&gt; through support for coups d’état or direct interference in electoral processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origins and execution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research examines the mechanics behind the initiation and execution of these hostile activities, to the extent possible given their largely secretive nature. Narratives shaped by Western news media frequently portray authoritarian leaders as closely guiding or directing the activities of their bureaucracies. However, the research reveals that state threats can arise from a variety of sources, including “business as usual” official processes, the self-direction of intelligence agencies, and freelance efforts by senior officials or influential private figures, as well as direct requests from state leaders themselves. To further complicate this picture, the research also finds that the operatives employed to carry out hostile acts vary; while intelligence officers remain central to state threat operations, other state officials, party officials and non-state actors are increasingly involved. These include mostly legitimate actors in the private sector, civil society and diaspora communities, alongside the more clandestine realms of private military companies, organised crime, political extremism and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patterns of activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the research does not conduct a quantitative analysis of state threat cases, it does highlight evident trends and patterns in the qualitative evidence from recent years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been “booms” in commercially focused espionage, cyber operations and online disinformation – activities in which technology and “whole-of-society” approaches can enable states to collect high volumes of information and penetrate sensitive systems at speed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State actors have increasingly incorporated cyber tools into established forms of tradecraft, such as espionage, intimidation, sabotage and malign influence, where technology complements and enhances human activity rather than replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different states have evolved varied national styles of hostile activity, such as Russia’s high-risk and brazen approach, Iran’s reliance on non-state partners, North Korea’s ambitious cybercrime spree and China’s more carefully calibrated approach. Each style is shaped by that state’s resources, ambitions, cultures and histories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also confirms the widespread Western perception that contemporary state threats are largely emerging from four authoritarian regimes – China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – and that liberal democracies are among the major targets. However, it also indicates that hostile acts are not solely the province of authoritarian states and Western countries are not the only victims. In fact, hostile acts between states occur in a variety of contexts, especially among emerging middle powers. Authoritarian and autocratic states have targeted local rivals in conflict zones such as the Middle East, and democratic states such as India have allegedly used hostile acts against state rivals and dissidents both within their own regions and sometimes within the borders of Western states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is shaping these patterns of behaviour? The research suggests that each of the four most hostile states in question has its own distinctive culture, history and ambitions but is also subject to broader trends at work. At macro-level, what the research sees as “geopolitical climate change” is fundamental. Leading non-Western powers such as China and Russia have long preferred a world order shaped by great powers, spheres of influence and state sovereignty, instead of a Western vision of a rules-based international order dominated by the US. Now, with the shift of economic and political power away from the US and its allies, China and major developing economies not only have a desire to see the world work in support of their interests, but they also have the strength to make it happen – the kind of historical turning point that has often resulted in open war in the past. However, although China and other states enjoy growing economic and military strength relative to the West, open conflict could entail substantial and even existential risks. Consequently, hostile acts that fall short of war offer alternative ways to signal resistance to Western states and undermine Western interests, while avoiding the threat of a substantial response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What motivates the wider use of hostile actions beyond the four main perpetrators? Many of the states in question are located close to conflict zones or in high-risk regions, and have used covert and clandestine means against their exiled opponents and local enemies for many years. However, even among the middle powers, there are indications that the use of state threats is on the rise and that this too is probably one of the effects of geopolitical climate change. With the US and its allies both less willing and less able to play the role of global law enforcer, smaller states are taking matters into their own hands, but without risking open conflict: in the words of political scientist Ivan Krastev, they “are determined to be at the table, and not on the menu”. There is also a possibility that states are emulating patterns of behaviour they see other states using with relatively little consequence. As international relations scholar Shogo Suzuki has suggested, the development of “delinquent gangs” among states can, over time, lead to a wider contagion of behaviours between states that were previously seen as unacceptable by the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;novelty-and-effectiveness-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;Novelty and effectiveness of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with sceptical views of the potential impact of clandestine and covert action use various arguments: that such activities are not new and have not had an impact in the past; that they are inherently difficult to execute successfully and therefore have limited value as policy tools; and that their results are never certain and, indeed, can be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, state-backed hostile activities are not a complete novelty, and have a long and continuous global history, even during relatively peaceful periods. Nonetheless, the research finds it hard to understate the sheer volume of hostile activity currently being registered by senior Western intelligence officials, who have used language that frames the current wave of hostile acts in distinctly “epic” and “epoch-making” terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the explosion in volume, moreover, there is much that is new in the way contemporary state threats are executed. Cyber tools play an increasingly important role in well-known activities such as espionage, harassment, sabotage and disinformation. Importantly, however, cyber has not so much replaced traditional human intelligence tradecraft, but has been combined with it, creating a form of technologically augmented clandestine and covert action, providing opportunities for a greater volume, velocity and range of hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new is the comprehensiveness of the approaches being used by China and Russia; their whole-of-society strategies have expanded the range of channels they use to conduct their activities, and they have strayed far from the classic state agency foci of official, military and political targets into the commercial, scientific and even societal realms as well. As Russia expert Keir Giles says of the Kremlin’s online campaign against dissent and overseas criticism, “it is a profound mistake for anybody to assume that they are too unimportant to be a target”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also offers a cautious perspective on the question of effectiveness. To be sure, the picture is mixed. As intelligence historian Rory Cormac points out, few covert acts have unambiguously positive or longterm results for the perpetrators. Critics have not been cowed, Western economies have not been crippled and most Western governments have largely remained true to pre-existing policies. In fact, many of these hostile acts have also come at significant reputational cost to the perpetrators, as well as leading to policy countermeasures such as sanctions, prosecutions and the expulsion of intelligence operatives, which have the perverse effect of reducing the perpetrators’ long-term capabilities and access to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this optimistic perspective might prove misguided, as the research notes several examples of hostile state action that cannot be seen as anything other than successes. China’s massive campaign of commercial espionage has certainly reaped an enormous economic dividend. In the words of General Keith Alexander, former head of US Cyber Command, it has probably been “the single greatest transfer of wealth in history”. North Korea’s cybercrime spree of recent years has also probably netted it many billions in US dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, propping up the regime of Kim Jong Un and allowing it to continue its development of weapons of mass destruction. In other cases, hostile efforts might have played a contributory role in enabling the perpetrator’s desired outcome; some, though not all, see Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election as a potential example. Moreover, immediate or consistent “results,” as often demanded by Western governments, may not necessarily be the aim of many of these actions. States employing hostile actions might have varying metrics of success; they may be content with achieving only an occasional “lucky hit” or expect that actions will have a measurable impact on their targets’ resilience over the medium-to-long term. It is also conceivable, as political scientists Austin Carson and Karen Yarhi-Milo argue, that states engaging in covert actions view those actions as means to “signal” credibility, strength and intent to other governments, without the accompanying risks associated with military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-threat-futures&quot;&gt;State threat futures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges Russia has faced in Ukraine, Iran’s recent setbacks in the Middle East and North Korea’s noticeable economic difficulties, all three continue to possess the apparent will, intent and sufficient means to pursue their current range of hostile activities. In some cases – Russia, for example – there also appears to be a growing willingness to take greater risks, escalating levels of violence and the potential threat to life. Most importantly, China boasts vast capabilities and, particularly in the realm of offensive cyber operations, has been demonstrating a heightened level of aggressiveness and readiness to pre-position assets for acts of sabotage against Western infrastructure, presumably in preparation for a potential future crisis in the South or East China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the relative openness of Western economies, societies and systems, all four revisionist states have good access to potential targets and, where they do not, can work with a range of deniable partners and proxies that do – especially in the criminal fraternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new technologies such as varieties of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing develop, opportunities for these states to enhance and extend their capabilities will also grow, although policymakers should be cautious about magnifying the effect they will have; advanced technologies can be hard to deploy and have defensive as well as offensive possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the four main current perpetrators of state threats, the research predicts their increasing use by middle powers, particularly in the Global South. As the US and other Western powers withdraw from direct involvement in regional conflicts in areas such as the Sahel, Southern Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia, local powers are likely to become more inclined to employ tools that can assist them in damaging, deterring or influencing rivals without triggering conflict. Middle powers’ use of state threats is most likely to occur in the deployment of cyber tools for transnational repression, espionage, offensive cyber operations and online information operations. At the same time, the experience of the past decade suggests that these states might become more ambitious, daring, physical and kinetic over time, and, like the current four states of concern, increasingly turn towards non-state partners and proxies to supplement their capabilities. There is also a risk that some liberal democracies will be increasingly tempted to expand their own use of aggressive activities below the threshold of armed conflict in response to the changing international environment, testing the limits of existing law and ethical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, while the research indicates that state threats have had somewhat mixed effects thus far, this does not guarantee a decline in their use or a lack of impact in the future. Their relative cheapness and apparent lack of political risk are likely to make them attractive tools of statecraft in the short-tomedium term for various types of states, and their sustained use over time is also likely to have corrosive effects, especially in young democracies or emerging economies that are less well placed to resist them; for example, in regions such as the Balkans and the Sahel. Even highly resilient developed states with robust protections in place may also face greater risks of physical damage or long-term corrosive effects on social cohesion in the face of sustained hostile activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research does not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how targeted Western states have responded to various types of state threats, although several initiatives aimed at strengthening economic security, democratic integrity and social cohesion in European and Five Eyes countries are acknowledged. Consequently, the research does not assess the quality and effectiveness of Western responses to the challenge of state threats, nor does it offer detailed policy proposals. However, the research findings hold significant implications for the framing and implementation of future policy for Western governments, which are outlined in five groups of observations below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-1-avoid-wishful-thinking-and-ignorance-when-assessing-threats-and-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Observation 1: Avoid wishful thinking and ignorance when assessing threats and vulnerabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 20 years, many Western states have turned a “blind eye” to the hostile actions of states such as Russia and China, prioritising economic relationships and seeing such behaviour as an aberration that can be ignored. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this perspective has changed, although the pronouncements of the recently re-elected US President Donlad Trump suggest the possibility of a less united Western front in the face of Russian aggression at least. The research indicates, however, that regardless of variations in Western policy, the current challenge from state threats will continue. The hostile conduct of states such as Russia, China and Iran, and their use of state threats, reflect their longterm desire to see a world order that rejects liberal rules and norms in favour of hard sovereignty and spheres of influence, within which Western power will be diminished. Unless the US and its allies decide to accept that fate – which seems unlikely, regardless of President Trump’s rhetoric – the underlying reasons for conflict will continue. State threats from Russia, China and their associates are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, and may proliferate more widely in their use among non-aligned middle powers and even democratic states. Thus, Western governments must grasp, and continue to acknowledge the significance, dynamics and probable longevity of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments must also avoid hubris and overconfidence in their assessment of how wellpositioned they are to resist state threats. Open societies present significant attack surfaces for aggressive states. As governments have learned in preparing for disasters, it is perilous to assume that the worst experiences of the past are the right benchmarks for future catastrophes. While Western states have so far not faced major setbacks due to hostile state activity, the possibility that an act of physical sabotage or an offensive cyber operation might have disastrous consequences, including major loss of life, cannot be ruled out. Over the longer term, moreover, the hard-to-detect corrosive effects of persistent hostile activity may indeed begin to surface. If the intensity and potential impact of such activities escalate, current levels of Western resilience and efforts to enhance it may prove insufficient to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an extent, Western governments are relatively well-placed to understand state threats and their own vulnerabilities because of the high competence and knowledge of their diplomatic cadres, and intelligence and security agencies. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, Western governments have also developed expertise in resilience and protective security. However, in many Western states, government departments and agencies are woefully under-resourced in relevant linguistic and cultural expertise or appropriate technical skills. They have, moreover, obvious gaps in their bodies of knowledge and expertise when it comes to understanding more intangible matters such as democratic resilience and social cohesion, or the full spectrum of their countries’ vulnerabilities and dependencies on other states, especially complex international systems such as trade, finance, energy supplies and communications infrastructure. If governments are to be able to understand and act upon threats and vulnerabilities, therefore, they must consider whether they have the right people with the right knowledge in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-2-understand-opponents-thinking&quot;&gt;Observation 2: Understand opponents’ thinking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the differing mindsets and worldviews of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that have allowed them to develop their challenges to the international rules-based order. In all four instances, the strategic cultures of these states show a fluid attitude towards what constitutes peace or war, and an attraction to seeking out loopholes in previously accepted legal frameworks and international norms of behaviour. As Australian scholar-soldier David Kilcullen points out, Russia and China have sought to test the West vertically by pushing hostile actions to the threshold of armed conflict and horizontally by expanding forms of hostile action across a wide range of areas, many of them unexpected, such as illegal migration. For Western governments and international organisations that emphasise clear legal boundaries and due process, state threats thus pose deep challenges when it comes to framing appropriate and timely responses. Very often, Western governments and organisations simply do not have in place the appropriate structures, processes or capacity to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Western countries need to reconsider whether the clear peace/war dichotomy on which they have based their policies for many decades (if not centuries) still makes sense when their opponents are happy to ignore the boundary between them. It further indicates Western countries need to take a more imaginative approach to which sectors threats might emerge from and in what combinations. These suggestions should not be seen as a plea to governments to take an “anything goes” approach or to mindlessly pursue novel potential threats. Legality, and principles of ethics necessity and proportionality, should remain essential to the character of Western responses, as should an ongoing focus on core areas of national security. However, if Western governments do not show more agility, flexibility and creativity in how they respond to state threats, they will risk confirming the assessments of opponents who see them as easy targets, inviting further hostile action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-3-ask-whether-the-current-resilience-focused-model-of-response-is-enough&quot;&gt;Observation 3: Ask whether the current resilience-focused model of response is enough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the core Western approach to state threats is a state-agnostic, resilience-focused model that sometimes seeks to deter or disrupt state threats at source, or use punitive or retaliatory responses – but largely eschews offensive operations and takes a piecemeal approach to developing shared international standards of behaviour. This is especially true in cyberspace, where a strong focus on civilian cyber security has been combined with “persistent engagement” with attackers – a phrase used by cyber scholars Michael Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett. Alongside this, Western powers have also undertaken a desultory diplomatic pursuit of international standards for cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the long-term nature of the threat, however, a key question that Western governments need to address is whether the current balance between different types of measures is appropriate. The resilience-based model alone is far from cost-free, and there will be natural and appropriate concerns about the risks of heavy-handed legislation or regulation of fundamental freedoms, whether political, social or economic. The cost of upgrading the resilience of existing systems, structures and processes, or better yet by building it in by design, would need to be explicitly accepted; and, to protect civil liberties, checks and balances on intrusive legislation such as legislative renewals and sunset clauses would need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, governments must consider whether they are prepared to protect and insulate themselves from hostile actions and more frequently pre-empt attacks, react to them and possibly escalate in response. Western states must carefully evaluate how to alter aggressors’ “return on investment” calculations, not only by mitigating the effects of hostile state behaviour, but also by imposing costs that may shift the decisionmaking processes of perpetrator states. Doing so might offer Western governments more opportunities to shape the environment they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if they choose a more assertive path, they will also need to calibrate how far they are willing to go. Quite apart from triggering a hostile response, such behaviours could have a potentially degrading effect on the West’s ideas about itself, its standards and its wider reputation, as the US intelligence community found in the wake of revelations about its past behaviour in the mid-1970s. Were legal and ethical tolerances to change dramatically, and the consequences of these changes to become public, there could be negative effects on public trust in the institutions of government and damage to the reputation of Western states as upholders of international standards, feeding Chinese and Russian narratives, about Western hypocrisy and further undermining the integrity and stability of the rules-based order. If reactive and explicitly offensive measures are to come into play, therefore, they will need to be circumscribed and calibrated within legal and ethical bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the accusations that the West is just as bad as its opponents and to create preventative measures against proliferating hostile state behaviours, Western states will also need to consider what they do to shape international standards. Assertive diplomacy in multilateral and “minilateral” forums might kickstart discussions about international standards in non-military conflict, starting with cyberspace, but expanding to cover the role and scope of espionage, sabotage and subversion outside periods of traditionally defined war. Although these are unlikely to gain immediate traction with states such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, they may gain a hearing with a less truculent China and offer a nucleus of consensus that could help provide a barrier to the proliferation of hostile activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-4-shape-a-coherent-comprehensive-and-prioritised-set-of-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 4: Shape a coherent, comprehensive and prioritised set of responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the complex and often decentralised nature of how state threats emerge in perpetrator states. Regime objectives are sometimes achieved through top-down direction and at other times via more entrepreneurial initiatives. These regimes have various channels of operational action available to them, including both state agencies and state-linked non-state actors. Western governments must be cognisant of this reality, while also refraining from assuming that an equally diffuse set of countermeasures will be effective in response. In fact, the frequently episodic character and disorienting effect of state threats necessitate that Western governments develop clear and coherent narratives and strategies to avoid losing sight of the significance of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments therefore need to consider how best to organise their responses, giving particular attention to threats’ cross-domain character. This will necessitate a coherent risk assessment and a common strategy across government and society. National governments need to develop a “single point of view” on state threats, and effective leadership and coordination mechanisms to guide and oversee strategic implementation, necessitating closer cooperation between agencies and government departments dealing with different dimensions of the same problem. One such area is tackling the activities of state-linked organised crime, which will require coordination, intelligence sharing, and even joint-working between intelligence agencies and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation will also be essential. Countries must carefully assess the full range of threats and vulnerabilities, while pragmatically considering the time and resources available. Not all vulnerabilities can be addressed simultaneously and the order in which they are tackled is significant. In this context, governments may find it tempting to concentrate on familiar areas, as much resilience work will involve the protection of processes, networks, assets and people, most of which will be relatively easy to map and measure. However, governments must also address the more intangible elements of democratic and societal resilience, which are sometimes perceived as overly challenging to tackle but likely pose the greatest existential risks if left unmitigated. Furthermore, governments need to remain vigilant and responsive to emerging threats or vectors of attack. However, they should not unthinkingly pursue novel issues for their own sake, shifting resources en masse at the expense of tackling existing and unmitigated challenges. This is particularly important when considering the potential impact of AI, the promise and dangers of which are far from clear at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-5-take-an-approach-based-on-partnership-both-domestically-and-internationally&quot;&gt;Observation 5: Take an approach based on partnership, both domestically and internationally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the research indicates, in some of the most active perpetrator states, particularly Russia and China, the regimes adopt a whole-of-society approach to executing clandestine and covert activity. Furthermore, although these states do not appear to have established security ties with one another comparable to a Five Eyes-type relationship, there are signs of cooperation in sharing online expertise and evading sanctions, and in the sphere of online disinformation, with states recycling and echoing the narratives of the other revisionist states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liberal democratic states of the West cannot aspire to emulate authoritarians’ mobilisation of private enterprise and civil society as instruments of the state. Moreover, they should refrain from doing so if they wish to uphold their essential character as open societies. Nevertheless, Western states do not confront a binary choice; the continuum between open and closed societies is wide. As past crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic indicate, liberal democracies can work together in pursuit of broader objectives, temporarily limiting some freedoms without discarding them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to achieve coherence outside of such an obvious crisis is through a partnership model, which may impose some new obligations on the private sector and civil society but will also require willing cooperation, support and initiative from non-governmental actors. The value of this approach has already been observed in areas such as the fight against financial crime, both in the UK and beyond. However, for partnerships to succeed, governments must share a clear threat picture to provide incentives for action, establish a coherent strategy in response and work with non-governmental partners to develop mechanisms for cooperation. In summary, governments need to take businesses, organisations and the wider public into their confidence if they are to address state threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the research indicates that the issue of state threats cannot be tackled by a single state in isolation. An international perspective is vital. Many of the threats facing Western states are analogous, as are the vulnerabilities to these dangers. In specific instances, such as the fragility of international infrastructure, these constitute shared challenges. Developing a coherent cross-border response, whether initially through minilateral coalitions of like-minded states or ultimately through broader multilateral platforms such as NATO or the EU, is crucial. Concurrently, the growing risk of the escalating use of state threats by middle powers highlights the necessity for dialogue regarding the perils of persistent hostile activities and their impact on societal resilience and stability. The UN would serve as the obvious platform for this discussion; however, given current divisions within the UN Security Council, more fruitful approaches will likely arise from engagement at bilateral, minilateral and regional levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is navigating a volatile global order by asserting its strategic autonomy amid rising tensions between major powers. Historically non-aligned, India follows a flexible foreign policy approach balancing ties with both the West and Russia. Despite US pressure and the mounting threat of sanctions, India maintains deep defence ties with Russia. This cooperation reflects both strategic necessity and energy dependence, with discounted Russian oil now a major import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dim-lit antechambers of global power, India stands as both witness and architect to a world on the edge of multipolar chaos. The tectonic plates of international order are shifting, and New Delhi – long a master of strategic ambiguity – now finds itself the subject of a more perilous experiment in global pressure with Washington brandishing the threat of sweeping tariffs and secondary sanctions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham’s bill – stipulating 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil to curb Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine – puts India’s time-honoured doctrine of “strategic autonomy” to its severest test. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s subsequent warning to India of being hit “very hard” by secondary sanctions if it continues to trade with Russia only underlines the gravity of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign policy, once defined by the stoic non-alignment of Nehruvian vintage, has undergone a metamorphosis in recent years. No longer content with the passivity of balancing, India now orchestrates a grand pivot strategy, leveraging its unique geography as the hinge between Europe and Asia. This is not mere opportunism, but a conscious recalibration – an attempt to elicit concessions and assurances from both Washington and Moscow, to shape the architecture of regional security to its own advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s strategic calculus is undergirded by its defence procurement patterns. Despite overtures from the West, over 60% of India’s military hardware remains Russian in origin – an insurance policy rather than a Cold War relic. The Russian-made S-400 air defence, the BrahMos cruise missile joint venture, and the ongoing localization of the AK-203 rifle serve as potent reminders to adversaries and allies alike that India’s deterrence posture is robust and diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the recent India-Pakistan 4-day war, the S-400 missile system performed well. By late 2025, India will take delivery of the fourth of five S-400 system, with the final unit due in 2026. The deal, inked in 2018 despite American debates over CAATSA sanctions, signalled India’s enduring commitment to strategic autonomy. In continuing these acquisitions amid the Ukraine war and Western sanctions on Moscow, New Delhi has underscored its refusal to subordinate national security imperatives to external pressure, preserving room to manoeuvre in a shifting geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, within the Indian foreign policy establishment, a philosophical schism endures. On one side stand the realists, who recall the Soviet vetoes at the UNSC and see the Russia relationship as a sacred trust. For them, to abandon Moscow is to risk strategic orphan-hood and invite encirclement by a Sino-Russian axis stretching from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean. The pragmatists, however, see a Russia diminished; it has not only become economically dependent on Beijing, but its global influence has also been eroded by the pointless quagmire in Ukraine. They argue for a pivot to American technology and the security umbrella of the Quad, cautioning that continued proximity to Moscow could trigger secondary sanctions and imperil India’s economic ambitions. India’s economy is closely interwoven with the West through robust trade and corporate ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessity, as ever, asserts itself. India’s energy security is now inextricably tied to Russian crude, which accounts for over a third of its imports. Paradoxically, Western sanctions have only deepened this dependency, offering India discounted oil and a hedge against global price volatility. India exploits the fissures in the Western sanctions regime to secure its own economic stability, even as it diversifies its defence procurement and technology partnerships in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign policy now operates within a complex web of overlapping interests and transactional alliances – a “Multipolar Manoeuvre Matrix”. The old binaries of democracy versus autocracy, East versus West, have given way to a landscape defined by nuance and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a calibrated assertion of its strategic autonomy, India has deepened its role within the Quad, hosting joint naval exercises alongside the United States, Japan, and Australia in the Bay of Bengal – a maritime signal of Indo-Pacific resolve. This commitment was further highlighted when the foreign ministers of the Quad met in Washington on July 1, for their latest meeting, reinforcing their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific and launching new initiatives on maritime security and critical minerals cooperation. Simultaneously, through the I2U2 initiative and the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, New Delhi extends its economic and geopolitical reach westward, weaving new ties across the Arabian Peninsula and into Europe. Yet, in a deft balancing act, India sustains robust participation in BRICS, preserving dialogue within alternative, non-Western multilateral frameworks – as reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation in the BRICS Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 6–7 July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger for India is not simply American retaliation for its Russia ties. It is the risk of being caught in a bilateral squeeze, where any move toward one pole is interpreted as betrayal by the other. In India’s strategic calculus, China is the main adversary, with Pakistan serving as a proxy – a “borrowed knife” wielded by Beijing to advance its own agenda. Should India distance itself from Moscow, it risks a reverse pivot – Russia intensifying defence cooperation with Pakistan or becoming wholly dependent on China, both scenarios inimical to Indian security. Conversely, standing too firmly by Moscow could fracture India’s deepening partnerships with the United States and Europe, undermining its aspirations for technological and economic modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent incidents illustrate this peril. Reports have surfaced of Russia exploring lucrative deals with Pakistan, underscored by a quiet trade forum held in Moscow in late 2024 – moves widely interpreted as Moscow hedging its bets in South Asia. Though Russia condemned the Pahalgam terror attack, Moscow notably avoided directly blaming Pakistan, reflecting an evasive stance that subtly shields Islamabad. At the same time, American officials have warned of possible sanctions should India continue to expand its defence ties with Russia, even as they court India as a bulwark against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To navigate this thicket, India has developed a sophisticated sanctions-evasion strategy. Indian companies, facing the threat of being locked out of the dollar-based global financial system, have sought alternative payment mechanisms – trading in rupees or roubles, and deepening investments in Russian energy assets to generate dividend flows for defence purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not mere circumvention; it is a calculated strategy to preserve autonomy in the face of extraterritorial pressure. At the same time, India invests in American industries, creating jobs and goodwill that can be leveraged to temper US policy decisions. The result is a dynamic, adaptive approach that seeks to maximize manoeuvrability while minimizing exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western capitals urge decisive alignment and rapid decoupling from Russia, New Delhi moves with deliberate caution. India has abstained on United Nations votes, refused to condemn Moscow outright, and maintained high-level diplomatic engagement with both sides. This patience is a recognition that the tectonic plates of global order are still shifting, and that premature commitments could foreclose future options. Despite mounting pressures, Indo-Russian ties endure. Defence cooperation is institutionalized through regular exchanges, joint military exercises, and co-production deals. The relationship has evolved from a simple buyer-seller dynamic to one of joint research, design, and production – exemplified by projects like BrahMos and the Su-30MKI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this circuit is not immune to strain. The growing Sino-Russian partnership, the uncertainties of the Ukraine conflict, and the lure of Western technology all test its durability. Like a chessboard in flux, India must manoeuvre deftly – balancing between opportunity and peril – to ensure this partnership remains an asset, not a strategic liability, amid shifting tectonics of global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian foreign policy, far from dogma, is a living dialectic. It is an evolving engagement with the world, informed by history yet unshackled by it. In an era defined by unravelling alliances and multiplying crises, India seeks autonomy. The shifting tectonics of global power cannot allow it to remain passive. The burden and privilege before India is to remain the axis upon which the fragile equilibrium of the international order may yet depend.&lt;/p&gt;

The underlying policy challenge has been described in various ways, including “hostile activity by states” and “threats from state actors”, with the UK government choosing the term “state threats”. However, while sounding similar, these definitions have differences in scope and meaning that can affect how researchers might assess the character, scope and impact of the current threat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This synthesis paper thus explores the commonalities and differences in the policy definitions Western states use to conceptualise the underlying threat from state actors, drawing on the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence (SOC ACE) research programme Research Paper Old Wine, New Bottles? The Challenge of State Threats. The research identifies several basic similarities across existing definitions, which highlight clandestine, covert and coercive state activities as core elements of the threat. However, it also identifies variations in scope and meaning around the levels of hostile intent needed to justify seeing a state action as a threat. It further addresses the extent to which states might be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors, such as terrorist networks and organised crime groups (OCGs), with which they might have relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify these issues, the research sets out a new “working model” for state threats that combines the most common elements of existing definitions and seeks to draw pragmatic boundaries where uncertainties exist. According to the research, state threats are politically and intentionally motivated hostile acts that are underhand and largely, but not exclusively, covert by nature. They fall short of the internationally defined nature of war, and are initiated or encouraged by state actors and executed by state or non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research makes clear that state threats must include an intent to cause harm; and that neutral or even positive actions (such as an investment creating an economic interdependency), which might later be “weaponised” for nefarious purposes, should be seen as potential vulnerabilities, rather than state threats in themselves. Moreover, the research argues that the harmful acts of non-state actors should only be seen as state threats where there is evidence of interaction between a non-state actor and a state, combined with an alignment in hostile behaviours – whether in method, target choice or timing. While non-state actors are potential tools of a state, they are not the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to UK officials, state-linked hostile activity in the UK has risen dramatically over the past decade. In March 2023, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Matt Jukes, stated that his force’s casework on foreign interference and espionage had increased fourfold since March 2018, with the attempted poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. This challenge has been described in various ways in Western countries, with the UK choosing the term “state threats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the growing policy importance of state threats and a limited body of research on the issue, the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence research programme worked with the Royal United Services Institute to set up the inter-disciplinary State Threats Taskforce (STT) in 2023. The STT convened two workshops comprising former practitioners and experts from Europe and Five Eyes countries, which sought to scope the threat landscape faced by the UK and its allies, and current and potential policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While helping to sketch the outlines of the challenge, however, the workshops also revealed uncertainty – even among those deeply immersed in relevant fields – about the nature, character and scope of state threats. Therefore, new research has been undertaken to address key questions about the challenge of state threats. The research draws on research literature, publicly available official documents, and credible media reports published in English over the previous decade, supplemented by 50 semi-structured interviews with academic experts, researchers, journalists, current and former government officials, and practitioners the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. The primary question it addresses – and the focus of this paper – is how best to define the term state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-academic-research-does-not-provide-a-definition-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;Current academic research does not provide a definition of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research notes that, unsurprisingly, given the relative novelty of the term state threats, academic literature on the concept is currently limited. Nonetheless, a substantial body of literature exists on related subject areas pertinent to the field. The two most significant are “hybrid” and “grey zone” activities. These terms are often paired with various nouns such as war, warfare, conflict or threats to create a variety of compound terms such as “hybrid warfare” or “grey zone conflict”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of hybrid warfare, as conceived by modern military thinkers, first emerged in 1999 in Unrestricted Warfare, a book by two colonels in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui. The authors argued that China must use “all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military and non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interest”. Separately, in the following decade, US Marine colonel and scholar Frank Hoffman used the term “hybrid war” in a 2007 article, identifying it as the use of blended military tactics exemplified by state and non-state actors such as Islamist group Hezbollah. The term hybrid war was also used in Russian military discussions (in Russian as gibridnaya voina), framed as a type of political warfare at which the US was adept and Russia needed to master, mixing military methods with economic action, information campaigns and political subversion. Despite the differences in the use of the word hybrid in various countries, however, at its core its meaning lies in the “addition and combination” of a variety of methods and tools “bringing into play the maximum range of categories of conflict and combining them in novel ways”, as noted by Australian soldier-scholar David Kilcullen. Hybridity is thus closely allied to, if not identical with, the idea of “weaponisation”, which Russia expert Mark Galeotti defines as “the notion of items and concepts not usually connected with conflict” being used as forms of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related area of research focuses on “grey zone” conflict. Although hybrid warfare shares conceptual common ground in its preference for unconventionality, grey zone activities emphasise the use of ambiguous methods to achieve political ends, damaging a target without detection or attribution and thus making a robust response less likely. In this, grey zone activities are close to the older concept of “covert action”, defined by US intelligence expert Loch Johnson as “clandestine intervention in the affairs of other nations”. The grey zone concept also dovetails well with newer ideas developed in the realm of cyber studies, such as “intelligence conflicts”, defined by cyber experts Robert Chesney and Max Smeets as “statecraft pursued by the means and methods traditionally associated with intelligence agencies”; or “persistent engagement”, defined by cyber expert Michael Fischerkeller and associates as an ongoing struggle “calibrated to remain below the threshold that would elicit an armed response, seeking instead to produce cumulative gains over time”. Throughout all these definitions, there is a shared focus on the use of less easily detectable and attributable methods to achieve political ends with limited consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various terms provide value to researchers studying state threats. They highlight different styles of hostile activity that states may employ, whether combining methods, exploiting unexpected avenues, or playing with thresholds and norms. Moreover, despite a primary focus on these activities in the context of military affairs or near-war scenarios, they also have relevance to what Western states would see as conventional peacetime activities of intelligence agencies and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, critically, none of these academic definitions provide a comprehensive underpinning for what states are discussing when they refer to state threats or similar concepts. Firstly, while the academic literature addresses the use of hybrid methods and grey zone activities by state actors, it also references examples of non-state actors employing similar approaches. These methods are not exclusive to states. Secondly, and more importantly, by defining threats based on types of activity, these terms exclude the possibility of states employing methods that are neither hybrid, innovative, unexpected nor ambiguous. It is logically conceivable that a state could use a singular, familiar and only lightly covert form of hostile action that instinctively feels like a state threat – such as a one-off assassination of a foreign political figure – without it easily fitting into the category of a hybrid or grey zone threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uks-has-held-an-actor-agnostic-and-behaviour-focused-view-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;The UK’s has held an actor-agnostic and behaviour-focused view of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the term state threats emerged around 2017-18 and was used to name a new Joint State Threats Assessment Team, created in June 2017 and based at the UK Security Service (MI5)’s Thames House headquarters. For a period, ministers and officials also used other terms alongside state threats to refer to the challenges posed by states’ hostile actions, including “hostile state activity”, “hostile activity by states” and “state-based threats”. However, by 2021, state threats had become the UK’s preferred descriptor. The Home Office set out its definition of state threats in its Consultation on Legislation to Counter State Threats (Hostile State Activity), issued in May 2021, which introduced measures later included in the National Security Act 2023. According to the consultation, state threats comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overt or covert action orchestrated by foreign governments which falls short of general armed conflict … but nevertheless seeks to undermine or threaten the safety and interests of the UK, including: the integrity of its democracy, its public safety, its military advantage and its reputation or economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also defines five key state threat categories, which cover the classic and well-known behaviours of state intelligence and security agencies, while largely not using traditional terms such as sabotage or subversion. They comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to people&lt;/strong&gt;, through harassment or physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to things&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the nation’s critical national infrastructure or overseas supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; against both the public and private sectors, including academic, scientific, technological and commercial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interference&lt;/strong&gt; in political, electoral, economic or social processes or decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to geostrategic interests&lt;/strong&gt; in the reshaping of international norms, and misuse of rules, norms and agreements to coerce other states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key underlying theme of the UK state threats definition is that it primarily focuses on hostile activities rather than the identities of the state actors behind them. According to the Home Office, this decision was made because the UK government did not want to imply that state actors using hostile acts were inherently or permanently hostile towards the UK. However, despite this, several leading UK intelligence leaders have been specific in pinpointing the main culprits as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;western-states-use-a-variety-of-similar-but-not-identical-policy-definitions-to-the-uk&quot;&gt;Western states use a variety of similar but not identical policy definitions to the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research shows that international organisations and Western governments use various terms to describe hostile activities by states. NATO and the EU have used the term “hybrid threats” for some time. The European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE), a joint initiative of the two organisations, defines such threats as actions “conducted by state or non-state actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by combining overt and covert military and non-military means”. In contrast, recently created policy formulations, such as the UK’s, have focused specifically on state-linked behaviours and have not limited their scope to hybrid activities alone. Below are three more recent examples from the Netherlands, Canada and Australia, showing the similarities and parallels between definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/447Ruoi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Non-UK terminology on state threats-type activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these terms and definitions, the NATO/EU language concerning hybrid threats stands out as an outlier, deeply rooted in early military discussions from when Western countries were still confronting the rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East, alongside Russia’s annexation of Crimea. By emphasising hybridity as a type of attack employed by various actors, it fails to address state activity specifically and should, therefore, be set aside in favour of more recent terminology that does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of the state-centric contemporary definitions exactly matches the UK’s definition, each implicitly shares similar perspectives on the character and scope of the threats being identified. These include their severity (falling below the internationally defined nature of war); source (originating with states, even if carried out by non-state actors); character (covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or surreptitiously threatening); and intent (to damage other states’ interests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite “family resemblances”, there are also notable differences. While the consensus is to focus on behaviours that are likely to be conducted secretly or duplicitously, the UK also includes overt hostile acts, greatly expanding the definition’s scope. A further difference is in the level of hostile intent required for an act to qualify as a state threat or equivalent. In the definitions of Canada and the UK, a hostile act is intended to harm the interests of another state; intent is apparent. In the case of the Netherlands, however, the definition also encompasses undermining actions that could harm another state’s interests. Although political intent is implied, it is not explicitly required. On such grounds, a vast range of antisocial state behaviours – environmental pollution and failing to meet treaty obligations, for example – could be interpreted as state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions also demonstrate other ambiguities about levels of state intent. For example, the definitions assume that a state act is either hostile or not. However, some state behaviours might have several intentions behind them, both positive and potentially negative. For example, the provision of aid, investment or technology transfers could be intended to help while also providing the donor with a level of leverage over the recipient. They might be used for good or ill. Even if such help starts with purely positive motives, it has the potential for abuse in the future: political intentions can change over time. However, to designate such interstate interactions as hostile acts because they might become so would require that wide swathes of normal diplomacy be seen as potentially hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final area of difficulty is the role of non-state actors, which is explicit in several definitions and implied in others. While an OCG or terrorist network might occasionally act on behalf of or partner with a state, such groups are also likely to pursue their own agenda, which, while damaging to other states, is not directed, encouraged or required by their state partner. To include all non-state actors’ activities would, therefore, magnify the scale of state-linked hostile activity, while excluding them would almost certainly understate the scope of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-pragmatic-process-of-reconciliation-is-needed-to-provide-a-working-definition-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;A pragmatic process of reconciliation is needed to provide a working definition of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the outlier concept of hybrid threats, the research notes various approaches that might be used to reconcile the differences between more contemporary policy terms and tackle any ambiguities. The most obvious is the wholesale adoption of one country’s definition or another’s; however, deciding which one to use risks becoming an involved process requiring justificatory criteria or a quick but arbitrary decision with an uncertain rationale. Neither method is very helpful. Another approach is to define state threats either very narrowly or very broadly, alternatively excluding or including all problematic categories. However, both approaches have significant weaknesses; the former risks ignoring many relevant hostile behaviours and actors, and the latter risks bringing a vast and undifferentiated spectrum of state and non-state activities into scope. Consequently, some pragmatism is required in developing a working definition of what we mean by state threats that does not dilute the essential qualities in existing policy definitions while also providing a workable scope for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overt or covert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centre of gravity in Western government thinking is that state threats largely consist of covert and clandestine activities, although the UK also explicitly includes overt acts. Economy, simplicity and the weight of policy opinion suggest that excluding overt acts might be appropriate; however, doing so could potentially omit episodic and blatant acts of semi-covert or overt hostility that only seem to differ from covert hostile acts by a matter of degree, and which, moreover, often occur as one ingredient alongside covert activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then arises which types of overt statecraft should be included or excluded. The acceptability of various overt activities under international law or custom is open to broad interpretation, even when states concur on the letter of the law or the usual pattern of practice. Furthermore, some policy tools that Western states regard as entirely legitimate are dismissed by others, including those that are not necessarily Western adversaries. For instance, India sees Western use of autonomous economic and financial sanctions outside the UN framework as inappropriate. Including overt acts that any state might deem unacceptable or illegitimate, without any qualification, would thus create a definition that is so broad as to become meaningless and would also encompass Western statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, several potential dividing lines might be drawn. Some overt hostile activities are explicitly banned; wars of aggression, for example. Others are explicitly permitted under international law in response to other states’ hostile and illegal actions, such as enforcing freedom of navigation in international waterways if a blockade is attempted, for instance. Moreover, other actions, such as the imposition of autonomous sanctions, are not illegal and are direct reflections of measures that the international community itself uses through the UN Security Council. While some states might question the rights of states to apply them without UN endorsement, they do not question the idea of sanctions as a tool of policy in themselves. These kinds of measures do at least bear the imprimatur of some international acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between these poles, however, lies a zone of activities that are neither explicitly endorsed nor prohibited by international law and practice; peacetime espionage, for example. Sifting the acceptable from the unacceptable within this zone is a difficult matter, given the diversity of states’ legal, moral and cultural norms. What “feels” right for one country might not in another. However, some potential rules of thumb might establish whether a state’s overt behaviours could be deemed less acceptable as peacetime conduct, especially when used in conjunction with covert hostile acts. These are behaviours that, in effect, go against the intended spirit of the rules, if not their precise letter, and comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extreme behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; that push acceptable forms of statecraft to the very edge of international practice, such as the use of physical threats in diplomacy; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subversive behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; that distort, infringe or manipulate rules and norms with antisocial behaviours, such as seeking to redraw international boundaries without consent, or using international tools and institutions in dishonest or misleading ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a rough heuristic for drawing lines between acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, it is probably through the pragmatic application of these criteria, imprecise though they may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The importance of intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On matters of intent common sense suggests that a desire to harm is an essential component of a hostile act. Sins of omission or neglect can be damaging and dangerous, but they are rarely viewed as threats. A doctor whose mistake results in a patient’s death may be accused of negligence or possibly manslaughter, but likely not murder. Additionally, the development of an interstate dependency that may later be exploited cannot be considered a hostile act without substantive evidence to suggest that it is intended as such from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the need to demonstrate intent to harm as a guide, it is therefore justifiable to exclude purely negligent state behaviours and the formation of international dependencies from the scope of state threats in most cases. However, their potential for weaponisation remains a latent issue states must be aware of. Both categories of behaviour have the potential to be misused at some point and could therefore be regarded as pathways by which hostile actions might emerge in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The importance of responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the same logic, the acts of non-state actors with links to states cannot be included or excluded as a whole. Intermediate criteria need to be applied to assess the quality of evidence of operational engagement between state and non-state actors, and the likely alignment of their intentions. Where non-state actors undertake hostile activities that are aligned with a group’s own agenda and not with that of the linked state actor, go against the wishes of that state actor, and generate little dividend for or cause harm to that state actor’s interests, such activities should not be treated as hostile state actions, regardless of existing operational links between the actors involved. To see a non-state actor’s activity as a form of hostile state threat, credible evidence needs to show not only a relationship or operational entanglement between the actors, but also reasonable grounds to believe that the non-state actor’s actions are undertaken because of that relationship, and with the involvement, encouragement or approval of the state actor. If these provisos are not in place, states become hostages to the actions of any actor that deems itself to be an instrument of that state’s interests, regardless of the views or actions of the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, finding convincing evidence to meet these criteria is much easier to propose than to achieve, and it may create uncertainties about how to categorise the behaviour of certain non-state actors. However, it is safer to base policy on credible evidence – even if it is open to different interpretations – rather than on external assumptions regarding the political allegiances of states and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The working model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these heuristics and judgements, the research establishes a new definition of state threats that synthesises the most prevalent elements of existing definitions and delineates pragmatic boundaries in areas of uncertainty. It seeks to flesh out the existing understanding of the term state threats based on the four core criteria initially identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is a hostile act that fall short of the internationally defined nature of war, and/or distort and subvert peacetime international rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The source of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is initiated or encouraged by a state actor and executed by a state or non-state actor for a state actor’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The character of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is underhand and undermining (covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or threatening) or abuses accepted rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The motivation of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It intentionally or knowingly damages another state’s (or other states’) interests and assets for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As readers will surmise, this definition is still a working model and edge cases will challenge it. Nevertheless, it is a useful framework for analysis and broadly aligns with the underlying sense of state threats expressed in various Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrates that policymakers face challenges in defining and outlining the scope and nature of hostile state activities. Very little about these activities fits neatly within established conceptual policy boundaries. Although careful analysis can achieve a workable level of coherence, some ambiguity of meaning is unavoidable. The underlying tension the research reveals – between the need for comprehensiveness and the need for clarity – may be the fundamental problem Western governments face as they develop an appropriate set of policy responses to state threats. The research does not seek to resolve that tension by proposing detailed policy recommendations. However, its findings do have implications for the assumptions and perspectives policymakers will need as they formulate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-1-recognise-the-redundancy-of-the-peacewar-dichotomy&quot;&gt;Observation 1: Recognise the redundancy of the peace/war dichotomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although terms such as hybrid threats and grey zone conflict do not fully capture the issue that Western governments face, they highlight important aspects of how major state actors are thinking and acting. Russia, China, Iran and others have indeed used hostile actions that blend unusual and novel techniques while navigating the legal and ethical boundaries that Western governments have established in international relations. As Kilcullen points out, Russia and China have aimed to test the West vertically, by pushing hostile actions to the brink of armed conflict, and horizontally, by expanding various forms of hostile actions into unexpected areas such as illegal migration. For Western governments and international organisations that prioritise clear legal boundaries and due process, state threats therefore present significant challenges in framing appropriate and timely responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Western countries need to reconsider whether the clear peace/war dichotomy they follow still makes sense when their opponents are willing to ignore the boundary between them. It further suggests that Western countries need to adopt a more imaginative approach to identifying the sectors from which threats might emerge and in what combinations, as well as how they might respond. The research shows that there is an intermediate “zone” of unacceptable behaviours between peace and war that might be better seen as a distinct category – “conflict”, perhaps – and therefore, it behoves Western states to recognise this and recalibrate how they respond in ways that are commensurate to the level of action taken by their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-2-create-clear-but-flexible-definitions-within-which-to-frame-policy-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 2: Create clear but flexible definitions within which to frame policy responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research notes that no matter how fluid the policy problem governments face – and as noted, state threats are among the most fluid and amorphous – without a workable definition of the problem being targeted, responses will potentially fail. If the parameters of the challenge are set too wide, policy responses risk becoming diffuse and uncoordinated; if they are set too narrowly, important aspects of the problem will be neglected. The task is to address the essential aspects of the problem; in the probably apocryphal words attributed to Albert Einstein: “Things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this presents a challenge, and it is quite possible that the most parsimonious approach to defining the problem will still generate a vast array of issues to address. As the research indicates, this is probably the case with state threats, encompassing diverse areas such as espionage, sabotage, intimidation and subversion. Unlike a phenomenon such as terrorism, the one common theme behind these various threats is not the type of hostile act employed, but rather the core source of the threat: a state actor. State threats thus resemble a many-headed hydra, with numerous interlinked hostile acts emerging from singular sources – the states themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do Western governments manage this problem? Again, the research does not provide answers at this point, but it does offer areas for further consideration. Having a broad categorisation of state threats does not prevent governments from developing subcategories of interconnected aspects of the problem that might be dealt with in policy “clusters”, which make sense based on patterns of behaviour seen in available intelligence. For example, human espionage and malign influence campaigns can be closely connected, and many of the most violent activities in transnational repression and physical sabotage use similar methods and involve similar perpetrators. These clusters within the overall policy framework could themselves be prioritised; policy problems within each distinct cluster could then also be prioritised. How the prioritisation process would work in practice would need to be decided on, but one obvious technique of risk management would be to consider criteria such as the likelihood or regularity of specific threats, their potential impact, and the level of the state’s resilience or vulnerability to those threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-3-recognise-the-importance-of-access-to-and-sharing-of-intelligence-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Observation 3: Recognise the importance of access to and sharing of intelligence and expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research further suggests that governments must have access to reliable intelligence, suitable tools and relevant human expertise to be able to identify and respond to state threats, particularly when attributing responsibility to the partners and proxies of state actors in ambiguous edge cases. The most fundamental – and, unfortunately, least effective – observation here is that departments and agencies require adequate resources and tools, and appropriate levels of expertise in relevant domains and geographies. To some extent, many Western governments are relatively well-positioned in this regard already due to the high competence and knowledge of their diplomatic personnel, and intelligence and security agencies. However, in many Western states, government departments and agencies are severely under-resourced in relevant linguistic and cultural expertise concerning perpetrator states and, in some cases, in technical expertise in areas such as cyber and disinformation. Without these, governments will find tackling diverse challenges such as state threats much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The place of partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations are not, however, merely intended to prompt greater investment in more resources; they also emphasise the need for Western governments to adopt a more flexible approach to gathering and accessing intelligence and expertise. The research indicates that much policy, intelligence and investigative work related to state threats remains siloed within governments. As always, in this situation, links, overlaps and common patterns of behaviour by malicious actors in seemingly different domains go unnoticed and unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem can be partly mitigated through more flexible intelligence-sharing protocols among departments and agencies, and closer collaboration and joint efforts in areas where disparate threats share common origins, such as when non-state actors in organised crime operate on behalf of states. In such cases, intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies must work together closely. This necessity extends to establishing broader international partnerships, including bilateral and multilateral security collaborations, where allies and partners possess insights and access that individual states may lack. Furthermore, enhancing access to intelligence and expertise involves ensuring that governments use intelligence from the private sector effectively. This does not imply altering the law in a manner similar to China, which mandates that private enterprises support and facilitate state and party covert operations. Rather, it entails leveraging work already being performed by private actors in sectors with existing statutory responsibilities to gather and act on intelligence; for example, in the financial services sector, or fields where there is a practical need to comprehend high-risk environments, including logistics, energy, and metals and mining. Here, intelligence sharing and joint working can pay substantial dividends, as initiatives such as the UK’s Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce have already demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-4-create-a-flexible-but-proportionate-toolkit-of-policy-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 4: Create a flexible but proportionate toolkit of policy responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious corollary of facing a fluid set of interconnected threats and being willing to reconsider international legal distinctions is the need for a flexible policy toolkit. If Western governments are to demonstrate greater agility, flexibility and creativity in addressing the zone of conflict in which state threats are occurring, they need more options than they currently allow themselves or have already considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested in the research, much of the current Western response is based on a “resilience model”, which aims to soak up and remain unaffected by hostile acts, in effect waiting for the hostile acts to end. However, in taking this stance, Western governments assume that they will be able to withstand the effects of the long-term attrition involved, and that hostile actions will stop before they cause major or existential damage. They might be right in this, but it is an optimistic perspective that leaves much to chance. Governments also appear to assume that they have limited options available to affect the calculations of the attackers themselves. Although options to undertake disruptive and even offensive measures in areas such as cyber effects operations exist, options which might change attackers’ calculations, research suggests that their use remains relatively limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations should not be interpreted as a plea for Western governments to take an “anything goes” approach to responding to state threats. Legality, ethical principles, necessity and proportionality should remain foundational to Western responses, and governments might consider how to shape wider international standards of behaviour through existing diplomatic channels. Assertive diplomacy in multilateral and “minilateral” forums might kickstart discussions about international standards in non-military conflict, starting with the long-term dialogue around the use of cyberspace, then expanding to cover the role and scope of espionage, sabotage and subversion outside periods of traditionally defined war. Although these efforts are unlikely to gain immediate traction with the most aggressive “revisionist states” such as Russia or North Korea, they may offer a nucleus of consensus that could help to provide a barrier to the proliferation of hostile activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-5-remain-alert-and-be-aware-of-dependencies-and-vulnerabilities-in-a-rapidly-changing-world&quot;&gt;Observation 5: Remain alert and be aware of dependencies and vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing world&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the research indicates the need to be aware of potential changes in the scale, scope and nature of state threats. The emergence of new state actors, techniques and methods of attack must be monitored, along with changing contexts – economic, political and social – that could influence how hostile actions occur and what their potential impacts might be. One of the most important areas governments should focus on is the impact of technology, particularly advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and quantum computing, and how they might make acts of intimidation and sabotage – or worse – easier to undertake, more dangerous and potentially more deniable. Additionally, governments need to pay attention to the potential weaponisation of domestic issues of targeted states, and the exploitation of dependencies and vulnerabilities. Western governments must fully understand their levels of interconnectedness and interdependence not only with competitors and opponents, but also with significant non-aligned “middle powers”, as well as allies and partners. As noted above, while strategic dependence on other states may not be a state threat per se, it has the potential to become so if unexpected geopolitical realignments occur. As the current policy disagreements between the US and its allies indicate, this risk can never be wholly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

But to distinguish itself from previous initiatives, UKDI needs resources and a cultural shift to deliver innovation at scale and speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To “harness tech for the UK’s Armed Forces”, the UK Ministry of Defence launched UK Defence Innovation (UKDI) on 1 July. This is not the first time a body under the MoD is tasked with enhancing innovation and securing cutting-edge technology for UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the perceived need for yet another new body? Because innovating in defence remains hard: Hierarchical military organisations require a top-down approach. And while in the commercial world, small companies can disrupt well-established business models, defence remains a conservative sector. Disruption by innovators championing radical and untried approaches clash with a system in which most civil servants and military personnel are not incentivised to take risk – an inherent factor of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the difficulties of sharing sensitive information makes it difficult for companies to enter the defence sector. Once in, long project timelines that can take around five to six years from bid to delivery are longer than typical investment and financing cycles of start-ups and SMEs – they may be out of business by the time the first payments come through. For investors, this makes start-ups with a defence application a difficult value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-inspiration-from-the-us-defense-innovation-unit&quot;&gt;Taking Inspiration from the US Defense Innovation Unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New approaches are needed to tackle persistent challenges for innovation in defence. The exemplary model comes from the US, where in 2015, the US DoD created a “Defense Innovation Unit” (DIU). Known to be a “significant driver” of innovation and a successful bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley, DIU has effectively been seen as an embassy for US defence among tech companies developing innovative tech capabilities in Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs, linking into these communities to identify interesting capabilities. The US DIU uses Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) processes to contract with tech companies to rapidly prototype relevant technologies, aiming for 60-90 days and averaging 120 days to award prototype agreements - a stark contrast to the slow procurement cycles that typically shape the US acquisition process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just the process, also the culture shapes DIU’s success. This includes attracting top talent from the civil service and tech industry and providing a work culture that incentivises taking risks. The DIU enjoys support form senior military and political leaders and the Defence Innovation Board recommended in January 2025 to further expand DIU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, institutions of similar names and nature have been mushrooming across Europe. Their aim is to unite technology developers and the military end-users, to create more awareness of the potential of technology with the military forces and signal to investors which technologies are the most interesting to them. The technological innovations seen in the Russo-Ukrainian war have further highlighted their advantages in combat and catalysed innovation activities across Europe. And the increased NATO spending targets mean that there is money to invest in and accelerate defence innovation and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-new-innovation-ecosphere&quot;&gt;The UK’s New Innovation Ecosphere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the recent years, the UK has looked to model the US success. In its Strategic Defence Review (SDR), the government has recognised that defence innovation is “vital to stay ahead of our adversaries”. Indeed, the SDR goes as far as to call for defence to be “innovation led” and proposes a “radical root-and-branch reform of defence procurement – combined with substantial investment in innovation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 1 July, MoD launched the defence innovation unit endorsed in the SDR, the UK Defence Innovation (UKDI), tasked with accelerating innovation for UK defence and security. However, UKDI is not the first organisation tackling this challenge in the UK. There is a wide network of innovation hubs, centres, and task forces pre-dating the SDR, dealing with the innovation challenge in defence – an issue that has long been on the agenda for UK defence secretaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initiatives sit at various levels of the MoD’s organisation and beyond, spanning from frontline commands, the MoD’s head office to Dstl, DE&amp;amp;S, the Department for Business and Trade, and UKRI. At these various levels, they fulfil different tasks. Some are focused on enabling the military end-user to speak with product developers directly, some act more as start-up incubators to attract inward investments, while others seek to connect state-funded research programmes with the right companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scattered landscape of innovation units has been argued to lack the necessary strategic direction to unite their various innovation ambitions into a coherent approach that can deliver meaningful change to how the MoD approaches innovation as a whole and delivers it at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, the government has announced a “strategic consolidation” of the landscape by providing an umbrella organisation for all these innovation hubs: UK Defence Innovation (UKDI). Within the purview of Strategic Command, now renamed Cyber &amp;amp; Specialist Operations Command, the new unit “brings together” several existing initiatives such as DASA, DIU, the DE&amp;amp;S FCI and Frontline Commands’ units. The description of UKDI as an “umbrella” leaves room for interpretation. The most direct line of responsibility concerns DASA, as the accelerator will be “an integral part of UKDI”. The nature of the relationship with the other innovation units will get clearer over time, with UKDI aiming to be fully operational by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-success-factors-for-ukdi&quot;&gt;Critical Success Factors for UKDI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the private sector, start-ups and investors, greater cohesion and a strategic outlook are welcome measures, providing a clear point of contact and a more consolidated demand signal. So, is the UKDI such a centralised, true hub for all MoD innovation initiatives? The funding that it will command suggests that. The government announced that UKDI will have a ringfenced £400 million annual budget. It is easy to demand more money – something even the US counterpart faces - but hard to secure in tight economic constraints. If this constitutes a genuinely new and dedicated budget, this means that UKDI will do more than just control DASA, which has awarded significantly less per year in the past. That hints to a lead role of UKDI in innovation across its organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shift comes with challenges and risks. UKDI will need to pool the expertise that resides across the various sections of the organisation to be successful. This can put it at odds with those parts of the organisation that need to give up that expertise. The creation of the National Armament Director position and the formation of a new Military Strategic Headquarters show that there is ample political appetite for centralising defence structures. But centralisation can also be a threat to innovation. Independent hubs may be able to explore different ideas and solutions with different developers and producers. When there is too much emphasis on coordination, there is also a risk of creating path dependencies across the organisation. Independent hubs, while wasteful, can avoid those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, centralisation may help with some of the harder tasks any innovation organisation faces when it comes to MoD procurement practice. This practice has evolved to minimise risks for the MoD and the taxpayer. Civil servants are incentivised to follow this process, and there are few with an interest in inducing flexibility in that system for innovation’s sake. An organisation with more budgetary might and at the heart of the MoD’s structure may be better positioned to campaign for the necessary changes to make that process more permissive for innovation. The challenge will be to allow wastage within the UKDI ecosystem of hubs that can create innovation for the Frontline Commands’ specific needs while utilising the power of a united innovation platform to address common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a central innovation entity may enable a broader definition of innovation that goes beyond putting a shiny new toy in the hands of a special forces soldier. Harnessing tech for UK armed forces necessarily also means making the most out of technology for the infrastructure behind the warfighting soldiers: whether that is coordinating logistics, streamlining reporting duties or easing the administrative burden – there are more ways in which technology can empower UK armed forces beyond the battle line. UKDI must identify technological solutions that empower not just the few, but the UK Armed Forces as a whole. The new unit’s success will be judged on its ability to deliver such innovative capabilities at a large scale and within shorter timeframes than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced the grim reality that its Soviet-inherited defense industrial base was riddled with corruption, institutional inertia, and a closed culture. Yet this legacy sector, despite its dysfunction, remained indispensable to Ukraine’s survival in the face of an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was not a slow reform but a wartime transformation. In just three years, Ukraine has cultivated a defense technology ecosystem focused on unmanned systems that is agile and competitive. This report, based on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian officials, entrepreneurs, and military officers, tells the story of how this shift occurred under the extreme pressures of war. More importantly, it draws out the central lesson for the United States and its allies: Any serious effort to prepare for the wars of the future must incorporate options for radical decentralization, bottom-up innovation, and competitive dynamism within the defense industrial base. The Ukrainian case is not conclusive, but it is a crucial example of how free societies should adapt their defense sectors to meet modern threats with speed, agility, and technological ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine institutionalized a distinct “commercial-first” defense market focused primarily on innovative systems—such as unmanned platforms—by carving out a separate and parallel budget within defense spending and radically simplifying and reducing onerous acquisition rules for this market.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than relying on its legacy military-industrial complex for innovative capabilities development, Ukraine turned to the commercial sector. The country allocated a dedicated portion of its defense budget for acquiring new capabilities, originating from commercial sector and established a new regulatory framework to enable rapid acquisition and integration of unmanned technologies from nontraditional vendors. This transformation included establishing streamlined electronic procurement procedures and decentralizing procurement authority all the way down to the level of independent military units (discussed further in point 7).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s commercial-first market focused on unmanned and software-intensive military technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; The commercial-first market was originally focused almost exclusively on commercial drones. This proved to be incredibly effective, and the market’s scope has expanded significantly since the full-scale invasion began. The primary scope now includes unmanned systems—such as first-person view (FPV) and long-range strike drones and ground and naval unmanned vehicles—alongside electronic warfare and electronic reconnaissance platforms, advanced sensors, secure communications, and artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled software modules for autonomous navigation and target recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial technology—mostly unmanned systems—now accounts for nearly half of Ukraine’s defense procurement spending.&lt;/strong&gt; Based on state budget allocations alone, commercial sector acquisitions comprise nearly one-third of total spending on weapon systems. When factoring in reallocated funds from local budgets and volunteer-supported procurement, this share approaches half of all defense acquisition spending—demonstrating that in a modern, high-intensity conflict, commercially developed technologies can play a significant and beneficial role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine adapted and aligned its unmanned capability acquisition process to the commercial product development lifecycle.&lt;/strong&gt; At every stage of the product development lifecycle, the Ukrainian government worked to remove unnecessary procedures, decision milestones, and oversight mechanisms. It adapted its acquisition processes to more closely align with how drones are developed and acquired in the commercial context. Ukraine adapted regulatory and funding mechanisms to support this model, ensuring that timelines, language, and expectations between government and industry were aligned and grounded in warfighting necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine ensured military requirements for unmanned systems were defined in terms of real-world problems by end users, not rigid technical specifications coming from top-down planning.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience shows that frontline-driven problem identification leads to faster, more relevant solutions. Instead of relying on bureaucratic forecasting of requirements, Ukrainian units communicate their needs and experiences directly to engineers through informal channels of personal connections or events such as hackathons and challenges. By framing requirements as operational challenges rather than technical blueprints, the military encourages more creative responses from industry and widens the pool of potential suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine fully outsourced early-stage research and development (R&amp;amp;D) to the commercial sector, meaning drone manufacturers independently fund and develop technologies up to the prototype stage—typically reaching status as a minimum viable product(MVP) or technology readiness level (TRL) 6–7—before the military starts to engage with the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; In Ukraine, the military does not get involved in the earliest stages of developing new drones. Instead, private companies use their own money to design and build early versions of the technology. By the time the military sees it, the drone is already a working prototype, ready to be tested in real battlefield conditions. This means the military can focus on testing and using promising technologies, not funding or managing their initial development. This approach shifts the burden of early experimentation and funding to private industry, speeds up innovation through direct feedback from end users, and allows the military to focus its resources on testing, integration, and rapid deployment of promising solutions—ensuring that only mature technologies enter the defense evaluation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine heavily decentralized its defense procurement of unmanned capabilities, including by giving military units procurement authority and budgets to buy systems they need directly from a list approved by the Ministry of Defence (MOD).&lt;/strong&gt; These changes allow the units to bypass traditional annual procurement planning, enabling them to use funds available on their accounts—either directly transferred from the state budget or reallocated from local government resources—to acquire urgently needed technologies. This shift enables faster, more responsive acquisition tailored to the real-time needs of frontline operations, enhancing operational adaptability and reducing reliance on centralized bureaucratic processes. By comparison, operational military units in the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) receive budgets for uses such as paying soldiers and funding operations and maintenance, but not procuring military systems and equipment, a role that is compartmentalized within individual military services or the Office of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure and encrypted digital communication tools transformed military capability development by streamlining the communication of military needs to industry, replacing paperwork with fast digital processes and connecting military end users directly with drone developers.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on its success in digital governance, Ukraine has begun applying the same approach to its defense sector. Although a unified digital acquisition system is still evolving, digitization already accelerates prototyping, streamlines evaluation, and brings the military and industry into real-time collaboration. These tools allow the armed forces to quickly and securely communicate battlefield needs, evaluate solutions, and procure technology directly—laying the foundation for a more agile and responsive defense innovation system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the most immediate and visible crisis was the existential military threat—tanks rolling across the border and a possibility of immediate occupation of the whole country. Yet beneath this emergency lay a deeper, more protracted crisis that both predated the invasion and critically shaped Ukraine’s ability to respond to it: decades of horrific mismanagement of Ukraine’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a cornerstone of mighty Soviet military production, Ukraine’s defense industry had, by the time of the invasion, become a shell of its former self—plagued by corruption, outdated technologies, incompetent management, inefficient corporate governance, and severe technological gaps. Some of the attempted solutions to these problems—such as extensive regulatory rules and oversight to reduce corruption and mismanagement—had exacerbated other problems, such as cultural insularity and institutional sclerosis. These structural deficiencies posed a huge obstacle to producing weapons and innovative military technologies at scale. In effect, Ukraine faced the near-impossible task of overhauling its deeply troubled defense industrial system amid a full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Ukraine managed to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years out from the invasion, Ukraine now boasts an innovative defense technology sector that is in many ways the envy of Western countries with far larger military budgets and digital technology industries. A growing body of analysis has explored how Ukraine’s defense ecosystem evolved in wartime conditions by turning to commercial- and startup-driven innovation and leveraging decentralized acquisition strategies. Researchers have examined how Ukraine adapts to constantly evolving strategic and operational challenges faster than many traditional militaries, citing successes like the use of maritime drones to eliminate Russia’s Black Sea naval blockade. Others have focused on how Ukraine’s iterative approach to testing and deployment, showcased in technologies like the situational awareness system Delta, offers lessons in accelerating defense innovation and absorbing battlefield feedback in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report—the result of dozens of interviews with Ukrainian government officials, corporate executives, and military personnel—seeks to tell the still mostly unknown story of how Ukraine accomplished this remarkable turnaround and provide lessons learned for the U.S. Department of Defense in unleashing drone dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did Ukraine do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the main arc of Ukraine’s story is not one of rapid transformation of legacy defense companies (though some of this did occur). Rather, Ukraine’s leaders sidestepped many reform challenges by creating two parallel defense budget and acquisition systems that operated separately and simultaneously: one for traditional companies and traditional systems, and another for commercially derived capabilities, mostly for unmanned systems. At the time, demand for all kinds of equipment and capabilities—both traditional military kit and commercial technology—was soaring amid the largest war in Europe since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s leaders correctly concluded that the traditional defense industrial base could not be relied upon to rapidly acquire or develop drones. Major defense contractors, such as Ukroboronprom, lacked the capabilities, knowhow, and talent pool to scale production of attritable drones even remotely approaching the quality and quantity of what was readily available on the commercial market. At the same time, however, the commercial sector could not, in a realistic timeframe, emerge as a viable alternative for traditional military production of materiel such as tanks, missiles, aircraft, and artillery. These complex, capital-intensive systems require long-term investment, certified production facilities, and specialized engineering talent—capabilities the commercial sector simply could not deliver at scale or speed in the midst of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent analytical work casts Ukraine as a model of agile industrial governance and commercial-sector mobilization. The U.S. Naval Institute wrote that Ukraine’s use of commercial drones underscores the strategic value of agility in adopting new technologies, and field researchers from the Royal United Services Institute documented two-month loops from frontline need to mass-produced FPV drones. The Atlantic Council has further emphasized Ukraine’s ability to outpace more established militaries in adopting and fielding emerging technologies, crediting its vibrant tech sector and unusually fast procurement cycles and suggesting that Ukraine offers NATO allies important lessons in twenty-first-century warfare. Importantly, this research treats Ukraine’s wartime mobilization not as an anomaly born of desperation, but as a controlled experiment in modern defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reports and broader literature point to transformative efforts across three dimensions: (1) budgetary changes, (2) transformation of processes across capability development lifecycle, and (3) digital communication channels. On the fiscal front, the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) documented the dramatic growth of Ukraine’s defense industrial output from $1 billion in 2022 to an expected $15 billion in 2025, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute highlighted Kyiv’s decision to allocate 34 percent of its GDP to defense in 2024. In parallel, the U.S. Naval Institute and Atlantic Council both pointed to a transformed development lifecycle, where frontline demand drives rapid iteration and mass production of military systems. Finally, CEPA and VoxUkraine each discussed how digital platforms such as Brave1 demonstrate how Ukraine has embedded transparency and cross-sector coordination into its acquisition ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing body of research provides the conceptual and empirical foundation for this report’s analytical approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;Research Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advances the argument that two distinct acquisition systems—one focused on traditional hardware-intensive platforms and another oriented toward commercial-first software-centric capabilities—can and should coexist within modern defense acquisition systems. Ukraine’s wartime experience with drone acquisition provides empirical evidence that a dual-track model is not only viable but necessary to meet the diverse demands of contemporary military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conventional defense industrial bases (DIBs) may eventually be forced to adapt to the tempo and innovation cycles of commercial technology development, Ukraine demonstrates that new acquisition systems for commercial technologies, such as unmanned systems, can function effectively in parallel with traditional acquisition pathways even during existential conflict. This parallel structure enables military organizations to exploit the advantages of both legacy and agile ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this argument, the report uses Ukraine as a crucial case study for drawing broader lessons for the United States and its allies. Ukraine’s wartime adaptation provides a rare real-world laboratory to observe institutional transformation under extreme conditions. Unlike theoretical models or peacetime pilots, Ukraine’s innovations in defense acquisition are battlefield tested. The insights presented here are based on over 50 in-depth interviews conducted in 2024 and 2025 with Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, MOD officials, defense startup founders, commercial drone manufacturers, and U.S. stakeholders, including members of combatant commands, program executive offices (PEOs), and commercial defense companies and venture capital funds. This dual perspective grounds the analysis in both practitioner experience and comparative institutional context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes the drivers of Ukraine’s transformation across three analytical dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgetary Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s innovation model is rooted in structural shifts to its defense budget. By creating a dedicated funding stream for unmanned systems acquisition outside the traditional defense acquisition system—managed by an alternative agency—Ukraine enabled faster, more flexible procurement of commercial technologies. This budgetary dualism allowed the government to reorient priorities away from an inefficient legacy defense-industrial base and toward battlefield-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation of Processes Across the Capability Development Lifecycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine departed from the rigid, linear acquisition model common to many militaries and instead adopted a product development framework aligned with commercial practices. This transformation included decentralizing procurement authority, enabling unit-level purchases, accelerating prototyping and field testing, and integrating frontline feedback into procurement cycles. In doing so, Ukraine replaced paper-based, multiyear bureaucracies with a nimble and iterative approach suited to the fast-evolving battlefield environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Communication Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; A crucial enabler of Ukraine’s transformation was the digitization of the defense innovation ecosystem. Ukraine constructed real-time digital interfaces connecting warfighters, engineers, and government institutions, such as the Brave1 coordination platform, the DOT-Chain weapons marketplace, and Army+ app feedback tools. These interfaces provided visibility into operational needs and technological performance, helping to reduce corruption, improve responsiveness, and maintain alignment between end users and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these three dimensions is examined in depth in the report, using Ukraine as an empirical test case for assessing the feasibility and utility of commercial-first innovation pathways in defense. Based on this analysis, the report distills lessons learned from Ukraine and offers policy recommendations for the U.S. Department of Defense as it seeks to modernize its own acquisition system. The Ukrainian case is not a one-to-one template, but a source of tested insights that can help shape reforms in a more deliberate, scalable, and institutionally integrated manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dimension-1-budgetary-changes&quot;&gt;Dimension 1: Budgetary Changes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To institutionalize commercial drones’ acquisition, Ukraine created a dedicated budget outside of the MOD’s acquisition and procurement budget.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2023, the government allocated separate funding specifically for procuring unmanned systems from the commercial sector and empowered the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) to oversee it. This step was supported by a distinct set of procurement rules established by the cabinet of ministers to accelerate purchasing drones from the commercial market. This shift ensured that military customers had direct access to funding and could engage flexibly with nontraditional suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of 2025, nearly one-third of all defense procurement spending is directed toward commercial innovation, with major portion allocated to unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; With over 165 billion UAH allocated for capabilities developed outside the traditional defense-industrial base (see Dimension 1 analysis below), Ukraine has fundamentally reoriented its acquisition strategy toward a more agile, decentralized, and innovation-driven model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procurement authority has been decentralized to the unit level, enabling faster and more localized procurement and adoption of unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The MOD tests and evaluates the systems, then adopts them into service, making them available for purchase by military units. Almost 700 frontline units are now authorized to purchase critical systems directly from commercial vendors, using funds drawn from both central government allocations and flexible transfers from local authorities. This structure allows for responsive bottom-up acquisition based on operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a result, private companies fully fund early-stage R&amp;amp;D, while the government incentivizes success through fast-track procurement.&lt;/strong&gt; Without access to public funding, firms take on the risk of developing drone prototypes on their own. Once a solution proves viable, the military adopts it rapidly—often purchasing it at market price before final refinements—creating a strong feedback loop that rewards speed, effectiveness, and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ukraine urgently needed to acquire innovative capabilities from domestic commercial firms, startups, and select foreign vendors, it became immediately clear to government officials that traditional defense budgeting mechanisms were an obstacle. Existing budgeting processes relied on multiyear planning cycles, where even the most basic procurement could take one or two years to materialize. The country needed a system capable of mobilizing funds quickly and ensuring their flexible usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere was this disconnect more apparent than with novel unmanned systems. For example, a commercial FPV drone, despite its widespread use on the battlefield and growing lethality, could not be purchased through official channels because it had no name in military nomenclature. The bureaucratic machinery, bound by legacy classification and documentation systems, lacked even the vocabulary to describe what the frontlines urgently demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, to solve the problem of urgently supplying drones to the frontline, diverse and mostly ad hoc groups of volunteers organized grassroots crowdfunding campaigns, both domestically and internationally. While these efforts played an essential role during the early stages of the war, they were stopgap measures, not a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more important for this analysis is the institutional solution Ukraine ultimately adopted to create an agile acquisition process of unmanned capabilities from the commercial sector: the creation of a separate budget, distinct from the conventional defense acquisition funding and procurement system, governed by its own rules and procedures. While this section of the report focuses on the structure of the wartime defense budget changes, the new procedural approach will be explored in greater detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the budgetary shifts first requires an understanding of Ukraine’s defense acquisition budget structure. Currently, it consists of three major budget programs through which defense spending is conducted for new capabilities acquisition. Each budget program functions as a separate budget, administered by a distinct agency operating under its own regulations and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge that the spending figures and categories provided in this report are taken from the Ukrainian state budget, but do not precisely reflect all nuances of military spending. This is due to two primary factors. First, a significant portion of military expenditures remain classified, making it exceptionally difficult to determine which specific line items fall within each budget program. Second, the unpredictable nature of wartime operations requires the government to frequently reallocate funds or initiate new spending outside the original budget approved by the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, a broad conceptual mapping remains both possible and useful for understanding the deeper budgetary shifts that have occurred, and how they have enabled Ukraine to respond with speed and flexibility to the challenges of wartime acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7Jv0KlH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Comparing the Three Budget Programs for Defense Acquisition Funding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2020, the MOD was the only government body defining operational requirements, since it was the sole acquisition authority for the armed forces. This centralized structure positioned the MOD as the only customer and interlocutor with the state-owned defense-industrial complex, which was organized under the umbrella of the Ukrainian Defense Industry, or Ukroboronprom (UOP)—a state-owned defense conglomerate uniting financially interdependent Soviet-era enterprises under centralized management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence owned the first acquisition budget and conducted acquisition efforts using a single budget program titled “Development, procurement, modernization, and repair of weapons, military equipment, means, and systems.” This program functioned as the principal vehicle for the R&amp;amp;D, procurement, operations, and sustainment of arms and materiel, all from one funding source. Despite institutional reforms initiated in the years that followed, this budget program remains the primary mechanism through which the military executes defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine has been in a protracted state of war since 2014. For almost a decade of the ongoing war, the Soviet-legacy military industrial base proved to be not only deeply corrupt but also fundamentally incapable of generating innovative, particularly unmanned and software-centric, defense technologies to fight and deter Russia. The Ukrainian government tried to address this problem by creating a dedicated body to boost defense-industrial modernization, and in 2020, the cabinet of ministers established the Ministry of Strategic Industries (MSI). The mandate of this newly formed ministry was to oversee and complete the restructuring of the UOP—which had long been plagued by inefficiency and opacity—and to address the systemic dysfunctions of the military-industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This institutional shift created a second acquisition budget dedicated to the development of advanced defense technologies and the modernization of the military-industrial base. Allocations to the MSI started in 2021 and became a mechanism through which the government aimed to invest in innovation—outside the legacy channels of the MOD and UOP that had failed to deliver results. However, despite this effort, both the MSI and the restructured Ukroboronprom—transformed into a joint-stock company in 2023, where the single shareholder is still the government, and rebranded as the Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI)—continued to face constant leadership changes and failed to deliver new capabilities. Therefore, on the brink of the full-scale Russian invasion, Ukraine found itself incapable of developing and producing innovative weapon systems, and its defense-industrial base remained largely outdated and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 full-scale invasion was a major pivot point. Ukraine had to change its defense acquisition strategy to integrate innovations from the commercial sector into military operations. The Ukrainian Armed Forces began rapidly adopting readily available solutions—from DJI’s Mavic drones to commercial satellite imagery provided by companies such as Maxar and Planet Labs. However, this surge in demand for innovative commercial products quickly exposed the rigidity of existing procurement system, which lacked both the speed and flexibility required in wartime conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Ukrainian government introduced a parallel acquisition mechanism for unmanned capabilities. Initially focused on addressing operational constraints and acquiring off-the-shelf commercial drones, this approach soon evolved to include direct contracting with startups and commercial companies emerging within Ukraine’s defense tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this effort, a third acquisition budget was established alongside a simplified acquisition process, administered by a third agency. This budget was earmarked specifically for nontraditional capabilities—primarily unmanned systems across all domains, electronic warfare tools, and later, advanced sensors and AI-enabled technologies. To institutionalize this new pathway, the SSSCIP was granted a dedicated procurement authority, formalizing its role as a central actor in acquiring next-generation unmanned and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending data across the three principal defense budget programs show how priorities have changed since 2018. As illustrated in Figure 2, the MSI’s budget program first appeared in 2021, amounting to just 3 billion UAH (around 75 million USD), a negligible figure in the context of defense industrial base development. This figure shows that modernizing the legacy defense industry and acquiring new capabilities received little attention at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape shifted dramatically following the full-scale invasion, as the Ukrainian government prioritized large-scale procurement of weapon systems and military equipment through the MOD. However, in 2023, another strategic pivot became evident—for the first time, 30 billion UAH was directed toward the procurement of unmanned systems from the commercial sector—signaling a commitment to leveraging and outsourcing R&amp;amp;D to nontraditional defense suppliers. For comparison, this figure is almost twice the investment into new capability acquisition from the state-owned legacy industry that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jNtaTBC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Three Major Budgets Within Ukrainian Defense Spending Designated for New Capabilities Acquisition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new model proved highly effective. Therefore, in 2025, the MOD announced plans to allocate 110 billion UAH—out of a its total acquisition budget of nearly 500 billion UAH—specifically for drone procurement. Although this process will be administered through the MOD’s Defense Procurement Agency, it will follow the same principles established for unmanned technology acquisition: reliance on a military-commercial technology online marketplace, authorization for direct unit-level procurement, and accelerated procurement cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the MOD’s approach closely mirrors the model employed in recent years by SSSCIP for commercial drone procurement, this planned budget reallocation can be conceptually added to the 47 billion UAH previously allocated under the SSSCIP program. The two programs operate under nearly identical rules, differing primarily in the administrative body overseeing them within the defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the cabinet of ministers retains the authority to supplement this funding through ad hoc decisions. For example, in February 2025, it authorized an additional disbursement of 8 billion UAH to SSSCIP for the procurement of unmanned systems as an ad hoc measure. When aggregated, the total funding directed toward the acquisition of unmanned technologies from the commercial sector reaches approximately 165 billion UAH—amounting to nearly one-third of all expenditures on weapons and military equipment by the Ukrainian military. This trend reflects a fundamental reorientation of Ukraine’s defense acquisition strategy toward a more agile and innovation-driven model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with central budget reforms, Ukraine has decentralized procurement authority for capabilities acquired from commercial sector. Nearly 700 military units are now authorized to make purchases based on a commander-approved list of essential items instead of the traditional dependency on annual procurement plans and lengthy budgeting cycles. This procurement authority covers not only unmanned systems, but also electronic warfare, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), sensors, parts, transportation, communication systems and other items beyond big expensive weapons systems and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military units receive funding from two primary sources: (1) direct transfers from the state budget and (2) reallocated funds from local budgets. In December 2024, the Ukrainian government authorized direct budgetary transfers to military units specifically for the procurement of unmanned systems, allocating the equivalent of 27 billion UAH over an 11-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, local authorities were granted the flexibility to quickly redirect part of their own budgets in response to urgent needs of frontline units. This allows local authorities, especially those close to the front line, to either support the units that protect them or simply reallocate their revenues to help equip the armed forces with the latest market technology. In 2023 alone, local authorities contributed 16 billion UAH in transfers to military units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in budgeting process and decentralization in procurement authority show that Ukraine has restructured its defense spending by moving away from long-term, often inefficient capability development programs with the legacy military-industrial base, instead delegating much of the early-stage R&amp;amp;D to the commercial sector. With the exception of limited grant programs—where individual awards do not exceed 8 million UAH—there are no substantial government-funded programs to support early-stage R&amp;amp;D. As a result, commercial companies carry both the financial risk and the burden of assembling specialized talent in the initial phases of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once a viable product is developed, the government offsets these early investments by adopting a fast-track procurement model: acquiring technologies at full market price, even when they remain under refinement or are still undergoing operational improvement. This approach allows the government to rapidly field innovative capabilities and create incentives for private sector innovation through rapid military adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidate budget line items into bigger “pots” for more flexible and rapid resource allocation to procure unmanned systems, with one pot specifically dedicated to unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD’s current highly specific budget line items fragment funding and slow the department’s responsiveness to innovation. Consolidating these lines into broader mission-aligned categories would give the DOD the agility to spend resources on what is needed and already available, reducing administrative complexity and allowing program managers to adapt to changing operational and technological demands without restarting the budgeting process from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund the full product lifecycle across appropriations.&lt;/strong&gt; Modern capability development does not have clean boundaries between (1) research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E), (2) procurement, and (3) operations and maintenance phases. Military technology constantly develops and upgrades. The DOD should revise its financial management regulations to allow a single stream of funding to support the full lifecycle of a system—from prototyping and testing to deployment, troubleshooting, iteration and sustainment. This would eliminate artificial breaks in funding and reflect how technology is actually developed and improved upon today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a dedicated unmanned systems acquisition budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than funneling all innovation through rigid acquisition pathways and program-of-record channels, the DOD should carve out a standalone budget for rapid procurement of unmanned technologies at high technology readiness levels. This readily available budget must be governed by flexible rules that allow iterative deployment, unit-level purchasing, and the acquisition of products not yet formalized in military nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a structural distinction between acquisition pathways for conventional platforms and a commercial-first track, starting with one for unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should formally separate the acquisition of large-scale, expensive, hardware-intensive programs—mostly major defense acquisition program (MDAP) and middle tier of acquisition (MTA) portfolios—from software-centric and commercially viable technologies. This structural distinction would allow MDAPs and MTAs to continue under the traditional oversight-heavy framework while enabling a separate, more agile path for procuring capabilities such as drones, AI-powered software, and communication tools from commercial innovators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To draw lessons from Ukraine and to apply them to the U.S. defense acquisition system, it is first necessary to delineate which categories of systems and technologies should remain within the traditional acquisition pathways and which can be transitioned to more flexible acquisition mechanisms targeted toward the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. defense industrial base is predominantly not commercial in nature. It is dominated by a small group of large prime contractors that operate almost exclusively within the defense sphere and largely bypass the commercial technology ecosystem. Today, most cutting-edge technologies—whether in software, AI, or unmanned systems—are originally developed in commercial sector, targeted at consumer or B2B markets, and shaped by open competition and rapid iteration, not by traditional defense firms. The true drivers of innovation in unmanned and software-centric technologies lie within the commercial sector, including startups and venture capital firms, which operate outside the rigid, decades-old structures of the traditional defense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drone technology is no exception to the broader shift toward commercially driven innovation. To rapidly address the growing demand for low-cost expendable unmanned systems, the DOD should establish a dedicated budget for the acquisition of mature, high-TRL drone technologies from manufacturers capable of scaling production quickly. This budget must be flexible—unencumbered by rigid funding categories (known within the DOD as “colors of money”)—and usable across various stages of the capability lifecycle, including iterative development, testing, fielding, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To empower experimentation and accelerate fielding, this budget should be distributed across the services and down to lower levels of command, including combatant commands, enabling operational units to procure systems they wish to test or deploy. Critically, these funds should be made readily available outside the constraints of the standard budgeting cycle, allowing units to act on emerging needs without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure coherence across the force and manage security concerns, the DOD should maintain a curated list of preapproved systems—something like a much bigger Blue UAS list, managed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). This list would serve as a flexible, vetted catalog of options, offering military users a wide selection of drones that meet core requirements, particularly in terms of interoperability with existing networks and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative should be viewed as a pilot project—an initial experiment in devolving procurement authority and leveraging mature commercial technologies to meet immediate operational needs. If successful, it can serve as a blueprint for a broader shift toward commercial-first acquisition across the department. By expanding this model beyond small drones, the DOD could accelerate the integration of commercially developed technologies that bring new capabilities or upgrade existing ones, ultimately making the U.S. military more agile, responsive, and technologically competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine which systems should fall under the new commercial-first acquisition framework, the “watershed” should be along the distinction between conventional, hardware-intensive platforms typically developed by major defense primes and a new generation of software-centric, cost-efficient technologies often enhanced by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the context of the U.S. defense acquisition system, the most appropriate structural distinction aligns with separation from portfolios containing MDAPs and MTAs. This delineation reflects fundamental differences in development cycles, complexity, and vendor ecosystems, and provides a logical basis for structuring relative budget allocations between traditional and commercial-first acquisition pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDAPs and MTAs encompass the DOD’s most complex, capital-intensive, and strategically sensitive systems, such as fighter jets, submarines, integrated missile defense architectures, and ships. Reforming this category is a substantial effort that affects entrenched contractual obligations, multiyear budget cycles, and layers of bureaucratic oversight. Therefore, MDAPs and MTAs should continue along established acquisition pathways with prime contractors and long-term programmatic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial-first acquisition should focus on the vast array of capabilities that fall outside the MDAP and MTA category. These are capabilities that are within the reach of the commercial sector, such as AI-enabled software, unmanned systems, satellite constellations, next-generation communications, and even early-stage hypersonics and humanoid robotics. These technologies are often best developed not through traditional defense contractors but by startups and commercial innovators already working at the technological frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction is not merely conceptual—it has direct and significant implications for budget structuring. Defense budgets should be divided along the same lines as the acquisition pathways. Funding for MDAPs and MTAs can continue to follow the traditional, requirement-driven, multiyear budget planning process, suitable for large-scale, complex systems with long development timelines. In contrast, the budget allocated to the commercial-first market must be designed to allow immediate procurement of readily available technologies. This funding should be oriented toward solving problems and meeting the operational needs of end users. Using this budget, commanders should be able to procure novel products that do not yet exist in military nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions with CSIS, U.S. commanders and warfighters emphasized this gap. Many reported facing critical operational challenges for which commercial vendors already offer viable, well-suited solutions. However, they were unable to procure these technologies because the solutions do not align with preexisting requirements—requirements that were often written more than five years ago and are tied to rigid budget allocations. This disconnect shows the need for restructuring budgeting procedures to make funds more immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the pace of innovation races in modern conflict has fundamentally changed the lifecycle of military capabilities, many systems—particularly those based on software and AI—may never reach a traditional sustainment phase. Instead, they remain in a state of continuous development, undergoing frequent upgrades and iterations. In such a dynamic environment, military customers must assess not only the deployed solution but also competing alternatives from other vendors on the market each time technology is refreshed. This process reflects the competitive environment of the commercial market and creates opportunities for multiple vendors to compete for awards, rather than locking into a single supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model would enable nontraditional companies to secure more contracts from various military customers, provided those customers have access to flexible, readily available funding. Military customers should be able to fully cover costs from their available funding for testing and evaluation of commercial prototypes by conducting paid pilots. This will make military customers more responsible during the selection process as they use their own funds and pay the full price for selected prototypes to reward companies for delivering products with high technological maturity. In doing so, companies are rewarded for their early-stage R&amp;amp;D investments by gaining the opportunity to sell high-maturity prototypes and codevelop them with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach moves the defense innovation ecosystem away from its current dependence on achieving program-of-record status as the sole pathway to profitability. Instead, it offers immediate returns to companies and their investors and lowers the barriers to entry for firms, opening this commercial-first market for competition. At the same time, said competition incentivizes continuous, operationally tailored technological progress among companies to keep winning contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial-first market reshapes the product development lifecycle by redistributing responsibilities and funding sources: early-stage innovation driven and funded by private capital, and public investment focused on testing, validation, and fielding. Figure 2 illustrates this realignment across capability development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PscFAhC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Redistribution of Responsibilities and Shift in Funding Sources Within Drone Budget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these reforms would build a more dynamic, responsive, and innovation-ready budgetary environment within the Department of Defense for non-MDAP acquisitions. By shifting from a static, siloed model to one that reflects the tempo and structure of modern technology development, the Pentagon can unlock access to its 200-billion-dollar market for the commercial sector and bring the most innovative capabilities to the field at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine successfully adapted its drone acquisition lifecycle by aligning it with the commercial technology development process.&lt;/strong&gt; Faced with urgent wartime demands and the failure of legacy procurement systems, Ukrainian authorities abandoned rigid, linear frameworks in favor of an agile, iterative model that mirrors how commercial products are developed—from identifying needs to prototyping, testing, and refinement. This shift enabled faster delivery of frontline-ready capabilities and fostered a closer partnership between government and the commercial sector, proving the value of applying product development principles to defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine has redefined how military requirements for drones are generated by shifting from top-down forecasting to a bottom-up, problem-driven approach rooted in battlefield realities.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of issuing rigid technical specifications, Ukrainian military authorities now articulate their needs as operational problems communicated directly by end users—either through direct engagement with developers or formats like hackathons and government-run challenges. This method focuses on essential functions over fixed designs, accelerates responsiveness, encourages innovation from a broader pool of suppliers, and ensures that solutions remain relevant and aligned with the evolving demands of the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military outsources early‑stage drone R&amp;amp;D to the commercial sector and tests prototypes only at high TRL.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine has shifted the burden of funding and supporting early R&amp;amp;D and prototyping to private industry, encouraging companies to experiment, self‑fund, and iterate until their concepts reach TRL 7-9. Instead of selecting a single contractor and waiting for incremental progress, the military now receives prototypes that can move directly into government‑led testing, evaluation, and codification into the military arsenal. This approach concentrates public resources on final validation and leverages market capacity for earlier R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces procure a “good enough” product to complete a mission rather than chasing maximal technical sophistication.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military selects unmanned systems that meet operational needs instead of buying the best system with “showcase” features whose battlefield value is unclear. This pragmatism saves scarce resources for higher‑priority technical needs, while the speed of commercial innovation lets the military pivot quickly to improved models. Often, systems stay at the prototype stage as they undergo constant, sometimes monthly, upgrades in response to enemy countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine has embedded frontline warfighters into the testing and evaluation process of unmanned systems, ensuring that only combat-relevant technologies are adopted.&lt;/strong&gt; Soldiers with direct operational experience—including drone operators and users of AI-enhanced systems—participate in evaluation commissions and have a decisive voice in determining whether a system is ready for procurement. This user-centered approach is reinforced by rigorous testing under battlefield-like conditions, including exposure to real electronic warfare threats and variable terrain. Together, these practices ensure that new technologies are validated not just in theory, but through practical, end user–informed assessments that reflect the realities of modern combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine, like many other militaries around the world, relied on a traditional multiyear acquisition framework with a rigid, linear sequence of stages. The process typically began with a classified requirement development phase, followed by the selection of a designated enterprise within the state-owned military-industrial base to deliver a capability. This was then followed by a lengthy and costly capability development effort, which often failed to result in actual delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous issues plagued this system. Projects frequently stalled due to lack of funding, the loss of engineering talent, and excessive bureaucratic oversight, such as repeated inspections by the MOD. Delivery timelines were often extended to secure continued budget allocations. In some cases, collusion between ministry officials, who initiated the capability and requested funding, and enterprise managers, who produced progress reports justifying further investment, allowed programs to drag on indefinitely. While both sides were benefiting from this arrangement, the result was a failure to deliver defense capabilities, ultimately weakening the country’s readiness to defend its sovereignty and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the military’s decisive shift toward the commercial sector to acquire effective, frontline-ready capabilities fundamentally transformed the country’s approach to defense acquisition. The most significant change was the alignment of Ukraine’s defense acquisition framework with the commercial product development lifecycle. The pressing demand for speed, innovation, and reliability—particularly in areas such as unmanned systems, software platforms, and AI solutions—forced the removal of unnecessary stages, bureaucratic checks, and outdated procedures that had previously slowed the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new lifecycle did not emerge as an end-to-end strategy or a formalized vision of military leadership. Instead, Ukrainian authorities addressed bottlenecks and obstacles as they arose in the process of acquiring unmanned systems from the commercial sector. The approach that organically developed in Ukraine has significant value, as it represents a refined set of practices validated through real-world application under the conditions of an active war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new lifecycle, shown in Figure 3, is now much shorter and more agile, closely aligned with how commercial technologies are developed and brought to market. Any commercially developed product—whether hardware or software—typically follows the same product development cycle: (1) initial identification of a specific need or problem (not requirements), followed by (2) developing a technological solution and creating of a prototype or MVP by a commercial company, and (3) progressing through phases of testing, refinement, and eventual delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, iterative development plays a central role. Every iteration enhances the product’s performance, aligns it more closely with user needs, and advances its level of technological maturity. This continuous feedback and adaptation loop is essential for development of unmanned capabilities specifically, in order to achieve the level of readiness necessary for operational deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I3NMsTG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: The Ukrainian Military Commercial Sector Capability Development Life Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every stage of the new lifecycle framework, the government made necessary changes in regulation and funding procedures, which brought the military approach to capability acquisition closer to practices in the commercial sector. Although the revised process may appear straightforward, it plays a vital role in aligning language, timelines, expectations, and commitments between government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale invasion, capability acquisition timelines in Ukraine averaged approximately 11 years, with some programs taking as long as 20 years to complete. Since then, Ukraine has managed to shorten this process to an average of 18 months—and, in the case of small expendable systems, to as little as 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace requirements with problem statements that come directly from those who will use the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of relying on rigid engineering requirements set far in advance, the U.S. military should define its needs through operational problem statements developed directly by those who will deploy the technology in the field. This approach is especially relevant for small drones and other unmanned systems, where rapid iteration and adaptability are essential. These problem statements should be communicated to the commercial ecosystem to guide innovation and encourage creative technical approaches. The only additional requirement should be that any proposed system integrates smoothly into existing and planned military networks, ensuring compatibility and interoperability from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsource more early‑stage drone R&amp;amp;D to commercial industry and only test and evaluate prototypes that are at least TRL 6–7 (i.e., ready for testing in operational environment).&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should rely more heavily on commercial actors to conduct early-stage R&amp;amp;D for drone technologies, reserving government involvement only for the evaluation of systems that have already reached a high level of maturity—those at or beyond TRL 6–7. In practice, this means the military would receive prototypes ready for field testing, significantly shortening development timelines. This approach allows the private sector to absorb initial development risk, promotes competition, and ensures that only technically viable and operationally relevant systems move into military testing pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test and evaluate mature systems in operational or near-operational environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Testing and evaluation should be driven by end users—those who will actually operate the systems—in environments that replicate real battlefield conditions. For unmanned systems, this means including variables such as contested electromagnetic environments, complex terrain, and extreme weather. For AI-enabled drone software, this requires secure, closed-loop testing environments that incorporate realistic operational data and simulate actual use cases. Allowing users to assess the systems ensures technological relevance and encourages iterative refinement based on frontline feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a simplified and flexible procurement procedure—“other transactions” (OTs)—as the default mechanism for procuring drones from a nontraditional vendor.&lt;/strong&gt; To enable fast, flexible acquisition of commercially developed unmanned systems, the DOD should make OT authority the standard mechanism for working with nontraditional vendors. OTs allow the military to prototype and scale production without the bureaucratic constraints of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). For this to be effective, acquisition professionals need dedicated training on OT design and implementation, so they can structure agreements that are legally sound, strategically aligned, and tailored to the pace of commercial technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current acquisition process in the DOD still reflects legacy approaches to innovation development and adoption—much like the outdated system Ukraine inherited from its Soviet past. This is not a coincidence, as the U.S. acquisition system is also a product of the Cold War era, a time when technological progress moved at a much slower pace and the military was the main driver and funder of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the most significant technological breakthroughs no longer appear in classified military labs, but rather in the offices of tech startups and large tech companies—often led by engineers in sneakers and T-shirts rather than white lab coats. While many of these breakthroughs are still indirectly supported by government funding, the gap between the commercial and military innovations in both the speed and nature of technological leaps has grown dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this reality, the military’s challenge is not to compete with the commercial sector or to try to recreate its innovative success within the military industrial base, but rather to find the most effective ways to leverage these advancements and adapt them for defense purposes. The acquisition system is that gateway through which commercial technology can enter and be integrated into the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the DOD still relies on a complicated, multistage process created to manage the entire lifecycle of a capability—from defining requirements and developing a prototype to procuring, using, and eventually divesting it. This system is deeply embedded in institutional policies, with funding procedures, layers of bureaucracy, and decisionmaking processes all organized around a rigid, requirement-based structure. Designed for a different era, this framework now struggles to keep pace with the speed, innovation, and agility demanded by modern conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s most recent effort to modernize its acquisition system is the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF), launched in 2020. The core idea behind the AAF is to give program managers more flexibility by offering six different acquisition pathways. Each pathway is designed to match the specific needs of a given capability, allowing faster and more efficient development. The goal is to move away from outdated, one-size-fits-all processes and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, making it easier to deliver new technologies to the military more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in reality, the AAF pathways largely remain a refined version of the old system, rather than a true departure from it. Despite its intended flexibility, it continues to operate within the same institutional constraints and bureaucratic structures it was designed to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programs continue to experience significant delays, lack of readily available resources for procurement of available solutions, and slow technology transitions. The MTA pathway, intended to accelerate delivery of systems smaller than MDAPs, shows considerable inefficiencies. The DOD plans to invest 44.5 billion USD across 20 of its most expensive MTA programs, yet many face development timelines that stretch well beyond their original targets. Several programs now anticipate delivering initial capabilities years after their MTA phases end. Moreover, programs entering the MTA pathway with immature technologies often face protracted development cycles rather than rapid fielding. The Government Accountability Office found that none of the seven reviewed MTA programs with low technology maturity were ready for production or fielding by the end of their efforts. These delays reveal a persistent structural inability to deliver timely innovation, even under acquisition models designed for speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet today’s challenges, the U.S. government should go beyond the AAF for unmanned systems acquisition and align this capability development process more closely with commercial product development practices. This means not just simplifying the capability lifecycle, but also rethinking how each stage should support faster adoption, continuous updates, and better alignment with the pace and methods of commercial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, any military capability starts with a formal process of writing detailed requirements. Within the current U.S. defense acquisition system, developing formal requirements is a complicated process which often takes years. As U.S. military personnel shared with CSIS, this process typically produces lengthy, highly technical documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long, that narrow the pool of potential vendors, often favoring a small group of large defense primes willing and able to meet the extensive list of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better engage the commercial sector, requirements for commercial technology solutions should be short—preferably no more than three pages—focused on the operational problem, and flexible enough to allow a range of innovative approaches. Unlike traditional government-led R&amp;amp;D programs, the commercial sector can offer diverse, nonstandard solutions that compete on performance and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way military needs are shared with industry should also be updated. A single easy-to-use digital platform should be developed to let companies quickly see what the military needs, determine how urgent each problem is, and connect directly with end users through events, webinars, or other interactive tools. This direct communication would help companies better understand the problems and tailor their solutions more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, capability requirements should originate closer to the real operational environment. Ukraine’s experience has shown that operational needs can vary significantly across different parts of the frontline and domains, showing the importance of context-specific solutions. For the United States, this means that, ideally, combatant commands would engage more frequently and directly with industry to inform and refine operational needs development alongside formal acquisition processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples within the DOD illustrate how requirements generation and communication can be modernized to better align with contemporary innovation practices. First, The Navy’s PEO for Digital and Enterprise Services, or PEO Digital, shared with CSIS that the office has developed the Electronic Requirements Governance Board (eRGB), a digital, Jira-style ticketing system that allows end users to submit capability needs and enables PEO Digital to further track, refine, remove duplications, and assign resources. Each request is reviewed within a unified platform that integrates feasibility assessments, dependency analyses, and real-time dashboards. This system reduces the average requirements cycle from three years to just three months, enabling faster translation of operational needs into actionable acquisition initiatives, while improving transparency and minimizing duplication across the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the DIU has redefined how capability needs are communicated to industry through its use of Commercial Solutions Openings (CSOs). These brief solicitations describe operational problems without prescribing technical solutions, leaving room for commercial creativity and rapid response. By often requiring those proposed solutions to be only interoperable and integrable with existing systems, DIU ensures technical compatibility without stifling innovation. This concise format also functions as a technology scouting tool, allowing the DIU to quickly map emerging technologies and engage with a broad spectrum of commercial actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage of the product development lifecycle is the most time-consuming and resource-intensive: research, development, and prototyping. Commercial companies and startups outpace government and big primes because competitive market pressure and commitments to investors drive fast, continuous iteration for a working prototype or MVP. In the commercial technology world, software updates roll out far faster than any formal requirements or budgeting cycle can track, and success is measured by delivered products rather than achievement of process milestones. Therefore, outsourcing early R&amp;amp;D lets the military tap this momentum and receive mature, high‑TRL prototypes without bearing the cost of prolonged R&amp;amp;D in usual acquisition process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD must establish continuous technology scouting to maintain real-time awareness of the commercial innovation landscape. This requires consolidating all incoming responses from existing channels—such as CSOs, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) submissions, and service-level innovation hubs—into a unified, searchable database. Each entry should be evaluated against the TRL scale and made accessible across program offices to avoid duplication and improve coordination. An additional mechanism should be created to receive and assess unsolicited commercial proposals, tracking their readiness and any prior DOD engagement. Together, these efforts would provide acquisition professionals with a real-time map of available commercial capabilities, ensuring that promising and existing solutions are evaluated and not lost in bureaucratic silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that these unmanned systems prototypes align with actual operational needs, testing and evaluation must be conducted by the same end users who originally identified the capability gaps. A concern raised numerous times by combatant commands in discussions with CSIS is that too often the systems delivered to them are based on assumptions generated at the service level, resulting in misaligned or underperforming capabilities. Embedding end users directly into the testing process, ideally within the intended deployment environment and alongside manufacturers’ engineering teams, enables real-time feedback and rapid iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial for AI-powered software for unmanned systems, which should be evaluated in controlled, secure environments that replicate operational conditions, using declassified data where feasible to for realistic assessment. The U.S. military can implement this approach by decentralizing testing and evaluation and embedding it closer to the operational edge. This can be achieved through the establishment of dedicated units—small-scale equivalents of the DIU—within each service or even at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more effective model for testing and evaluation may involve empowering existing acquisition entities—such as PEOs—to conduct experimentation in close cooperation with the end users, as demonstrated by the success of Navy’s PEO Digital in piloting commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of PEO Digital’s Innovation Adoption Kit is its four-stage “investment horizons” model, which structures the journey of technology from early exploration to operational deployment. Horizon 3 serves as the entry point for commercially developed innovations, acting as a technology backlog filled with solutions that have emerged independently of Navy funding. This allows the Navy to monitor a broad range of emerging capabilities without immediate investment, institutionalizing early-stage scouting and creating a pipeline for future testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Horizon 3 technology shows promise, it moves into Horizon 2, where the Navy funds pilot programs to evaluate performance in mission-relevant environments. These pilots prioritize outcome-based testing over full compliance with military standards, removing a major barrier for commercial entrants. Flexible contracting tools—such as OTs—enable rapid iteration, with some Navy program offices running up to 20 pilots a year compared to the traditional pace of just 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a pilot proves effective, Horizon 1 facilitates the transition to scaled deployment by streamlining budgeting, governance, and compliance steps. Instead of requiring all regulatory hurdles be cleared up front, this phase front-loads only what is necessary, accelerating adoption while managing risk. One 2022 Innovation Adoption Kit open call drew over 100 commercial applicants, and within seven months, an AI analytics firm had gone from proposal to fielded contract. This approach offers vendors a transparent and accelerated path from prototype to production while ensuring that government investment is tied to demonstrated results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, organizations like the Rapid Capabilities Offices and U.S. Special Operations Command have developed agile frameworks that prioritize operational relevance and iterative feedback. The Rapid Capabilities Offices, for example, uses a model that directly involves warfighters in identifying urgent capability gaps, rapidly sourcing prototypes, and testing them under real operational conditions. Special Operations Command’s SOFWERX is an example of how collaborative ecosystems—with open access to small businesses, academia, and labs—can drive innovation at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite these advances, many of these efforts still lack well-defined pathways for transitioning validated solutions into larger acquisition programs, limiting their broader impact. To solve this problem, services and end users should have readily available budgets, as discussed in previous chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, an important aspect of innovation adoption is contracting. It should not be treated as a special form of art requiring a vast, siloed workforce. Instead, it should be boiled down to a technical service—focused on executing agreements—within a broader product development ecosystem. This approach would allow acquisition professionals to focus on one core function: structuring fair, efficient contracts that support the iterative development, maintenance, and scaling of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting a single default contracting mechanism across the product lifecycle would simplify this process significantly. OTs—nontraditional contractual instruments employed by the DOD to support research, development, and prototyping activities outside the FAR—already offer this kind of flexibility. Specifically designed to engage nontraditional defense contractors and accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies, OTs offer a highly flexible mechanism for structuring agreements that align with commercial business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exempting some key regulatory requirements, such as cost accounting system compliance and conventional intellectual property provisions, OTs reduce barriers to entry and facilitate broader participation from private sector innovators. Unlike standard procurement contracts, OTs are not subject to many of the statutory constraints typically governing federal acquisitions, including the Competition in Contracting Act. This legal flexibility enables the tailoring of agreements to the specific needs of emerging technologies and diverse development models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OTs frequently rely on RDT&amp;amp;E funding, their use is not limited to this appropriation category. Agreements may be structured as fixed-price, expenditure-based, or hybrid models, depending on the nature of the project and its anticipated outcomes. This adaptability makes OTs particularly well suited for advancing defense innovation through rapid, mission-driven procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later stages of the capability lifecycle are beyond the focus of this analysis. In the Ukrainian context, many systems are deployed directly to the front line after testing and procurement, often used in combat before reaching any formal sustainment phase. In the U.S. context, technologies that advance beyond prototyping can enter further iteration cycles where every new procurement will be conducted as a market transaction or transition into traditional sustainment processes. Both stages are characterized more by incremental adjustments and bureaucratic management than by rapid innovation. As such, these phases offer little insight into the dynamics of commercial integration or agile acquisition, which are the central focus of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital platforms enable real-time collaboration between military users and commercial innovators.&lt;/strong&gt; Real-time communication between military end users and commercial innovators is essential for developing effective unmanned systems. Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of building dedicated digital platforms that enable frontline soldiers to interact directly with civilian engineers throughout the entire capability development lifecycle. These platforms—such as Brave1 and DOT-Chain—facilitate early-stage problem identification, feedback exchange during prototyping, and post-deployment assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization streamlines testing, procurement, and feedback cycles.&lt;/strong&gt; By digitizing traditionally paper-based processes, Ukraine has streamlined the cycle of testing, procuring, and refining commercial technologies, particularly in the drone sector. Online procurement marketplaces allow unit commanders to directly select and acquire unmanned systems based on immediate needs. At the same time, digital feedback and reporting mechanisms ensure that warfighters can quickly report performance issues, request improvements, and influence future procurement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communication between commercial and defense worlds should go digital. It cannot be buried in paperwork or stalled by outdated rules. Soldiers on the front lines and engineers in hoodies need to be in real-time communication, solving urgent problems together. The future of defense depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, having already made significant success in digital governance, has begun extending this approach to its military. While it has not yet established a unified system of a capability delivery, it has launched initiatives to address immediate communication needs through digital tools. If these initiatives are eventually integrated into a coherent digital infrastructure, Ukraine could get a sophisticated, agile capability development system grounded in direct communication between its armed forces and its industrial base. The following section explores some of these emerging initiatives in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brave1 platform, launched soon after the full-scale invasion, was initially designed to foster collaboration between defense sector institutions and the private technology industry. One of its most distinctive features is its use of open calls, challenges, and hackathons to collect solutions from innovators in response to urgent battlefield needs. In close coordination with the MOD and other agencies, Brave1 aggregates frontline requirements and communicates them to industry as requests for prototype submissions. Whether through formal challenges or open solicitations, the platform serves as a centralized channel through which multiple startups and early-stage companies can submit technologies for evaluation and potential testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its role in requirements communication, Brave1 also functions as a national-level technology scouting tool. According to representatives interviewed by CSIS, the platform is aware of approximately 85 percent of all defense technology products currently developed in Ukraine. As such, Brave1 effectively bridges the gap between military demand and industrial supply by facilitating early engagement of emerging defense companies and maintaining real-time visibility into the innovation landscape. It embodies the principles discussed earlier in this report: digitalizing requirements formulation, accelerating prototyping, and enabling a continuous, structured dialogue between the military and the commercial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing and evaluation purposes, Ukraine has developed institutional mechanisms to support rapid, end user–driven testing of defense technologies, with a strong emphasis on digitalization and operational relevance. One key initiative is the Iron Range system, which combines a newly established government-owned testing range with a fully digital application and evaluation process. The system replaces paper-based procedures and allows manufacturers to quickly and regularly access state testing infrastructure and technical expertise. This enables commercial companies to test their technologies, refine them, and get approved for limited operational use within weeks rather than years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD is also launching the DOT-Chain Defense weapons marketplace operated by the Defense Procurement Agency. The marketplace represents a groundbreaking shift in Ukraine’s defense acquisition strategy, introducing a digital, decentralized system that empowers frontline units to select and procure the capabilities they need directly from domestic manufacturers. Launched with a pilot allocation of 1 billion UAH for 10 brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the system enables military units to independently order drones within their assigned budgets using a transparent digital platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units can browse available systems, place real-time and preproduction orders, leave reviews, and submit maintenance requests—bringing consumer-style flexibility and feedback mechanisms into defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supplier side, drone manufacturers upload product listings, update availability and production timelines, and deliver directly to the military, bypassing traditional intermediaries. The Defense Procurement Agency serves as the coordinating body, managing payments, monitoring deliveries, and analyzing user feedback to refine procurement and ensure accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 80 domestic drone producers already applying and more than 400 UAV models proposed, DOT-Chain is quickly becoming a central node in Ukraine’s wartime tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future plans include scaling the marketplace beyond drones to other weapon categories and integrating it with Army+, an app for digital services and reporting in the armed forces, to streamline logistics, maintenance, and frontline requests—further reinforcing Ukraine’s agile, demand-driven model of defense innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the marketplace, the ministry is developing a feature within Army+ to enable feedback collection on unmanned systems performance, the results from which will be shared with the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has taken important steps toward building a digital ecosystem to support the integration of commercial technologies into its military arsenal. However, this progress has not emerged from a unified, top-down strategy, rather, it has resulted from a series of ad hoc initiatives aimed at closing communication gaps and resolving specific bottlenecks as they arose. Therefore, these efforts are fragmented, developed and managed by different government stakeholders, making coordination and integration into a single platform challenging. This fragmentation reflects the broader realities of wartime innovation: the urgency of conflict has acted both as a catalyst for rapid action and a constraint on long-term planning and institutional coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a unified digital platform for defense innovation that spans the full capability lifecycle.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should develop or adapt a single user-friendly platform that enables real-time communication, submission of proposals, testing coordination, and progress tracking across all branches and agencies. This system should communicate problem-based requests for technical solutions, allow both solicited and unsolicited submissions, store testing and performance data in a centralized, searchable repository, and connect military needs with existing commercial solutions using AI-enabled tools. It should also serve as a hub for industry engagement events and integrate current tools like Digital OnRamp, Tradewinds, and Vulcan into a coherent, streamlined interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandate the use of this platform through formal policy and institutional incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure adoption, the DOD must implement a policy shift that requires the use of the unified digital platform for all commercial technology–related acquisition and communication. Without mandatory usage or alignment with success metrics, such tools risk becoming underutilized. Clear directives and institutional buy-in will be essential for building a genuinely connected innovation ecosystem across the military and the commercial sector. Incentives to motivate acquisition professionals and military personnel to use the platform could include integrating platform engagement into performance reviews, promotion criteria, and award recognitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ukraine, which was forced to build digital solutions under the pressures of wartime urgency, the United States has the advantage of peacetime stability, and with it, the time and resources to design a unified digital system for collaboration with the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure effective communication across the product development lifecycle and between the military and industry, the DOD should establish a single, modern digital platform with integrated communication channels, enabling real-time collaboration, information exchange between the industry and the military, as well as progress tracking. This platform, which could be newly developed or built upon existing systems, must serve the entire DOD and all services to prevent duplication of efforts and facilitate shared awareness of operational needs and available commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform should support the full capability development cycle for commercial technology and include several key functions. The basic workflow should function as shown in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G3s4i9V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Workflow Within a Single Digital Platform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, after military end-user needs are collected and articulated as problem statements—with only minimal technical requirements such as interoperability standards—these solicitations (e.g., CSOs) should be published in a dedicated section of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, commercial companies should be required to register and maintain individual secure profiles through which they can submit proposals, track their progress, and maintain confidential communication with acquisition officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, all submitted solutions should be stored in a centralized database, updated in real time with each proposal’s status and testing outcomes. This database must be accessible across the DOD, allowing acquisition professionals and end users to search existing submissions, evaluate prior testing results, and identify solutions that could satisfy new requirements without duplicating development efforts. Military users should be able to view solution specifications, integration histories, and feedback from other units to inform purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies should likewise have visibility into their performance records with DOD customers, enabling them to build business pipelines based on demonstrated capability delivery. The platform should incorporate intelligent search functions, including AI-enabled matching tools, to connect military needs with existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, companies should be able to independently register and present unsolicited solutions, broadening the pool of available technologies. These entries would be marked as “not yet tested” but would allow the DOD to quickly identify promising innovations for future pilot programs or evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the platform should also centralize information about industry engagement events—such as industry days, hackathons, and technology challenges—facilitating broader participation from military units facing similar operational challenges and encouraging collective problem-solving efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this platform would serve as a digital backbone for continuous communication between the military and the commercial sector across the entire product development lifecycle. It would reduce duplication, consolidate efforts and resources, and enhance coordination in areas such as training, logistics, and capability deployment, thus supporting broader doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities—or DOTMLPF—integration and modernization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few initiatives in the DOD that partially align with the vision described above. These digital platforms are an effort to make it easier and faster for military organizations to connect with commercial technology providers. These tools help match military needs with innovative solutions from the private sector, streamlining the way new capabilities are discovered, tested, and acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital OnRamp, built by the DIU, uses AI to match plain-language descriptions of defense needs with relevant commercial technologies. Tradewinds Solutions Marketplace, managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, offers a searchable library of vetted, ready-to-contract solution videos from industry and academia. Vulcan, sponsored by U.S. Special Operations Command, acts as a national security-focused scouting platform that helps identify and evaluate promising technologies. Together, these and other platforms represent a growing effort to modernize defense acquisition by opening the door to faster, more direct engagement with commercial innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, each of these platforms is seeing a limited use and has not yet become the go-to place where the military and industry communicate and work together. To change that, there needs to be a policy shift that requires communication and business processes to go through a single platform. People are rarely willing to change how they work unless it is either required or clearly tied to their success—so making the use of such a platform mandatory is key to building a truly connected and effective system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-for-the-department-of-defense&quot;&gt;Next Steps for the Department of Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a commercial-first approach for acquiring unmanned systems—using these rapidly evolving technologies as a proving ground for broader acquisition reform.&lt;/strong&gt; These technologies are advancing fastest in the commercial sector, where innovation cycles are shorter and new capabilities emerge continuously. Given the strategic importance of AI and autonomy to future warfare, and the pace at which these technologies are being developed outside traditional defense channels, it is critical for the DOD to prioritize their acquisition directly from commercial providers. This will allow the military to test new acquisition models that can later be scaled across other capability areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a dedicated, flexible budget for unmanned systems that spans the full capability lifecycle without separation into colors of money and is not constrained by traditional appropriations.&lt;/strong&gt; To accelerate the acquisition and fielding of unmanned systems, the DOD should create a separate budget line that can be used across research, development, procurement, and sustainment phases. This funding pool should be decoupled from rigid, predefined requirements and made readily available for acquiring mature, commercially developed technologies. By consolidating narrow budget categories into a larger mission-aligned fund, the DOD would gain the flexibility to quickly procure and iterate on unmanned systems based on evolving operational needs. This approach would reduce administrative delays, enable continuous upgrades, and reflect the real-world pace of technology development and battlefield demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize funding for unmanned systems around broad mission areas, not narrow, preset requirements, to enable faster problem-solving and support commercial innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; This shift would allow military units to address real-time operational challenges by purchasing available commercial technologies rather than waiting for lengthy procurement cycles tied to outdated or overly specific requirements. By focusing on mission outcomes rather than predefined technical specifications, the DOD can more easily integrate nontraditional vendors, accelerate adoption of emerging capabilities like drones and AI systems, and create incentives for private sector R&amp;amp;D investment. This more flexible approach also ensures that acquisition aligns with the dynamic nature of modern conflict, where needs evolve rapidly and speed of adaptation can determine battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a separate acquisition track for unmanned systems that prioritizes off-the-shelf procurement at high maturity levels, distinct from conventional platforms multiyear acquisition.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike conventional acquisition programs—which fund technology maturation and follow lengthy development and oversight processes—this commercial-first pathway would focus on procuring off-the-shelf or near-ready unmanned systems using a dedicated budget with readily available funds. This approach would enable rapid fielding of capabilities without waiting for traditional program timelines and allow the military to buy what it needs now, rather than investing years and resources into maturing technologies that already exist on the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower entry barriers for nontraditional vendors by removing noncritical security requirements in early testing and fielding of unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive clearance and facility security demands—such as requiring personnel and production sites to meet strict security standards, cybersecurity checks, and components’ origin control—pose a major obstacle for small startups, which often lack the resources to navigate this complex process. For companies with often fewer than ten employees, meeting these requirements can delay or block access to pilot opportunities altogether. Easing these constraints is a critical first step, such as piloting and testing, toward opening the defense market to commercial-first solutions and enabling faster testing and adoption of innovative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure rapid access to testing infrastructure and enable trials in conditions that closely replicate real operational environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Current processes in the United States often require six months to a year—or more—for companies to gain access to military testing ranges. This delay risks making technologies obsolete before they are even evaluated, especially in fast-moving fields like AI, autonomy, and electronic warfare. Moreover, existing U.S. testing environments are heavily constrained by domestic regulations, limiting the realism of trials. For example, restrictions on frequency use and jamming often prevent the simulation of real-world threats, such as those involving non-GPS satellite systems like GLONASS. To address this, the DOD should either reform outdated regulatory barriers to enable more realistic domestic testing or consider outsourcing evaluation to allied nations like Ukraine, where battlefield-like conditions and relevant threats can be more accurately simulated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift cost evaluation approach from unit price to mission-based value, aligning more closely with the price-per-mission model used by Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than focusing solely on the upfront cost of individual platforms or systems, the DOD should assess the overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of a technology in the context of its operational impact. Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that low-cost, commercially available systems—such as FPV drones or AI-enabled platforms—can deliver disproportionate battlefield value when judged by their ability to complete specific missions rather than their unit cost. This shift in perspective encourages the adoption of agile, scalable, and often lower-cost solutions that may not meet traditional procurement benchmarks but offer significant advantages in real-world operations. By focusing on price per mission, the DOD can make smarter investments, reward functional performance, and accelerate the integration of commercially developed capabilities that deliver tangible impact on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create dedicated units within each service to help testing and evaluation of new technologies in real operational settings and by end users.&lt;/strong&gt; To make testing more effective and relevant, these activities should be done by the actual end users within the services. Organizations such as DIU are still seen as outsiders and do not control service-level budgets. Instead, the services themselves should set up permanent innovation units with access to flexible funding for commercial-first capabilities, allowing them to test commercial technologies, evaluate performance in real-world conditions, and buy what works directly and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train and test AI-enabled autonomy software for unmanned systems in operationally relevant environments to perform effectively.&lt;/strong&gt; For any AI system to work properly, it must be built on data that reflects the realities of its intended use. Autonomous unmanned systems need exposure to the actual terrain, enemy equipment, and countermeasures to navigate accurately and detect threats. Similarly, AI platforms designed for analyzing open-source intelligence must be able to recognize patterns, narratives, and behaviors specific to a country’s language, media environment, and population. Without this contextual training, AI systems risk underperforming or producing misleading results in real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a unified digital platform to manage end-to-end collaboration with the commercial sector.&lt;/strong&gt; This platform should consolidate functions currently spread across multiple tools and enable military users to communicate their needs as operational problems to the industry and allow commercial companies to submit, track, and update their proposals through secure profiles. A shared, searchable database would ensure visibility into submitted solutions, testing outcomes, and prior integration results—helping avoid duplication and speeding up adoption. The platform should incorporate AI-enabled search to match military needs with relevant technologies. By establishing this digital backbone and making its use mandatory in acquisition from the commercial sector, the DOD can enhance coordination, improve acquisition efficiency, and support long-term modernization across the force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is failing to leverage the full potential of the U.S. commercial sector—particularly in unmanned systems and AI-enabled software, where the U.S. technology companies are global leaders. As warfare becomes increasingly software-driven, AI will be central to enabling next-generation capabilities such as autonomous systems and unmanned platforms. These technologies are advancing rapidly in the commercial domain and must be integrated into defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully harness this potential, the DOD must make three critical changes: (1) create a separate budget which is not be tied to rigid requirements and line items for procuring, testing, fielding, and iterating commercial technologies at speed, (2) remove outdated and excessive security and classification barriers that currently exclude nontraditional vendors and favor only large defense contractors, and (3) build modern, digital communication channels that allow real-time collaboration between commercial innovators and military end users. Together, these steps would lay the foundation for a true commercial-first acquisition model capable of keeping the U.S. military on the leading edge of technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shift will take time, but there is precedent—the evolution of the U.S. space sector. For decades, NASA led a government-only model of space exploration and providing services for national security agencies. But over time, commercial companies like SpaceX, Maxar, and Planet Labs emerged and were given the opportunity—and funding—to demonstrate their value. Today, two parallel systems coexist, with the commercial sector proving to be not only cost-effective but often more agile and operationally capable. The DOD can take a similar path with unmanned systems, gradually integrating a commercial-first model alongside traditional acquisition and allowing results to speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of this approach in Ukraine lies in the dual-track systems that coexist alongside and complement one another. By embracing this shift, the department can not only unlock the full potential of U.S. innovation but also build a defense ecosystem that is better prepared for the demands of modern warfare. The time to act is now—while the United States still has the advantage of peace, unmatched technological leadership, and the resources to lead this transformation on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;黃子悅鄒家成質疑顛覆與暴動罪分期執行-總刑期具壓毀性&quot;&gt;黃子悅鄒家成質疑顛覆與暴動罪分期執行 總刑期具壓毀性&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QkhafwN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。11人不服定罪及刑期上訴，認罪的黃子悅提刑期上訴。案件今（17日）在西九龍法院（暫代高院上訴庭）繼續上訴聆訊。上訴方就刑罰上訴方面陳詞，梁國雄、林卓廷和黃碧雲均投訴原審法官錯誤地歸類他們為「積極參與者」，導致量刑起點過重；另外，梁國雄和林卓廷稱過去長期服務社會，卻未能獲得扣減；何啟明和陳志全更力陳他們服務社會的時間較長，理應比其他服務時間較短的被告獲得更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃子悅和鄒家成均另涉暴動案而判監，二人均投訴兩案刑罰完全分期執行，導致總刑期具壓毀性（crushing）。其中鄒家成指，原審法官下令本案刑期與7.1立法會暴動案的5年1個月15天完全分期執行，以致兩案的總刑期達到12年10個月15天，接近13年，這樣的刑罰對於剛從大學畢業、未有任何社會經驗的鄒而言，是具有壓毀性（crushing）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的11名被告包括：鄒家成（判囚7年9個月）、吳政亨（判囚7年3個月）、何桂藍（判囚7年）、林卓廷（判囚6年9個月）、余慧明（判囚6年9個月）、梁國雄（判囚6年9個月）、何啟明（判囚6年7個月）、黃碧雲（判囚6年半）、楊雪盈（判囚6年半）、鄭達鴻（判囚6年半）及陳志全（判囚6年半）。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表包括：副刑事檢控專員周天行、高級助理刑事檢控專員劉德偉、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋、高級檢控官吳加悅、徐倩姿和莊文欣等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻黨友譚文豪路線更激進-惟原審法官一律以7年作量刑起點&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻：黨友譚文豪路線更激進 惟原審法官一律以7年作量刑起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師潘熙代表鄭達鴻指，原審法官未有恰當地區分各名被告的罪責、案中角色和參與程度，相比起鄭達鴻，同屬公民黨的譚文豪在黨內的角色較重要，為時任立法會議員，甚至採取更加激進的路線，可是原審法官卻一律採用7年作為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官接納鄭達鴻犯案是因為被人誤導，予以扣減3個月，但強調這是一個有力的減刑因素，理應獲得較低的量刑起點，或者更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，鄭不是純粹對法律無知，以致錯誤地相信涉案謀劃是合法，他甚至研究過《基本法》，但是仍然被誤導，法庭在這項因素上應該扣減多於3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄錯誤地被歸類為積極參與者長期服務社會應獲扣減&quot;&gt;梁國雄：錯誤地被歸類為「積極參與者」、長期服務社會應獲扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙接著代表梁國雄陳詞，同樣指原審以監禁7年作量刑起點是明顯過重及原則上犯錯。潘指，原審法官錯誤地將梁歸類為「積極參與者」；又指法庭已裁定社民連於2020年6月才開始轉變立場，若果法庭恰當地評估梁的參與程度、案中角色和罪責，相比起其他一開始便立場堅定的同案被告，梁國雄的罪責較輕微和低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官聲稱梁在過往的案件中曾因為長期服務社會而獲得減刑，因此拒絕在本案因為相同理由而減刑，潘認為是原則上犯錯。潘強調，梁過往長期服務社會，構成其個人背景和特質，理應在每一宗案件獲得這方面的扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈不會否決財案-相反熱衷爭取政府撥款&quot;&gt;楊雪盈：不會否決財案 相反熱衷爭取政府撥款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良指，本案的謀劃性質是非暴力，並且嘗試就未來發生的事情達成協議，例如若果能夠達到「35+」的話，他們便會同意在議會裡做一些事情，這與其他類型的謀劃有所不同。張續指，初選的參與者橫跨不同政治光譜，各人有不同的想法、從政經驗、願景和期望；而且計劃受著事件發展的影響，例如在過程中香港社會變遷、選民的最終決定等等，因此他們不會知道接著會發生什麼事。由此可見，涉案謀劃從誕生直至最終結果，有一定程度的距離。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張籲法庭考慮案件的嚴重程度，對國家安全和整體社會帶來的危害到底有多少迫切性，加上被告們在陽光之下行事、公開透明，有別於在「黑箱」裡作案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，楊雪盈從沒有將否決財案與「五大訴求」捆綁在一起，也沒有任何證據顯示她在口頭上或書面上表明會否決財案，可見她在整個計劃中扮演著邊緣的角色。張又指，趙家賢曾引述楊稱：「戴耀廷又有啲佢嘅諗法又帶出嚟㗎啦，咪由佢講吓先囉，但即係選到入立法會裡面嘅時候，係每個議員自主行使個權力㗎嘛！」，可見楊是涉案謀劃的局外人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，趙家賢曾供稱楊在區議會生涯中，熱衷於爭取政府撥款，並推動將政府撥款用於她倡議的文化及改善民生政策，所以她不會否決財政預算案，相反只會要求政府增加撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全及何啟明長期服務社會-理應獲得更多扣減&quot;&gt;陳志全及何啟明：長期服務社會 理應獲得更多扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明和陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，原審法官一律對「積極參與者」的被告採用7年為量刑起點，但他認為「積極參與者」之中較低參與程度的被告，其量刑起點應該進一步下調。原審法官理應區分不同被告的參與程度。馬維騉進一步指，對於較低參與程度的被告，量刑起點應該定於5至6年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，原審法官判刑時理應考慮《基本法》第50至53條的合憲性，從而考慮被告真誠、但錯誤地相信涉案謀劃是合法的，強調這因素能夠減低被告的道德罪責。馬又指，法官應該根據案中事實而決定對「錯誤信念」給予多少減刑比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬另指，何啟明擔任區議員約6年，獲給予2個月扣減，可是有的被告在2020年才開始擔任區議員，直至案發時任期只過了6個月，卻同樣獲得2個月扣減。馬認為何啟明不只服務時間較長，更致力服務基層和有需要的市民，理應獲得更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BaIp4hv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳志全，馬指原審法官只給予3個月扣減，未能對陳長期服務的質量給予恰當比重。陳被視為最勤力的立法會議員，甚至獲立法會主席梁君彥讚賞，指陳的言之有物及準備充足，亦有政府官員為陳撰寫求情信。馬強調，陳過往與政府和建制派攜手合作，勤力地履行議員職責，有良好往績，並服務了8年，理應值得比3個月更多的扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲不應被歸類為積極參與者-理應被判處3年或以下&quot;&gt;黃碧雲：不應被歸類為「積極參與者」 理應被判處3年或以下&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文指，原審法官對案中「積極參與者」採用3至10年為起點，因此大部份被告均採用7年為起點，惟法庭量刑時應該考慮各人的犯案角色，以及涉案計劃所預期的後果。當中尤以犯案角色為較重要因素，因預期後果是非常遙遠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，「35+」在某些初選參與者眼中只是一句口號、一個亮眼的願景，但是現實上要達至「35+」，除了要在地方選區取得大多數議席之外，還需要在功能組別的35席之中取得13席，然而在初選計劃中，功能組別中除了衛生服務界和「超區」有初選之外，便沒有任何其他界別有舉辦初選，正如第一控方證人區諾軒所稱，「35+」是不可能達成。因此，達成「35+」然後否決財案、癱瘓政府運作，是幾近不可能，惟原審法官未有予以充份考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林卓廷和黃碧雲均來自民主黨、是傳統泛民，其中黃更擔任立法議員達8年，可是二人被指與民主黨立場捆綁，因而被定罪。沈強調，二人從沒做任何事去鼓吹否決財案，反指二人的角色被動，沒有出席過初選協調會議，對涉案謀劃不感興趣，幾乎是沉默的一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林和黃不應被歸類為「積極參與者」，理應被判處3年或以下，可是原審法官卻採用7年為量刑起點，與其他激進的參與者相同，是原則上犯錯。沈並補充，若然上訴庭不同意判處二人3年或以下，判處約4年也是公道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷服務社會至少8年-理應獲扣減&quot;&gt;林卓廷：服務社會至少8年 理應獲扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林卓廷，沈指判刑的時候，林只有一項刑事定罪紀錄，惟原審法官的量刑是基於林有4項定罪紀錄，是犯了錯誤。若果原審法官接受林只有一項定罪紀錄，便會進一步扣減刑期，因定罪紀錄關乎個人特質。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林卓廷服務社會至少8年，有良好的往績和聲譽，可是原審法官卻未有就此給予3個月扣減，沈指林理應獲得這3個月扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成原審判兩案分期執行-致總刑期接近13年-具壓毀性&quot;&gt;鄒家成：原審判兩案分期執行 致總刑期接近13年 具壓毀性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭指，本案判刑的時候，鄒有兩項刑事定罪紀錄，其中一項為「將未經授權的物品攜離監獄」罪，是相對輕微的控罪，原審被判囚3天，其後經上訴獲撤銷監禁刑罰，改判罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，原審法官基於鄒是「墨落無悔」聯署聲明的發起人之一，而判處較重刑期，是忘記了「墨落無悔」是在《國安法》實施之前發生，亦非控罪時段範圍之內。《國安法》生效之後，有關行為才變為有罪，然而原審法官未有重視《國安法》第五條的規定：「法律沒有規定為犯罪行為的，不得定罪處刑」，以致判處了一個有追溯力的刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，原審法官將鄒歸類為「積極參與者」，以7年為量刑起點，其後再考慮鄒是「墨落無悔」發起人之一，將量刑起點上調至8年，構成「雙重計算（double counting）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於刑罰整體性，關指原審法官下令本案刑期與7.1立法會暴動案的5年1個月15天完全分期執行，以致鄒兩案的總刑期達到12年10個月15天，接近13年，這樣的刑罰對於剛從大學畢業、未有任何社會經驗的鄒而言，是具有壓毀性（crushing），然而原審法官卻未有充份考慮。關指，兩案部份刑期同期執行，已足夠反映鄒在兩案之中的罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明參與初選非為個人利益&quot;&gt;余慧明：參與初選非為個人利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師彭耀鴻代表余慧明指，余的判刑明顯地過重，原審法官將余與其他「積極參與者」均無差別地採用7年為量刑起點，而未有區別各位「積極參與者」的角色、參與程度和罪責的分別。彭強調，余未曾出席初選協議會議，亦從沒擔任更積極的角色。彭又引述案例指出，若然法庭未有裁定串謀計劃實際上成功執行，量刑應該大幅降低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uxeOPwr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭並指，余參與初選並非為了個人利益，然而這一點未有反映在原審的判刑中。彭解釋，涉案謀劃並非為了推翻當時的特區政府，而是跟據《基本法》下的制度行事，余參與初選只是想為特區政府帶來改變，因她真誠地相信當時的特區政府對民意充耳不聞。再者，若果主流民意抱持相同想法，又若果政府依然我行我素、拒絕回應民意，余才會繼續參與涉案謀劃。彭強調，余並非為了個人利益，而是為了香港人的福祉；她的信念是對還是錯，或者是否實際上假扮爭取市民福祉，並不是法庭需要研究的範疇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃子悅原審法官未下令本案與暴動案刑期同期執行-未能恰當地評估刑罰整體性&quot;&gt;黃子悅：原審法官未下令本案與暴動案刑期同期執行 未能恰當地評估刑罰整體性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪的黃子悅只提出刑罰上訴，代表她的大律師郭子丰指，原審法官未能恰當地考慮刑罰整體性。在本案判刑之前，黃因為理大暴動案而被判監禁37個月，其時正在服刑，她其後因為本案被判監禁4年5個月（53個月），惟原審法官未有下令兩案刑期任何部份同期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭指，黃是一名積極的年輕女性，她積極地參與義工活動，深度地參與有關社會公義的工作，縱使在獄中仍然從不間斷地學習。若果原審法官恰當地評估刑罰整體性的話，便會知道兩案分期執行的話總刑期會是7年6個月，這等同於採用11年作量刑起點，是過份地壓毀性（unduly crushing）。郭冀上訴庭考慮暴動案和本案並非兩個完全獨立的事件，黃在兩案中的罪責有所重疊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司被告涉違背公職及公眾信任-長期服務社會的減刑因素應佔最小比重&quot;&gt;律政司：被告涉違背公職及公眾信任 長期服務社會的減刑因素應佔最小比重&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋回應指，本案牽涉的是一個前所未見的串謀計劃，有機會對香港造成毀滅性的危機，原審法官完全有正當理由採用較高的量刑，又指原審法官之所以對吳政亨和鄒家成採用8年為量刑起點，是因為二人在案中角色較重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於林卓廷一方投訴未能獲得長期服務社會的扣減，羅天瑋則反駁指，原審法官量刑時已考慮了被告長期服務社會，又指被告的行為牽涉違背公職以及公眾的信任，即使法庭將長期服務社會這因素納入考慮，也只能佔最小的比重。羅重申原審法庭的判刑理由完全正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文最後回應，指他談及長期服務社會的減刑因素時，重點不在於法庭應給予多少比重，而是原審法官對不同被告有差別對待，黃碧雲與林卓廷均長期擔任立法會議員，黃獲得扣減3個月，但林卻未能同樣獲得同樣待遇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首席法官潘兆初聽畢雙方陳詞後，稱基於本案的複雜性，牽涉定罪上訴、刑罰上訴及案件呈述上訴，將保留判決，並會在9個月內宣判。&lt;/p&gt;

To prevail in the era of agentic warfare, the U.S. requires smarter, faster command structures including Networked, Relational, and Adaptive models to outpace China and seize the advantage at machine speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ 200-year-old “Napoleonic” staff system is no longer fast enough for an era in which artificial intelligence (AI) agents can sense, decide, and act in milliseconds. This report, produced by the CSIS Futures Lab, explores how the Department of Defense (DOD) can replace today’s industrial-age military staff organizations with smaller, nimbler, AI-enabled command elements able to out-cycle peer adversaries such as China. The United States cannot out-innovate authoritarian rivals with nineteenth-century staff designs. Fielding adaptive, AI-enabled staffs—backed by robust networks, skilled people, and relentless experimentation—will let U.S. forces think and act faster than any adversary, preserving decision superiority in twenty-first-century conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-it-matters&quot;&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic warfare is here.&lt;/strong&gt; While AI agents have been a reality for decades, they are now able to automate intelligence fusion, refine threat models, and recommend courses of action, compressing decision timelines from days to minutes. Without new staff designs, U.S. commanders will lose the race for decision superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is optimizing its forces to attack U.S. critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; People’s Liberation Army (PLA) doctrine aims to disrupt U.S. decision networks by winning the information high ground and paralyzing the United States through a mix of cyber, electronic, and long-range strikes; staffs that are not distributed and capable of dynamic reconstitution will be ineffective in combat, if not destroyed outright in the opening salvo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical baseline:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers reviewed divergent concepts of how people interact with machines and form knowledge networks to provide options for rethinking the staff outside of the traditional military literature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed human-machine method:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers combined retrieval-augmented large-language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) with three workshops of experienced officers to generate and stress-test alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real PLA scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt; Each staff concept was run against three demanding missions drawn from Chinese doctrine—a joint blockade, a joint firepower strike, and a joint landing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ixdO7fZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Three Agentic Staff Options Examined&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive wins.&lt;/strong&gt; Across all models and scenarios, the Adaptive Staff scored highest and showed the greatest resilience to PLA system disruption tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People still matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Success hinges on a new cadre of officers fluent in AI orchestration, able to audit algorithmic recommendations, and ready to assume control when networks degrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tempo beats mass.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller, feedback-driven staffs consistently generated more viable options faster than larger legacy organizations, turning speed into a surrogate for force size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-challenges&quot;&gt;Strategic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no future for AI agents and new staff organizations unless the U.S. military invests in more computational infrastructure to power command decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordination at Machine Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Decentralized agents can fragment efforts if a common command logic is absent, creating a need for deeper human expertise on smaller agentic staffs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-Resilient Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; AI dependence widens the PLA’s attack surface unless zero-trust, deception-resistant architectures are baked in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Capital:&lt;/strong&gt; Officers must learn AI literacy, data visualization, and enough basic statistics and computer science to understand machine-generated insights, not just traditional staff processes rooted in historical cases and strategic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priority-recommendations-for-congress-the-dod-and-the-services&quot;&gt;Priority Recommendations for Congress, the DOD, and the Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a multiyear experimentation campaign.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct the Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO) to run iterative wargames, building on the Global Information Dominance Experiment (GIDE), that pit competing staff designs against common threat scenarios, with mandated annual reports to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close the compute gap.&lt;/strong&gt; Fund a classified, distributed high-performance cloud and edge architecture able to host AI agents during contested operations; commission an independent study to size the requirement and options to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerate AI-ready professional military education.&lt;/strong&gt; Embed explainable AI, agent orchestration, and prompt engineering modules across professional military education and create fast-track “AI facilitator” qualifications for mid-grade officers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harden decision networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Resource redundant communications, adversarial learning defenses, and audit trails that trace how agents reach recommendations, enabling commanders to trust—but verify—machine advice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutionalize rapid lessons learned.&lt;/strong&gt; Pair every major exercise with data pipelines that retrain agents and update tactics in weeks, not years; require synthetic data from AI-driven simulations to feed this loop continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-outlook&quot;&gt;Long-Term Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational art would combine human creativity and judgment with AI agents fusing data and making predictions.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller staffs have the potential to out-cycle legacy military organizations, generating tempo and giving commanders more time to think beyond the forward line of troops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous agentic wargames and simulations would make war plans more adaptive and relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller staffs could run iterated simulations using AI agents that refine the DOD’s ability to deter a global collection of authoritarian regimes and fight dispersed networks of combined joint task forces across multiple scenarios. These continuous games, guided by AI agents, would drive human and machine learning while identifying new deterrence options and operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New curriculum would revolutionize professional military education.&lt;/strong&gt; Officers should study historical campaigns alongside seminars on data science, modern weapon systems, and AI fundamentals to understand how to fight alongside AI agents fusing information. Schools could then capture data and support fine-tuning these agents through techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes, the staff organizations of militaries around the world today would be recognizable to French military legend Napoleon Bonaparte. While there are enduring aspects of warfare, it is hard to imagine that eighteenth-century staff structures are optimal for twenty-first-century warfare. The question is: What are the alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores how advances in AI are changing strategy and statecraft. This study combines leading network relational theories with the emerging agentic artificial intelligence capabilities for three possible agentic military staff structures. It outlines the results of several wargames that applied these three structures to possible crisis and conflict scenarios to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the staff options. This report complements ongoing research programs in the CSIS Futures Lab and a broader intellectual community that sees bundles of algorithms and distributed mosaic networks as the defining trend changing warfare. As new applications diffuse across the national security enterprise, the question is no longer if AI will change war, but how, and which state using it will emerge as the leading military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That race will be decided by a mix of infrastructure investments, espionage and counterespionage, and a willingness to experiment with how military organizations conduct planning and operations. While analysis abounds on the race between China and United States to build the computational infrastructure required to support further advances in AI and the game in the shadows to steal and protect intellectual property, less attention has been paid to how to structure a military staff for a new era of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Napoleonic staff model has served for over 200 years, its end is near, owing to the rise of agentic warfare, a new paradigm in military competition where AI agents operate alongside human commanders to accelerate decisionmaking and outpace adversaries. As the speed and complexity of modern conflict surpasses human cognitive limits, traditional industrial-age staff structures struggle to keep pace. Agentic warfare distributes autonomous AI agents across land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains and joint functions, enabling them to continuously collect intelligence, anticipate adversary intent, and recommend adaptive courses of action in real time. These AI agents are meant not to replace human judgment but to enhance it, compressing decision timelines from days to minutes and allowing commanders to act faster and with greater precision. By integrating AI at the tactical and operational levels, agentic warfare reshapes the character of operational art, ensuring U.S. forces maintain decision superiority in twenty-first-century battlespaces. However, realizing this vision requires a fundamental shift from hierarchical staff structures to networked, AI-enabled command architectures designed for speed, adaptability, and real-time operational synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rethinking this legacy staff structure in view of leading network relational theorists results in three distinct options for an AI-enabled agentic staff of the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;Networked Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that retains the functional focus of the current staff structure but applies AI agents to those functional areas for better and faster output;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;Relational Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that aligns functionally trained AI agents into teams (termed “netdoms”) that are tasked and managed by cross-functionally–focused humans (termed “switchers”); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that aligns on the iterative decisionmaking process of a staff and organizes humans to shepherd agents through that process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1-the-networked-staff&quot;&gt;Option 1: The Networked Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the tenets of actor-network theory, this decentralized staff architecture fuses human and nonhuman actors (e.g., AI agents, sensors, and data-driven tools) into an integrated web of capabilities that shapes, refines, and executes decisions in real time. This network is functional, with smaller staff elements working through functional agents to fuse data. In effect, each staff section has its own AI agent leading to independent intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, command and control, force protection, logistics, and information nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oBq1FJZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Networked Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the Networked Staff model, based on Bruno Latour’s concept of actants, smaller staff elements work through functional agents ingesting data including live updates, doctrine, history, and military theory. These functional agents also adjudicate inputs from other functional agents. For example, a small G2 team interacts with its functional agent to develop possible enemy courses of action. This data is fed directly to the fires agent, which assesses possible target areas of interest based on named areas of interest, to start developing a concept of fires and cross-checking it against inventories of munitions to create notional essential fire support tasks and even attack guidance matrices. The logic is functional, preserving elements of the legacy staff system, but potentially brittle if the links between functional agents are broken. Humans serve as expert reviewers of agentic inferences offered to commanders. This provides a human-in-the-loop check, but could slow data flows.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reorient legacy staffs to a networked structure, DOD leaders should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in computational infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Build a robust backbone of high-performance computing, data storage, and networking on classified networks to seamlessly integrate AI agents into each node for real-time analysis and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train and integrate AI agents.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop, refine, and deploy machine learning models that empower distributed decisionmaking, ensuring AI-driven insights are woven throughout the staff network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build human capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Equip the radically reduced number of people in the network (“super-empowered personnel”) with the higher-order synthesis skills to operate in a decentralized, AI-driven environment—encompassing data analysis, AI systems operation, and collaborative decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish new procedures.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop clear protocols for data sharing, communication, and decentralized planning that harness AI-driven inputs and maintain coherent, agile operations in a setting likely to see fewer staff layers between the battlefield and the commander.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2-the-relational-staff&quot;&gt;Option 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on relational sociology, this staff design treats the military organization as a dynamic web of relationships shaping planning and operations. These webs are effectively clusters of existing staff functions that interact independent of humans. The resulting netdom—inspired by Harrison White’s sociological theory of networks—becomes its own staff, where AI agents tailor recommendations and plans based on discrete datasets. Multiple netdoms support the commander and command element, or human switchers, allowing them to see competing perspectives in near real time. The switchers bridge these netdoms, forging critical links and fostering negotiation among alternatives. This model has fewer people than the Networked Staff model and has a different AI agent configuration as well as a different role for humans in decisionmaking. In a Relational Staff, human commanders adjudicate among competing netdoms, whereas in the networked model above, functional staff play a larger role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L97kbo3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the Relational Staff model, based on Harrison White’s concept of actants, a human switcher—likely the commander—evaluates different options generated by competing clusters of functional agents aligned with traditional staff sections. Each of these netdoms runs entire planning cycles within seconds and can be tuned (i.e., temperature) to adjust variance. The netdoms could even be aligned, based on the commander with his/her personal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a set of references ranging from historical cases to a treatise on how they envision fighting their unit, using methods like RAG. As a result, the commander/command element has competing agentic planning teams (i.e., netdoms) allowing them to always explore alternative options and even red team AI agentic clusters using other netdoms. Return to the intelligence fires example: The commander has one netdom develop a course of action based on its best judgment and his desire to conduct an area defense in which the netdom will explore how to combine canalizing terrain with indirect fires to prioritize engagement area development and attrition as the enemy moves through the battlespace. He tasks the other AI agent to focus on a preemptive fires-based spoiling attack. The different course of action (COA) concepts, each developed by the command element, allow the commander to more rapidly reach a decision and issue warning orders to subordinate formations. The logic is command-centric and turns legacy staff sections into AI agents. It is brittle at the point of the commander. If the leader does not have the necessary depth of military experience, education, and judgement, they will struggle to ask the netdoms the right questions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to investments in computational infrastructure, the DOD should implement the following recommendations to reorient legacy staffs to a relational structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map the organizational web.&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct a thorough network analysis to uncover existing relationships, clusters, and information flows, laying the groundwork for distinct netdoms aligned with functional communities of practice (e.g., command and control, information, fire, maneuver, intelligence, protection, and sustainment).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand up functional netdoms.&lt;/strong&gt; Create specialized nodes (e.g., operations, intelligence, and logistics) where AI agents recursively iterate among themselves to provide tailored insights, ensuring each community generates unique perspectives while remaining interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train human switchers.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop leaders adept at bridging netdoms, facilitating negotiations, and fostering collaborative problem-solving across diverse communities and AI-driven analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed AI agents in each community.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate machine learning tools at the netdom level to process relational data, refine strategies, and deliver real-time recommendations that spark cross-domain synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3-the-adaptive-staff&quot;&gt;Option 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Andrew Abbott’s approach to adaptive planning, this staff model is built around a series of interconnected processes (e.g., planning, execution, and assessment) that continuously adjust to shifting operational realities but are rooted in a deeper context connected to military history and theory. AI agents embedded within each process furnish real-time data and insights, while human facilitators ensure alignment with higher-level objectives. This fusion of machine-driven analysis and human oversight enables a fluid, iterative decision cycle that rapidly evolves with changing circumstances. The defining feature that differentiates the model from the network and relational models is the reliance on feedback loops that help human staff and commanders adapt their plans to changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mHSYchR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Adaptive Staff model is based on Andrew Abbott’s insights about non-linear dynamics governing how people create knowledge. In this perspective, the entire planning and operations process is seen as an agent-informed evolutionary system. There is still a small staff element, albeit smaller than the Networked Staff model. This staff interacts with a planning agent, which integrates data on doctrine, lessons learned, history, and military theory. These planning agents, based on staff prompting, inform operations agents. Like in the netdom concept, the operations agents work at a pure agentic level across functional agents, providing feedback that adjusts the planning agents’ output to provide more refined, up-to-date options for the commander. This allows the commander to steer the staff, creating in effect two key feedback loops: (1) human-agent and (2) agentic. The result is an accelerated decisionmaking process that makes planning and operations more tightly coupled. Decisions still reside in human judgment but adjust to rapid changes in the environment mediated by agentic insights. Back to the example, the commander tasks the staff to develop a defensive plan along a ridgeline and river (i.e., tie into terrain). The staff works through the planning agent, adding insights from historical cases and defensive tactics, to update possible courses of action, which the operations agent adjusts based on readiness, logistics, and estimates of enemy avenues of approach. The feedback loops are the defining feature, balancing human-agent interaction and supporting more rapid adjustments to changing context. This aligns the approach most with perspectives that see war on a complex, nonlinear system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to investments in computational infrastructure, to adopt an adaptive structure, the DOD should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operationalize interconnected processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Structure planning, execution, and assessment as continuous loops that feed into each other, ensuring real-time synchronization among all phases of an operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed AI-driven analytics.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate AI agents into each process to provide near-instant insights, detect emerging patterns, and support iterative decisionmaking under fluid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower human facilitators.&lt;/strong&gt; Train staff to guide, validate, and interpret AI recommendations across processes, keeping the overall mission in focus while harnessing data-driven inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate continuous feedback loops.&lt;/strong&gt; Implement real-time tracking and assessment tools that automatically inform subsequent planning cycles, allowing for seamless course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate an iterative mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; Foster a culture of adaptive thinking and rapid learning, encouraging experimentation and flexible responses to evolving operational realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three options offers a viable path into the future and a guide for how to rethink everything from the structure of current military staffs to how to educate future leaders. While the purpose of this report is to define pathways toward agentic warfare, the Adaptive Staff emerged as the preferred option according to model-based evaluation. When three foundational models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—were tasked with evaluating each of the three options against a mix of PLA campaigns, the consensus choice was the Adaptive Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this consensus across foundational models, each model offers a unique approach for experimentation. More than anything else, the DOD needs to start an aggressive campaign of experimentation that cuts across legacy service interests and equities to imagine the future of agentic warfare. This effort is less about getting the tech right than understanding human-machine interactions at scale and how to build agentic staff organizations. This will require an iterated approach that uses a common set of threat scenarios used to evaluate how best to restructure staffs—similar to the proof of concept explored below using PLA campaigns. This campaign of learning will also likely require external evaluation beyond the services and the DOD to ensure objectivity and accountability, to possibly include required congressional reporting. Regardless of its final form, which can be mapped by organizations like the CDAO, among others, the experiments must intentionally explore alternatives to legacy staff structures that have changed little in hundreds of years and are poorly aligned to take advantage of advances in AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds by establishing the historical foundation of the modern staff. From this vantage point, it adapts prominent ideas from political science and sociology to propose alternatives to the legacy Napoleonic staff for waging agentic warfare. Given these alternatives, the report shifts to stress-testing them, using common threat scenarios adapted from PLA doctrine to support algorithmic analysis, with three foundational models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) used to analyze how an agentic staff would perform. The report concludes with an inventory of recommendations that include launching a campaign of experimentation and building the infrastructure and human capital required to wage agentic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-military-staff-organizations&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Military Staff Organizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern military staff is a central component of operational and strategic decisionmaking in armed forces worldwide. They essentially manage complexity by automation, using a division of labor to coordinate and synchronize key inputs to commanders. This process is essential to modern command and the estimative processes that support it (i.e., military planning). Put simply, without a staff organization and coordinating process, military operations become kids’ soccer: There is no game plan and everyone rushes to the ball, compounding chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their current configuration, these organizations typically operate under a common framework that divides responsibilities into specialized functions. For example, in NATO and U.S. doctrine, the typical staff structure is divided as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J1/G1–Personnel (Manpower and Human Resources):&lt;/strong&gt; Manages personnel policies, manpower allocation, and morale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J2/G2–Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence to inform decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J3/G3–Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Plans and directs current operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J4/G4–Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures sustainment and support, including supply chains and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J5/G5–Plans:&lt;/strong&gt; Develops future operational plans and strategic initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J6/G6–Communications and Cyber:&lt;/strong&gt; Manages communications, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J7/G7–Training and Education:&lt;/strong&gt; Works on training plans and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J8/G8–Force Structure and Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; Handles financial planning and capability development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J9/G9–Civil-Military Affairs:&lt;/strong&gt; Engages with civilian agencies and multinational partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These staff sections largely align with military functions. In U.S. military doctrine, warfighting functions are how commanders group core capabilities to integrate, synchronize, and direct operations. In U.S. military doctrine, these functions vary by service but largely include command and control, information, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, sustainment, and information. The core concept is that combat power emerges from integrating these functions. Wars are won not just by shooting bullets or firing missiles, but by combining fire, maneuver, force protection, and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a military staff has evolved from its early iterations in ancient and medieval warfare to the highly bureaucratized organizations seen in modern armed forces. While there are historical antecedents, the modern staff confirmation is largely a function of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. During the French Revolution, the ideas of Paul Thiébault informed a series of reforms that led to the état-major général (general staff ) and staff organization employed by Napoleon. This staff system allowed for greater operational flexibility, rapid planning, and the synchronization of large-scale maneuver warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussians further refined this model in the nineteenth century, institutionalizing the general staff system, which became a hallmark of modern military planning. Over time, the system evolved to address increased scale and complexity, including large continuous fronts and mass mobilization in World War I and deeper joint and coalition integration in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple authors have concluded that the Napoleonic staff system holds foundational characteristics of the industrial age that thwart flexibility and adaptability in both planning and execution. Staffs are often seen as too large, too resistant toward adaptation, and too top-heavy, resulting in what will likely be decision disadvantage in future conflict. Traditional approaches treat the commander in an overly individualistic manner that tends to result in centralized decisionmaking at the expense of dynamically responding to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not clear that an eighteenth-century military process is ideal for twenty-first-century warfare. Despite their evolution, modern military staff organizations struggle to manage mass volumes of data, synchronize multi-domain effects, and integrate coalition and interagency partners. By continuing to break down complex tasks into subordinate processes, the legacy staff has grown over the years, leading to larger, often cumbersome, bureaucratic organizations. In place of mission command—centralized planning and decentralized execution—large military staffs attempt to serve both functions in a futile effort to manage complexity. This tendency toward inflexibility leads forward-deployed units to continue to experiment with augmenting the staff process to gain efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As units integrate multi-domain effects, “the increased speed in the division’s main command post (the central orders and targeting hub) can often outpace support from sustainment and protection warfighting functions concentrated in satellite command nodes.” The DOD needs a more rapid planning cycle that allows staffs to both integrate these effects and work across larger distributed geographic areas. These military organizations can further accelerate tempo by becoming flatter and managed more by algorithm than by hierarchical chains of command devoid of context at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision support is enhanced when functional expertise from across the staff and from external mission partners is brought together in direct support of the commander’s decision requirements. This idea was central to the notion of the “strategic corporal” and experiments with integrating long-range fires with distributed maneuver units as part of the Sea Dragon experiments in the 1990s. It also was a central feature of the concept of Force XXI in the U.S. Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-the-iron-cage-to-networks&quot;&gt;From the Iron Cage to Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military staff system reflects a larger nineteenth-century push toward rational legal authority and modern bureaucracy. The objective is control, rather than creativity, creating an “iron cage.” This concept dominates military innovation literature, where the goal is to define when, how, and why any novel idea escapes from its cage to change warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern sociology and political science no longer focus just on large institutions, bureaucratic mazes, and their role in shaping policy. Increasingly, studies focus on networks and how people—as agents—connect with each other and their environment to exchange information and catalyze change. This process has utility for visualizing and describing options for adapting legacy military staff organizations to wars that will be increasingly waged through algorithms. In other words, calls for data-centric warfare will stall if they do not simultaneously seek to reimagine what a military staff is and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three authors provide maps for escaping the iron cage of the Napoleonic staff and waging agentic warfare: Bruno Latour (1947–2022), Andrew Abbott (1948–present), and Harrison White (1930–2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A French academic, Bruno Latour explored how knowledge is produced. The central idea is seeing scientists not as individuals but as actors in a larger network that connects people and things (termed “actants”) to form networks, a concept known as actor-network theory. Latour’s work lends a perspective that characterizes the military planning process and larger legacy staff organization as a series of “translations,” where each actor tries to enroll others into their own vision of the operation. This process is central to knowledge production and, by extension, decisionmaking, as actants negotiate and compromise, often leading to novel outcomes. More importantly, the process leads to what Latour called inscriptions: ideas and strategies that are translated into maps, documents, simulations, and orders, which then shape how, for example, military plans and orders are understood. These inscriptions are not neutral; they carry their own biases and limitations, implying that a military staff casts a long shadow across its orders even when the officers are not present. Flows of information and influence are capable of bending rigid hierarchies. AI agents allowed to exchange information could create network effects that undermine traditional staff structures. However, as these plans and orders take shape, they often fall victim to “black-boxing”: when the logic is opaque and complexity is hidden behind simplified representations. The price of control is plans lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latour’s critiques of modern science can help shape the design parameters for adapting the Napoleonic staff for agentic warfare. First, seeing data flows as a translation process and understanding inscription help architects design more efficient and explainable systems. Agentic staffs—likely smaller than current military staffs—will need to be calibrated to the types of inscriptions that fuse tactical data with a knowledge ontology linked to military history and operational art, but at the functional level. This simple idea is where multiple automation schemes tend to fall down. They view military planning from the perspective of an engineer and optimize tagging data to support faster and more efficient workflows as opposed to treating military history, doctrine, and even structured lessons learned as forms of tacit knowledge that should inform how any AI model analyzes, routes, and synthesizes large data flows. Actor-network theory also brings to light a possible unintended consequence of the application of AI agents to the military staff: The same model training, fine-tuning, and resulting weights will produce an agentic form of Latour’s inscription. Staff officers should be aware that the training method for a frontier AI model could influence staff decisions as much as a well-crafted Concept of Operations briefing slide can shape the direction of a military plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods for better integrating humans in an agentic military decisionmaking network will require deeper AI literacy and deliberate design choices. Super-empowered staff officers—fewer in number but interacting with more information—will need to move beyond basic concepts like AI prompt engineering to more complex tasks, such as how to scaffold multiple AI agents together to complete a planning workflow. They will require higher-order skills, including sensing Latour’s inscription process in their staff and mapping it to the AI agents in a way that will maximize the AI’s effectiveness in the organization. This task requires users to have the ability to not only surface relevant staff data for an AI context but also recognize how the information they provide to the model will shape its output. Similarly, these staff officers should be aware of more complex AI interaction concepts such as graph theory, in which the structure of language itself is used to extract key ideas and better optimize how models search large volumes of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrison White was an American sociologist central to the rise of network sociology. In his major work, Identity and Control, White sees relational networks as the defining feature of human social systems in which individuals and groups assume roles (i.e., identities) and seek to influence connections (i.e., control). This process creates distinct sites of social action where specific roles prevail as a form of emergent (i.e., nonlinear) behavior, or what White calls “netdoms.” Actors switch among netdoms to shape how other actors across the network perceive the world around them and thus their interests and choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to imagining alternatives to the Napoleonic staff for agentic warfare, White’s relation networks suggest that designers will need to enable—and understand—the switching process. The concept of switching likely implies that human agents will need to switch between peer work and working with multiple functional agent clusters, with each generating alternative military options. Furthermore, it implies a need to resurrect explainable AI efforts and find novel methods for allowing human actors in an agentic network to express causal logic and understand how algorithms generate answers (i.e., explainable AI, also known as XAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third model emerges from the work of Andrew Abbott, an American sociologist famous for his work studying professions and the sociology of knowledge production. A central feature in Abbott’s work is how interactions among actors forge processes that unfold over time rather than static structures, creating in effect a nonlinear depiction of how social organizations—such as professions—evolve. Social phenomena tend to be shaped more by contingency (e.g., unexpected events) and unique context (e.g., emergent behavior), which makes traditional approaches to science ill-suited to explain the course of human history. The world cannot be reduced to simple cause-and-effect modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective is particularly relevant to the almost certain blurring of lines between traditional military staff roles and AI agents on the horizon, and the challenges with modeling complex systems such as war. Furthermore, it is not enough for AI agents to process large amounts of information and complete a doctrinal planning checklist. They need to be balanced against deeper knowledge ontologies that help interpret context (known as contextual embedding) and integrate human feedback (known as reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) as a way of capturing contingent events and their interpretation. These measures will help overcome modeling predictions based on standard transformer processes that have emerged over the last 10 years and defined the latest AI breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outlines-of-an-agentic-future&quot;&gt;Outlines of an Agentic Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three models serve as a guide for thinking about applying AI agents to military staff processes and planning. An AI agent is an autonomous system capable of perceiving its environment, reasoning about it, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. At its core, an agent is defined by the agent function—a mapping from data inputs to goal-driven actions—that operates based on internal models, learning mechanisms, and contextual information. While the foundational concept of AI agents dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, the modern understanding emerged based on research in the early 1990s that defined agents as “anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators . . . [establishing] a fundamental perception-action loop that characterizes agent systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of AI agents often reflects a balance between reactive and deliberative components. Early models, like the subsumption architecture proposed by Rodney Brooks, emphasized reactive behaviors layered hierarchically to produce intelligent action without centralized planning. In contrast, classical planning approaches rooted in classical symbolic AI—which handles representation and manipulation of explicit knowledge using symbols and rules—rely on a detailed internal model and forward simulation to generate plans that achieve specified objectives. Hybrid models, such as those proposed by Michael Georgeff and Amy Lansky, blend these approaches—allowing agents to react in real time while also engaging in strategic planning when time permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern usage of the term “AI agent” implies a range of attributes that describe an ability to operate intelligently and autonomously in a defined environment. “Intelligent” does not mean general human intelligence but an understanding of particular rules, goals, and inferences that enable AI agents to make decisions based on awareness of the environment. Furthermore, agents should be able, with the right architecture, to interact with other agents and humans to create more complex workflows. This means AI agents should be able to draw logical inferences that support planning and adapting to changes based on processing new data. As data changes, the agent should learn and adjust how it executes core tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have expanded the concept of agency to include language-based agents that combine reasoning, memory, and tool use. Approaches like ReAct integrate explicit reasoning traces with application programming interface calls, allowing agents to interweave thoughts and actions in complex tasks. Agents can be embedded in simulations that allow for agentic observation, planning, and reflection to better simulate human behavior and synthesize stored data (i.e., memory). These developments mark a shift from static models to agents capable of open-ended learning and complex interaction, skills required for dealing with the fog and friction that define military planning and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this agentic future is not without costs and concerns. If the adage is true that military plans are worthless but planning is priceless, agents put at risk the value gained through the painful planning process. Also, the reasoning of a model (assuming there is something beyond deep pattern recognition), if abstracted or blocked from human oversight, could induce reasonable concerns of AI hallucination or fabrication of information even when results are reliable. As models become more performant, alignment of the model to human intent (whether perceived or actual) will be an increasing concern, and in the process, will renew calls for mission command. These issues offer even more reasons to increase experimentation and learning to ensure the United States fields the most performant and trustworthy AI agents supporting the national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To imagine possible staff organizations for agentic warfare, the CSIS Futures Lab used a mix of data-driven AI methods and qualitative judgment from workshops with military professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VmdX65X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Research Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Figure 4, first, the team structured datasets on each theorist, the history of military staff organizations, modern U.S. joint doctrine, and texts of Chinese military doctrine. The research team then used Scale AI’s Donovan platform to create a combined corpus of over 200 texts as a basis for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG is a method for grounding LLM-generated results based on key external sources of knowledge that provide context to the model’s representation of information. By integrating external references into the generation process, RAG not only enhances factual correctness but also provides interpretable, context-aware insights, aiding more rigorous and transparent analysis. Chinese military doctrine in the dataset emphasized joint campaigns and systems confrontation and destruction. The method ensured the team used a consistent structure of questions against a common set of structured data (i.e., knowledge ontology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team developed a prompting strategy based on chain of thought: a method that breaks down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps in order to refine the results from LLMs. These intermediate reasoning steps verify the model’s decisionmaking process, enabling more transparent analysis. Applied to the curated dataset referenced above, the major steps consisted of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verifying that the LLM understood each theorist (i.e., Latour, White, Abbott).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this understanding of the theorist to imagine how to adapt legacy staff organizations for a new era of agentic warfare using the definition offered in the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having the LLM catalog possible strengths and weaknesses of the new staff structure (networked, relational, and adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assessing how well each new staff structure optimized for agentic warfare would perform against major PLA scenarios, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Blockade:&lt;/strong&gt; The coordinated use of all branches of the military to isolate a target, typically Taiwan, by severing its maritime and aerial connections through a combination of naval, air, missile, space, and information effects ranging from electronic warfare and cyber operations to propaganda and subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Firepower Strike:&lt;/strong&gt; Systematically degrading an adversary’s operational capabilities by delivering precise, overwhelming strikes against high-value targets across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Landing Campaign:&lt;/strong&gt; The integrated use of amphibious, airborne, and special operations forces—to include unconventional and subversive elements—to seize key terrain and establish a lodgment for follow-on major combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting a workshop analysis comparing the different approaches to counter the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used the same prompts with three different foundation models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. This approach ensured a larger set of observations, but the results are still only illustrative and designed to explore different options for changing legacy staff structures. The findings below reflect the research team’s comparative analysis of the cross-model outputs based on workshop discussions with military professionals. Three workshops were held in winter 2024 and consisted of small groups of on average 10 officers, each with over 10 years of military experience, discussing the model-generated results. The results of the workshops inform the qualitative assessments of each approach (networked, relational, adaptive) that follow, while the statistical appendix uses AI-enabled scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1-using-actor-network-theory-to-imagine-a-networked-staff&quot;&gt;Option 1: Using Actor-Network Theory to Imagine a Networked Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach reimagines traditional staff processes as a network of interconnected human and AI actors collaborating to generate operational knowledge and decisions. The concept aligns with Bruno Latour’s early work, which sees knowledge production not as the work of isolated individuals, but as a process of negotiations among people, data, and material artifacts. Unlike the hierarchical general staff (G-staff ) model, the Networked Staff is built around a series of “translations” at the level of functional nodes (i.e., command and control, intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, force protection, sustainment, and information). AI agents embedded in each node dynamically process large-scale data flows, propose recommendations, and refine functional plans based on real-time feedback from across the network. This makes the network model dependent on functional agent to functional data exchange. This design also requires functional model fine-tuning and other techniques like semantic indexing and metadata enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are key trade-offs in this approach. For one, planning is not neutral. Each staff process and functional node, whether human led or AI enabled, transforms knowledge into inscriptions that shape how decisions are understood and executed. These inscriptions—maps, orders, intelligence estimates, and wargaming simulations—carry biases and constraints that influence operational outcomes. Moreover, as plans are formulated, they risk falling victim to black-boxing, where the logic behind decisions becomes opaque, hidden within layers of AI-generated recommendations or simplified doctrinal templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter these risks, the Networked Staff requires a fundamental shift in military planning that prioritizes adaptability, explainability, and AI-driven agentic augmentation of a series of human decisionmakers rather than merely accelerated workflows. The key structural differences in a Networked Staff include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat, Decentralized Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Nodes operate independently but share information dynamically, ensuring that decisionmaking is distributed rather than top-down. This design could fundamentally alter rank structures in military headquarters and staffs. This shift has the potential to increase the speed and accuracy of decisionmaking and enable new forms of collaboration that would be impossible in rigid, hierarchical command structures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Driven Planning Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; AI agents analyze incoming functional data, identify patterns, and generate real-time recommendations, allowing for more agile, adaptive planning cycles. They become, in essence, the members of an operational planning team serving a smaller set of top military thinkers crafting courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Cross-Node Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike traditional staff sections that operate in silos, the Networked Staff fosters continuous interaction among functional agents, each with a human interlocutor. This data flow will need to be managed with alerts and augmented information requirements in a similar but not fully Bayesian manner to ensure humans in the network are not overwhelmed and subject to common decisionmaking pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Situational Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; AI models synthesize and visualize complex operational data, making it easier for planners to interpret battlefield dynamics and assess risks. The challenge will be dimensionality and determining at what level of abstraction to assess complex and nonlinear systems that define competition and combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Networked Staff to reach its full potential, the U.S. military needs to invest in computational infrastructure, deeper AI integration, and human capital development—not as a faddish tech fetish, but as a means of out-cycling adversaries like China that are almost certain to have advantages in time, space, and forces. Tempo becomes the theory of victory. The force able to generate viable options and maintain freedom of action is more responsive and resilient even if it is outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff is a step toward faster, more adaptive functional decisionmaking, but without deliberate safeguards, it could collapse under its own complexity. Coordination without command authority risks turning a synchronized fight into a series of disconnected actions, where misaligned priorities and conflicting decisions slow the tempo rather than accelerating it. AI-driven planning floods the system with data, but more information is not the same as context and better understanding—without structure, staff officers risk drowning in insights, leading to cognitive overload, hesitation, or misplaced confidence in an incomplete picture of the fight. Cybersecurity is another Achilles’ heel—by linking every functional node in a decentralized web, the Networked Staff expands the attack surface, making it a prime target for PLA system disruption warfare, AI poisoning, and deep-penetration cyber intrusions. Overreliance on AI introduces yet another risk: If operators do not understand how AI reaches its conclusions, they will either blindly trust or outright dismiss its recommendations, both of which can lead to failure at machine speed. To make the Networked Staff a true force multiplier, the U.S. military needs to tame the chaos—structuring data flows, reinforcing cybersecurity, and integrating explainable AI to ensure that humans remain in command, not just in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 1: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH A NETWORKED STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous section, the research team evaluated the different options for replacing legacy staff structures for a new era of agentic warfare through three foundation models and compared the results to generate the human analysis below. Specifically, the research team did multiple iterations of the same prompt structure against each model. A statistical analysis is available in the Statistical Appendix. The team then analyzed these to identify where they converged and diverged as well as to synthesize insights on the ability of a military using a Networked Staff to counter each PLA campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all models agreed that the Networked Staff concept provided increased tempo, adaptability, and decisionmaking driven by intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), outputs differed on how resilient it would be in the face of PLA system disruption tactics and how well it would maintain operational cohesion in complex, high-intensity fights. In some of the model runs, the joint firepower strike and blockade scenarios exposed the Networked Staff’s vulnerability to cyber and electronic warfare, while the landing campaign scenario raised concerns about synchronization and the risks of decentralized functional decisionmaking in large-scale, multi-domain operations. Across all perspectives, the need for structured AI oversight, resilient communications, and human-machine synchronization protocols remained a universal recommendation to ensure the Networked Staff does not become a liability in the face of PLA system warfare doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a PLA joint blockade scenario, the Networked Staff’s ability to rapidly synthesize functional nodes gave the United States and its allies a critical edge in situational awareness. The model outputs assumed AI-driven analytics could identify patterns in PLA naval and aerial movements in a manner that enabled friendly forces to anticipate blockading maneuvers, detect maritime chokepoints, and optimize blockade countermeasures in real time. The decentralized structure would allow independent nodes to generate concepts of support and staff estimates simultaneously, reducing delays inherent in traditional G-staff decisionmaking. Additionally, the LLM outputs—across models—emphasized how cross-domain functional integration enhanced the U.S. military’s ability to disrupt PLA communications, jam targeting systems, and exploit weaknesses in China’s electronic warfare operations, eroding the blockade’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some LLM outputs across models noted that conducting a counter-blockade operation required unity of effort in a manner that could prove challenging given the decentralized character of the Networked Staff alongside the concepts of translation and actants. Unlike a rigidly hierarchical PLA command structure that centralizes control over blockade operations, the Networked Staff’s distributed functional decisionmaking could lead to discrepancies in enforcement, inconsistent engagement criteria, or competing operational priorities across naval, air, and cyber domains. The resulting friction would undermine combat effectiveness. Additionally, the PLA’s system destruction warfare doctrine would target the network’s reliance on shared information flows, using cyber and electronic warfare attacks to inject false intelligence, disrupt node communication, or create decision paralysis through AI manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a PLA joint firepower strike scenario, the aim would be to systematically degrade U.S. and allied operational capabilities through precision multi-domain attacks targeting high-value assets such as command centers, logistics hubs, and integrated air and missile defense systems. In such an environment, the Networked Staff’s adaptability and resilience depend on the extent to which functions nodes survive the blow. Across models, the LLM outputs assumed the decentralized structure would enable forces to disperse key functions across multiple nodes, preventing a single-point failure that could cripple operations. Similarly, model outputs highlighted that AI-driven analytics allow real-time battle damage assessment and automated reallocation of surviving assets, ensuring that command continuity is preserved and friendly forces can manage maintenance and logistics required to replace combat loses and generate counterattack options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these advantages, the Networked Staff’s heavy reliance on real-time data and translations among functional nodes (i.e., actants) makes it a prime target for PLA electronic warfare and cyber operations. The PLA would likely jam communication links, inject deceptive targeting data, or disable AI-driven decision support systems, disrupting the Networked Staff’s ability to rapidly respond and coordinate a defense. Additionally, AI-generated battlefield assessments may overwhelm human operators or even produce hallucinations, leading to decision fatigue or confusion in identifying the most pressing threats during a fast-moving, high-intensity campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint landing campaign in which the PLA seeks to seize key terrain and establish a lodgment for follow-on combat operations, the Networked Staff’s ability to dynamically allocate forces, synchronize multi-domain fires, and disrupt adversary landing sequences becomes a decisive advantage. Multiple LLM outputs stressed that ISR nodes could continuously track PLA amphibious and airborne movement, fusing data from intelligence functional nodes with fires nodes to preemptively strike critical transport, logistics, and command elements before they reach the shore. In addition, some model outputs emphasized how AI-driven functional wargaming simulations would support instant adaptation to new threats, ensuring that counter-landing operations are fluid and responsive rather than rigid and predetermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, large-scale defensive operations require tight sequencing and precise coordination, areas where multiple model outputs stressed that the Networked Staff’s flat structure presents risks. Without clear hierarchical arbitration—whether via legacy or algorithmic approaches to mission command—different functional nodes might develop conflicting interpretations of the battlefield, leading to misaligned fires, redundant asset allocation, or missed opportunities to disrupt PLA landings before they gain momentum. The PLA’s electronic and cyber warfare operations would specifically target battlefield communications, further compounding this friction and disrupting the ability of friendly forces to conduct combined arms. The effect would be a digital defeat, severing ties among ISR, logistics, and maneuver elements to isolate defending forces and create openings for Chinese forces to establish a beachhead. Additionally, an overreliance on AI-generated assessments may fail to capture the true tactical complexity of landing operations, leading to misguided countermeasures based on incomplete or manipulated data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Networked Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff provides the functional coordination needed to counter multiple PLA military campaigns. By leveraging functional fusion—actants coordinating intelligence, fires, and logistics—it enables forces to counteract PLA blockades with real-time maneuvering, survive and recover from firepower strikes, and dynamically respond to landing threats before they establish a foothold. However, its greatest strength—its reliance on a highly networked, AI-enhanced decision ecosystem linked to warfighting functions—is also its greatest vulnerability. The PLA’s system destruction warfare strategy is designed to sever these networks, inject deception, and create decision paralysis that could render decentralized operations ineffective. Unlike the legacy G-staff model, which emphasizes hierarchical control and redundancy, the Networked Staff must actively compensate for its structural weaknesses by incorporating resilient communication networks, deception-resistant AI models, and structured synchronization protocols to maintain operational coherence under contested conditions. Done right, the Networked Staff can turn the PLA’s strengths—precision strikes, cyber warfare, and centralized execution—against itself, forcing the adversary into a fight it is neither optimized for nor prepared to win. But this outcome would require significant investments in computational infrastructure and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2-the-relational-staff-1&quot;&gt;Option 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on Harrison White’s theory on relational sociology, this staff design moves beyond static roles and rigid chains of command, instead functioning as a constellation of interdependent functional planning agents—called netdoms—that continuously interact, adapt, and generate operational insights. A human switcher adjudicates among the output of multiple agentic netdoms, each in effect conducting parallel planning. Unlike the Networked Staff, where functional agents work alongside human staff to form actants, each agentic netdom contains multiple functional AI agents independent of staff oversight. This difference implies a trade-off between deep functional dives managed by human staff (networked) and humans playing the role of switchers and comparing outputs from multiple AI agent clusters (relational). The idea is that the human staff officer will see a wide range of variation based on multi-agent interaction rather than deep functional dives guided by staff. In other words, there are fewer people in a Relational Staff approach, and they analyze whole outputs rather than functional snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, rather than relying on a linear, top-down flow of information, the Relational Staff fosters emergent decisionmaking based on evaluating how different netdoms approach solving military problems. This process has the potential to create divergent and novel findings but also to generate noise. In fact, it could create a signal-to-noise ratio challenge as it merges real-time information from the battlefield with deep contextual ideas about warfighting functions and even the history of operational art depending on how programmers train agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the humans in the middle of the Relational Staff will likely have to play the role of switchers. Officers will connect netdoms agents managing typical staff functions (e.g., maneuver, fires, intelligence, logistics) to ensure cross-functional collaboration that mitigates the signal-to-noise ratio challenge. Their role will be to translate insights, negotiate competing priorities, and synthesize perspectives across different domains so that staff decisions reflect an integrated real-time assessment of the battlespace. That is a tremendous amount to ask any staff officer, implying the human agent acting as switcher will need deeper training and possibly even entirely new skill sets compared to those currently taught in professional military education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Napoleonic G-staff, where functional elements operate in bureaucratic isolation, the Relational Staff thrives on continuous dialogue, leveraging AI agents to illuminate trade-offs, risks, and opportunities across joint functions in ways that traditional processes cannot match. Key differences between the Relational Staff and legacy G-staff model designs include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interconnected Netdoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike G-staff sections, which operate in isolation, netdoms are continuously linked by human switchers and AI-enhanced data flows, ensuring real-time information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Connect References:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the Networked Staff, the Relational Staff will need to balance constant negotiations among netdoms as a source of information against deep embedding and high-context data. This difference will create deeper training for different agents. The result will likely be ontology-enhanced representations that help agents learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Orientation and Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The G-staff requires manual coordination to reconfigure itself for different missions, whereas the Relational Staff dynamically reshapes itself in response to battlefield conditions through the process of negotiation. The main effort can shift quickly based on analytical insights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-Centered Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the pivotal role of human switchers, the Relational Staff is the least likely to see full autonomy in operations. Highly trained staff officers and commanders will be required to meditate negotiations among netdoms processing large volumes of information and analyzing against high-context datasets. While this staff model may have fewer people, it places a higher premium on their knowledge base, since they will have to analyze netdom output that factors in multiple warfighting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core strength of this model is its ability to incorporate human intuition into AI-driven recommendations. The Relational Staff breaks from the slow, sequential logic of legacy command structures, treating decisionmaking as an ongoing negotiation rather than a bureaucratic approval process. By networking intelligence, operations, and logistics into interconnected netdoms, it dismantles the stovepipes that delay response times, replacing them with parallel, AI-enhanced collaboration that allows planning cycles to move at machine speed. Instead of drowning planners in raw data, AI agents embedded within each netdom continuously filter, refine, and prioritize insights, ensuring decisionmakers focus on strategy rather than information management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this promise, the Relational Staff introduces risks that, if left unchecked, could turn agility into chaos. Without a clear arbitration mechanism to assist human switchers in guiding how netdom agents negotiate priorities, decisionmaking could spiral into misalignment, competing priorities, or outright fragmentation. AI-driven insights could flood the system with real-time updates, filtered by domain-specific context that may obscure more than it clarifies, leaving planners struggling to interpret information. The result would be cognitive overload, decision fatigue, and delays in identifying what truly matters. Without explainable AI, commanders risk falling into one of two traps: blindly following AI outputs without question or dismissing machine-driven insights altogether, undermining the very advantage this model is designed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 2: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH A RELATIONAL STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Relational Staff, with its AI-enhanced netdoms and human switchers, offers a flexible approach to military decisionmaking. However, its effectiveness against a PLA joint blockade, firepower strike, or landing campaign depends on how well it its agentic planning clusters—the netdoms—create viable courses of action to counter system disruption warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across models, the Relational Staff was described as posing a distinct advantage in multi-domain coordination, where air, naval, space, and cyber operations must operate in concert, orchestrated by a human-centered switcher, to counter a blockade force. Across multiple LLM outputs, there was an assumption that unlike a traditional staff with rigid silos, the Relational Staff fosters a more integrated approach, with maritime, air, and cyber netdoms continuously sharing intelligence, adapting force posture, and countering PLA maneuvers. Model outputs tended to assume that AI-driven insights within each netdom would analyze PLA movements, optimize force placement, and anticipate potential breaches, while human switchers would bridge information gaps, ensuring synchronization among communities. This structure would allow for dynamic adaptation, meaning the blockade does not operate as a static perimeter but as a fluid, evolving operational framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this very decentralization introduces coordination challenges in a prolonged blockade. Unlike the PLA’s hierarchical command system, which enforces unified action, the Relational Staff relies on negotiation among netdoms, which may lead to disjointed enforcement efforts if human switchers are disconnected or uncoordinated. The staff needs to either make a single commander the central switcher and authority, or assume the risk that multiple switchers might engage in negotiations between netdoms and each other, slowing down the flow of information and leading to conflicting objectives, and ultimately creating exploitable gaps. Additionally, the PLA’s system destruction warfare doctrine would likely target human switchers and AI-enabled netdoms, seeking to jam communications, disrupt network integrity, and inject false data into operational planning. This targeting would likely also start before a conflict and could include targeted assassinations, blackmail, and other unconventional methods to restrict the effectiveness of an AI-enabled conventional force. Highly trained switchers will be few in number, making them both a critical requirement and a critical vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A preponderance of model outputs described a Relational Staff that excelled in distributing decision making authority to survive a PLA joint firepower strike designed to systematically degrade command structures, ISR assets, and logistics nodes. Yet this approach was the most dependent on human operators, implying that this distribution relies on switchers surviving and quickly reconnecting data links to support the negotiation process central to a Relational Staff approach. Models tended to assume that, unlike in a traditional command structure, where a successful strike on a key headquarters could cripple operations, the Relational Staff dispersal of expertise across multiple netdoms would reduce single points of failure. That assumption depends on battle networks and concepts like mosaic more than different staff design principles, and it assumes that military organizations can rapidly replace dead switchers with new commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while decentralized execution enhances survivability, it can also introduce vulnerabilities in synchronization and strike timing. Effectively responding to a multi-domain firepower strike requires tight sequencing among ISR, targeting, and engagement elements. The Relational Staff’s dependence on human switchers to mediate algorithmic negotiations could slow down kill-chain execution to human decisionmakers, vice machine at the cost of speed. Furthermore, the PLA’s ability to target the connective tissue of the Relational Staff—namely, its information-sharing architecture centered around the human switcher—creates a major weakness. By jamming netdom communications, launching cyber-intrusions into AI decision support systems, and attacking key switchers in targeting and fires domains, the PLA could degrade the cohesion of U.S. counterstrikes, creating windows of opportunity for follow-on attacks. Lastly, because of the centrality of the human switcher, the PLA could tailor cyber-enabled information operations to skew decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the LLM outputs and model runs, PLA joint landing campaigns were characterized as requiring complex, cross-domain defense, where logistics, airpower, ISR, and maneuver forces are synchronized to deny PLA forces a foothold. The Relational Staff was well-suited to coordinate these intricate operations, as its netdoms foster multi-domain and functional integration, allowing defenders to rapidly adapt to PLA landing strategies as fast as switchers can select agentic options from competing netdoms. Unlike a rigidly hierarchical staff, which may struggle to rapidly adjust to preplanned defensive postures, the Relational Staff’s negotiation-based decision making enables it to flexibly shift resources and adapt force deployments in response to PLA maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this tightly coupled defense relies on both the quality of the human switcher and the netdom’s high-context training. A landing campaign demands tight sequencing of defensive fires, maneuver forces, and sustainment logistics, and if different netdoms interpret PLA movements differently or prioritize conflicting responses, operational cohesion could break down at a critical moment. Human switchers are also fallible to bridging the negotiation-based decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing these limitations, the PLA would target communication nodes among netdoms, using electronic warfare and cyber operations to disrupt coordination among logistics, ISR, and operational planning. If switchers become overwhelmed with competing information flows, decision latency could prevent defenders from concentrating combat power at decisive points, allowing PLA forces to establish a lodgment before the defense can fully respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Relational Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Relational Staff’s AI-enhanced netdoms and human switchers provide a dynamic approach to countering PLA campaigns, but its effectiveness hinges on balancing adaptability with coordination under system disruption warfare. Against a joint blockade, its multi-domain integration ensures real-time intelligence sharing and force posture adjustments, making the blockade fluid rather than static. However, the decentralized negotiation process introduces risks in synchronization, as human switchers—critical for bridging netdoms—become high-value targets for PLA cyber, electronic, and even unconventional attacks. In a joint firepower strike scenario, the Relational Staff’s dispersal of expertise reduces single points of failure, increasing survivability, yet this advantage depends on switchers rapidly reestablishing network links to coordinate counterstrikes. The PLA’s ability to degrade communications and AI decision support could slow kill-chain execution, creating exploitable windows for follow-on attacks. In a joint landing campaign, the Relational Staff’s flexibility would enable rapid adaptation to PLA maneuvering, allowing independent netdoms fusing intelligence, fires, and logistics data to continuously adjust defensive plans. However, this approach relies heavily on the competency of switchers to bridge decision gaps, and PLA electronic warfare and cyberattacks could sever these critical links, causing decision latency at decisive moments. While the Relational Staff’s networked design fosters agility, its dependence on human mediation for synchronization introduces vulnerabilities that PLA system destruction warfare is specifically designed to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3-the-adaptive-staff-1&quot;&gt;Option 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from Andrew Abbott’s insights into how professions and organizations evolve through nonlinear interactions rather than rigid structures, the Adaptive Staff approach envisions a continuously evolving system built around feedback loops connecting human and machines, as well as clusters of agents to support faster adaption to shifting operational realities. As a model for replacing the Napoleonic staff, it sits between the previous approaches, envisioning more agent autonomy than the Network Staff and less reliance on human switchers than the Relational Staff. Unlike traditional hierarchical staff models, which rely on static roles and bureaucratic workflows, or even the Relational Staff, which depends on switching, the Adaptive Staff structures decisionmaking around iterative cycles of planning, execution, and assessment that operate faster than legacy processes, essentially accelerating and fusing mission command and deliberate planning. This iteration requires higher degrees of model fine-tuning in relation to human feedback and key context including military theory and history independent of functional considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Networked Staff disperses decisionmaking across functionally independent nodes, and the Relational Staff emphasizes human switchers adjudicating clusters of functional agents, the Adaptive Staff treats decisionmaking as a continuous, iterative process, where AI agents and human facilitators work in tandem to generate, refine, and adjust plans based on real-time data. Each process—whether intelligence fusion, operational planning, logistics coordination, or fires management—is linked to others in a way that ensures synchronization without rigid command hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AI is not merely a tool for processing vast amounts of information—it must be embedded within deeper knowledge ontologies that allow for contextual interpretation of contingent events. Abbott’s work underscores the limitations of cause-and-effect modeling in social phenomena, a critical insight for military organizations seeking to integrate AI into complex decisionmaking processes. Rather than simply analyzing historical patterns, AI must be paired with reinforcement learning with human feedback to capture emergent battlefield dynamics and unforeseen variables based on evolving human judgment and collective intelligence. This approach prevents AI from becoming overly deterministic or optimizing for efficiency at the expense of adaptability. Key differences between the Adaptive Staff and the Networked and Relational Staff include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic, Process-Oriented Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the Networked Staff, which relies on decentralized, function-specific nodes, or the Relational Staff, which organizes around netdoms mediated by human switchers, the Adaptive Staff operates through interdependent processes that continuously refine decisionmaking based on real-time feedback loops that change the system. Unlike the G-staff, which is organized around functional sections that operate in parallel but often in isolation, the Adaptive Staff structures decisionmaking around fluid, interacting processes that continuously feed information into one another, preventing stovepipes and lag in operational assessments but also creating the risk of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative Decisionmaking Over Static Hierarchies:&lt;/strong&gt; While the Networked Staff flattens decisionmaking into distributed nodes exchanging information (i.e., actants and translation), and the Relational Staff prioritizes collaboration among netdom agents, the Adaptive Staff continuously revises its courses of action through structured iteration, ensuring that no decision is ever final but instead always subject to improvement based on feedback from the environment, agentic analysis, and even simulated outcomes derived from autonomous wargames run thousands if not millions of times in search of optimal conditions. While traditional staffs rely on step-by-step sequential planning (e.g., intelligence feeds operations, which in turn direct logistics, and so on), the Adaptive Staff allows for real-time iteration, recognizing that warfare does not unfold in a linear cause-and-effect sequence. This dynamic puts a premium on agent-generated branches and sequels and generating large numbers of options, often invisible to the human eye, to test possible scenarios. These simulated tactics and even whole courses of action provide reference points (i.e., synthetic data) to guide how agents respond to inevitable change in the environment. The value of this approach only increases when the adaptive staff integrates AI agents trained and weighted toward a perspective outside of traditional military planning, such as economic and diplomatic actions. Integrating these whole-of-government approaches in an Adaptive Staff would lead to uniquely effective options, emerging from a staff thinking in wholes rather than a myopic military lens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI as a Cognitive Enabler, Not Just a Data Processor:&lt;/strong&gt; While all three models integrate AI to enhance decisionmaking, the Adaptive Staff differs in that AI is embedded within processes, not just as a tool for automation but as a mechanism for refining, contextualizing, and learning from human decisions. AI agents are not just tools for information processing but integrated actors within the decisionmaking cycle, influencing planning and execution in real time, unlike the G-staff model, where intelligence products are generated in discrete cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergent Order over Predefined Structures:&lt;/strong&gt; The Networked Staff functions as a decentralized collection of nodes that interact horizontally, and the Relational Staff operates through negotiated relationships between netdoms, but the Adaptive Staff actively reconstructs itself in response to operational contingencies, ensuring that no plan is ever static. Rather than relying solely on pattern-matching from historical datasets, AI within the Adaptive Staff is trained to incorporate human feedback, operational art, and historical analogies, ensuring that contingency and emergent behavior are factored into decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adaptive Staff enhances agility and responsiveness, making it ideal for complex, multi-domain conflicts where rapid shifts in the operational environment demand continuous reassessment. By operationalizing interconnected processes, it ensures that planning, execution, and assessment operate as continuous loops rather than discrete, linear steps. This avoids the pitfalls of both traditional staff models, which often suffer from bureaucratic inertia, and the Networked Staff, which may struggle with synchronization due to negotiations among functionally independent nodes. AI-driven analytics enhance situational awareness, detecting patterns, shifts in adversary behavior, and potential opportunities or threats faster than human planners—the switchers in the Relational Staff. This removes potential bottlenecks caused by misalignment across netdoms while still maintaining flexibility and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Adaptive Staff is designed to enhance resilience and agility, it introduces risks that must be actively managed to prevent fragmentation, cognitive overload, and susceptibility to cyber threats. Unlike the Relational Staff, which is rooted in human switchers mediating how netdom agents exchange information, or the Networked Staff, which operates through translations among predefined function-specific nodes, the Adaptive Staff lacks a fixed structure—presenting a double-edged sword. Its fluidity allows for rapid iteration, but in high-intensity conflicts, coordination failures could emerge if facilitators fail to align operational priorities across interdependent processes. If competing AI-generated recommendations are not reconciled effectively, decisionmaking could become chaotic rather than adaptive. This challenge is compounded by the existing military education, training, and professional-development paradigms that emphasize static hierarchical structures. Emergent, rhizomatic organizational structures stand in near diametric opposition to military operation paradigms. This mismatch creates significant risk to adopting the Adaptive Staff design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional challenge is managing information overload. While AI enables real-time intelligence processing and course-of-action refinement, it also generates vast volumes of data that could overwhelm human facilitators shifting through background options and a collage of courses of action generated by agents searching alternative futures for advantage. Unlike the Networked Staff, which allows for compartmentalization within function-specific nodes, the Adaptive Staff processes are deeply interconnected, increasing the likelihood of decision fatigue if information flows are not properly managed and presented to human decisionmakers. The Adaptive Staff will require more humans than the Relational Staff, but they will have to be just as well trained and educated to interact with multiple functional agents across planning and execution considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 3: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH AN ADAPTIVE STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adaptive Staff’s process-driven, iterative approach provides a unique advantage in countering a PLA joint blockade, surviving a joint firepower strike, and defending against a joint landing campaign. Across LLM outputs, the Adaptive Staff was consistently characterized as the most capable of leveraging real-time monitoring, AI-enhanced assessment processes, and dynamic force reallocation to maintain the operational advantage against PLA system destruction warfare. Unlike the Relational Staff, which relies on human switchers negotiating among netdoms, or the Networked Staff, which disperses decisionmaking across independent function-based nodes, the Adaptive Staff continuously synchronizes planning, execution, and assessment, ensuring that responses evolve dynamically to meet battlefield conditions. However, this adaptability introduces vulnerabilities, as the reliance on iterative decision cycles and feedback loops creates risks of operational fragmentation, cyber manipulation, and decision latency under contested conditions. Effectively countering PLA campaigns with the Adaptive Staff requires robust redundancy measures, AI deception resistance, and clear thresholds for decisionmaking under uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of LLM outputs across the models characterized the Adaptive Staff as best suited to leverage real-time monitoring and rapid adaption across multiple domains to counter a PLA joint blockade. The outputs characterized AI-enhanced planning processes as continuously generating a range of new options based on changing maritime, air, and cyber conditions, allowing facilitators to dynamically adjust interdiction strategies in response to PLA maneuvers, electronic warfare tactics, and missile threats. Unlike the Relational Staff, which relies on human switchers to negotiate among netdom agents, or the Networked Staff, which operates through translation among functionally independent nodes, the Adaptive Staff maintains an iterative, process-driven decision cycle, ensuring that planning, execution, and assessment continuously inform one another. This continuous feedback loop prevents bureaucratic lag and allows the blockade to function as an adaptive operational framework rather than a static defensive perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, constantly responding to feedback loops could undermine unity of effort. Furthermore, it could create an information tax as agents awaiting updates thus delay tempo, a situation the PLA could compound through cyber and electronic attacks. The Adaptive Staff’s strength in fluid decisionmaking could become a vulnerability if the PLA systematically degrades key AI-human integration points, jams real-time synchronization mechanisms, or introduces false data streams into AI-driven assessments to create disjointed operational responses. Without structured redundancy and resilient data validation measures, along with conditional logic gates that determine when environment feedback is sufficient for action, the Adaptive Staff risks decision fragmentation, allowing the PLA to exploit gaps in blockade enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model outputs also consistently presented the Adaptive Staff as well suited to respond to a joint firepower strike. LLM responses across the three different foundation models (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) characterized this approach as denying the PLA a single set of high-value targets. This assumes, again, a battle network architecture that is distributed, resilient, and has sufficient computational power and connectivity to update AI models and analyze possible planning scenarios. This architecture allows the Adaptive Staff to rapidly restructure command relationships and authorities based on environmental feedback—for example, optimizing fires allocation based on battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this fluidity introduces risks in decision clarity and synchronization of fires across multiple domains. The PLA’s doctrine of systems confrontation is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in process-dependent networks, and if AI-driven recommendations overwhelm facilitators with conflicting targeting priorities, the strike response could become desynchronized. Moreover, the reliance on AI-generated insights in a contested electromagnetic environment could introduce cyber vulnerabilities, with PLA forces actively jamming data flows or injecting false targeting recommendations that cause strange loops as the Adaptive Staff’s model of the battlefield changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple models and LLM outputs also described how the Adaptive Staff would enable a force to deny a joint landing campaign. A PLA joint landing campaign represents one of the most complex operational challenges, requiring multi-domain coordination to deny beachheads, disrupt airborne forces, and neutralize supporting fires. The Adaptive Staff’s strength lies in its ability to dynamically synchronize defensive operations, ensuring that ISR, logistics, fires, and maneuver forces adjust in real time to PLA actions as feedback loops, essentially aligning options against possible futures as they emerge. Unlike the Relational Staff, in which negotiation across netdom agents could slow rapid countermoves, the Adaptive Staff allows for immediate shifts in operational priorities, keeping pace with PLA advances and logistical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this high degree of adaptation comes at the cost of operational cohesion. A landing scenario requires precise sequencing of defensive actions, and the Adaptive Staff’s decentralized processes and dependence on feedback loops may create decision bottlenecks in moments that demand intuition and rapid top-down command authority. Additionally, the reliance on AI-driven assessments could introduce transparency issues, as commanders may struggle to trace how specific defensive recommendations were generated and whether critical battlefield adjustments align with strategic intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Adaptive Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Adaptive Staff’s ability to rapidly process environmental feedback and restructure decisionmaking cycles provides an asymmetric advantage against PLA military campaigns, its strength in adaptability can also create vulnerabilities in coordination, tempo, and resilience in the face of information warfare (e.g., cyber, electronic, and propaganda operations). Against a joint blockade, the Adaptive Staff optimizes interdiction through dynamic force adjustments, but without safeguards against cyber and electronic warfare, it risks decision fragmentation and exploitable operational gaps. In a firepower strike scenario, its distributed nature enhances survivability, yet overreliance on AI-generated recommendations in a contested electromagnetic environment could lead to synchronization failures. Finally, in a joint landing campaign, its fluid decisionmaking enables rapid countermoves, but the absence of structured command authority may slow critical responses during high-stakes engagements. To fully leverage its advantages while mitigating its risks, the Adaptive Staff must integrate structured redundancy, deception-resistant AI, and explicit decision thresholds to prevent operational paralysis under adversarial disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparative-evaluation-of-ai-agentic-warfare-staff-models&quot;&gt;Comparative Evaluation of AI Agentic Warfare Staff Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding on the original research findings, the research team conducted a comparative analysis evaluating how three leading LLMs—ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini—assessed the performance of the Networked, Relational, and Adaptive Staff models against notional PLA campaigns. These assessments, paired with a structured analysis of variance (ANOVA), not only confirmed the overall superiority of the Adaptive Staff but also offered critical insights into where different AI agentic warfare staff structures would likely succeed or fail based on campaign demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all three models, the Adaptive Staff consistently outperformed its alternatives. It achieved the highest mean score (4.39) compared to the Relational Staff (3.90) and Networked Staff (3.59), a difference that was statistically significant according to ANOVA results (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This quantitative superiority reflects the Adaptive Staff’s underlying design principles: a dynamic, process-oriented structure emphasizing real-time feedback, contextual learning, and iterative decisionmaking. These attributes align closely with the challenges posed by PLA system confrontation warfare, particularly the need for rapid operational reconfiguration under cyber and electronic duress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint blockade campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, Gemini’s analysis aligned with Claude’s findings in recognizing the Adaptive Staff’s strength, emphasizing its real-time monitoring and dynamic adjustment capabilities linking planning and execution. However, Gemini placed greater emphasis on the vulnerabilities of the Networked Staff, particularly its challenges in maintaining operational cohesion under stress, a concern that was less pronounced in Claude’s evaluation. Claude highlighted the Relational Staff’s ability to better enable multi-domain coordination, but Gemini’s analysis noted the risk of disjointed enforcement due to the Relational Staff’s reliance on human switchers. ChatGPT similarly aligned with Claude, stressing the Adaptive Staff’s superior responsiveness and decisionmaking capacity. Notably, ChatGPT provided an even stronger endorsement of the Adaptive Staff model, offering it a clear numerical advantage over other models. In contrast to Claude’s moderate concerns about Networked Staff cybersecurity risks, ChatGPT categorically downgraded its viability. Likewise, while Claude identified coordination challenges in the Relational Staff, ChatGPT more severely criticized its limited operational effectiveness under blockade conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint firepower strike campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, both Gemini and Claude again identified the Adaptive Staff as the superior performer, particularly for its assumed ability to adapt, making it harder for the PLA to concentrate fires against high-value targets. Gemini placed more emphasis on the dangers of decision fatigue from high-volume AI-generated battlefield assessments than Claude did. Similarly, ChatGPT concurred with Claude on the Adaptive Staff’s strengths, especially its distributed resilience. However, ChatGPT rated the Networked Staff’s performance lower than Claude, emphasizing greater concerns about synchronization failures and information saturation. Unlike Claude, which acknowledged some relational model contributions, ChatGPT marked the Relational Staff’s performance as distinctly secondary, stressing the risks of human bottlenecks in rapidly evolving battlespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint landing campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, the Gemini analysis diverged slightly from Claude. Claude strongly favored the Relational Staff, highlighting its ability to facilitate complex, cross-domain defensive operations through robust human-AI teaming. Gemini, however, viewed the Adaptive Staff as a near-equal competitor, emphasizing its dynamic synchronization capabilities and ability to adapt under evolving battlefield conditions. Gemini also raised concerns about potential decision bottlenecks in the Adaptive Staff model due to its reliance on feedback loops, although these concerns were less prominent in Claude’s evaluation. ChatGPT largely agreed with Claude in recognizing the Relational Staff’s strength in coordinating defenses during large-scale amphibious assaults. However, ChatGPT, like Gemini, rated the Adaptive Staff nearly as highly, emphasizing its structured feedback-driven adaptability. Importantly, ChatGPT more explicitly highlighted the potential vulnerabilities of the Adaptive Staff model, specifically the risk of feedback loop dependencies leading to decision delays in high-intensity, decentralized operations—a subtle but important distinction compared to Claude’s assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an antithesis emerges when considering the importance of human judgment in the early stages of a blockade. Historical examples, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the restraint shown by Soviet submarine commanders, underscore the critical role that human decisionmakers can play in preventing escalation. In scenarios characterized by ambiguous rules of engagement and high political stakes, human switchers embedded within the Relational Staff could provide vital discretion at the tactical edge, ensuring that localized actions do not inadvertently escalate into broader conflicts. While the AI-driven Adaptive Staff offers speed and dynamic adjustment, it may lack the intuitive judgment necessary to interpret subtle political cues or apply proportional responses under strategic ambiguity. Thus, relational models, despite their vulnerabilities, offer an irreplaceable safeguard during the initial, unstable phases of blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Relational Staff’s human-mediated discretion is invaluable under certain political-military conditions, the broader operational environment demands an organization be capable of adapting to an emergent complexity at speed and scale. The Adaptive Staff, with its dynamic, iterative structure and continuous feedback loops, best meets these demands. Its ability to process real-time information, adjust operational designs fluidly, and maintain resilience under systemic adversarial disruption ensures that it can both mitigate escalation risks when necessary and transition rapidly to decisive operational maneuver once clarity emerges. Therefore, despite the critical role of human judgment early in crisis scenarios, the adaptive staff remains the optimal foundation for future military operations characterized by complexity, speed, and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the comparative analysis highlights the operational advantages of the Adaptive Staff, translating these insights into practical implementation demands deliberate policy and organizational action. As adversaries such as the PLA continue to refine strategies aimed at degrading decisionmaking and disrupting operational tempo, the DOD must ensure that future command structures are not only technologically advanced but also resilient and adaptable under contested conditions. An agentic staff model without corresponding investments in cybersecurity, synchronization protocols, and human-machine teaming architectures risks replicating the very vulnerabilities it seeks to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even the most adaptive technical systems must be complemented by human personnel trained to operate in complex, degraded, and ambiguous environments. Building future staffs requires a dual focus: enhancing technological capacity while cultivating adaptive cognitive frameworks among leaders and operators. The ability to balance algorithmic recommendations with human judgment, particularly in high-stakes, politically charged scenarios, will define the effectiveness of AI-integrated military operations in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, strategic investment decisions must account for the dynamic nature of agentic warfare itself. The iterative, feedback-driven nature of the Adaptive Staff suggests that future operational designs will not be static. Instead, they will require continuous experimentation, rigorous red-teaming, and the rapid institutionalization of lessons learned. Organizations that fail to build these adaptive learning cycles into the very fabric of command and control risk falling behind faster-evolving adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the DOD and Congress consider the future of AI-enabled military decisionmaking, investment in resilient, adaptive, and secure staff structures is critical. The Networked Staff, Relational Staff, and Adaptive Staff models each offer advantages in speed, agility, and operational integration, but also introduce new risks that must be actively managed. Across these models, three core challenges emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure coordination and synchronization in decentralized, AI-enhanced decisionmaking environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The findings consistently showed that while decentralized decisionmaking structures like the Networked and Relational Staff models enhanced tempo and flexibility, they introduced substantial risks of fragmentation, conflicting priorities, and desynchronization—especially under adversary pressure during blockade, firepower strike, and landing scenarios. These risks were most pronounced in scenarios where distributed nodes operated without clear arbitration mechanisms, as observed in the expert discussions on system disruption vulnerabilities. Coordination protocols, synchronized command logic, and robust human oversight mechanisms must be deliberately designed to counteract these risks, ensuring unity of effort even in highly distributed operational environments. These efforts will require assigning an agency and common protocols for evaluating agentic experiments. Standards matter and must be governed in the military to ensure a framework for adapting and scaling alternatives to the Napoleonic staff construct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build cybersecurity resilience against adversary system destruction warfare, particularly PLA cyber and electronic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt; Across all campaign scenarios, the LLM analyses and expert evaluations stressed that PLA system destruction doctrine would target the network dependencies, information-sharing architectures, and real-time data flows critical to agentic staffs. This threat was particularly acute for the Networked Staff, where reliance on real-time AI inputs and decentralized decision nodes created expanded attack surfaces. Findings indicated that without hardened communication nodes, deception-resistant AI models, and resilience by design in information networks, even highly adaptive structures like the Adaptive Staff could be systematically degraded. Investments must therefore prioritize survivability of communications, deception filtering, and cyber hardening to ensure decision continuity under contested electromagnetic conditions. Sadly, these are often afterthoughts in budget submissions, meaning the DOD will need to play a more proactive role in requiring deeper cybersecurity investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train personnel to operate effectively in AI-integrated command structures while maintaining human oversight and adaptability in degraded conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; This study has repeatedly highlighted the crucial role of human facilitators (in the Adaptive Staff) and human switchers (in the Relational Staff) as critical nodes ensuring synchronization, context-driven decisionmaking, and error mitigation. Across all models, the success of AI-human integration depended on personnel trained not only to interpret AI outputs but also to actively manage feedback loops, prioritize conflicting insights, and preserve operational cohesion under dynamic conditions. Without deeper professional military education reforms emphasizing AI literacy, agent orchestration, critical reasoning under uncertainty, and dynamic decision control, future staffs risk either over-trusting or underutilizing AI systems, amplifying vulnerabilities exposed in scenarios like firepower strikes and contested landings. Thus, human capital development must be a central pillar of agentic warfare transformation. Given that this will extend across services, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness likely has a large role to play in mandating changes to policy along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these insights frame the following recommendations, which outline key investments and policy measures needed to operationalize AI-enabled staffs while mitigating their vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Launch a multiyear campaign of experimentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most important thing the DOD can do is sustain aggressive experiments that test different approaches to building new staff structures better suited to agentic warfare than their Napoleonic precursors. This will require an agile approach to experimentation that, consistent with the CDAO’s Global Information Dominance Experiment (GIDE), uses live user feedback to iteratively develop and field prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch a follow-on to GIDE that tests different staff organizations against a common set of threat scenarios. These experiments should take the form of wargames, ideally linked to standing PLA campaigns, at both unclassified and secret levels. Using a mix of open and closed games will support a broader network of evaluation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and fund a congressionally mandated reporting cycle that ensures a mix of service, DOD, and external evaluations are presented to DOD leadership, likely the deputy secretary of defense, with Congress tracking progress. These evaluations should focus on benchmarking AI models relative to different military missions and provide external evaluation of progress made in deploying AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leverage opportunities through the J7/G7 to connect the campaign of experimentation to professional military education to ensure both a common pool of players in game-driven experiments and opportunities to connect the campaign to ongoing student research. These games should provide both a test bed and a feedback mechanism for fine-tuning models and optimizing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Invest in computational infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust computational backbone is essential to ensure seamless integration of AI across decisionmaking nodes, enabling high-speed, secure, and resilient communication even in contested environments. Despite calls for broad budget cuts, it is not clear the DOD currently has the depth of computational infrastructure required to support agentic warfare in peacetime, much less in contested wartime environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch a study to estimate the following: (1) current DOD computational infrastructure; (2) estimates for how much more computational power might be required to wage agentic warfare; and (3) options for addressing any gap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in high-performance computing and distributed AI processing to allow for real-time analysis at the edge of operations, even when disconnected from centralized networks. These investments should be linked to the aforementioned study and include cooperative efforts with entities like the National Science Foundation and Department of Commerce to ensure there is a robust, resilient network of infrastructure required to both run an information-age economy and support the emergence of agentic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prototype scalable cloud and edge computing solutions that enable staff structures to operate autonomously in degraded environments on classified networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance secure, high-speed networking architectures to maintain decision continuity under adversary cyber and electronic warfare attacks. This should include parallel red-teaming events during the campaign of experimentation that explore both traditional cybersecurity and new concepts to combat adversary bots that seek to deliberately poison data used by agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Train and integrate AI for military decisionmaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure AI serves as a force multiplier rather than a liability, models must be carefully trained, integrated, and refined through operational feedback. This effort will require a broad-based educational renaissance across the U.S. military. Assuming that the United States can wage agentic warfare without warriors who understand it would be a recipe for disaster akin to historic failures like the 1942 Battle of the Savo Strait, when sailors did not understand how to use new radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in explainable AI initiatives that ensure AI models provide transparent, auditable recommendations rather than black-box outputs. These investments should build on earlier Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) efforts in this area and create new ways of better integrating university-aligned research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain a campaign of experimentation across professional military education that refines AI models through wargaming and operational exercises, leveraging real-world feedback to improve model reliability and contextual adaptability. Just as interwar education focused on decision games and map exercises, there is an opportunity to help officers learn about modern joint all-domain warfare while generating new approaches to agentic warfare in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work with the J7/G7 and key combatant commands like U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to leverage the iterated wargames discussed above to propose entirely new approaches to generating staff estimates and plans. This process will likely include reimagining the deliberate planning process and finding better ways to align crisis and contingency planning. This study should directly engage schoolhouse experimentation and identify key gaps including adjustments to professional education as well as command and control systems and computational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and test new decisionmaking protocols for agentic staffs. This effort should include mechanisms for building an AI-enabled decision audit trail and testing protocols for dealing with comms-degraded environments almost certain to impact the performance of AI agents by limiting information updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Build resilience against PLA system disruption warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s doctrine of system confrontation specifically targets AI-reliant networks, making agentic staff and their vulnerability surface and cybersecurity standards a foundational requirement for any AI-integrated staff model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop new concepts for defending agentic networks at both the service and combatant command levels. This should include, but is not limited to, (1) deploying redundant communication systems and AI deception detection measures to ensure decisionmaking continuity under contested conditions; and (2) employing network segmentation and zero-trust security protocols to prevent adversary lateral movement within staff systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train AI models using adversarial learning techniques, ensuring they can identify and counteract PLA efforts to deceive and manipulate an agentic staff. This effort to train agents to detect deception should extend to the aforementioned campaign of learning and iterated approach to learning through games to design and fight an agentic staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Enhance human capital for AI-driven decisionmaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnel remain the critical link between AI-driven insights and strategic execution. Training programs must equip staff officers with the skills necessary to operate in decentralized, AI-augmented environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop AI literacy programs focused on data analysis, visualization, and AI optimization techniques (e.g., few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation). This should include training officers in structured decision arbitration, ensuring they can synchronize competing AI recommendations without creating decision bottlenecks. While the J7/G7 can mandate this training, the DOD should coordinate with the services and Congress to ensure it is properly resourced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train personnel in AI-human teaming strategies, ensuring they can interpret, challenge, and validate AI-driven recommendations rather than blindly accepting them. This training will need to be continuous and mix individual and collective training events. For example, imagine a U.S. Army soldier taking an online course on prompt engineering and asking tactical questions and analyzing model-generated content using red-teaming techniques. This process can include learning agents tailored to the soldier that aggregates data to help the commander better understand his formation and support mission command. Similar to the previous recommendation, while the J7 can mandate a requirement, the services and Congress need to be brought into the discussion to ensure that new education requirements are matched with resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create new approaches to lessons learned that capture synthetic data and establish real-time tracking, after-action assessments, and automated feedback loops to continuously improve AI performance and synchronization mechanisms. This process should be built from the bottom up, starting at service-level lessons learned and merging into joint structures. To be effective, it will require funding a mix of data scientists and computational infrastructure to support the effort, much of which could build on the existing Advana system deployed across the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agentic warfare is becoming a reality. AI-enabled military staff structures offer transformational advantages in speed, adaptability, and operational integration, but their success depends on strategic investment in infrastructure, cybersecurity, and human-AI collaboration. Without deliberate safeguards, the PLA’s system destruction warfare approach could exploit AI dependencies, disrupt synchronization, and degrade decisionmaking effectiveness. To ensure U.S. military staffs remain resilient and operationally dominant, the DOD and Congress should prioritize investments in computational capacity, AI training, cyber resilience, and structured decision frameworks. By embedding redundancy, explainability, and continuous optimization into AI-driven decisionmaking, the U.S. military can leverage AI as a strategic advantage rather than a potential vulnerability in twenty-first-century warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistical-appendix&quot;&gt;Statistical Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables below provide the data documentation for each scenario run by model. The first table reports the complete scoring across models and PLA scenario types. All scoring was based on providing the same inputs to the models as discussed in the report to ensure consistent prompts and context that supported comparative statistical analysis of the outputs. The subsequent tables analyze how each AI agent staff performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) single-factor analysis. In this study, ANOVA provides insights on statistically significant differences across the models in general, and in particular scores the AI agents’ performance across different PLA campaign scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each table contains a summary section and an ANOVA Table. The summary table section is organized into the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groups: The different models being compared (Networked, Relational, Adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Count: Number of observations (i.e., how many scores were collected per group; here, it is 90 for each model).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sum: Total of all the scores for each model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average: Mean score for each model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variance: Statistical variance showing how spread out the scores are within each model group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANOVA table is organized into the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source of Variation: Divides the variance into “Between Groups” (differences between models) and “Within Groups” (variance inside each model).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sum of Squares (SS): Measures variability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Degrees of Freedom (df ): Number of values free to vary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mean Square (MS): SS divided by df.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The F-statistic (F): (MS Between / MS Within) used to determine if group means are statistically significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P value: Critical for interpreting ANOVA—if p &amp;lt; 0.05, the difference between group means is considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F critical: The critical value from F-distribution tables to compare against the F-statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the P value is less than 0.05, it suggests that there are statistically significant differences between at least some of the model ratings. In addition, if the F statistic is larger than F critical, it confirms that the differences between groups are statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal scenario of AI-enabled scoring, there would be robust differences in scoring across the agentic staff approaches. This would include statistically significant differences between networked, relational, and adaptive designs, both overall and across different PLA campaign scenarios; and minimal differences between models, with either no statistically significant differences in the mean scores or minimal differences (i.e., a small difference in F statistic and F critical). Combined, these data trends would indicate more robust support for one staff design over its counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis Across PLA Scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Table 1 above, all three AI foundation models (i.e., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) rated the Adaptive Staff the highest across all three PLA campaign scenarios. It had the highest average performance score (4.39), and the F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. Though generated by AI-enabled scoring, these insights reinforce the qualitative assessment that the Adaptive Staff is the best candidate for initial agentic staff experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Blockade Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 reports the findings just for blockade scenarios. Statistical analysis using a single-factor ANOVA confirmed significant differences in AI scoring across the staff models. The Adaptive Staff achieved the highest mean score of 4.07, outperforming the Relational Staff (mean 3.60) and the Networked Staff (mean 3.37). The F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (Networked, Relational, and Adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. These results reinforce the broader findings: The Adaptive Staff maintained its assessed advantage across multiple evaluation runs, providing robust support for its prioritization in future agentic warfare force design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Firepower Strike Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the joint firepower strike scenario, single-factor ANOVA results demonstrated clear performance differentiation among the staff models. The Adaptive Staff again achieved the highest mean score (4.4), edging out the Networked Staff (4.10) and significantly outperforming the Relational Staff (3.50). The F statistic is greater than F critical—though the magnitude was smaller than in the joint blockade analysis—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fyLhjKP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Landing Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the joint landing campaign scenario, the ANOVA results highlight a notable shift compared to the blockade and firepower findings. While the Adaptive Staff dominated performance in both the blockade and firepower scenarios, the Relational Staff emerged as the top performer in the landing scenario, achieving the highest mean score of 4.60. This significantly exceeded the Adaptive Staff (4.23) and the Networked Staff (mean 3.30). The F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. These findings suggest that unlike in blockade or firepower campaigns, where dynamic adaptation and distributed decisionmaking are paramount, complex cross-domain operations like an amphibious landing may benefit more from the human-machine teaming, coordinated judgment, and synchronized operational integration that characterize the Relational Staff model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 6: ANOVA: Single-Factor Analysis of Networked Staff Agents by Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff had varying results across models. Claude gave the AI agentic approach the highest score (3.83), and the result was statistically significant. Furthermore, the F statistic is greater than the F critical—albeit only slightly—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. In other words, there are small but statistically significant differences in how AI foundation models scored the Networked Staff across the three PLA campaign scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 7: ANOVA: Single-Factor Analysis of Relational Staff Agents by Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in the table above, unlike with the Networked Staff, there were no statistically significant differences in how the three foundation models scored the agentic warfare approach across the three PLA campaign scenarios. The F Statistic was also smaller than the F critical, reinforcing this finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HY9gp2H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table above analyzes how the three foundation models compare in their ratings for the Adaptive Staff approach across the three PLA campaign scenarios. Similar to the Networked Staff scoring, there are small but statistically significant differences across the models, with ChatGPT scoring the adaptive approach slightly higher (4.6) than Claude and Gemini. All three foundation models scored the Adaptive Staff higher than the alternatives despite the small difference in mean scoring across them. Furthermore, the F statistic is greater than the F critical—albeit only slightly—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. In other words, there are small but statistically significant differences in how AI foundation models scored the Adaptive Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is increasingly weaponizing its chokehold over critical minerals amid intensifying economic and technological competition with the United States. The critical mineral gallium, which is crucial to defense industry supply chains and new energy technologies, has been at the front line of China’s strategy. To date, China’s chokehold on rare earth metals has attracted more attention than its restrictions on gallium, and some have downplayed the potential consequences of disruptions to gallium supply chains. Yet CSIS analysis reveals the extent to which China can wield gallium to impose significant economic harm on the United States and its allies and partners. This CSIS Brief unpacks the scope of the problem and offers policy recommendations on how to bolster U.S. and allied economic security and deny China a key tool of economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-and-key-findings&quot;&gt;Introduction and Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid spiraling trade tensions with the United States, Beijing has brandished a new arsenal of economic weapons, with few proving more potent than its export controls on critical minerals. As of May 2025, China had restricted the export of at least 16 key minerals and alloys, many of which are essential inputs for products ranging from consumer electronics to F-35 fighter jets. These measures have struck deep into U.S. and allied supply chains, and appear to have given China substantial leverage in its ongoing trade and technology negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the impacts of these controls hit global markets, examining the case of gallium—a little-known but crucial metal—offers a powerful warning signal. China has a near-total monopoly over gallium production, accounting for a startling 98 percent of the world’s primary supply. The mineral was among the first to be caught in the escalating tit-for-tat trade restrictions between the United States and China, making headlines when it landed on Beijing’s export control list (alongside germanium) in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That initial broadside was largely a warning shot designed to showcase Beijing’s capacity to impose pain on sensitive U.S. supply chains while limiting broader impacts on the global economy. Now, China is tightening the screws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research by CSIS, supported by data provided by minerals supply chain intelligence company Rovjok, reveals that China’s gallium restrictions are having a greater impact than previously anticipated. This is due to both tighter enforcement against transshipment and new controls on specialized gallium extraction technologies that are not available outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief presents several key findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s gallium export controls have incrementally tightened in response to expanding U.S. technology restrictions. Its measures have ratcheted up from licensing requirements and end-user controls to a total export ban targeting the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global dependence on Chinese primary gallium is now causing a gallium supply crunch that may soon impact key production lines as firms draw down their stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s most recent round of export controls on gallium extraction technologies could impede U.S. and allied efforts to quickly develop economically competitive alternative supply sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market forces alone are unlikely to solve the problem. Targeted government investment will be critical to breaking China’s gallium monopoly and undercutting its geopolitical leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to this mounting crisis will require the United States to take urgent steps to develop alternative sources of gallium supply and extraction technologies. Fortunately, the financial investments needed are relatively modest and promising solutions are well within reach—but only with a level of sustained policy attention that has only just begun to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galliums-role-in-chinas-geoeconomic-strategy&quot;&gt;Gallium’s Role in China’s Geoeconomic Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s use of critical mineral export controls is not a new phenomenon, but it has evolved in recent years from a policy bludgeon to a precision tool. A defining early example came in 2011, when Beijing temporarily withheld rare earth exports to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. China backed off from those restrictions within months, but not before sending rare earth prices skyrocketing over 80 percent and leaving Japanese officials scrambling for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, China trained this threat against the United States. As trade frictions flared under the first Trump administration, Chinese leader Xi Jinping publicly visited a rare earth processing facility in a conspicuous warning about the potential costs of further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the ensuing years, China further strengthened its hand by developing a legal and regulatory framework to transform these scattered actions into a comprehensive export control system. In 2020, the Chinese legislature passed the Export Control Law, which gave Beijing streamlined authorities to exercise “control on the export of dual-use items.” Unprecedented in Chinese export control regimes, the law included a provision claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning even entities outside of China could be held accountable for violating its statutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QdJALAR.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: China’s Escalating Export Controls Impacting Gallium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, China put these tools to the test, announcing new licensing requirements limiting the export of gallium and germanium. The rules were broadly seen as retaliation against a series of landmark export controls put in place between October 2022 and July 2023 by the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands banning the sale of leading-edge chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s initial restrictions were cautious but calculated. Stopping short of an outright ban, they required gallium and germanium exporters to apply for licenses and disclose detailed end-use tracing information about their clients to China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Notably, MOFCOM emphasized that these measures did “not target any specific country.” Still, the move sent a powerful signal that if China’s semiconductor industry were denied Western chips and tools, China could deny the West crucial raw materials and intermediate inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing significantly tightened these restrictions as U.S. technology controls ramped up. In December 2024, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security announced a package of expanded chip-related controls, including the addition of 140 Chinese semiconductor firms onto its Entity List. Just one day later, MOFCOM issued an update to its own export controls which functionally banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order marked the most stringent export controls China has put in place. For the first time, the ruling asserted the long-arm jurisdiction that China built into its Export Control Law years earlier, declaring that “any organization or individual of any country or region” would be held responsible for violating it. In effect, the rule formally outlawed the re-export or transshipment of gallium and other covered materials to the United States through third countries or territories, closing a major enforcement loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than one month later, Beijing took its gallium export controls even further in a quiet but consequential move. On January 2, 2025, MOFCOM amended its export control catalogue to include several of the key extraction technologies used to separate gallium metal from its host ores (generally bauxite or zinc). The addition indicates that China is now taking steps to preserve its leverage over gallium supply chains by withholding the most cost-efficient means of extracting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, China escalated once again by launching a coordinated interagency push to crack down on the smuggling and transshipment of restricted critical minerals. Coinciding with high-level U.S.-China trade discussions in Geneva, China’s State Export Control Work Coordination Mechanism Office convened over 10 central ministries—including MOFCOM and the Ministry of State Security (MSS)—as well as dozens of local officials to deepen enforcement over strategic mineral exports. China’s MSS has previously publicized its efforts to foil gallium smuggling attempts, but the new mechanism reflects Beijing’s deepened commitment to reinforcing its emerging export control system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creeping expansion of China’s gallium restrictions, from limited licensing requirements and end-user controls to full on embargos and long-arm export bans, offers important clues as to how the ongoing trade war may escalate. Beijing has already shown that it can use the progression of its gallium export controls as a playbook for choking off the United States and its partners from a broader range of strategic minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reassessing-the-impacts-of-chinas-gallium-export-controls&quot;&gt;Reassessing the Impacts of China’s Gallium Export Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reactions in the United States to China’s gallium export restrictions downplayed the potential for disruption. In the months following China’s first 2023 announcement of its controls, company representatives, policy analysts, and government officials expressed confidence that production lines would remain unaffected and that alternative sources would quickly come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading chipmakers and downstream manufacturers reassured reporters and investors that their supplies were diversified, assessing that there would be “no material impact.” Citing international customs and trade data, analysts pointed to the low amount of gallium products imported directly from China to the United States to suggest that dependencies were negligible. Even U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan appeared unconcerned, remarking at a CSIS event in late 2024 that “there are other sources of . . . gallium in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, these optimistic assessments obscured deeper structural vulnerabilities that have grown increasingly acute as China’s gallium controls have tightened. This analysis highlights three key developments which suggest that the risk of China’s gallium restrictions to U.S. and allied supply chains is greater than previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-1-diverging-prices-within-and-outside-of-china-reflect-a-growing-supply-crunch&quot;&gt;Key Point 1: Diverging prices within and outside of China reflect a growing supply crunch.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since China’s export controls went into effect in August 2023, the price of gallium has diverged sharply between domestic Chinese and international markets. Within a month of the initial announcement, low-purity gallium prices in the Rotterdam exchange spiked by over 43 percent as Chinese suppliers halted shipments while applying for export licenses from MOFCOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surge can be partially explained by a widespread rush by international buyers to stockpile gallium before the controls took effect. However, prices did not come back down even after demand stabilized, reflecting the impact of a supply-side squeeze caused by reduced Chinese exports of gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsJszeQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Gallium Price Shocks and Supply Shortages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of gallium outside of China, represented by its listed price on the Rotterdam exchange, has continued to significantly diverge from domestic price points as Chinese exports have fallen. By early 2024, prices appeared to have largely decoupled into two distinct markets, with gallium sold outside of China at nearly double the price of that within China (see Figure 2). Chinese customs data helps tell the story, showing that the country’s average monthly gallium exports drop significantly after August 2023 (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qpUp259.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: China’s Unwrought Gallium Exports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends have intensified following China’s escalation of its controls to a full-scale embargo on the U.S. market beginning in December 2024. Tighter due diligence requirements, imposed by the extraterritoriality clause in the new controls, have further reduced China’s gallium exports and caused prices to surge to record highs. By mid-December, gallium prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 and continued to climb precipitously. In May 2025, the Rotterdam price of gallium reached $687 per kg, an increase of over 150 percent over pre-control prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, gallium prices within China have fallen due a combination of domestic oversupply and a lower demand outlook triggered by a recent shift in China’s photovoltaics industry away from technologies requiring gallium. The fact that this excess supply is not being exported, despite sky-high prices in overseas markets, reflects the seriousness of Beijing’s most recent controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compelling anecdotal evidence provided by firms similarly points to a major supply crunch impacting not only U.S. companies but also major firms in allied countries like Japan and South Korea. Japanese officials and executives have expressed concern over the impacts of China’s newly escalated licensing requirements on gallium exports, equating the rules to “some sort of declaration of economic war against the rest of the world.” South Korean sources have similarly reported to the authors that Korean firms have been forced to wait months for licenses from MOFCOM, with some being denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments confirm analysts’ worst fears about China’s ability and willingness to meaningfully constrain global access to gallium. While the full extent of the impact of these measures on sensitive production lines remains unclear, companies downstream of the gallium supply chain could soon face dire challenges. The case of Henkel, a German producer of industrial adhesives that was recently forced to declare force majeure on its deliveries due to disruptions from China’s restrictions of antimony, stands as a dire warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-2-non-chinese-sources-of-gallium-remain-reliant-on-feedstock-originally-sourced-from-china&quot;&gt;Key Point 2: Non-Chinese sources of gallium remain reliant on feedstock originally sourced from China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s decision to target gallium was driven by unique market dynamics that provide Beijing with an unusual degree of leverage over the mineral’s global supply. In 2024, China produced 98 percent of the world’s low-purity gallium, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS)—a figure well above its share of production of other targeted minerals such as germanium (68 percent) and antimony (48 percent). As a result of this near total monopoly, China can credibly withhold access to gallium supply from downstream markets, leaving buyers with few short-term alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively small quantity of gallium consumed globally each year similarly provides China with acute leverage over markets. Annual demand for gallium is below 700 metric tons (t) internationally, a fraction of the massive markets for minerals like copper (25.9 million t) or nickel (3.1 million t). While demand for gallium is rising quickly, its comparatively small market means that even limited supply variations can have significant impacts on its global availability. This also makes gallium prices highly sensitive to minor supply adjustments, giving Beijing considerable leverage to manipulate market forces by artificially releasing or withholding flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OsZqAQU.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Global Gallium Supply Projections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s stranglehold over gallium supply chains is rooted in its leading position in aluminum production. Gallium is not extracted directly from the earth—instead, it is recovered as a byproduct of processing other materials, primarily bauxite (the mother ore of aluminum), with a small amount also from zinc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China emerged as the world’s dominant producer of aluminum over the past two decades, it also developed the scale and technical capabilities to mass-produce gallium. Leading state-owned aluminum processors like the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco) were encouraged by state authorities to install the equipment needed to extract gallium from aluminum tailings. As China’s production of low-purity gallium began to explode and flood global markets around 2010, severe price fluctuations forced most of the leading non-Chinese suppliers out of the business over the following decade (see Figure 5a and 5b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left as virtually the only supplier in the world, China found itself with the means to translate its market dominance over gallium into geopolitical leverage in a way that few in the West saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7C2SJcm.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: A. Global Aluminum Production; B. Global Gallium Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even firms not directly reliant on low-purity gallium could soon begin to feel the impacts of China’s restrictions. China’s direct dominance over gallium recedes further down the supply chain, diminishing to around 50 percent in the production of refined (high-purity) gallium and even less for intermediate products like gallium compounds and semiconductor wafers. Yet, these downstream inputs remain almost entirely dependent on gallium feedstock originating in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively scant publicly available data on gallium flows has contributed to an illusion of supply chain resilience among some U.S. firms and analysts. The United States has never imported a majority of its low-purity gallium from China, creating the appearance of a diversified supply. Even after U.S. imports of Chinese gallium zeroed out following China’s 2023 export controls, the United States was still able to source imports from countries like Japan, Germany, and other partners, suggesting that it could easily route around Chinese controls. For high-purity gallium, the United States even has one domestically based supplier in operation, reducing its reliance on imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zEeOeFU.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Gallium Production Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s new export controls should complicate this sense of security. MOFCOM’s licensing system now requires importers of Chinese gallium to provide detailed end-user tracing information, and foreign firms that supply U.S. companies with gallium at any point in the supply chain risk losing access to their only viable source of raw gallium if discovered. This creates strong incentives for foreign firms to halt service to their U.S. customers, as the marginal U.S. market for gallium likely does not justify the risks involved. These dynamics are further heightened by uncertainty over the extent of China’s enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a8gTHcD.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: A. Low-Purity Gallium Exports by Origin Country; B. Estimated High-Purity Gallium Exports by Origin Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s expanded controls could also begin to impact the few existing alternatives to Chinese gallium feedstock, which are primarily recycling facilities that recover gallium from scrap generated via the downstream wafer substrate manufacturing process. As an example, Japan uses approximately 40 percent of domestically recovered scrap and 60 percent primary low-purity gallium from China as feedstock into its domestic refining production. Still, the production capacity at its recycling facilities is limited and relatively costly, and ultimately it remains reliant on drawdowns from existing inventories that could gradually shrink as China further withholds upstream supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges are reflected in a detailed 2024 study by the U.S. Geological Survey—published prior to China’s updated export controls—which estimates that a full-scale Chinese embargo of gallium could cause an $8 billion hit to U.S. gross domestic product. The largest projected losses were concentrated in the semiconductor industry, underscoring the vulnerability of strategic U.S. supply chains to China’s controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-3-new-export-controls-on-gallium-extraction-technology-further-undercut-the-price-competitiveness-for-non-chinese-producers&quot;&gt;Key Point 3: New export controls on gallium extraction technology further undercut the price competitiveness for non-Chinese producers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominant position over gallium supply chains extends beyond the raw material itself. A more opaque but similarly consequential constraint lies in the specialized resin technology used to extract gallium from bauxite ore processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, China’s dominance over gallium production is not the result of a monopoly over access to deposits—gallium is fairly abundant—but rather its unmatched ability to extract the metal at scale and at lower cost. Chinese state-backed companies have outpaced global competitors by investing in the energy-intensive, chemically complex, and environmentally taxing process of extracting gallium from the Bayer liquor created during the processing of bauxite ore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most expensive steps in this process is isolating gallium from ore tailings at volumes that make production commercially viable. Chinese firms have innovated new methods of doing this at lowered costs. In particular, the chemical company Sunresin has developed a proprietary chelating resin tailored for gallium recovery. This resin outperforms older methods in both adsorption capacity and operational lifespan, allowing producers to extract more gallium per cycle with less material degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of China’s dominant domestic gallium industry, Chinese firms can produce these resins with economies of scale that their overseas competitors cannot match. Chinese facilities can thus produce gallium more cheaply and further extend their dominance, creating a positive feedback loop. This high-performance resin is critical to keeping China’s production costs well below what Western producers can match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is compounded by the fact that this resin is neither widely manufactured outside of China nor readily substitutable. Sunresin produces as much as 90 percent of the global supply. While other methods of extracting gallium exist, they are more expensive and degrade more quickly, making it difficult for non-Chinese producers to compete with China on price, even under normal market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the strategic value of this technology, Chinese authorities in 2025 quietly expanded their export controls to include the resin itself. A January update added “technologies for extracting gallium metal from alumina mother liquor using ion-exchange or resin methods” (通过离子交换法、树脂法等方法从氧化铝母液中提取金属镓的技术和工艺) to MOFCOM’s export control list. Industry sources have reported that exports of the high-performance resin have ceased entirely due to these new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its allies, this presents a fundamental obstacle to rebuilding domestic gallium supply chains. Even with feedstock and refining infrastructure in place, producers outside of China are unlikely to achieve competitive costs without equivalent resin performance. Until incentives are put in place to support the production of high-performance resin at adequate scale, non-Chinese producers will struggle to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galliums-strategic-significance&quot;&gt;Gallium’s Strategic Significance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium is used within a wide range of technologies, from advanced semiconductors to light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and permanent magnets. Yet, gallium’s true importance to the United States is not reflected properly in official reporting. The USGS shows gallium consumption in the United States to be around 20 t per year. However, taking into account imports of gallium-based wafers, magnets, and LEDs, consumption is likely far higher, up to 200 t per year (see Figure 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8CGcivH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: United States Estimated Annual Gallium Consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, gallium’s outsized importance to key defense supply chains has elevated its value as a source of strategic leverage for China. China’s decision to open its controls with gallium—rather than other more commercially important minerals—allowed it to signal its capacity to disrupt U.S. and allied defense production while avoiding broader damage to its own economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of gallium to advanced defense systems is difficult to overstate. Gallium compounds enable a class of “wide bandgap” semiconductors that outperform silicon in extreme operating conditions. Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, for example, can operate at higher voltages and temperatures with lower losses, making them ideal for advanced radar, electronic warfare systems, and other applications requiring efficient power conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. defense systems have incorporated gallium-based technology for decades, but gallium compounds have taken on an increasingly critical role. Recent improvements in GaN chip design and falling fabrication costs have brought about rapid advances in next-generation radar technology. Widespread adoption of GaN chips has enabled smaller radar modules to track targets with higher resolution at farther distances. GaN-backed modules have been integrated into the U.S. military’s most important modern radar systems, including the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 radar, the Marine Corps’ G/ATOR radar, the Army’s LTAMDS radar, the Missile Defense Agency’s AN/TPY-2 radar, and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter’s upgraded AESA radar, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium-enabled radar systems will also play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome” proposed by President Donald Trump. For example, Lockheed’s GaN-based Long Range Discrimination Radar—which is currently undergoing field testing in Alaska and will likely go into service next year—would form a crucial layer in the system’s defense against ballistic missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gallium-enabled radar systems will play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Department of Defense has invested millions of dollars in recent years to develop another emerging compound, called gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has an even wider bandgap and better performance potential than GaN, and it could form the backbone of a new generation of even more powerful and efficient defense electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other technical developments have made U.S. and allied defense systems deeply reliant on technologies made with gallium. Open-source assessments reveal that over 11,000 individual parts used across the U.S. Department of Defense require gallium, and nearly 85 percent of defense supply chains containing gallium are known to include at least one Chinese supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key U.S. allies and security partners, ranging from Poland to Saudi Arabia to Taiwan, have also placed orders for U.S.-built GaN-enabled radar systems in recent years. As a result, supply vulnerabilities extend beyond the United States to its most important strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-chinas-monopoly&quot;&gt;Breaking China’s Monopoly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which China can derive leverage from its monopoly over gallium production fundamentally depends on how fast alternative supply sources can come online. If plants outside of China can rapidly begin or restart gallium extraction, then China’s ability to threaten global supply chains will quickly diminish. While promising initiatives are underway to establish new gallium production capabilities, decisive government action is needed to ensure these efforts are protected from China’s market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-limits-of-market-forces&quot;&gt;The Limits of Market Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, the gallium problem appears to have a clear market solution. As China restricts global supply, the rising global price of gallium should entice new producers into the market, creating alternatives to Chinese supply. The more China uses its leverage, the less it should have left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the unique market characteristics of gallium discussed in the previous section mean that this challenge is unlikely to be solved by market forces alone. With near-complete control over the floodgates of global supply, Beijing can easily manipulate gallium prices to desired levels. In practice, this means that firms seeking to enter the market cannot guarantee that the market price of gallium will remain high enough to cover production costs. If alternative suppliers appear to be ramping up production, China could suddenly flood the market, cratering prices and erasing profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium’s small market size relative to the huge aluminum market further adds to the challenge. For a Western alumina refinery, adding a gallium side-stream would impart additional complexity and risk for only a tiny fraction of the revenue generated by its alumina production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s exclusive access to the most advanced resins used to extract gallium also gives its domestic refineries a significant cost advantage, further reducing incentives for foreign firms to compete. Absent market conditions that can support the scaled production of gallium extraction resins outside of China, non-Chinese firms will likely remain at a prohibitively large cost disadvantage in primary gallium production compared with their Chinese competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors reflect the limits of relying on market forces to respond to China’s export controls. While current market conditions (characterized by rising demand, highly constrained supply, and high prices) have spurred considerable interest from new gallium producers worldwide, a long-term solution will require sustained government action if it is to incentivize firms to enter the market and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-domestic-opportunities&quot;&gt;U.S. Domestic Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these market limitations, government intervention will be necessary to ensure that short-term, long-term, and emergency requirements for gallium material can be readily met. Some U.S. government agencies have taken initial steps toward finding alternative suppliers, yet more work is needed to move beyond assessments toward concrete action. This includes taking swift action to support promising efforts by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal investments to expand domestic gallium production have begun to take shape. In 2024, the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub) announced up to $10 million in federal funding to accelerate early-stage R&amp;amp;D for critical mineral extraction technologies, including gallium. This funding aims to unlock more efficient methods for gallium byproduct recovery, separation, and concentration—areas where the United States has lagged behind China’s resin-based extraction processes. The Department of Defense (DOD) has similarly begun using its Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities to prioritize awards for gallium recovery projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are positive first steps toward meeting long-term needs, more action is required to address the immediate and short-term vulnerabilities caused by China’s tightening restrictions. For example, while the DOD maintains a National Defense Stockpile (NDS) of critical materials, this does not include gallium. Even in the wake of China’s export controls, the Defense Logistics Agency—which manages the NDS—left gallium off its materials procurement plan for 2025. While the NDS has limitations, the idea of including a minimum stockpile of gallium is a low-cost insurance policy against the worst-case outcomes of China’s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More federal support can also accelerate promising efforts that are already underway to find viable domestic supply alternatives. The Idaho National Laboratory is leading the development of integrated separation and processing systems for rare earth–rich ore bodies, such as those at the Sheep Creek deposit in Montana. Notably, recent geological assessments at Sheep Creek suggest the site contains the highest concentrations of gallium found in any known U.S. deposit. Private sector partners such as the U.S. Critical Materials Corporation are actively seeking to scale this discovery into commercial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another initiative worthy of close attention is MTM Critical Metals’ pre-permitted facility in Texas, which aims to deploy a patent-protected process for extracting gallium from industrial scrap. Scheduled to begin operations in early 2026—an unusually rapid timeline for critical-mineral projects—the plant could provide the first domestic source of gallium recovered largely outside Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, MTM is reportedly negotiating binding agreements that lock in scrap feedstock and set minimum offtake prices with Indium Corporation, a leading U.S. supplier of purified gallium to semiconductor fabs. These price-floor provisions are expressly designed to shield the venture from Chinese market manipulation, offering a test case for how contractual innovation can complement technical advances in rebuilding resilient supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, industrial retrofit opportunities present low-hanging fruit for production scale-up. For example, Atalco’s Gramercy Refinery in Louisiana—the only operating alumina refinery in the United States—could support side-stream gallium recovery with relatively modest upgrades. Similarly, Nyrstar has touted a $150 million effort to build a gallium and germanium processing facility at its existing zinc plant in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging developments, warning signs prove why government backing is essential for long-term success. In October 2023, Nyrstar’s operations at its Clarksville zinc smelter—where it intended to install gallium and germanium recovery equipment—was put on indefinite hold after financing and engineering challenges delayed key milestones. The episode mirrors the fate of Australia’s Pinjarra gallium refinery, which was forced to cease operations in the 1990s when low prices and a lack of policy support erased commercial margins. Both cases illustrate the importance of sustained government incentives, stable offtake contracts, and clear policy signals that strategic minerals production will be rewarded over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-collaboration-with-allied-producers&quot;&gt;International Collaboration with Allied Producers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding gallium supply chains at speed cannot be achieved through domestic sources alone. While establishing a reliable domestic supply is a reasonable strategic objective, it should be secondary to the urgent task of quickly developing large-scale gallium production outside of China. Ultimately, these efforts should prioritize projects that add gallium side-stream capacity at large-scale aluminum refiners, most of which are located outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusted partners in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe each bring unique capabilities and reserves that can narrow gaps in U.S. capacity. The recent designation of Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources for DPA funds was a critical step in leveraging allied advantages, but more international coordination with like-minded global partners is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada already hosts North America’s only gallium producer, Neo Performance Materials. Although its operations are currently limited to recycling scrap inputs, it could help bridge the gap as primary production comes online. More significantly, Rio Tinto is exploring gallium recovery from alumina tailings at its Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean refinery in Quebec. If commercial-scale processing proceeds as planned, Rio Tinto could eventually supply 40 t of gallium annually—enough to meaningfully diversify North American supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia represents perhaps the greatest near-term opportunity for large-scale gallium production. Alumina refineries operated by South32 and Alcoa in Western Australia account for the largest such capacity outside of China, and given that gallium is recovered as a byproduct of alumina refining, these operations offer compelling economies of scale. Industry analysis suggests that building side-stream gallium recovery plants at these sites could be cost-effective and yield up to 40 t annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Nimy Resources is exploring secure gallium supply chains for U.S. defense applications through a collaboration with M2i Global. The partnership reflects the value of demand-side signaling from the U.S. government to spur up-front investment from private firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, in partnership with the United States and South Korea, has committed to strengthening critical mineral supply chains, including gallium, under a trilateral framework announced in June 2024. Japan has a long history of utilizing gallium in its advanced electronics industry and is among the largest producers of gallium outside of China. The agreement highlights the shared priority of developing enhanced refining and processing capabilities—critical steps in reducing dependence on Chinese intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe also shows signs of renewed momentum. Greek metals group Metlen plans to extract gallium as part of a €295 million expansion to its alumina production capacity, aiming for 50 t of gallium annually by 2027. This initiative has been designated as a strategic project under the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act, ensuring priority access to permits and financing. Meanwhile, Germany’s Stade refinery—once a major gallium producer—has announced plans to restart operations by 2027, potentially adding another 40 t per year to the global supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whether these new sources of supply will be accessible to U.S. buyers will depend on the evolving global trade landscape. The Trump administration’s tenuous relationship with many traditional trading partners may cause political roadblocks, and European policymakers may seek to channel the material to their own clean-tech and defense sectors first. Proactive U.S.–EU negotiations on long-term offtake agreements will therefore be essential to lock in access before production comes fully online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Kazakhstan—while not a traditional U.S. ally or security partner—previously produced primary gallium at the Padvolar refinery up until the early 2010s. It has recently suggested that production will recommence, with a target of 15 t per year from the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doubling down on its gallium and other critical mineral restrictions, China’s leaders appear to have calculated that the country’s dominance over the global supply of minerals upstream of critical high-tech supply chains provides it with meaningful leverage over its rivals. Current trends reflect the worrying possibility that they could be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, acting quickly to shore up these vulnerabilities is a critical test of U.S. and allied resilience against China’s emerging economic tool kit. Failing to respond effectively will send dangerous signals to Beijing about its ability to inflict asymmetric pain on the United States and allied economies. Fortunately, the United States and its global partners can take straightforward steps to neutralize China’s leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If even a subset of the above international and domestic projects come online as planned, non-Chinese production capacity could grow by as much as 170 t—approximately 24 percent of current global supply. This would not only be sufficient to meet much of allied demand but could also help rebalance global pricing and undercut the effectiveness of China’s market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capitalize on these opportunities, policymakers should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in a gallium defense stockpile using existing Defense Production Act authorities.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense should expand its Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Program to include at least 50 t of gallium over a five-year horizon. The stockpile should prioritize sourcing from non-Chinese suppliers under long-term offtake agreements and could be administered through the Defense Logistics Agency. Gallium has a shelf life of just one year, requiring careful inventory management to prevent degradation and ensure a reliable reserve during periods of supply disruption. The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides $2 billion for critical minerals stockpiling through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. A small portion of these funds allocated toward gallium would go far in securing adequate supply for defense needs. Congress should also require an annual assessment of gallium supply adequacy under the National Defense Authorization Act to institutionalize visibility and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand federal matching funds for gallium and germanium recovery pilots at existing zinc and alumina refineries.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Energy’s Office of Industrial Efficiency and the Department of Commerce should jointly create a pilot-scale retrofit fund—modeled on the 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit—specifically targeted at adding gallium recovery capabilities at existing facilities like South32’s Worsley Alumina in Western Australia and Nyrstar’s Clarksville Smelter. Matching should prioritize first-mover projects in facilities that coproduce high-purity alumina or zinc, where side-stream economics are most viable. These agreements should also be supported with floor-price and guaranteed offtake arrangements backed by stockpiling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a joint procurement mechanism with allies to de-risk early production volumes and stabilize demand signals.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should work with Japan, the European Union, and Canada to establish a pooled purchasing program—similar to NATO’s Strategic Airlift Capability—to jointly contract initial volumes of gallium from new projects. This could take the form of forward offtake agreements with price floors indexed to Chinese domestic gallium benchmarks, insulating new producers from deliberate undercutting by Beijing. Procurement agencies such as the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, Japan’s JOGMEC, and the European Union’s EIT Raw Materials could coadminister this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen multilateral coordination through the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) to ensure cross-border investment, data sharing, and streamlined permitting for critical mineral projects.&lt;/strong&gt; MSP members should create a shared project tracking database for gallium-relevant extraction, refining, purification, and recycling initiatives, including harmonized data on projected output, permitting status, and investor needs. Additionally, the United States should propose the creation of a “fast track” gallium permitting lane for projects in allied jurisdictions, modeled on the Five Eyes’ clean energy infrastructure cooperation frameworks. The MSP could also coordinate diplomatic engagement with European nations where gallium projects are underway, such as Greece and Germany, to ensure U.S. access to gallium produced under EU strategic materials programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方鄺俊宇和涂謹申同屬民主黨參與初選卻未被起訴&quot;&gt;上訴方：鄺俊宇和涂謹申同屬民主黨、參與初選卻未被起訴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文繼續陳詞。他指，沒有任何證據顯示黃和林直接與戴耀廷溝通，也沒有直接證據顯示二人對「35+」以外、戴的涉案計劃知情，或者閱讀過戴的文章。即使二人純粹知悉戴的「攬炒」主張、吳政亨「三投三不投」和「墨落無悔」聲明，也不會等同於二人同意犯罪協議，即「無差別」否決財案。沈強調，參與初選本身並不足以證明二人同意犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈提及同樣來自民主黨、但未被起訴的初選參與者，包括鄺俊宇和涂謹申，亦提及有兩人經審訊被裁定罪名不成立，可見法庭必須有足夠證據肯定被告同意「無差別」否決財案，迫使特首下台，才能定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，黃和林沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，二人對於「無差別」否決財案並不感興趣，也沒有出席過初選協調會議。因此法庭手上便沒有任何證據，因為二人從沒就「無差別」否決財案發表過任何言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方不排除民主黨對否決財案沒有統一立場&quot;&gt;上訴方：不排除民主黨對否決財案沒有統一立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，沒有證據證明民主黨所有成員行事統一，「這是一個神話」，需要有證據支持。然而兩名控方證人、前民主黨成員區諾軒和趙家賢，作供時未有提及民主黨的內部運作，例如黨員是否行動一致。警方到被告住所搜屋時，也未有檢取到任何文件或會議紀錄，能夠證明到民主黨對於否決財案的議題持統一的立場。再者，法庭並不能知道民主黨立場的鬆散或統一程度，其中一個可能的推論是，民主黨對於否決財案並沒有一個統一的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，原審法官在裁決中引述時任民主黨主席胡志偉在初選論壇上的發言，「今日喺香港，我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人其實都係好清楚，反對國安法⋯⋯我哋參與呢個初選自必然亦都一定會係會運用我哋嘅喺議會上面嘅否決權，財政預算案嘅否決權，去迫使到特區政府同中央政府必須要回應五大訴求⋯⋯」，並推論「我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人」包括黃和林，從而裁定必然會否決財案。然而，沈指「我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人」僅意指出席當日九龍東區初選論壇的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，法庭單憑胡志偉的發言，不能作出唯一合理推論指所有民主黨成員均支持否決財案，這是錯誤的。若然民主黨沒有任何統一的立場，又若然當中有任何疑點，法庭便沒有足夠的證據去將黃碧雲和林卓廷定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈引述九龍西選舉論壇的發言，當另一名參選人劉澤鋒質問黃碧雲：「民主黨係咪應承一齊攬炒先？」黃碧雲回應：「我哋係會用盡憲制裡面所有嘅權力同埋手段係爭取五大訴求，如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」沈指上述顯示黃只會運用《基本法》框架內的權力，而否認支持「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈另引述林卓廷的論壇發言，談及否決財案時，林稱「我哋要睇具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又表明若果政府在財政預算案中包含「派錢」的話，便不會投反對票。沈指，上述言論顯示林否認他會「無差別」否決財案，亦證明了民主黨成員之間並沒有統一的立場，否則林便會被黨排斥（an outcast）。沈又重申，雖然論壇筆記提及他附和胡志偉否決財案的主意，但是一旦談及有關議題的時候，林卓廷並沒有按照論壇筆記發言、偏離了標準答案，可見林有其個人觀點，而且他不支持「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又質疑，原審法官未有考慮上述證據，定罪是不合邏輯，然而對於另一名被告劉偉聰不跟從論壇筆記發言的說法卻接納。沈指，關於林是否同意否決財案方面，至少存在疑點，並強調上述提及的證據均顯示黃和林沒有顛覆政權的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍若正確解讀證供-必不會無差別地否決-反稱會認真審視財案&quot;&gt;何桂藍：若正確解讀證供 必不會「無差別地」否決 反稱會認真審視財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 指，沒有證據顯示何在案發期間知悉涉案謀劃是不合法，直至法庭裁定該涉案謀劃是不合法，根據法律原則不應裁定被告有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又指，原審法官錯誤地拒絕接納何的證供，重申何認為「35+」不可能達成，她參選只為了鼓勵人們出來投票以得到最大票數，引起國際社會的關注。何亦在作供時提及，政府財政預算案存在「公共財政黑洞」、「魔鬼在細節中」，若她當選議員的話會用盡所有機會向政府提問，Beel 指這顯示她會認真審視財案，必定不會「無差別地」否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又引述何供稱，不論「35+」或「35-」也好，如果政府的議案未有被認真審視、政府迴避議員監察或審核程序有不公，她都一定會投反對票，顯示她著眼公帑是否運用得當。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，原審法官錯誤地解讀何桂藍的證供，若然正確地解讀的話，便會知道何希望立法會成為一個有效的議會，能夠恰當地行使職能，以向政府問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又指，原審法官錯誤地推論被告有意圖顛覆政權。控方指稱被告透過「無差別」否決財案，意圖引致政府癱瘓，觸發憲政危機，惟Beel 反駁指，「憲政危機」的意思是一些不能解決到的危機或衝突，然而《基本法》第50至53條訂明的機制，能夠處理財案被否決之後的情況，因此並不會引發憲政危機。原審法官在裁決中指稱財案被否決後會引致嚴重後果，只屬揣測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成墨落無悔正好反映參選者對於無差別否決不存在共識&quot;&gt;鄒家成：「墨落無悔」正好反映參選者對於「無差別否決」不存在共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭指，鄒不相信能夠達到「35+」，甚至認為連「Plan B」也會被DQ，若是如此，涉案串謀的基礎便不存在，惟原審法官未有接納鄒的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，原審法官錯誤地裁定鄒是參與涉案謀劃的一份子。鄒供稱他未曾收妥初選協調會議文件，惟這說法不被法庭接納，即使他有收過有關文件，也不代表他同意文件內容。單憑鄒收妥協調會議文件，並不足以證明鄒同意涉案謀劃，或使法庭作出唯一不可抗拒推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒連同另外兩人發起「墨落無悔」聯署，關指因為初選參與者之間就「是否否決財案」沒有共識，所以像鄒這般的「政治素人」便以「墨落無悔」作為一種手段，去迫使民主黨和公民黨等傳統泛民去達致共識。「墨落無悔」正好反映參選者之間對於「無差別否決」方面並不存在共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又投訴，原審法官基於鄒的政見是親本土派，便推斷他會「無差別」否決財案，以迫使政府回應訴求，可是鄒的政見頂多只能是一種證明傾向性的證據，如果法庭以此來推論他參與一個嚴重的串謀計劃，未免過於危險。關強調，持有親本土派立場本身不是一種罪名，但是若然法庭利用政見來推論被告有罪，便會非常危險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成作供時原審官多次介入提問-質疑未能獲得公平審訊&quot;&gt;鄒家成：作供時原審官多次介入提問 質疑未能獲得公平審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭亦投訴，原審法官在鄒作供主問期間多次介入，使他未能得到公平審訊。關引述法庭謄本並舉例指，當鄒在證人台上供稱他認為「35+」不可能時，法官李運騰隨即提問，鄒家成遂解釋他的說法，然後法官陳慶偉說：「那沒有邏輯的」，其後庭上開展一輪討論；關質疑情況猶如一名陪審員公開地在庭上評論證人的供詞沒有邏輯，若然審訊設有陪審團的話，便猶如某一名陪審員向另一名陪審員說被告的證供沒有邏輯，有機會引致不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關並提及另一個例子，在主問期間，當辯方問到成立獨立調查委員會的訴求，會如何反映在預算案，惟法官陳慶偉主動提到他本人曾主持「鉛水事件」的獨立調查委員會，而該調查委員會從來沒有反映在預算案。關認為，陳官當時做法等同在法官席上給予證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又舉例指，鄒家成在作供時，把對「35+」計劃積極的人分成三類，其中一類是「販賣假希望嘅政棍」，但其後自稱是「第四類人」；法官陳慶偉要求鄒再想清楚共有多少類人，「因為我不想你現在捏造（make up）證據」，鄒反問：「咁我而家，要點？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關指，在鄒作供首日，當時代表鄒的大律師陳世傑一共發問了112條問題，然而三名法官卻一共發問了153條問題。縱觀鄒的整個作供過程，法官的發問數目佔所有問題的45%。關指，可能在法官眼中，鄒屬激進派及親本土派，並不值得讚揚，但是他仍然有權獲得公平審訊；相反陳官甚至籲他想清楚才回答，又稱不想鄒捏造證供，這對鄒造成威嚇，使他未有機會解釋其證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關強調，不只《基本法》和《香港人權法案》，甚至是《國安法》第42條也表明被告有權獲得公平審訊。關指，公平審訊權利是根本性和不可退讓的，不論控方證據有多麼壓倒性也好，被告都有權得到公平審訊，可是鄒卻未能得到公平審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明法官打斷大狀提問接管主問-乃逾越界線&quot;&gt;余慧明：法官打斷大狀提問、接管主問 乃逾越界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表余慧明的資深大律師彭耀鴻，同樣投訴原審法官多番介入余的主問，包括不批准余的代表大律師石書銘就某些問題發問，以及接管整個主問，導致余的代表大律師未能呈現其辯方案情，尤其是法官不批准他問余的談判底線是什麼，指稱問題與案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，在余作供的早期階段，原審法官便開始介入提問，其後以辯方大律師的提問不相關為由，持續介入，做法逾越了界線。彭又指，曾有至少一名法官認為辯方大律師的提問與案有關，可是仍被法官陳慶偉打斷，不批准辯方大律師繼續追問，並以「next question, thank you」作結。任何人聽到有關對話或是閱讀錄音謄本，都會意識到陳官口中的「thank you」並不是出於禮貌的回應，而是一種帶有嘲諷或貶損意味的回應。彭指，明白法官工作十分困難，但是余也面對一項可以判處她終身監禁的控罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，法官不斷向余慧明問假設性問題，例如問余，若政府拒絕與他們談判，余會否對預算案投反對票。原審法官最終不接納余的證供，又引述她的公開發言和訪問內容，不相信她會與政府談判及作出讓步，裁定她有顛覆國家政權的意圖並會否決財案，惟彭認為余在作供期間未有機會回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司原審法官提問屬中性-不存在不公或偏見&quot;&gt;律政司：原審法官提問屬中性 不存在不公或偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表、高級助理刑事檢控專員劉德偉回應上訴方的陳詞。他指上訴法庭審理上訴申請時，並非要覆核所有證據，除非原審法官的裁斷明顯錯誤，否則上訴庭不應干預原審法官的事實裁斷。劉另指，法庭不應將某些證據抽出來獨立考慮，而是應該考慮多項證據的「累積效應」，以作出唯一不可抗拒的推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於鄒家成投訴法官介入提問引致審訊不公，劉德偉反駁指，本案審訊沒有陪審團，乃由三名法官組成的審判庭審理，因此法官不但要就法律議題作出裁斷，同時需兼任「事實裁斷者」角色，為了滿足這個角色的工作，他們有需要在庭上發問，以及向被告澄清其證供。此外，出於案件管理的需要，他們亦要控制及管理大律師的提問，以確保提問乃與本案議題有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉堅稱，原審法官的提問屬中性，不構成介入，也不會威嚇到鄒，鄒完全有權回答問題；即使辯方大律師某些問題被打斷，但仍然無礙他展示辯方案情。整個作供過程不存在不公或偏見，鄒未有被剝奪公平審訊的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，三名原審法官均是具豐富經驗的法官，他們在裁決理由書將定罪的理由列出，因此沒有任何基礎指稱原審法官不公平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司胡志偉曾言會運用否決權-證民主黨成員之間立場統一&quot;&gt;律政司：胡志偉曾言會運用否決權 證民主黨成員之間立場統一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於大律師沈士文指，民主黨對於否決財案未有統一立場，黃碧雲和林卓廷並不主張「無差別」否決財案。劉德偉則引述時任民主黨主席胡志偉在初選論壇中，曾表明同意運用憲法賦予的否決權，否決財政預算案，顯示民主黨成員之間存在統一的立場。劉指原審法官已正確地考慮有關證據，因胡志偉是時任民主黨主席，其言論表明會運用否決權，因此民主黨的初選參與者，包括黃碧雲、林卓廷、尹兆堅等均抱持統一的取態，而且他們之間必然曾作出相關討論。劉強調，胡志偉和尹兆堅曾分別在公開場合表示會否決財案，這並非純綷巧合，而是有強大的環境證據去證明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於林卓廷聲稱沒有按照論壇筆記內容去發言，因此法庭不應考慮論壇筆記內容，劉德偉則反駁指，法庭應該予以考慮。劉指，黃和林提交初選提名表格，加上二人與民主黨的聯繫，能夠支持法庭裁定二人必然會運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良昨日指，原審法官考慮了不相關的證據，包括警方在楊的辦公室電腦搜獲的一份草擬文件，當中提及她「一定會否決」預算案，惟該文件從沒有公開發布、沒有證據顯示楊在選舉工程中使用過它。劉德偉則反駁指，原審法官之所以裁定楊罪成，不單只基於該文件提及她「一定會否決」預算案，還有因為楊認為政府不可信，加上楊曾出席戴耀廷主持的記者會，所以原審法官才有足夠基礎作出不可抗拒的推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭回應律政司一方陳詞時，強調法官的提問佔總問題數目的45%，不公是明顯的，因原審法官兼任陪審員角色，卻在庭上告訴被告他是錯誤的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關引述律政司的陳詞指，鄒及其法律代表未有在庭上作出投訴，關則反駁指這說法是不相關，並反問：「大律師怎樣向法官作出投訴，說『你說得太多了』？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨質疑量刑比其他承諾否決之參與者多出6個月&quot;&gt;吳政亨質疑量刑比其他承諾否決之參與者多出6個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各上訴人已完成定罪上訴範疇的陳詞，法庭接著聽取有關刑罰上訴的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師梁麗幗指，不爭議原審法官將被告歸類為不同的判刑類別，但是質疑吳政亨的量刑比其他承諾會否決財案的參選者高出6個月，以致最後判囚7年6個月，是不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁指，吳從沒主張否決財案，原審法官量刑時未有比較吳與其他初選參與者之間的分別，也未有解釋到為何吳值得比其他承諾會投否決票的人判多6個月。原審法官亦從未得出結論指吳的罪責相比其他參與者較重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁續指，吳並非一名有公眾影響力的人，他發起的「三投三不投」運動亦未造成重大影響力。吳從未走入鎂光燈之下，也從未有任何參選人在初選論壇中提及吳的名字。訊息紀錄顯示，雖然吳曾多次向戴耀廷獻計，但是有關提議從不涉及否決財案或犯罪謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁續指，吳對涉案謀劃遠遠說不上是熱衷，他所熱衷的只是爭取「35+」，而從來不是否決財案或是「攬炒」。吳從沒有公開地或私下向任何人施壓，要求對方堅持否決財案，他亦沒有這樣的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於律政司一方指稱吳協助初選的流程和眾籌，可是這些僅屬次要的行動（peripheral actions），不能視之為吳協助推動否決財案的謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁又指，吳政亨並非參選者，因此他不會是「作出致命一擊（strike a fatal blow）」的人，即是他不會是最終能夠在立法會投票否決財案，然後觸發憲制危機的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，其他上訴人的代表大律師將會就刑罰上訴陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s most recent threat – to slap Russia’s economic trade partners with prohibitive tariffs in a bid to push through war negotiations with Ukraine – has returned to the fore discussions about the durability of Russia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month’s annual St Petersburg Economic Forum (SPIEF) epitomised some of the fractures in Russia’s elite over the financial trajectory of the country. SPIEF is designed to showcase the very best of Russia’s investment potential – if in previous years this had been a platform for foreign investors to identify new opportunities, this year it seemed to point to a disconnect between President Putin and his ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other problems tangential to the war – which were not discussed at SPIEF – centre around Russia’s ability to support and stimulate those territories of Ukraine that it has seized, to avoid them becoming a further and long-term drain on its resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-woes&quot;&gt;Economic Woes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the usual speculation about which Western countries would attend or shun the highly politicised proceeds, the distinction between Putin’s assessment of the economy, and the rather more muted discussion from his officials was particularly stark this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO of state-controlled Sberbank and long-time Putin ally German Greff focused on the business and investment side, warning that high interest rates and an overvalued Ruble were impacting on investment and stymieing Russia’s economic growth, describing the economy as a “perfect storm”, with some Russian business struggling with non-payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by far the most dire predictions were those of Minister for Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, who maintained that Russia is on the brink of recession, a headline picked up by numerous Russian media outlets and which overshadowed many of the other debates at SPIEF this year. Reshetnikov’s reasoning appeared to be linked to Russia’s GDP growth – for the first quarter of 2025 it has been significantly lower than the same period in 2024, and the downturn has sparked consternation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline is largely because Russia’s previous GDP expansions since 2022 were driven by Kremlin-mandated wartime spending, giving a false impression of growth – this was not due to stimulation by investment or a particularly thriving business climate. The illusion of growth, stimulated by high defence spending, likely conceals more structural problems. For now, Russia’s growth predictions for 2025 sit somewhere between 1.5% (according to VTB, Russia’s second largest bank) and 2.5% (Reshetnikov’s own office), with the Central Bank predicting 1-2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;officials-vs-putin&quot;&gt;Officials Vs Putin?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reshetnikov’s gloomy outlook is not a new narrative – he has consistently pointed to labour shortages in Russia as one of the greatest internal risks for Russia, something that Putin has himself acknowledged, although the gap between acknowledgement and activity towards this remains unbridged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly, the Kremlin has proudly touted the unemployment rate as at an historic low, ignoring the obvious reality that this is because all available manpower is being utilised in service of the war, or emigration to dodge the draft. This also overlooks serious and well-publicised staff shortages in technical enterprises such as Russian Railways – many of their engineers and locomotive crews have either been mobilised or left the country to avoid the draft, resulting in a shortfall of almost 5,000 personnel required to run its extensive transport network. This naturally has an impact on Russia’s ability to boost its trade with allies such as China and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina has been realistic about Russia’s economic progress and its limitations, maintaining since the start of the war that Russia should brace itself for additional sanctions. In post since 2013, she has worked since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions to shift the country away from dependence on western financial structures and currencies, moving Russia’s reserves into Chinese currency or Euro – around USD200bn of the Central Bank’s assets are already in gold and renminbi. This has made the Russian economy more resilient to sanctions that reduce Russia’s access to dollars. Russia’s establishment of alternative pay structures to the SWIFT banking system, or the use of Chinese payment systems, while still in their infancy and not approaching the size of SWIFT, are for now reasonably effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite a broad consensus about economic challenges between ministers, this was in stark contrast to Putin’s own assessment at SPIEF. Indeed, Putin focused on Russia’s GDP growth, suggested that defence manufacturing was not the only driver of progress, and that industries such as agriculture and construction were one of the top performing sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disparity of views has been seized upon as evidence of disunity between Putin and his federal officials. But while Putin may not have been prepared to discuss Russia’s economic woes at SPIEF – which is after all supposed to be a platform to showcase the country to foreign investors – he is undoubtedly aware of some of the realities of maintaining high defence spending. In December 2024 in a meeting with the Board of the Ministry of Defence, he noted that while 7.2% of Russia’s GDP is to be spent on its military and defence, he also recognised that this cannot be endlessly increased without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drains-on-russias-resources&quot;&gt;Drains on Russia’s Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other pulls on the Russian economy beyond sanctions and military spending on hardware, which were not expressly discussed at SPIEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia makes incremental territorial gains in Ukraine, to consolidate its hold over the territory it has already taken, it must invest and stimulate the local economy, if it is to be anything other than a drain on resources. While there is undoubtedly a political angle in cementing control over these regions and constructing infrastructure, practically speaking, Russia must also account for the social welfare of those living there, including funding pensions and benefits – a significant financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has set up two state programmes to account for funding Crimea and the four occupied territories of Ukraine. In 2025 alone, more than RUB 108 million was allocated for Crimea, and RUB 319 million for the Ukrainian territories, figures that are set to continue more or less unchanged until 2027. The Kremlin’s tactic earlier in the war of splitting up the budgets of wealthier regions such as St Petersburg to fund “reconstruction” projects in occupied regions of Ukraine was unpopular, resulting in less funds available for the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has attempted to stimulate local investment in the territories through a variety of tax reduction schemes and offering support to SMEs, but these are unlikely to bear economic fruit in the short term. Russia’s patronage of the occupied regions – both economically and through its horizontal political ties – is planned to last at least until 2030, until these regions are able to operate without Moscow’s core financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regions are not the only drain on resources – the Kremlin has had to boost its regional spending in places like the southern Kursk region, where in 2024 the Ukrainian military for months managed to seize several Russian border towns. This was only resolved in April 2025 – over the past few months the Kremlin has had to shore up civilian defences and support displaced residents, to a cost of around RUB 43.9 billion from the Reserve Fund, allocated to Kursk on an ad hoc basis. The costs of reconstruction in Kursk alone (not including neighbouring Belgorod which has experienced similar shelling), runs to an estimated RUB 700 billion – a figure unlikely to be readily available, leaving the region likely impoverished for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that military spending and sanctions aside, Russia in the long term may have greater financial problems on its hands, as it attempts to push more deeply into Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

It considers the upstream and downstream processing steps from raw materials, such as coal, that could potentially give North Korea access to those precursor chemicals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the raw materials and precursor chemicals required to support a chemical weapons (CW) programme is an important foundation stone in an assessment of whether North Korea’s chemical industry possesses adequate infrastructure and capability to support such a programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the primary purpose of this report is to serve as a point of reference to identify relevant chemicals for the Project Anthracite team, it will also serve as a useful reference for those engaged in similar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis in this report is insufficient to determine whether North Korea is engaged in the production of chemical warfare agents (CWAs), but it does identify the chemical processes that would be required to sustain a CW programme. The availability of raw materials, coupled with the availability of basic technology, strongly supports the premise that North Korea can produce simple agents, such as sulfur mustard. There is, however, a greater degree of technical capability needed to produce nerve agents, and this capability may not be immediately obvious in North Korea’s chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is unique in that it considers the whole range of chemical processes and raw materials required to produce CWAs and does not assume the availability of chemical precursors. Instead, it traces the CWAs, which are relatively complex molecules, back to their roots in raw materials and minerals such as coal and apatite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has long presented a uniquely challenging environment for intelligence collection – as data is often obscured by limited access and high levels of operational security – and it is often referred to as a “hard target” due to its extreme secrecy and control of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the international community’s intelligence focus has historically centred on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, owing to its strategic threat and geopolitical implications. However, there are also concerns around North Korea’s potential chemical weapons (CW) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution and growing sophistication of open source intelligence (OSINT) have transformed the landscape of intelligence analysis. OSINT now allows analysts to synthesise data and to compile, corroborate and assess information from multiple unclassified sources, potentially offering valuable insights into otherwise opaque targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises an important question: can OSINT provide meaningful insights into North Korea’s CW capability? While the regime’s access to small quantities of chemical agents is well-documented – most notably in the assassination of Kim Jong Nam in Kuala Lumpur using the nerve agent VX – there are longstanding, although unverified, reports that North Korea may possess between 2,500 and 5,000 tonnes of historic chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles, and the US Defense Intelligence Agency believed in 1997 that North Korea had a “sophisticated chemical weapons programme”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to establish a foundational understanding of the chemical infrastructure and materials North Korea would require to operationalise a large-scale CW programme. By identifying the key industrial processes and precursor chemicals necessary, the paper intends to provide a baseline for assessing feasibility and future indicators of potential proliferation activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future papers in this series will build on this framework to further analyse production pathways, dual-use facilities and potential international procurement networks supporting North Korea’s CW ambitions by corroborating publicly available information with sophisticated imagery analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper employed a multidisciplinary OSINT methodology to assess North Korea’s potential for CW production by reviewing information from a wide range of sources, including North Korean patent applications, state television broadcasts, scientific literature, technical reporting and academic texts. Analysis focused on finding industrial processes and raw materials – such as coal, phosphate rock and arsenic-bearing minerals – relevant to the synthesis of key CWA precursors such as thiodiglycol, phosphorus trichloride and methylphosphonic difluoride. Patents and scientific publications were examined for reported industrial routes and chemical feasibility, while state media provided insights into industrial priorities, capabilities and self-reliance narratives aligned with Juche ideology. Mainstream scientific and grey literature supported validation and cross-referencing of industrial routes and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A structured framework was used to map upstream and downstream chemical processes against North Korea’s resource base and industrial outputs. Limitations included restricted access to verifiable in-country data and the potential for bias in North Korean state sources, mitigated where possible by multisource corroboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organic chemicals begin their life cycle as fossil fuel feedstocks, which undergo a series of refining and processing steps in chemical plants to produce basic building block chemicals, often referred to as “upstream” processing. These fundamental chemicals subsequently undergo a series of processing and synthesis steps (“downstream” processing) to produce intermediate and speciality chemicals, which find use in industries ranging from pharmaceutical to agrochemical. Such transformation of raw materials forms the backbone of any chemical industry, and understanding these production pathways is essential to assessing a country’s capacity to access the chemicals that could support a CW programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-raw-materials&quot;&gt;Basic Raw Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is abundant in North Korea and plays a significant role in its domestic energy and industrial base. Unlike petroleum-rich nations, North Korea relies heavily on coal as a feedstock for a variety of industrial processes. This makes coal not only a source of energy but also a vital input for chemical manufacturing. The upstream and downstream processing of coal involves several stages that yield a wide range of chemical products. In the context of North Korea, where access to global chemical markets is severely restricted, the ability to extract and refine chemical precursors from coal and minerals represents a potentially important contribution to the North Korean principle of self-sufficiency, Juche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upstream-processing&quot;&gt;Upstream Processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first stages of the chemical production chain in North Korea, coal is converted into fundamental feedstocks. One of the most important conversions is gasification, a process in which coal reacts with oxygen and steam at high temperatures to produce synthesis gas, or “syngas”, composed mainly of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngas serves as a key intermediate in the production of various chemicals, such as methanol, ammonia and urea. Methanol, for instance, can be further processed into methylamines – a group of chemicals which include dual-use chemicals with potential application in the synthesis of nerve agents. Ammonia, another major product of syngas, is used not only in fertiliser production but also as a precursor for nitrating agents and explosives. Thus, even the initial phase of coal chemical processing produces compounds that could serve as important building blocks for a CW programme, depending on the infrastructure and intent of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;downstream-processing&quot;&gt;Downstream Processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downstream processing expands the range of chemical products significantly. Through processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, coal-derived syngas can be converted into a variety of hydrocarbons, alcohols and other organic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadth of chemical building blocks that can be obtained from fossil fuel feedstocks in shown in the Sankey diagram in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;processing-of-minerals-and-brine&quot;&gt;Processing of Minerals and Brine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although organic chemicals begin their lifecycle as fossil fuel feedstocks, most inorganic chemicals begin their life as ores and minerals. North Korea has reserves of more than 200 mineral types, many of which are important sources of inorganic precursors required to produce chemical warfare agents (CWAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide by the electrolysis of brine is commonly referred to as the “chlor-alkali process”. In 2022, around 100-million tonnes of chlorine were produced worldwide using this process. Chlorine is a key raw material in the production of CWAs as a chlorinating agent in the production of vesicants and important precursors for nerve agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phosphorites (Apatite)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apatite is the primary mineral in which phosphates are found. It is mined around the world to produce phosphate-based fertiliser. Apatite deposits are common in North Korea and there are many apatite mines. Apatite can be easily converted to white phosphorus by heating in a furnace; the phosphorus can subsequently be converted to phosphorus trichloride by reacting with chlorine. Phosphorus trichloride is a key precursor in the chemistry of CWAs, not only as an important building block for organophosphorus chemicals, but also as a chlorinating agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the preparation of phosphate-based fertilisers from apatite and fluorapatite, hexafluorosilicic acid is produced as a by-product. Neutralisation of hexafluorosilicic with sodium hydroxide gives sodium fluoride. Apatite (including fluorapatite) deposits are common on the Korean Peninsula, and there are several apatite mines in North Korea, notably the Sonam Mine in Cholsan County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirabilite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirabilite is a hydrous sodium mineral which is often found in parts of the Korean Peninsula. Mirabilite can be used in the production of sodium sulfide by the carbothermic reduction of sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfide is an important precursor in the synthesis of sulfur mustard, and while not included in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals, is on the AG’s list of controlled precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arsenopyrite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is a critical element for lewisite production, and can be found in deposits of arsenopyrite (FeAsS), a sulfide mineral containing arsenic, iron and sulfur. There are many deposits on the Korean Peninsula, and it is mined at the Sangnong mine in North Korea. The key precursor for lewisite is arsenic trichloride, which can be easily produced by the treatment of arsenic trioxide with hydrogen chloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic trioxide is released when the mineral arsenopyrite is heated, and incidentally is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia and as such is included on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important industrial processes to produce the feedstock chemicals needed for the main CWAs are summarised in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;production-routes-of-chemical-warfare-agents&quot;&gt;Production Routes of Chemical Warfare Agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sulfur-mustard-hd&quot;&gt;Sulfur Mustard (HD)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur mustard is a CWA that was first used in the First World War, and has most recently been used by the Islamic State in Syria. Classed as a vesicant (blister agent), it causes both severe chemical burns on contact with skin, eyes and respiratory tissues and significant chronic health issues, including a predisposition to cancer. Chemically, sulfur mustard or bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide is a chlorinated organosulfur compound with the formula (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S. Figure 3 shows its most common routes of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kckWxXs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: The Most Common Production Routes for Sulfur Mustard.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The Project Anthracite Team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Levenstein Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur mustard can be prepared by treating ethylene with sulfur monochloride (disulfur dichloride, CASRN 10025-67-9). Other similar routes from ethylene using sulfur chlorides are also reported in literature. The utility of sulfur monochloride as a precursor in the production of CWs is reflected by its inclusion in Schedule 3 (3.B.12) of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meyer Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiodiglycol is one of the most useful precursors for the synthesis of sulfur mustard, and as can be seen in Figure 3, many of the routes outlined proceed via thiodiglycol. It is a Schedule 2 (2.B.13) in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals and can be converted efficiently to sulfur mustard in high yield and purity using a range of chlorinating agents, via the process reported by Meyer. Similar synthetic methods are reported in literature using concentrated hydrochloric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride or sulfur chlorides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethylene Oxide Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethylene oxide has widespread industrial uses and can also be a useful precursor to produce sulfur mustard via thiodiglycol. Ethylene oxide can be converted to thiodiglycol by treating with hydrogen sulfide – several methods are published in patents and literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chlorohydrin Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethylene is readily converted into chlorohydrin (2-chloroethanol) by treating it with hypochlorous acid. Chlorohydrin can subsequently be converted to thiodiglycol by treatment with sodium sulfide. Although chlorohydrin is not included in the CWC Annex on Chemicals, it is included in the Australia Group’s (AG) control list for chemical weapons precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vinyl Chloride Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable production method for sulfur mustard was reported by Dupont chemists in 1945, where vinyl chloride was treated with hydrogen sulfide to give sulfur mustard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lewisite&quot;&gt;Lewisite&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewisite (or lewisite 1) is an organoarsenical compound (2-chlorovinyldichloroarsine) produced by the US, Japan, Germany and the former Soviet Union for use as a CWA. It is a vesicant (blister agent) and included on Schedule 1 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is produced by a catalytically mediated reaction of arsenic trichloride with acetylene, which produces lewisite in &amp;lt;85% yield, with two significant impurities which are themselves vesicants. They are included in Schedule 1 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals: lewisite 2 (bis(2-chlorovinyl) chloroarsine) and lewisite 3 (tris(2-chlorovinyl) arsine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: The Most Common Production Route for Lewisite.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Naturally occurring materials and minerals are represented by the blue rectangles. Source: The Project Anthracite Team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nitrogen-mustards&quot;&gt;Nitrogen Mustards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first production of nitrogen mustards occurred in the 1920s, when they were looked at as potential CWAs. Like sulfur mustard and Lewisite, nitrogen mustards are vesicants and their chemical structure shares similarities with sulfur mustard. They are one of the few CW agents which have a legitimate use; HN2 was used as one of the first chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and is still used today in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of nitrogen mustards is relatively straightforward and can be obtained from chlorination of the corresponding ethanolamine precursor, for example, triethanolamine can be converted to nitrogen mustard (HN3) by the treatment of triethanolamine with thionyl chloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ethanolamine precursors are all included on Schedule 3 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals. Despite being easily converted to Schedule 1 CW agents, the ethanolamines find wide industrial applications. Indeed, triethanolamine, the key precursor for nitrogen mustard (HN3), has multiple industrial uses and is common in most homes as it is included in the formulation of many personal care products. As such it has the highest trading volume of all the scheduled chemicals in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals. As a result, it was placed in Schedule 3 rather than Schedule 2 of the Annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of ethanolamines is relatively simple. For instance, triethanolamine can be produced on an industrial scale by the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nerve-agents&quot;&gt;Nerve Agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organophosphorus nerve agents are a class of highly toxic chemical compounds developed for warfare that disrupt the normal functioning of the nervous system, with potentially fatal consequences. Nerve agents interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is essential for muscle control. They were discovered during pesticide research by Germany in the period immediately before the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabun (GA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabun (GA) is the simplest of the G-series nerve agents to synthesise due to the availability of a range of suitable precursors. As is shown in Figure 6, it can be produced from either phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus oxychloride as the principal phosphorus containing starting materials (both are included in Schedule 3 of the Annex). As shown in Figure 2, phosphorus trichloride can be readily obtained from apatite by the treatment of white phosphorus with chlorine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus oxychloride is the most convenient precursor for Tabun and can be obtained by chlorinating phosphorus trichloride further to phosphorus pentachloride, which is subsequently reacted with phosphorus pentoxide (to give phosphorus oxychloride).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimethylamine (DMA), which is required for the synthesis of Tabun, can be readily obtained from ammonia on an industrial scale through a catalytic reaction with methanol at elevated temperatures and high pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarin (GB), Soman (GD) and Cyclosarin (GF)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing processes to produce Sarin (GB), Soman (GD) and Cyclosarin (GF) nerve agents are complicated by the requirement to introduce a phosphorus-carbon bond, which results in additional synthetic steps and precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key precursor in the production of these G-series nerve agents is methylphosphonyl dichloride (DC), which can be prepared in a multistep synthesis from phosphorus trichloride. Methylphosphonic dichloride, on reaction with hydrogen fluoride, can be converted to the Schedule 1 precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), which can subsequently easily be converted to the corresponding G-series nerve agent by treatment with the corresponding alcohol, as is shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Schedule 2 methylphosphonyl dichloride and the Schedule 1 methylphosphonyl difluoride are key precursors for the synthesis of G-agents. While the difluoride has no other use other than the synthesis of G-agents (hence its inclusion on Schedule 1), the dichloride can be used for the synthesis of some pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Agent Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VX is the best known of the V-series nerve agents. Originating from pesticide research at ICI, it was developed further at Porton Down in England during the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all reported routes to produce V-agents depend on the availability of methylphosponous dichloride, which can be prepared by the methylation of phosporus trichloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methylphosponous dichloride undergoes alcoholysis with ethanol to form the corresponding phosponite which is subsequently transesterified with N,N-diisopropylaminoethanol to produce the Schedule 1 mixed phosphonite O-(2-Diisopropylaminoethyl) O’-ethyl methylphosphonite, commonly referred to as QL, which is a key precursor for the binary VX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The required N,N-diisopropylaminoethanol can be readily produced from ammonia and proceeds via diisopropylamine, as shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has explored the key basic raw materials, processes and precursors required to support a CW programme. It has specifically considered upstream and downstream chemical processing and assessed their relevance to subsequent precursor and CWA production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier study assessed that North Korea has between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of legacy CWs, but the study did not determine if they were produced as part of an indigenous production capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemical processes outlined in this paper support an assessment that North Korea could gain access to an important toolkit of precursors from basic industrial process that originate either from North Korea’s vast coal resources or its mineral deposits, and such basic industrial processes are essential for a functioning chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry indicates a strong likelihood that North Korea has access to the key precursors and chemical feedstocks that would allow sustained production of sulfur mustard. Figure 2 highlights how many of these key precursors can be readily obtained from downstream processing of coal and other mineral deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the key precursor and chemical feedstocks required for the sustained production of nitrogen mustards and lewisite can also be readily obtained from downstream processing of coal and other mineral deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper also identifies a reasonable likelihood that North Korea has all the key industrial feedstocks and raw materials to produce the precursors required to support the production of G-series and V-series agents. The significant requirement for more complex organic chemicals means that a mature chemical industry would be required, of which there is only limited evidence. As such, subsequent OSINT work will be required to make a robust assessment of North Korea’s capability to produce G-series and V-series agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper makes a convincing case for exploring open-source research, trade data, remote sensing and optical imagery to map the industrial processes and production routes described in this paper to sites in North Korea. This will allow for a robust, multisource assessment of North Korea’s chemical industry capabilities, and to what extend they could support a CW programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to deal with hostile action in a “grey zone” that is neither clearly peace nor war marks the return of an old problem rather than the arrival of a new one. It still needs dealing with. There are some new elements to be considered (for example, how information technology expands the attack surface), making a recently released House of Commons Defence Committee report, Defence in the Grey Zone, a welcome contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Mazar predicted in 2015 the rise of multipolarity and wider scope for putting revisionist motives into practice means grey zone campaigns “will constitute the default mode of conflict in coming decades”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 Hal Brands pointed out, grey zone conflict demonstrates the weaknesses of the existing order. It shows how key revisionist states can nibble away at its edges, using incremental and subtly coercive approaches. It shows the limits of existing international security structures to prevent or reverse this coercive behaviour – as seen in the West’s struggle to undo, as opposed to simply punish, Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Nora Bensahel perceived that election of Donald Trump “may make it more likely . . . that the United States will face an increasing number of grey zone conflicts in the coming years.” This is partly because of the President’s relatively “restrained” foreign policy, and – in connection with Hal Brands’ point – Trump has “repeatedly expressed scepticism about international institutions and multinational cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee drew evidence from across Europe (Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands), but this commentary recommends consulting like-minded partners further afield. RUSI’s ongoing research on Taiwan’s experience of dealing with hostility in the grey zone points to three insights that are complementary to the report’s findings, and which could contribute to continued cross-Government thinking on how to respond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the “grey”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address the cognitive trap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn the narrative from “escalation” into “resilience”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eliminate-the-grey&quot;&gt;Eliminate the Grey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first priority for managing hostile action in the “grey zone” is to reduce the grey zone itself, by doing away with the ambiguities that create confusion on how to respond. This ambiguity takes two forms: disguised identity or intent of the hostile actor, and how the victim situates the act (and justifies the reaction) with reference to points on a spectrum between a state of peace and a state of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the hostile actor for public attribution demands investment in information collection, information flow management (within government and across the public / private interface), and intelligence. The Foreign Secretary’s statement on the China audit of an investment of £600 million in intelligence services is welcome news. Information flow also requires breaking silos and strengthening coordination functions under a well-planned strategic communication strategy. In March 2025, Taiwan’s President Lai made an explicit assessment that China is a “foreign hostile force”. On 16 June, he convened officials from the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mainland Affairs Council, and National Security Bureau to brief major opposition party leaders on national security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with orthodox theory on grey zone warfare, the Committee report says “‘Grey zone’ refers to hostile activity below the threshold of direct, state-on-state conflict”, but this begs the question of where that threshold lies. In practical terms, it is a political decision. That decision should be made by the victim and not by the initiator of the action. Eliminating the “grey” can be understood as like dialling up the contrast on an old black and white TV, allowing actions and reactions to be dealt with in the normal legal (white) category, or a “black” category where laws and powers designed for states of emergency up to a state of war can be applied. Liberal democratic society is not naturally well adapted to a state of emergency, but to deal with the grey zone hostility, it needs constitutionally approved measures that safeguard values without offering loopholes for adversaries. Graduated mobilisation and sequential changes in rules of engagement need to be prepared in advance, in consultation with internal and external stakeholders. In March 2025, Taiwan launched a 17-point program that builds out the legal and institutional tool box to deal more effectively with hostile acts like subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the defence committee concludes “current grey zone attacks indicate that Russia already believes it is in an existential struggle with the West,” which takes the wind out of the debate on a meaningful formal “threshold”. This leads us to the next observation, which is that the obstacles to managing hostility in a grey zone are to be found less in the books of law and more between the ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;address-the-cognitive-trap&quot;&gt;Address the Cognitive Trap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureaucratic reform and capability requirements account for most of the committee’s recommendations. While they are important, the vital adjustment is cognitive; specifically, to a mentality that is prepared to enact a prompt comprehensive risk assessment that balances defence with other aspects of national interest. Such an assessment should be made with the resolve to accept there will be times to push back. In a landmark case, in June 2025, Taiwan jailed the captain of a ship – a Chinese national – that had been arrested on suspicion of causing damage to an undersea cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambiguity is only a good strategic position when the adversary believes you are prepared to act without perfect certainty about attribution. So long as the adversary believes you will not, you give him an incentive to do as much as possible while hiding his hand. In other words, you incentivise grey zone hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an illustration of the problem, the slowness and difficulty in responding to Russian “grey zone” actions in 2014 lay not so much at a conceptual or organisational level, but in the low-risk appetite for escalation. Describing events in new terms such as “hybrid war” and “grey zone” perhaps made it easier to excuse the inability of the Kyiv government and its western supporters to mount an effective response. The reification of the “grey zone” (the term is not part of Russian or Chinese doctrine), and fetishisation of ideas like a “Gerasimov doctrine” and “hybrid war” among Western commentators and theorists obscured more decisive – if unpalatable – factors: Ukraine’s poor organisational discipline, the West’s lack of commitment to deter or resist Russia and run the risk of escalation to a war for which they were materially unprepared and did not wish to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the “grey zone” concept to influence deliberation on policy choices can be counterproductive. Framing cable cutting as a “grey zone” action rather than “sabotage” endorses the difficulty of attribution and the significance of the attack “below the threshold” of war. The choice to categorise such action as “grey zone” may encourage the perpetrator to think they are less likely to be held accountable or punished, and they will consequently feel less deterred. Using the term “grey zone” in ways that signal self-deterrence, lack of resolve or capability is a cognitive trap to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the report’s approach to definitions suggests room for improvement. Noting that the term lacks a generally agreed definition, and that aspects overlap with other concepts such as “hybrid” or “irregular warfare”, it resolves to use “the terms ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid’ interchangeably”, then suggests grey zone attacks “can be grouped, in an escalating level of hostile intent, as Influencing, Interfering, Operations and Conflict.” This seems a muddle to say on one hand “grey zone” refers to action below a certain threshold, but then to define it in a group that spans “influencing” and “conflict”. “Operations” could mean anything. To write (as the report does in the Summary) that “the scope is limitless,” also does not help. Sabotage and assassination are attacks and must be identified and dealt with as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report recognises the importance of a “willingness to use . . . capabilities either to deny or to punish those undertaking or authorising grey zone attacks”, but for a product of the defence establishment, its recommendations on what sort of capabilities are needed to inflict appropriate “punishment”, or how to help leadership determine when it is required, are strangely muted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reject-the-narrative-of-escalation-for-one-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Reject the Narrative of “Escalation” for One of “Resilience”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action in the grey zone is designed to be morally asymmetric, in other words, the initiator disguises their intention or identity to cause the victim to hesitate to take effective action for fear of being accused of “escalation”. Failure to resist the narrative power of grey zone tactics can foster a sense of helplessness. To discredit attempts to blame the victim for trouble making and to gain the initiative, Taiwan’s government has promoted a narrative (with institutional backing) based on democratic and whole of society resilience. This allows moves that set strong positions pre-emptively, shifting the burden of escalation liability onto the other party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House of Commons report has a section entitled “building homeland resilience”, but here there is a glaring contradiction in this area of HMG policy. The former head of MI6, Sir Alex Younger told the committee of China “if you want a textbook on subversion, cyber and political harassment, it is all there”. Subsequently the UK China Audit “a full spectrum of threats – from espionage and cyber-attacks, to the repression of Hong Kongers, and attacks on the rules-based order . . . our protections must extend more widely than they currently do”. This grey zone report acknowledges “malicious foreign powers seek to influence the public debate, including on the war in Ukraine, by covert means, including influencing operations”, yet the government declined to list China on the enhanced tier of its new Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). Ministers appear to support a request for China to open larger embassy premises, which would broaden its base to exert influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, Taiwan is well ahead of the UK. Despite the fact something near 40% of its exports go to China, the government in Taipei has tightened rather than shied away from measures to prevent subversion, espionage, and illicit influence from the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “grey zone” is not a fact of life to be accepted, but the natural consequence of a collective failure of commitment to upholding global order. As with any space neglected by order and enforcement, it is a hospitable base for predatory and unaccountable aggression. Developing capabilities and coordination is part of the solution, but ultimately it is more and unavoidably a problem of intellectual honesty and political confidence. The defence committee has done its part, but the government as a whole would do well to consult more widely on how to make the more UK resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic relationship is being recast. The second Trump administration has made clear that the United States wants Europe to handle European security, representing a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy on a scale not seen since World War II. While the scope of the transformation of U.S. involvement in Europe remains to be seen, the trajectory of the transatlantic alliance will also dramatically impact the vaunted special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. These shifts substantively challenge the status quo of British defense strategy, wedging the United Kingdom between rising expectations for its defense capabilities and mounting resource constraints. As London takes a sober look at its long-term approach through its recent Strategic Defense Review, a refreshed understanding of the special relationship is critical to developing a strategy to maximize U.S.-UK defense cooperation and equip both partners to face the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “special relationship”—a phrase coined by Winston Churchill in his famous 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech—was forged to address crises in European and global security. The deep intelligence, defense, and security working partnership that formed during World War II persists to this day. During the Cold War, military and defense industrial cooperation, especially in the nuclear realm, grew significantly to combat the Soviet threat, as did intelligence cooperation. Since then, the United States and United Kingdom have operated together in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A shared strategic outlook, whether in defeating Nazism, communism, or terrorism, helped forge a close bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the special relationship is not as meaningful as it once was. An honest audit of bilateral ties over the past decade reflects a partnership that has faded in relevance to policymakers, especially in Washington. This is partly because the two countries are no longer fighting side by side in Iraq and Afghanistan—but not entirely. In recent years, the United Kingdom has been consumed with Brexit, become estranged from Europe, suffered sluggish economic growth, and implemented cuts to its military forces. This has made it a less relevant actor in Europe, a less relevant global economic player, and less of a global military presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a war raging in Ukraine, Washington has shifted its focus to the Indo-Pacific and the challenge posed by China. Meanwhile, its emphasis on economic security, competition with China, and sanctioning Russia has also meant more coordination and engagement with the European Union given its colossal single market. The United Kingdom’s estrangement from the European Union has made it more peripheral to these conversations and less able to play its former role as a transatlantic bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new governments in both London and Washington, policymakers face a critical opportunity to refresh and strengthen the special relationship and make it fit for purpose. Thus far, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump have gotten off to a strong start. Despite coming from different sides of the political spectrum, they appear to have developed a personal rapport—similar to past political opposites such as Barack Obama and David Cameron or George W. Bush and Tony Blair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United Kingdom, strengthening the special relationship will require rebuilding relations with Europe and leading in continental affairs, as this is what has made it most relevant to the United States—whether during World War II, the Cold War, or today. Thus, efforts to rebuild ties with the European Union, focus more on NATO, and take the lead on supporting Ukraine, for example, will help the United Kingdom position itself as a transatlantic bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, London must focus and streamline its defense efforts given its significant resource constraints. The special relationship has largely entailed close alignment and cooperation on almost every issue in every region—at times leaving the United Kingdom overstretched and creating situations where it is unable to live up to ambitious rhetoric. Recognizing that it cannot be everything to everyone in the U.S. government, the United Kingdom will need to focus its bilateral efforts in a few areas in which it excels. This is where the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) could be critical to reviving the special relationship. Upon taking office in the summer of 2024, Starmer ordered a top-to-bottom review of the British military. The resulting report, issued on June 2, 2025, provides a forward-looking assessment of the country’s strategic interests and requisite military capabilities. Its release meets the moment with a strategic vision that seeks to reinforce the value of close cooperation for partners on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task ahead will not be easy. The Trump administration is increasingly at odds with Europe, creating a widening diplomatic gulf. This makes the United Kingdom’s potential role as a transatlantic bridge more vital than ever—but also more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper briefly outlines the current U.S.-UK defense and security relationship. It then assesses the feasibility of the SDR’s objectives and its implications for U.S. foreign policy in Europe and beyond. Finally, it weighs the tough choices that lie ahead for British defense policymakers given the United Kingdom’s economic constraints, new U.S. foreign policy priorities, and intensifying geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-the-special-relationship-on-defense&quot;&gt;Mapping the Special Relationship on Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ties between the United States and United Kingdom benefit greatly from a relatively aligned strategic culture and way of viewing the world. The two countries have historically held similar threat perceptions of adversaries and tend to have a broader conception of national interests, lending them a willingness and readiness to act militarily in the world. For instance, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, both countries rushed forward military assistance and rallied European allies to action through a comprehensive sanctions response. Preserving and strengthening the special relationship is not only a core British foreign policy interest, it has also been a priority for every U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Far from being merely rhetorical, the special relationship is exceptionally deep, especially when it comes to defense and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intelligence&quot;&gt;Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have built the deepest intelligence alliance in the history of the Western world. It has been gradually forged through the common fight against Hitler’s fascism, Soviet communism, and the Global War on Terror. In the aftermath of World War II, the two nations agreed to collect and share sensitive signals intelligence as part of the 1946 United Kingdom–United States of America (UKUSA) Agreement. At the time, the United States leaned heavily on well-established British intelligence capabilities from across the vast British Overseas Territories and Commonwealth to surveil Soviet activities. This cooperation laid the foundation for the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance between the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which was formalized in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes has since developed into the world’s most significant intelligence-sharing alliance, rooted in extensive coordination and sharing of both raw and finished intelligence. In many ways, it is considered the gold standard of intelligence alliances and represents the backbone of the special relationship. For example, the United Kingdom benefited immensely from Five Eyes intelligence sharing during the Cold War, when U.S. monitoring of Soviet submarines proved vital to coordinated defensive efforts in the North Atlantic and North Sea. In return, British listening posts in its former imperial territories provided crucial signals intelligence to the United States on Soviet activities in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionally, the Five Eyes operates across a wide spectrum of domains and geographies. Allied intelligence organizations monitor maritime traffic through strategic areas, surveil ballistic missile tests and satellite deployments, and coordinate on collective offensive capabilities in the cyber domain. Moreover, numerous agreements exist in discrete, highly sensitive areas such as chemical and biological defense, which entail extensive technical cooperation at the working level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-technology&quot;&gt;Nuclear Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on nuclear technology is another core tenet of the special relationship with roots in the early Cold War era. The 1958 Mutual Defense Agreement formed the basis for closer ties and allowed the UK nuclear arsenal to incorporate U.S. technological advancements. Since 1962, the United Kingdom has acquired U.S. nuclear weapons delivery technology while producing its own submarines and warheads. Furthermore, its Trident system, which includes four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed submarines, relies on maintenance by U.S. company Lockheed Martin, and the United Kingdom procures the aeroshells required to produce warheads from the United States. The Trident system is thus closely linked to U.S. systems, though they ostensibly operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mutual Defense Agreement was extended indefinitely in 2024 and includes provisions that make it difficult for either party to terminate the arrangement. Locking in the bilateral nuclear-sharing arrangement on a more or less permanent footing has provided some important assurances of continued U.S.-UK cooperation, irrespective of domestic political changes. Moreover, the extension provides some stability and budget certainty at a time when London is modernizing its stockpile of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, replacing the aging Vanguard-class submarines with a new Dreadnought-class platform that will enter into service in the early 2030s. Budget overruns and delays related to this modernization drive a significant risk, as the Dreadnought program has already led to a 41 percent increase in projected costs for the Royal Navy as of December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) reoriented strategic thinking about the British defense industrial base. It emphasized building a resilient defense industry without reliance on foreign suppliers—a marked shift from past governments’ tendency to outsource defense production to reduce costs. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic, and Brexit have shifted attention across the political spectrum toward prioritizing maintenance of a sustainable UK industrial base. The SDR recognizes the UK defense industry as a vital engine for growth, both in its security ambitions and long-term economic outlook. In FY 2023, the Ministry of Defence invested nearly $40 billion with UK industry, supporting 440,000 jobs. Defense industrial relationships, the most significant being with the United States, contributed to $19.7 billion in overall British defense exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the United Kingdom’s closest defense partner. Its Foreign Military Sales portfolio with the United States is valued at more than $18.6 billion in joint projects, particularly the F-35 program, demonstrating the high level of interoperability and industrial integration that characterizes the relationship. As a tier-one partner on the program, the United Kingdom contributes critical components to the F-35 supply chain, with approximately 15 percent of the value of each aircraft attributable to the United Kingdom. This includes the Martin-Baker ejection seat, Cobham refueling probes, and BAE Systems tail sections. As a result, the F-35 plays a significant role in the British labor market. The Royal Air Force’s XVII Test and Evaluation Squadron, housed at Edwards Air Base in California, operates primarily to bring F-35 aircraft into service. The partnership, focused on integrated procurement and maintenance, has been a foundation of economic competitiveness in defense for both partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) agreement enhances the unique bond between the three treaty allies and ensures cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The last time a similar agreement was reached was in 1958 with the U.S.-UK Mutual Defense Agreement. AUKUS aims to promote a “free and open Indo-Pacific that is peaceful, secure, and stable,” as reflected in two main pillars. Pillar One focuses on delivery of nuclear-powered attack submarine capabilities, including highly sensitive nuclear propulsion technology that Washington has historically held sacred. By 2040, the SSN-AUKUS will replace the United Kingdom’s Astute-class attack submarine as one of the world’s most advanced submarines. Pillar Two is broader and more complex, with a clear focus on enhancing joint capabilities and interoperability across several domains, including “cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities,” as well as electronic warfare, hypersonic technologies, and enhanced information-sharing protocols. Its implementation will demand investment in both the U.S. and UK defense industrial bases, relying on joint innovation and shared research and development. So far, however, there has been limited progress made on implementing Pillar Two. Looking forward, the success of AUKUS will not solely depend on adequate financing; just as critical will be whether the United Kingdom has the infrastructure to produce innovative technology at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, regulatory reforms, particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) exemptions announced in September 2024, have attempted to ease export controls and other regulatory barriers that had limited U.S.-UK defense industrial integration. Removing such barriers could accelerate procurement opportunities and access to both countries’ defense technology sectors but also has the potential to form a trilateral common market on defense that incentivizes strengthening this relationship. Such trilateral defense cooperation could enhance battlefield integration and technological innovation across theaters. Consequently, the AUKUS partnership offers a strategic counterweight to China and reinforces allied unity in a rapidly evolving landscape of geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basing&quot;&gt;Basing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, which has maintained military bases in the United Kingdom since 1942, currently deploys approximately 10,000 military personnel on British soil, not including a significant number of contractors and civilian employees. In turn, approximately 750 military and civilian personnel with the Ministry of Defence train at U.S. military bases across 30 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each nation also benefits from the other’s global footprint of military bases. The United States has utilized military infrastructure in overseas UK territories, such as Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has housed a shared U.S.-UK military base since the 1970s. The United Kingdom finalized an agreement in May 2025 on the future of the Diego Garcia archipelago that would hand territory over to Mauritius but allow the Diego Garcia base to continue operation on a 99-year lease. The negotiations, while met with criticism by defense hawks in both the United Kingdom and United States, emphasized the territory’s strategic importance for power projection of two uniquely entangled allies by focusing on maintaining joint operational forces and power projection in the region. Importantly, the United States was not an official party in the agreement. However, the final agreement was met with high praise by the Trump administration as a vital success for U.S. national security interests in the Indian Ocean and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;special-operations-forces&quot;&gt;Special Operations Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions between the U.S. and UK militaries have historically taken place through a patchwork of relationships between specialized communities. Although there are no formal frameworks governing cooperation, the relationship between the countries’ special operations forces is particularly significant in this regard. From a U.S. perspective, what the UK forces have not been able to deliver in terms of quantity has been compensated by their quality and interoperability with U.S. units. For example, the two countries have deployed special forces together as part of the Joint Special Operations Command Task Force in the Iraq War, a temporary grouping often assigned to engage high-value targets. U.S. and UK special operations units also regularly train together, both on a bilateral level and through NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-kingdoms-current-strategic-dilemma&quot;&gt;The United Kingdom’s Current Strategic Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-kingdom-and-europe-after-brexit&quot;&gt;The United Kingdom and Europe After Brexit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, British voters opted to leave the European Union in a referendum that altered the economic and political trajectory of the United Kingdom. In the ensuing nine years, the United country has become more estranged from the continent and has experienced economic stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Brexit vote, UK strategy sought to turn away from Europe and toward the rest of the world. Prime Minister Teresa May declared that the post-Brexit era of “Global Britain” was beginning. After officially departing the European Union on December 31, 2020, the UK government conducted an “Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy,” in essence a national security strategy, that paid almost no attention to Europe. Instead, “Global Britain” would aggressively seek new trading agreements around the world. For instance, the United Kingdom signed onto the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement involving 11 countries in the Indo-Pacific and the Americas, in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, instead of accelerating growth by removing the “shackles” of EU regulation, Brexit has created structural barriers that have exacerbated the United Kingdom’s economic challenges. In particular, it has made it more cumbersome to do business with the European Union. Given the European Union has around 450 million people and is an economy roughly equivalent in size to the United States or China in terms of purchasing power, Brexit erected barriers to an enormous neighboring market in which British producers had been highly enmeshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, following the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–08, London enacted deep austerity measures. A lack of economic investment, together with the uncertainty and friction from Brexit, has led to sluggish growth and reduced investment. Covid-19 also contributed to high inflation, which was then exacerbated by an energy crisis following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, leaving the United Kingdom with some of the highest energy prices in Europe. The United Kingdom was the only member of the G7 yet to restore pre-pandemic levels of GDP by 2023, with foreign direct investment inflows falling 37 percent for six years prior. It then slipped into a technical recession in the final quarter of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a defense policy perspective, the United Kingdom is facing a myriad of resource constraints that will hinder its ability to be as capable a global partner for the United States as it has been in the past. Despite recent efforts to ramp up defense spending to meet NATO commitments, the British Armed Forces are anemic after decades of budget cuts—spending began winding down at the end of the Cold War and has fallen an additional 22 percent between FY 2009 and FY 2016. Similarly, between 2014 and 2023, following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the United Kingdom displayed the lowest real increase in defense spending among NATO members, totaling a mere 6.84 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-the-strategic-defence-review&quot;&gt;Enter the Strategic Defence Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In announcing the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 2024, Starmer identified an opportunity for the United Kingdom to be a leader in an increasingly “dangerous and volatile world.” His new Labour government commissioned the SDR as a broad and comprehensive effort to reassess “the threats Britain faces, the capabilities needed to meet them, the state of UK armed forces and the resources available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revising London’s overarching defense strategy has become a regular practice in the past decade, this being the third iteration in the past five years. But the SDR is intended to be different. Its scope, process, and context suggest a complete strategic overhaul. According to Secretary of State for Defense John Healey, it is the “first of its kind” and will set the direction for the Starmer administration. It seeks to be more akin to the sweeping changes in the United States brought about by the Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous UK defense strategy was produced in 2023 by the Conservative government following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While its key takeaways doubled down on many of the trends identified in the 2021 review, two years of war on the European continent and an increasingly volatile threat assessment demanded a shift toward building military capacity and stockpiles to fight a conventional war. Prior reviews had largely failed to address key questions concerning capability gaps in national defense and the United Kingdom’s contribution to NATO. They also offered little fiscal flexibility for the country to shape new procurement processes or rapidly rearm itself. The 2023 defense strategy increased defense spending by only £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) compared to the 2021 strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 SDR attempts to challenge the existing status quo, especially regarding defense and procurement processes. Notably, the review was led by an independent panel of experts rather than just internal figures within the Ministry of Defence. Its chair, former NATO Secretary General George Robertson, worked alongside General Sir Richard Barrons and former senior White House national security official Fiona Hill. Their review was supported by perspectives from nearly 150 experts from across government, the military, industry, academia, international partners, and the public. The report very much digests the lessons learned from Ukraine and is focused on how to get the United Kingdom ready for war. While the report does not outwardly say that the United Kingdom is unprepared, that is the obvious conclusion. Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute concludes “the implication is clear: assuming this is what it takes to be ready for modern war, then the UK is lagging badly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for the United Kingdom is that its armed forces, particularly its army, are not big enough. The review says the end strength should be increased “when funding allows.” To make up for the lack of size and the significant costs of many of the weapons used to equip the force, the SDR seeks to leverage technology to increase overall firepower, as well as to better integrate UK forces together to increase their battlefield impact. A key focus is also on defense production and producing cost-effective munitions and drones. In assessing the SDR, Olivia O’Sullivan and Marion Messmer at Chatham House write, “A central commitment is the development of ‘always on’ munitions capacity—creating an industry that is capable of rapidly increasing production in the event of high-intensity conflict. That is a key lesson from Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR also seeks to provide a framework ensuring that UK forces can prepare and deter against threats under a broad range of parameters. This includes the country’s commitment to nuclear deterrence, homeland security, support for Ukraine, retention of personnel, technological innovation, and procurement strategy. As for nuclear deterrence, the United Kingdom has recently announced it will procure the F-35A Lightning variant, which is able to deliver nuclear payloads, thereby adding a second leg to the country’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the SDR is a “NATO-first” approach that nevertheless attempts to maintain a global role for the United Kingdom. The review includes plans to move quickly to warfighting readiness, including efforts to modernize the country’s force structure to enable integrated multidomain operations and improve efficiency in its acquisition and support strategy. The review highlights key organizational reforms that consider how the government can employ emerging technologies and reinforce partnerships to strengthen its capabilities in areas of vulnerability. Using a whole-of-society approach and key lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, it outlines how the United Kingdom can accelerate national preparedness and wartime resilience while continuing to lead in international coalitions such as AUKUS and the Northern European Joint Expeditionary Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also highlights the importance of coordinating procurement with European NATO partners. This is an important nod to the growing effort within the European Union to create economies of scale and to reduce the sprawling number of systems employed by European militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tough-choices-ahead&quot;&gt;The Tough Choices Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London faces a strategic dilemma: it seeks to pursue an ambitious defense agenda but must abide by considerable resource constraints. This effort will necessitate reassessing Britain’s strategic footprint in Europe and Asia, recalibrating its defense relationship with the European Union, and identifying internal reforms to address personnel, defense industrial, and process and bureaucratic issues currently straining its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities for reform are vast and span a suite of issues, including centering emerging technology as the backbone of the British Armed Forces, ensuring domestic resilience, increasing the efficiency of procurement processes, and setting the right balance between land- and sea-focused forces. The SDR reviewers were carefully instructed to make their recommendations feasible “within the trajectory” of a spending increase from the current 2.3 percent of GDP on defense to the NATO target of 2.5 percent. This was a budgetary challenge before the 2025 NATO Summit. Now, London supposedly seeks to dramatically increase its defense spending commitments in the medium term, as Starmer joined NATO leaders in the Hague in their commitment to significantly raise the spending target to 3.5 percent on core defense and an additional 1.5 percent on defense-related areas. To hit these targets would require an additional $41 billion annually, and it is unclear where that money will come from. What is clear, is that although the British government has accepted all 62 recommendations set out by the SDR since its release, implementing the kind of structural shift the review demands will be easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of overall strategic reform means the United Kingdom will confront a swathe of hard choices in the coming years. Several high-profile initiatives take up a significant portion of the UK defense budget. For example, the cost of maintaining a nuclear deterrent has risen from 5–6 percent of defense spending around five years ago to at least 19 percent in 2025. The AUKUS agreement to build submarines for Australia—as well as the Global Combat Air Programme, a project to develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet with Italy and Japan—is not only expensive but also seemingly “set in stone” in future UK defense budgets. Additionally, the SDR believes the size of the army needs to grow, yet there is no funding presently to increase end strength. This leaves little maneuvering room to fill other capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-britain-or-nato-first&quot;&gt;“Global Britain” or “NATO First?”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive U.S. administrations have been inconsistent in how they want London to allocate resources between Europe and Asia. The Biden administration pushed European allies to ramp up their activities in the Indo-Pacific, for example, through freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea. Officials from the Trump administration have signaled a reversal of this course by suggesting that the UK military should focus squarely on the Euro-Atlantic region, particularly in support of Ukraine. A 2024 CSIS report argued that the United Kingdom should focus on leading in Europe, given the threat posed by Russia and the challenges of contributing in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the United Kingdom could increase London’s importance to both Washington and Brussels, as well as other European capitals, by contributing to the building of a European pillar of NATO. With the potential for a significant reduction in the United States’ military presence in Europe on the horizon, the United Kingdom—the only non-U.S. NATO member that assigns its strategic deterrent to NATO—is uniquely positioned to mediate a new burden-sharing or burden-shifting arrangement. Bolstering ties with Europe’s economic and military powerhouses—France, Germany, and Poland—may lay the foundation for a new “European Quad” leadership group to coordinate efforts to support Ukraine, rearm Europe, and deter Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-joint-expeditionary-force&quot;&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubling down on British leadership of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is also a worthwhile pursuit. The JEF is led by the United Kingdom and counts nine other nations as members, including the Netherlands and the eight Nordic and Baltic states, and is intended to provide a rapid response capacity. Leaning into the JEF might also offer a pathway to mitigate the gap left by expected reductions in U.S. forces. From its foundation in NATO’s “Framework of Nations” concept, the JEF has become an important cog in the broader European defense architecture. JEF nations are also among the highest spenders on defense in Europe—making the force a potentially vital avenue for sustaining European deterrence in the near term as the continent reacts to a reduced U.S. presence. As Ed Arnold of the Royal United Services Institute notes: “If the US disengages, no single European power, or groups, can fill the vacuum. Therefore, an update to the RPG [regional planning group] model and increased regionalisation might be the only way to keep NATO together in a configuration that is close to its current form.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the JEF’s importance would grow following any U.S. troop departures, the force should not be seen or marketed as a like-for-like replacement for U.S. forces, especially ground forces, on the continent. The Nordic and Baltic countries in the JEF certainly have capable militaries, but the force does not include Europe’s large continental military powers: France, Germany, and Poland. Moreover, while some Europeans might see a United Kingdom that is newly reengaged with Europe on defense as a good-enough replacement for the United States, UK military capacity is nowhere near what it once was, particularly when it comes to ground forces. London thus needs to market the JEF soberly—not as a cure to American-less European defense but as an important tool that enhances the continent’s overall security. A strong JEF does not obviate the need to construct a more integrated European defense effort, whether through NATO or outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aukus&quot;&gt;AUKUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite seemingly being focused on Australia and the Indo-Pacific, the lines of effort in AUKUS are relatively geographically agnostic, meaning its applications are strategically beneficial in both the European and Indo-Pacific arenas. U.S. technologies shared through Pillar Two will increase the United Kingdom’s role as a top-tier undersea power and strengthen its capabilities in the North Atlantic. To achieve such ambitions, specific recommendations for restructuring found in the SDR will certainly help. Local-national partnerships to combat historic underinvestment in Barrow—a town critical to the United Kingdom’s defense manufacturing goals—seek to reignite progress by identifying critical early-stage commercial innovation and ensuring adequate resources. Such a focus could overhaul stagnation in implementation for Pillar Two and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent. In a transatlantic context, reinforcing the United Kingdom’s commitment to AUKUS also deepens ties in the U.S.-UK nuclear relationship, furthering innovation goals that position both countries at the forefront of military technology. Its focus on developing critical and globally competitive technologies to expand economic and strategic influence further strengthens the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London’s well-established partnerships could help it fill specific gaps in Western force posture and command and control that could develop amid a U.S. withdrawal. Yet key challenges remain, notably the weak and fragmented nature of European defense cooperation, which historically has depended on a mixture of bilateral agreements, NATO contributions, and small-group cooperation on specific issue sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-eu-relations&quot;&gt;UK-EU Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United Kingdom is to lead on European security, it needs to deepen cooperation with the European Union—not just to bolster its own defense industrial base, but to shape and support the continent’s collective security ambitions. At the UK-EU summit in May, a defense and security agreement was reached that lays the groundwork for British inclusion in growing European defense initiatives. However, a more complex agreement will be necessary to grant UK companies access to the European Union’s new €150 billion lending facility, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) fund. While SAFE provides financing to member states, it may pave the way for other EU defense initiatives. If the bloc becomes an active weapons procurer, whether through budget growth or issuing joint debt through eurobonds, the United Kingdom will want to be part of that structure. Brussels has also made it a priority to involve London given how important British firms are to the broader European defense industrial base. However, UK integration into these initiatives will likely require “paying in,” perhaps by contributing to the EU budget or servicing EU debt. Other non-EU NATO countries such as Norway already contribute to the EU budget and therefore are included in its defense initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer’s Labour government has its work cut out for it to revive economic growth and maintain fiscal prudence, all the while navigating a volatile global landscape mired by trade uncertainty and a revanchist Russia eyeing Europe’s eastern flank. However, Britain’s economic outlook has left the government little budget space to make an ambitious reform agenda reality. Within this context, the following general recommendations for the United Kingdom would help ensure the continued vitality of the special relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to lead on Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; London and Paris have led the effort to create a “coalition of the willing” to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire or peace agreement. However, with talks unlikely to settle the conflict, and with the United States unlikely to allocate more military aid to Ukraine under the Trump administration, the United Kingdom should instead play a vital role in sustaining Ukraine. This could involve more bilateral military assistance, such as the most recent package of air defense support promised by Starmer in June, or encouraging and participating in a collective EU effort to aid Ukraine, as argued in a recent CSIS report. A sustained commitment to a peacekeeping force will not only require spending but also adhering to recommendations in the SDR to overcome long-standing issues with recruitment and retention in UK forces. Moreover, London, which has shared significant intelligence with Kyiv and allies, should plan to help fill or mitigate gaps in case the United States cuts off intelligence support to Ukraine again—as it did for a week after the disastrous Oval Office meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus U.S.-UK relations on European security.&lt;/strong&gt; If the United Kingdom takes a leadership role in Europe, it will become more important to the United States, allowing London to once again serve as a transatlantic bridge and translator of events in Europe, something that was lost post-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep working with the European Union on defense, and push the European Union to do more.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of trying to work around the European Union and encourage other “like-minded” European countries to do the same, the United Kingdom should be encouraging member states to leverage the bloc’s untapped power and capacity, especially to generate resources for defense and rationalize and integrate the European defense sector. It should also push for greater EU cooperation and integration with NATO, particularly regarding funding for defense activities. Having London adopt a forward-leaning posture on EU defense initiatives not only makes sense on merit, it would also help spur an improvement in relations with the European Union and position it to lead on defense in Europe. This should also be encouraged by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the lead on European defense planning, intelligence, and strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The United Kingdom should be prepared to help fill any defense planning and strategy gap left in the wake of a U.S. force withdrawal. Presently, it is the United States European Command (EUCOM) that thinks holistically about the defense of Europe. It is important that European nations also build capacity for similar thinking and planning, whether within NATO or outside of it—with London taking a lead role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize economic growth.&lt;/strong&gt; A more prosperous United Kingdom is one that will invest more funds into defense. Therefore, the United States should encourage the United Kingdom and European Union to take steps to lower economic barriers between them. The United Kingdom exports almost as much to the European Union as it does to the rest of the world combined. Therefore, improving cross-channel economic relations is not just beneficial from an economic perspective but will help improve economic growth, allowing the country to invest more in defense. Conversely, the United States should avoid steps that impinge on the United Kingdom’s growth. While it is positive that an agreement was reached to lower the tariffs placed on UK imports by the Trump administration, the remaining 10 percent blanket U.S. tariffs, in concert with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum auto parts, will harm the United Kingdom’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Washington has right-sized expectations for the special relationship.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to recognize the fiscal and military realities confronting the United Kingdom and adjust its expectations accordingly. Too often Washington has expected London to be able to do everything the United States does, just at a slightly smaller scale. It should anticipate a greater division of labor in the special relationship and encourage the United Kingdom to set clear priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow through on established priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Lengthy government reports often start out claiming to want to set clear priorities but struggle to balance many competing interests. The SDR has pledged to ruthlessly prioritize—and now needs to follow through. Moreover, Washington has initiative fatigue from its UK partners. As the United Kingdom has had four prime ministers in just the past three years, British officials have been continuously presenting new strategy documents and initiatives to Washington, which is left bewildered about the United Kingdom’s strategic direction. London needs to set a course and stick to it, as well as narrow the scope of its commitments with an eye to its resource limitations This is particularly necessary because U.S. policy toward Europe’s security remains incoherent and inconsistent. Far from showing weakness, this will demonstrate the United Kingdom’s reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight the innovative aspects of the SDR to U.S. and European defense planners.&lt;/strong&gt; The SDR seeks to internalize the lessons of the war in Ukraine and adapt those lessons to a modern NATO military. Thus, there is much for other NATO militaries to learn from this review. Of great interest to the alliance are areas relating to procurement, future force structure and design, innovation and technological adaptation, and private sector innovation, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR’s focus on speeding up and streamlining procurement is of particular relevance across the alliance. The SDR hits the current UK procurement system hard. Grace Cassy of Chatham House, part of the SDR review team, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Procurement takes an average of 6.5 years for projects with a value of more than £20 million. The result is that the UK has a narrow base of large suppliers who have the balance sheet to survive the procurement cycle. Digital capabilities have been de-prioritized to fund other long-running equipment programmes. Put simply, the UK has raided the future to pay for the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That assessment is no doubt similar in almost every ministry of defense in NATO, as well as at the Pentagon in the United States. The United Kingdom should thus widely share its findings—at both the political and technical level. Importantly, the United Kingdom should not just view this as a one-off diplomatic engagement but should track lessons learned as it seeks to implement many of the recommendations and should brief allies and partners in the coming years about its experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 SDR is a clear inflection point for British defense strategy and makes clear that several of the key forces challenging the special relationship have come to a point. The United Kingdom does not have the military presence or capacity it once did and, in many ways, is struggling to define a clear global identity and role in the European security architecture. At the same time, the storied relationship between the United States and United Kingdom, combined with the potential for focused and productive growth laid out by the SDR, proves that the United Kingdom is still an incredibly impactful ally for the United States. This is why it is vital for both partners to right-size expectations in the special relationship and focus on redefining a purpose-driven relationship—for one, concrete development in UK military capabilities will enhance its preparedness for war in an increasingly treacherous global landscape. It will also demonstrate an effort to appease President Trump’s calls for Europe to take a big step up in its defense spending, which may help keep trade tensions at bay and help the United Kingdom grow economically without falling victim to transatlantic economic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By establishing a complete strategic overhaul, the United Kingdom has established a resource-intensive but high-reward outlook for the future of its defense capabilities. The SDR focuses on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine and a path to take tangible steps forward in innovation, procurement, and economic growth. Britain’s leadership role in supporting Ukraine among European countries offers a clear model for its persona going forward, particularly as the United States contemplates pulling back from the European theater. However, doing so will require streamlining limited resources to enhance its capabilities in areas of acute strategic advantage which ultimately benefit allied interests in Europe. Pivoting its strategy or resources to attempt to meet unrealistic demands could set the United Kingdom up for immense failure in its attempt to increase wartime preparedness, and may even inhibit critical growth in all aspects of its economy. Instead, the focus should be on lowering trade barriers between both partners to revitalize the British economy, support the domestic defense industrial base, and ultimately make the goals presented in the SDR for British defense capabilities significantly more palpable despite serious challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short period since the SDR’s release, it is clear that the road ahead will not be easy. The special relationship rests at the heart of its future, but the key to maintaining the vitality of U.S.-UK ties will be a focused effort to stick to a plan that sets reasonable expectations and concretely meet the goals it lays out. This demands a sober calculation of its resource constraints and what the United Kingdom can reasonably deliver with respect to both its short- and long-term security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;律政司：《基本法》賦權否決財案不代表可「為所欲為」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;律政司基本法賦權否決財案不代表可為所欲為&quot;&gt;律政司：《基本法》賦權否決財案不代表可「為所欲為」&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/26FEGpi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。11人不服定罪上訴，認罪的黃子悅提刑期上訴。案件今（15日）在西九龍法院（暫代高院上訴庭）繼續上訴聆訊。律政司一方回應昨日上訴一方的陳詞，指「無差別」否決財政預算案迫使特首下台，明顯地是違背了《基本法》第73條所定下的立會職權，構成濫權；又指《基本法》附件已訂立指引如何達到「雙普選」，批評上訴方利用爭取普選來合理化否決財案的行為，只是轉移視線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後上訴方就各人的案情陳詞。其中鄭達鴻一方指，當時願意跟隨公民黨否決財案的路線，是為了得到黨的支持而參選初選和其後的立法會選舉，這與他一旦當選後會否按自己意願還是「跟黨投票」並不相同，惟原審法庭未有對鄭與黨之間想法上的分歧給予充份比重。梁國雄一方則指，早在案發之前已曾投票反對財案，因未有包含全民退休保障或任何幫助基層的措施，強調並非「為否決而否決」，而是考慮過財案利弊才決定投什麼票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SjESmK6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的11名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表包括：副刑事檢控專員周天行、高級檢控官吳加悅、徐倩姿和莊文欣等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司基本法已指引如何達至普選-質疑上訴方以爭取普選來合理化否決財案&quot;&gt;律政司：《基本法》已指引如何達至普選 質疑上訴方以爭取普選來合理化否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行回應昨日上訴方有關法律議題的陳詞。周指，上訴方嘗試以他們的方式重構控方案情，然而控方實際上並不是指稱被告拒絕審視財案利弊優劣，而是指稱不論財政預算案的內容或優劣，被告均打算「無差別」否決，明顯地是違背了《基本法》第73條所定下的職權，構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，上訴方似乎利用《基本法》承諾達至普選，來合理化被告否決財案的行為，然而這只是轉移視線（red herring）。因《基本法》附件一及二已列出行政長官和立法會的產生辦法，指引香港特區如何達到「雙普選」；《基本法》清晰地列出立法會的職能和權力，以及當財案被否決後、不同情況下應採取什麼做法及怎樣運用權力，是為了應對不同的處境，不代表議員有權否決財案便可以「為所欲為」；周反指他們應該跟從《基本法》所定下的框架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周亦提到，上訴方指稱立法會可以拒絕通過財案，以迫使特首辭職，是另一個荒謬的例子，亦吻合他們濫權的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司司法不應干預立法會的法律原則並非絕對不適用本案&quot;&gt;律政司：司法不應干預立法會的法律原則並非絕對、不適用本案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周指，上訴方昨提及司法不應干預立法會行使權力的法律原則，並非絕對，而且不適用於本案。原審法官已在裁決理由書中充份及正確地處理有關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周亦指，上訴方提交的海外案例，對於本案的協助有限，因海外的案例並不能處理《基本法》和《國安法》之下香港特有的法律框架，也削弱了「應在憲法框架下行使權力」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司顛覆國家政權條文下非法手段並不僅限於刑事行為&quot;&gt;律政司：顛覆國家政權條文下「非法手段」並不僅限於「刑事行為」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴方昨日堅稱《國安法》第22條涉及「顛覆國家政權」罪行條文中，「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」中的「非法手段（unlawful means）」，必然意指「刑事行為（criminal acts）」。周天行則反駁指，若然「非法手段」僅限於「刑事行為」的話，只會使「或者其他非法手段」字眼變得多餘（otiose），沒有任何實質意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指，原審法官在裁決中已正確地指出「非法手段」並不僅限於「刑事行為」或牽涉武力，相反「非法手段」還可以包括任何法律上不容許的手段，解讀時須視乎條文的上文下理和立法目的，而且法庭考慮條文的上文下理時應採取較廣闊的理解。周又指，原審裁決理由書中乃比對了《國安法》下其他條文的用字，例如「通過各種非法方式引發⋯⋯憎恨並可能造成嚴重後果」、「其他危險方法」，從而得出結論，又指草擬《國安法》的人士使用「非法手段」字眼，在用字方面是故意，為了包涵各式各樣的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方基本法未有規定議員怎樣運用權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：《基本法》未有規定議員怎樣運用權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文回應指，《基本法》並未有規定議員怎樣運用權力，舉例指沒有限制議員發言時間，反問議員行使權力否決財案的背後理由，是否應受到法庭審視？答案是否定，按照「不干預」的原則，法庭不應插手有關議題，否則的話，議員行使權力的方式可被刑事化，後果是非常嚴重和影響深遠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於律政司一方指稱上訴人以普選來合理化否決財案的行為，只是轉移視線，沈士文表示不同意，因《基本法》附件並非「答案」，雖然《基本法》第68條表明香港會達至立法會由普選產生，可是社會上對於普選路線圖仍存在很多分歧和爭議。沈士文最後重申，《基本法》設下的機制是為了處理立法會的「死局」，並不會在法律上構成「顛覆政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨贊同35計劃不代表贊同無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;吳政亨：贊同「35+」計劃不代表贊同「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接著上訴方就各人的案情陳詞。代表吳政亨的大律師關文渭指，吳與首被告戴耀廷之間從沒有就否決財政預算案有任何討論。關強調，吳贊同「35+」計劃並不代表他同樣贊同「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JR7EKAR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，戴耀廷有可能與不同的參選人達成不同的協議，而且不同參選人可能出席了不同地區的協調會議，收到不同的會議文件，因此戴與吳之間可能達成了的協議，是不同於戴與其他參選人之間的協議。關強調，舉辦初選乃至在立會奪取大多數議席並無問題，這可能是戴與吳之間的協議，吳不應因而被定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻從沒主張無差別否決財案-原審法庭未充份考慮不會跟黨投票&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻：從沒主張「無差別」否決財案 原審法庭未充份考慮不會跟黨投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的資深大律師潘熙指，有關在協調會議文件上應該使用「會積極運用」還是「會運用」《基本法》權力，初選參與者之間從沒達成共識，尤其是在鄭達鴻所屬的港島區，因此犯罪計劃並不存在，惟原審法庭未有予以充份考慮，犯了錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續指，即使犯罪計劃確實存在，鄭達鴻也不是犯罪計劃的一份子，因當時鄭是公民黨裡相對年輕的黨員，是「小人物（small potato）」，不像較資深的黨員般有決策權，即使鄭的想法與黨不一致，但他也沒有權去控制或「話事」。鄭當時願意跟隨公民黨否決財案的路線，是為了得到黨的支持而參選初選和其後的立法會選舉，這與他一旦當選後會否按自己意願還是「跟黨投票」並不相同，惟原審法庭未有區分兩者之間的分別。潘又指，原審法庭未有對鄭與黨之間想法上的分歧給予充份比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘續指，鄭本人抱持著希望，相信政府會回應市民訴求，例如政府的確撤回了《逃犯條例》修訂，某程度上回應了「五大訴求」之一，因此鄭相信，若然財案被否決的話，政府會與他們對話，強調鄭從沒主張「無差別」否決財案，反而是經考慮利弊之後才決定投票贊成還是反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官未有考慮鄭達鴻與其他黨友的言論有別，也未有考慮鄭曾經自行研究過《基本法》；若果鄭相信自己的行為並不會癱瘓政府運作，法庭便不能推論他懷有「顛覆」意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄過去曾考慮基層政策而投反對票-非為否決而否決&quot;&gt;梁國雄：過去曾考慮基層政策而投反對票 非「為否決而否決」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙接著代表梁國雄陳詞，他指由於梁未有親自作供，原審法官在裁決理由書中，僅用了11個段落便裁定梁罪成。潘指梁從沒參與任何討論或出席任何初選協調會議，僅派出代表出席會議。區諾軒的證供更顯示，同屬社民連的黃浩銘曾提醒區：「陣間開會，唔好應承人哋會否決財政預算案嘅講法」；岑子杰亦曾在會議上表明，若果財政預算案包含全民退休保障的話，社民連會投贊成票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘指，梁國雄從不支持「攬炒」概念，惟原審裁決引述社民連在2020年5月所發布的文章〈爭奪全面否決權持續不斷抗暴政 — 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉，指稱他們立場轉變，即是轉為支持奪取大多數議席以行使否決權。潘則反駁，該文章並不足以證明他們立場由不支持變為支持「無差別」否決財案，因社民連一直以來均以「改善基層及勞動市民生活為先」，所以不會「無差別」否決財案。若果法庭接納黃浩銘和陳寶瑩代表社民連在會議上的言論，那麼梁國雄便沒有打算「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙指，早在案發之前，擔任立法會議員的梁國雄亦曾經對財案投過反對票，因為他認為財案未有包含全民退休保障或任何幫助基層的措施，又或者梁認為有關財政預算屬「不義撥款」，因而投下反對票。潘強調，梁並非「為否決而否決」，而是考慮過財案利弊才決定投什麼票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈從無在fb發布墨落無悔帖文&quot;&gt;楊雪盈：從無在FB發布「墨落無悔」帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良陳詞指，楊在案中屬最低參與程度，她的名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明帖文上的其他聯署人之中，可是她從未在 Facebook 發布「墨落無悔」帖文，沒有證據顯示誰人加入楊的名字，「這是一個謎」；然而原審裁決指唯一合理推論是她知悉「墨落無悔」的內容，同意及有意推動涉案謀劃，屬犯了嚴重錯誤。張反指，有可能把楊的名字加入聯署者名單是另有其人，可是案中沒有任何證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，楊雪盈的宣傳小冊子列出她的9項政治主張，涵蓋動物權益、環保、性小眾和社區發展等，而「五大訴求」僅為其中之一，顯示楊是一名特立獨行的政治人物，較有興趣涉足社會服務，而不會視自己為民主派，因此她對於跟隨戴耀廷的計劃不感興趣。張並舉例指，楊沒有親自出席第一次的協調會議，只是派出一名代表，惟原審法官忽視第一次協調會議並有未達成共識否決財案，第二及第三次會議則只談及流程，因此原審裁定楊對否決財案計劃知情，必然是不符事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良亦指，原審法官考慮了不相關的證據，包括警方在楊的辦公室電腦搜獲的一份草擬文件，當中提及她「一定會否決」預算案。張指該文件從沒有公開發布、沒有轉發給其他人，當警方發現該文件時，楊幾乎忘記了有這樣的文件，沒有證據顯示楊在選舉工程中使用過它。張堅稱，該文件所載的只是「選舉語言」，質疑原審法官不應斷定該文件是楊為初選準備的「統一口徑（lines to take）」或選舉論壇筆記，從而裁定楊有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張總結指，楊表示會否決財案，只是因為財政預算案向有錢人傾側，未能惠及真正有需要的市民，電腦搜獲的文件亦未能顯示楊會聯同其他民主派一起「無差別」否決財案。張並強調楊有自己的政治主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全作為最勤力議員-不會一反常態不再擁護基本法和特區政府&quot;&gt;陳志全：作為最勤力議員 不會一反常態不再擁護《基本法》和特區政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明的大律師馬維騉指，何僅就法律議題上訴，沒有任何補充。馬維騉另代表陳志全，指陳當時任職立法會議員，因出席率達99%而被讚為最勤力議員，甚至獲時任立法會主席讚賞。陳當時熟悉公共事務，並且必然知悉《基本法》第50至53條下，特首解散立法會的權力，以及重選後若然立法會第二度否決財案的話，特首便須辭職，以及《基本法》第73條列明的立法會議員職能，這是毋庸置疑的。因此，陳是否有干犯「顛覆國家政權」罪的傾向，便有商榷之處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，陳從沒有在選舉論壇、網台節目或遊行期間，提及過會「無差別」否決財政預算案。相反，陳過去曾與親建制派合作，支持政府政策。馬反問，陳作為一名宣誓效忠《基本法》和特區政府的時任立法會議員，他有意圖「無差別」否決財案、癱瘓政府運作，是否唯一不可抗拒的推論？馬質疑，原審法官未有對陳的證供給予充份比重，反而考慮控方證據，指稱陳突然一反常態，不再擁護《基本法》和特區政府，這是否一個公平的推論？馬質疑法庭不能達致唯一不可抗拒的推論，陳的定罪並不穩妥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文則陳詞指，雖然警方在林卓廷的住所搜到論壇筆記，當中提及他附和胡志偉否決財案的主意，但是林從沒有在論壇上採用這份筆記所述的主意，更反而表明若然政府在財政預算案中包含「派錢」措施的話，便不會投反對票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，黃和林從沒有主張「無差別」否決財案，也沒有出席過初選協調會議，只是派出黨友莊榮輝作為代表，可見二人並不感興趣，因此沒有證據顯示二人在會上聽過戴耀廷講述涉案計劃，二人並不知情。再者，根據第一控方證人區諾軒的證供，沒有任何一個協調會議曾達成共識同意「無差別」否決財案，與會者的共識從來只限於舉辦初選論壇、爭取的議席數目和替補機制等。&lt;/p&gt;

Foreign ship construction can rapidly deliver the needed icebreakers as the U.S. grows its domestic shipbuilding industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has an ongoing and growing national security risk in the Arctic. Due to the lack of U.S. presence in the region, the country is unable to sufficiently counter, or even fully understand, this risk. While Russia’s over 40 polar icebreakers, compared to the United States’ current three (with only one a true heavy polar icebreaker) may seem like a glaring disparity, China’s four icebreakers (with a fifth on the way) are arguably more distressing. A direct comparison of icebreaker numbers with Russia is not a fair measure, because Russia has different operational demands in the Arctic (e.g., more ports, waterways, and Arctic area for their icebreakers to service). However, China is not an Arctic nation, and currently has more polar icebreakers than the United States—and is likely to continue outpacing the United States’ sluggish icebreaker construction effort. This constitutes a giant spotlight on the U.S. national security risk in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) polar icebreaker acquisition challenges are well known, having been the subject of several recent congressional hearings, multiple articles, and a comment recently made by President Trump about ordering 40 big icebreakers. The USCG’s then–deputy commandant for operations, Vice Admiral Peter Gautier, and then–deputy commandant for mission support, Vice Admiral Thomas Allan Jr., testified before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on November 14, 2024, on the USCG’s icebreaker recapitalization efforts. Those testimonies affirmed the U.S. national security risk in the Arctic, the USCG’s need for more ice breaking capacity now, and the sad state of the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) acquisition program. The continued PSC acquisition challenges were further acknowledged again by Vice Admiral Allan Jr.’s testimonies before the House Committee on Homeland Security on December 18, 2024, and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 5, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is fully aware of the growing national security risk in the Arctic: President Trump announced the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding in his 2025 State of the Union address and addressed the problem further in his recent executive order, Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance. But the PSC solution remains a distant reality. The USCG was unable to provide a date for delivery of the first PSC when the subject was raised during the recent hearings; 2033 was mentioned by Representative Rick Larsen during the March 5 hearing. But estimates have continued to slide for years, and the 2033 date must be eyed with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract for the first PSC was announced in 2019 with a planned delivery in 2024. That date has passed, and the first PSC is still being designed (albeit nearing completion) and the shipbuilder and USCG do not have enough understanding of the totality of the project to provide a delivery estimate with any level of confidence. This is especially distressing as the three-ship PSC acquisition cost has ballooned almost threefold from $1.9 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;The Origins of the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSC is a large, complicated ship, and the U.S. shipbuilding industry has not constructed a heavy icebreaker in 50 years. The reasons for the PSC being delayed and over budget are many, and they are all justifiable to a certain degree. Responsibility for the problems ends up being a circular argument where all stakeholders share portions of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major overarching problem with all federal ship acquisitions is that they are sluggish, even in the best of circumstances. The laws and regulations governing major system acquisition programs are partly to blame, and are being targeted for reform by President Trump’s recent Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base executive order. It takes years to amass all the written analyses, reports, and documents to support the acquisition of a major system. Ten years is used as the USCG’s general planning factor when starting a new cutter acquisition—that is about how long it takes to run the acquisition gamut between identifying a future capability gap to taking delivery of the first new cutter when all goes smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the USCG’s Fast Response Cutter (FRC) acquisition as an example, the USCG documented the need to recapitalize their aging fleet of 110-ft patrol boats in a 1995 Mission Analysis Report and commenced the ignominious Integrated Deepwater System program in 1996 to comprehensively recapitalize its aged fleet of cutters, aircraft, and boats. After several fits and starts, the FRC program contract was awarded in its current state in 2008 and the USCG took delivery of the first FRC hull in early 2012. That is 17 years from documented need to delivery of the first hull, a distressingly long time for a class of cutters that is relatively simple and small, and that ultimately utilized an off-the-shelf design. The FRC acquisition demonstrates that even a 10-year planning timeline can be ambitious for a major system acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what is possible across the global shipbuilding industry from a construction perspective, take the Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas cruise ship as an example. The contract for the Icon of the Seas was announced in 2016, construction began in June of 2021, and the ship was completed and departed on its first voyage in January 2024—less than three years later. Acknowledging the apples to oranges comparison, the Icon of the Seas is arguably more complicated than the PSC—the PSC has no waterparks, mini-golf courses, or ice rinks, and will accommodate roughly 7,000 fewer people. If a ship the size and complexity of the Icon of the Seas can be brought into operation in a matter of years, why not a heavy polar icebreaker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a miracle if the USCG took delivery of the first PSC before the end of the decade and lucky if a 2033 delivery comes through. If that is unacceptable to the administration and Congress, something must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-uscg-polar-icebreakers&quot;&gt;The Current State of USCG Polar Icebreakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCG operates the national fleet of active Polar icebreaking ships (cutters), including one heavy icebreaker, USCG Cutter (USCGC) Polar Star, and two medium icebreakers, USCGC Healy and the recently acquired USCGC Storis. Both the Polar Star and Healy are noble cutters and have served the nation admirably, but they are old (49 years and 25 years, respectively) and overdue for replacement. The USCG is largely succeeding in keeping their two legacy polar icebreakers operational by putting their operations and maintenance into “no-fail” status; essentially, they get 100 percent of needed funding. Ideally, all cutters would get 100 percent funding, but the USCG is only completing half of needed cutter maintenance due to funding shortfalls and competing demands. These constraints have outsized negative impacts to the readiness, safety, and effectiveness of the other 240 cutters in the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the USCG spending an outsized portion of its cutter operations and sustainment budget on its polar icebreakers, it has struggled to keep them running. Healy’s equipment casualty in July 2024 called its annual deployment into question. This follows the significant fire in 2020 that necessitated a complex and lengthy replacement of one of its main propulsion motors. Keeping Polar Star running relies on cannibalizing parts from the inactive Polar Sea—a clear indication that the USCG’s sole heavy polar icebreaker and its maintenance program are far from state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of the former offshore supply vessel Aiviq from Edison Chouest Offshore, renamed the USCGC Storis, will certainly help the USCG provide additional presence in the Arctic. However, there are valid reasons why the USCG balked at the Aiviq when discussion around potentially leasing the ship started in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delays in acquiring PSCs forced the USCG to embrace the Aiviq with open if wary arms. Because the Storis was designed and built for different operations than what the USCG intends to use it for, the USCG will attempt to secure appropriations to put the Storis through significant and expensive bouts of retrofits and design changes—including modifications and equipage to comply with damage control, survivability, and cybersecurity policies—to improve the vessel’s ability to perform USCG missions in the polar ice. To focus the Storis’ patrolling effort as soon and as often as possible in the Arctic, these retrofit periods must be shoehorned between regular deployments. Stopping and starting maintenance of that magnitude is typically undesirable due to repeated work shutdowns and startups that add time and cost to the overall project and reduce the time the cutter is available for the crew to operate and train on. However, doing so is necessary in this case to deliver the immediate and recurrent presence in the Arctic that Congress demands. The cutter is expected to perform well and to improve with each successive modification cycle. However, the Storis will forever suffer from issues associated with the design and configuration modifications and it will always be a single-class ship, which will present challenges and added costs for the life of the cutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s June 2020 Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. National Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic Regions directed the analysis of partner-nation icebreaker leasing options and his comment on June 25, 2025, during a NATO Summit press conference about buying a used icebreaker from Finland indicated continued interest in acquiring available foreign icebreakers. Buying or leasing foreign icebreakers could certainly increase the USCG’s presence in the Arctic, but these foreign icebreakers would suffer many of the same capability shortcomings inherent in the Storis. Purchasing a foreign icebreaker would necessitate costly modifications like those planned for the Storis. For a leased ship, it is unlikely that capability shortcomings could be meaningfully ameliorated with modifications given the nature of a lease; the USCG would have to return it in the same state they received it. Leasing contract renewals and the availability of the ships for deployments may not be guaranteed; and the ships may not be available outside of deployments for crew training to build operating proficiency. Some legislative gymnastics would likely be required to even get a foreign vessel purchase or lease on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks to national security in the Arctic are urgent and growing and demand immediate attention. To address these risks, the USCG has identified a need for a mix of eight to nine heavy and medium polar icebreakers. Generally, heavy polar icebreakers are large ships that would enable the exquisite capability of year-round access to polar regions while medium polar icebreakers are comparatively smaller, have a shallower draft and less endurance, and less acquisition and sustainment costs. They will operate in shallower, ice-covered coastal areas where the majority of typical USCG mission demand in the Arctic is expected to occur. As previously discussed, the three-ship PSC program is delayed and overbudget. The planned USCG medium polar icebreaker acquisition program is named the Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) and currently has nothing to show for itself beyond its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-ahead&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments indicate a positive sea change on the horizon for the USCG’s polar icebreaker acquisition programs. Only July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, marking a huge windfall for USCG icebreaking acquisition programs. The bill appropriates the USCG $4.3 billion for the PSC program and $3.5 billion for the bourgeoning Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) medium polar icebreaker program. The appropriations will go a long way to helping make the PSCs and ASCs a reality, but funding does not guarantee the U.S. shipbuilding industry can construct and deliver either class of ship in a timely fashion on budget and on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the USCG issued a Request for Information (RFI) to industry to identify medium polar icebreaking ship designs for the ASC acquisition program that are complete or already in operation and global shipyards able to launch a medium polar icebreaker within 36 months of the contract being awarded. Seeking information from global shipyards is a significant development and is a clear indication that foreign ship construction may be on the table. Note, though, that the RFI seeks the ability to launch rather than deliver a ship within 36 months. A ship can be launched with potentially years’ worth of construction and outfitting yet to go. Because rapid operational deployment is desired and international shipyards have demonstrated the ability to deliver polar icebreakers the size of an ASC within 36 months, the USCG should instead use delivery timing as the desired performance measure. Otherwise, the USCG may find itself in a situation where an unproven shipyard is able to float the hull within 36 months, only to have the overall project flounder in the familiar ruts for years before delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest way the U.S. can acquire needed polar icebreakers is through foreign icebreaker construction. Yes, foreign ship construction is currently unacceptable for a variety of very good reasons, including compliance with current U.S. law, but it is possible if the U.S. is willing to make it happen. The spectrum of potential foreign involvement in U.S. ship construction spans from simple collaboration and information sharing through full ship delivery. Assuming two foreign shipyards are available to take on the work, a rough best-case scenario calculation is that the U.S. could potentially take delivery of four ASCs and have two of them in full operation by 2030. That is well before the likely delivery of the first PSC and before the USCG is able to make all of its planned annual iterative upgrades to the Storis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several steps Congress and the USCG can take to put the ASC program into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow the USCG to bypass the traditional acquisitions process and go straight to a readily available solution—an existing medium polar icebreaker warship design in current operation, such as the Royal Canadian Navy’s Harry DeWolf–class offshore patrol vessel. This would enable an immediate start to construction, eliminating years’ worth of time devoted to establishing requirements; advertising, bidding, and awarding the contract; and vessel design. Program risk would be reduced through evidence of successful operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construct the ASCs in Canada and/or Finland (perhaps preferred, given alignment with the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE) Pact) and/or by other foreign partner nations. Negotiate a fair market price and commence construction immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not allow “analysis paralysis,” aspirational requirements, or significant design changes to slow the process. Put the acquisition reforms and innovation directed by the recent executive order into action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construct five ASCs of the USCG’s advertised icebreaker fleet mix of eight to nine heavy and medium polar icebreakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Construct the ASCs in whatever foreign shipyards can accommodate their fastest delivery. Preference could be given to Canada and Finland to capitalize on ICE Pact collaboration, but other foreign partner shipyards should not be excluded from competition on a fastest ship delivery performance basis.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate as many major system acquisition requirements and documents as possible. Allow completion of the most useful documents concurrently with the ships’ construction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue with long-term planning and programs to bolster the United States’ shipbuilding and maritime industrial base, such as those proposed by the Congressional Guidance for a National Maritime Strategy and the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, and initiatives championed by the White House Office of Shipbuilding and directed by executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow the PSC program to continue, despite the delays and cost overruns, and the requirement that it be reviewed for cancellation pursuant to section six of the recent acquisition modernization executive order. The $4.3 billion appropriated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act should hopefully be sufficient to get the three ships completed. The PSC program and U.S. shipbuilding industry succeeding would be a point of pride for the U.S. and would help demonstrate the promised value of the ICE Pact, and the money invested would help strengthen and grow the U.S. maritime industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCG should undertake the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partner with U.S. industry for supporting equipment contracts for systems like the command, control, communications, computers, cyber, and intelligence (C5I) suite, weapons systems, small boats, and deck equipment (e.g., davits, cranes, and windlasses). Plan to conduct final ship outfits of all ASCs in a U.S. shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While low on icebreaker capacity, and at little-to-no cost, the USCG should seek opportunities to partner with foreign navies and coast guards active in the polar regions through reciprocal professional exchanges of personnel, shiprider maritime law enforcement agreements, and deployments of law enforcement detachments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will not increase its icebreaker numbers by the end of the decade under the current acquisition plan. Foreign construction of USCG ASCs would be novel and would uncomfortably highlight the shortcomings of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base, but could add four much-needed ASCs to the USCG fleet by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming UK Cyber and Electromagnetic Command (CyberEM) outlined in the Strategic Defence Review could be a much-needed pillar of modernisation. It follows a line of thinking, pre-dating Russia’s 2022 Ukraine invasion, where electronic warfare (characterised by rigid hardware) and cyber operations are increasingly entwined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the past is a guide, we have a long way to go. Four years ago, Future Soldier promised to boost the Army’s electronic warfare (EW) capability “100%”, while UK doctrine from 2018 highlights the “imperative” to master the “convergence” of cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not translated into reality, either in equipment or training. A well-identified problem is a lack of digital skills not only in the MOD but across the defence industry. Plans to address this may not be bold enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s CEMA lessons pose worrying questions for the command if the British Army faced a “fight tonight” scenario. The problem is attracting talent while upskilling CEMA personnel in the Army – which could lose operators to “the domain lead”, CyberEM Command. For this new vision, the pipeline for specialists is thin, with 32 scheduled for training at Shrivenham this year. For context, 13 Signal Regiment was re-formed around a core of roughly 250 specialists. For the new “cyber pipeline” at Shrivenham, “recruitment into cyber roles in 2025 will initially be through the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, with the British Army joining for subsequent recruitment campaigns from early 2026.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM Command will deploy contractors to conflicts as a Digital Warfighter Group alongside soldiers. Bolstering Army generalist ability and specialisation in this field has been identified as a serious near-term problem, so it is vital that this fundamental requirement is not lost amid reorganisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Soldiers must be, at a minimum, aware that the moment of a cyberattack, from disrupting rail transit to the Baltics to a glitch in a wide area network, could preclude kinetic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Systems, deployed in swarms to stream intelligence to commanders, can be hacked “over the air.” UAS cyber exploitation can be avoided with vigilance, but it is an evolving risk. The US is now interested in cyber payloads delivered in radio frequency attacks, degrading or compromising battle networks, and how to defend against this. This capability has long existed in the air domain and was seen in Ukraine when Russian hackers Fancy Bear compromised an early version of a Ukrainian app for artillery in the Donbas – with lethal effect – while Ukraine’s Delta system has been repeatedly targeted. Our networks will hopefully be more robust, but our adversaries will be more capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many cyber activities will be conducted far from the front, much of it by civilian contractors, and CEMA equipment is increasingly user friendly, there is wide agreement that specialists will be in high demand for expeditionary operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because “software-defined warfare” relies on increasing amounts of deployed hardware, such as the Trinity Wide Area network nodes that could be fitted to Boxer armoured vehicles as part of the Digital Targeting Web (DTW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low latency of these networks cannot be assumed. US Marines have reported many hours of struggle coordinating with contractors working in shifts at far away hubs while deploying battlefield networks. In a peer conflict, Royal Signals personnel will be working around the clock on the engineering and cyber side of operations to maintain communications as forces move. Meanwhile, even ruggedised computers can fail in austere environments. The deployable Digital Warfighter Group is logical, but we need more army specialists, not just “button pushers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communications, technology is opening doors. CEMA is increasingly implemented through reprogrammable digital systems while software-defined radios “hop” frequencies 1000s of times a second and spread signals across the spectrum to thwart interception and jamming. CEMA equipment is getting more portable, powerful and “cognitive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort now is to fuse a vast array of new and emerging systems and tactics on an extremely short timeline, including replacing obsolete equipment like the Bowman radio, if Britain is to stand up its DTW by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orchestrating-the-cyber-domain&quot;&gt;Orchestrating the Cyber Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM Command therefore has an important “cohering” role, discussed in the SDR. An increasing number of compact EW systems can be mounted on manned aircraft, drones or ground vehicles to disrupt attacks through deception, attack (to blind adversaries) or a combination of EW and kinetic effects, passively seeking and destroying radars and GPS jammers. However, tactics constantly evolve and opponents can modify antennas to harden against jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR describes the need for “the Integrated Force to fuse the disparate CyberEM activity of a small number of expert organisations” and that the CyberEM Command would be the “single point of authority”. The SDR says that “where cyber effects must be aligned as part of military operations, this integration will remain the responsibility of the relevant joint commander”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might alignment involve? Under Project ASGARD, which focuses on reconnaissance and strike, the Army is procuring drones from Modini. Their Dart 250 EW has a passive sensor to seek enemy radars, potentially complementing the RAF Stormshroud which has a software-defined payload that creates false radar returns. This could enable Joint Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defences (JSEAD/DEAD) to create overlapping effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this increasingly complex battlefield, a liaison role for CyberEM Command will allow centralised “decision making for authorities to reduce duplication and reduce inefficiency”. It will be critical to track new multidomain systems and tactics. For example, the DIGAR anti-GNSS jamming platform was originally intended for manned aircraft but was reconfigured for use in Ukraine, hardening HIMARS against Russian GNSS jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples show the need for wider “spectrum awareness” across the force, and the potential it could unlock. But before CyberEM Command can “cohere” and “align” we need enough Army specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cyberem-startup&quot;&gt;The CyberEM Startup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM is intended to aid how “defence understands, develops and accesses capability with allies and industry”. Civilian contractors will play a core role in the DTW, requiring highly motivated talent, including experts in encryption and AI from the private sector and reservists in the Specialist Group Information Services. A “Spectrum Coordination Office” will support civil-military cooperation to this end, but realising this goal may come down to attracting talent in-house, as much as partnering with industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, AI will be incorporated into our systems. The Command’s Cyber Direct Entry programme offers applicants £40,000 starting salary with £25,000 “in additional skills pay”. This is a good start - according to Glassdoor, the average salary for a cyber security specialist in London is £51,000, however according to the LSE, the median advertised salary for AI engineers in the capital is £87,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for specialists sits uneasily with the tight timeline for the DTW: Trinity is due to replace the Falcon internet system next year. The Boxer, potentially fitted with Trinity, may not be ready in meaningful numbers. We may also be moving to the ability to reprogram equipment for almost any enemy EMS tactic in near real time, through US experimental projects such as the Rapid Effects Generation Enterprise and Arsenal. This is implemented at the battlefield tactical edge, not remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years after the first publicly reported cyber-EMS attack, Israel’s strike on an incomplete nuclear reactor in Syria (thought to be a joint operation between the Israeli Air Force and Unit 8200) the UK is finally close to a CEMA strategy fit for modern war. It comes, by some accounts, after decades where the Army has fallen behind on EW capabilities. We cannot afford similar delays on the rapidly changing modern battlefield. For CyberEM Command to truly fulfil its role, it needs to be properly resourced, for training capacity, staff retention and career development opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once confined to science fiction, solar geoengineering is now moving into real-world experimentation, raising the risk of misuse by hostile actors. Also known as solar radiation management, this set of novel technologies – such as stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening – aims to artificially slow the rise in global temperatures by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth’s surface. To date, their primary purpose has been to tackle the symptoms of accelerating climate change. However, these technologies also pose dual-use risks: alongside unintended environmental consequences, they could be exploited by powers seeking to tilt the geopolitical balance to cause climate-related disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK government prioritises investment in solar geoengineering research and development, it has a crucial window to help shape international norms. Without adequate safeguards, these technologies could become tools of geopolitical coercion in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-campaign-of-hybrid-warfare-in-europe-is-expanding&quot;&gt;Russia’s Campaign of Hybrid Warfare in Europe is Expanding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s new national security strategy, released on 24 June, highlights a rise in hostile activity on British soil from countries like Russia and Iran. This includes acts of sabotage, cyber attacks and other forms of democratic interference, which often exploit legal loopholes and are difficult for the authorities to attribute. The strategy warns that such hybrid threats not only endanger the British people but also threaten the UK’s critical national infrastructure and prosperity. This trend, the authors suggest, will continue over the coming years as states pursue their interests more assertively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing consensus among European governments and their intelligence communities indicates that Russia, in particular, is escalating its clandestine activities across the region, necessitating increased governmental preparedness and response. In November 2024, MI6 Chief Sir Richard Moore publicly revealed that the UK’s intelligence services had uncovered a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of Russian sabotage in Europe. Similarly, Norway’s national security strategy, released in May, identified Russian sabotage as a major concern, emphasising the need to anticipate more aggressive and widespread hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report on Russian targeting patterns and tactics, published in February (which this author contributed to), shows that Russia’s campaign of hybrid activities in Europe has expanded significantly since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began over three years ago. It documents over 200 incidents of suspected Russian hybrid warfare in Europe between 2014 and 2024, including acts of sabotage, disinformation and electromagnetic attacks like GPS jamming. Most incidents (86%) have taken place since early 2022, with events recorded in 2024 rising sixfold compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s choice of targets has also evolved. In addition to arson attacks on ammunition depots, Moscow has increasingly targeted the energy and aviation sectors, severing undersea power cables and planting incendiary devices on air freight. The number of European countries targeted by Russian hybrid warfare has also surged. This same report shows that an average of 20 countries were targeted annually in 2022-24, up from just three per year in the prior three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland and the UK have remained the primary targets so far this year, probably due to their continued support for Kyiv. In the first half of 2025, suspected Russian operations have included conducting undersea infrastructure surveillance off the British coast, distributing fake military draft letters to Ukrainians living in Poland, and damaging a water supply system on Sweden’s Gotland Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these actions appear designed to test European defences and probe for weaknesses. But others seem more random, suggesting that Moscow’s goal is not only to prepare for a possible future involving a direct military confrontation with NATO, but to create a sense of confusion and chaos. By wreaking havoc across Europe, the Kremlin likely aims to force European states to focus their attention inwards, divert European resources from Ukraine and show that sanctions enforcement carries political and economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, European states are stepping up efforts to deter hybrid threats. This has included criminal proceedings, diplomatic expulsions and strengthening cyber defences. NATO’s Baltic Sentry mission, launched earlier this year, also aims to increase surveillance of critical undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and shows promise in preventing future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as measures to counter Russian sabotage mature, the Kremlin may further diversify its tactics. Although unlikely in the short term, an expanded hybrid warfare campaign could involve even more elaborate approaches. At the more imaginative end of the spectrum, this may include causing an environmental disaster, like an oil spill in a busy maritime shipping lane. Alternatively, Moscow could seek to induce climate extremes, such as drought or flooding, by deploying solar geoengineering technologies against an adversary, disrupting agricultural production and the operation of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-geoengineering-research-sees-renewed-support&quot;&gt;Solar Geoengineering Research Sees Renewed Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International intrigue in climate cooling technologies is growing. The UK government’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency, for example, announced in May plans to invest £57 million across 21 geoengineering projects. This includes funds for stratospheric aerosol injection research and efforts to refreeze Arctic Sea ice, which is now shrinking at a rate of 12.2% per decade due to global warming, compared to its average extent during the period from 1981 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These investments make the UK one of the largest funders of geoengineering research globally. But it is not the only state interested in assessing the feasibility of these emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several others, including Australia, China, India, Russia, the US, and several EU members, are also exploring geoengineering techniques. This is according to the US intelligence community’s national intelligence estimate on the geopolitical implications of climate change through 2040. This report, published in 2021 during the Biden administration, warned that large-scale unilateral solar geoengineering deployment by a major power to counter the intensifying effects of climate change, should other warming-limitation efforts be deemed insufficient, would carry major risks for geopolitical stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian scientists have long been strong proponents of solar geoengineering for managing climate change impacts. According to one recent academic study, this interest stretches back to the mid-Soviet period. Notably, Moscow had remained an important voice in this scientific debate until its isolation from the international science scene following its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-concerns-around-solar-geoengineering-abound&quot;&gt;Security Concerns Around Solar Geoengineering Abound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists have long held diverging views on whether more research funding should be channelled into solar geoengineering. This is partly because research and deployment of these technologies are not currently covered by existing international law, despite their potential for harmful cross-border impacts. While some states have agreed to a de facto moratorium on large-scale solar geoengineering use under the Convention on Biological Diversity, a UN treaty focused on protecting biodiversity, this agreement is not legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With relatively few field experiments having been carried out, solar geoengineering technologies remain largely unproven. Meanwhile, the interconnected nature of the global climate system makes unintended consequences resulting from their use highly likely. The UN and various research institutes have in recent years highlighted the risk of potential side-effects, including unpredictable and extreme changes in rainfall patterns, which could undermine food and water security within affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern is how any cascading effects would manifest. As previous analysis on this issue has suggested, increased rainfall that is beneficial to one country might cause major downstream flooding in a neighbouring state. While any sudden termination of these technologies would risk triggering severe shocks, including abrupt warming and ecosystem disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-geoengineering-as-an-instrument-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Solar Geoengineering as an Instrument of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns around solar geoengineering deployment – such as those identified by the US intelligence community – have typically centred on these technologies being used as extreme responses to mounting climate pressures. Yet more recently, some experts have raised the alarm about how they might be leveraged by hostile actors to further their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There currently appears to be no publicly available evidence suggesting the Kremlin is planning on weaponising solar geoengineering technologies, or that it has even considered this. However, their relative ease of deployment, legal ambiguities surrounding their use, and the potential for plausible deniability could make them an attractive tool in an era of intensifying hybrid warfare where there are fewer guardrails to restrain state behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the controversial nature of these technologies means they could be used to cause widespread disruption, even without enabling negative climate impacts, due to high levels of anxiety surrounding their development. Given this possibility, Russia’s scientific credentials in this field and Russian military intelligence’s history of allegedly using novel methods to inflict harm on adversaries, it seems plausible that Moscow may experiment with weaponising solar geoengineering in the coming decade, even though this scenario may have seemed outlandish just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-challenges-and-recommendations-for-policymakers&quot;&gt;Key Challenges and Recommendations for Policymakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most acts of sabotage or cyberattacks, it would probably be difficult for most European intelligence agencies to detect, attribute or prevent the use of solar geoengineering as a weapon given current capabilities and priorities. Any early warning would therefore be limited, raising the risk of strategic surprise. This challenge is likely to be compounded by uncertainty over where responsibility for solar geoengineering governance should lie. There is currently no international consensus on which forum, if any, is best positioned to lead on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, several states and multinational organisations appear to be scaling back efforts to examine issues like this that sit at the intersection of climate change and national security. This de-prioritisation risks eroding institutional awareness of the security implications of solar geoengineering technologies among defence, security and intelligence communities despite their potential to be used coercively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK increases investment in solar geoengineering research, a narrow but critical window exists to shape international norms and safeguards and establish red lines. The UK, given its growing role in this area, has an opportunity to lead efforts to embed prohibitions against the offensive or coercive use of solar geoengineering into international agreements and research protocols. It can also champion the creation of a dedicated intergovernmental task force – under the UN, NATO, or an alternative body – to monitor militarisation risks, enhance transparency and establish response mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, risks linked to solar geoengineering should be integrated into national and allied security strategies and planning frameworks. This would help to build understanding and cultivate resilience against any potential future hybrid threats involving climate manipulation. The UK intelligence community, meanwhile, should treat these technologies as it would other emerging hybrid threats – investing in detection and attribution capabilities, and coordinating across government agencies to spot and track early signs of misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。除了施德來及柯耀林，其餘12名經審訊後被裁定罪成的被告，連同認罪的黃子悅，合共13人提出上訴。另外律政司尋求法庭推翻就劉偉聰的無罪裁決。案件今（14日）在西九龍法院（暫代高等法院）聆訊，預計需時10天。甫開庭，彭卓棋的法律代表確認彭撤回上訴，彭及其律師團隊獲准提早離席，其後彭從被告欄中站起身及步回懲教囚室。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭上午先處理律政司針對劉偉聰的案件呈述上訴。律政司一方指稱，從初選開始到結束，劉的整體行為均與涉案的犯罪協議一致，包括提交初選提名表格、參選初選、落選後遵從協議而不出選立法會選舉。律政司要求上訴庭裁定劉偉聰參與在涉案計劃及串謀之中，推翻無罪裁決，並發還案件予原審法庭繼續處理。任職大律師的劉偉聰自行在庭上陳詞，重申他從沒主張「五大訴求，缺一不可」，亦從沒主張「無差別」否決特區政府提出的財政預算案。高院首席法官潘兆初表示押後判決，並批准劉繼續保釋外出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的12名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋撤回上訴並提早離席&quot;&gt;彭卓棋撤回上訴並提早離席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接近開庭時間，13名上訴人陸續被懲教人員帶入被告欄，各人分別向家屬和友人揮手。何桂藍和余慧明均蓄短髮，其中何桂藍穿上白色T恤及桃紅色恤衫。鄭達鴻、陳志全和林卓廷均穿著西裝褸，梁國雄則穿著哲古華拉T恤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，首席法官潘兆初表示收到彭卓棋律師代表的通知，彭會撤回上訴，並指這代表彭的上訴會被撤銷。代表彭的大律師向法庭確認，並表示今早已索取彭的指示，她為律師團隊遲來的通知而向法庭致歉。彭卓棋及其律師團隊申請離席獲批，其後彭卓棋從被告欄中站起身及步回懲教囚室。彭卓棋的胞弟彭家浩亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰原審脫罪-律政司上訴要求發還&quot;&gt;劉偉聰原審脫罪 律政司上訴要求發還&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭上午先處理律政司針對劉偉聰的案件呈述上訴。代表律政司的副刑事檢控專員周天行陳詞指，原審法庭未能按證據而裁定劉是參與犯罪協議的一份子。周指，劉出席了九龍西的第一次初選協調會議，顯示涉案串謀最早於2020年3月便存在。劉其後於3至4月收妥有關協調機制的文件，亦於6月提交了初選報名表格。劉同月參與初選論壇，即使《國安法》在同年7月1日實施，劉依然繼續參與7月11至12日的初選。周指，劉在初選落敗之後，他遵守涉案的協議，立即停止所有選舉工程，甚至在7月14日在社交媒體平台發布帖文，表示尊重初選結果及協調會議的安排，不會出選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周指稱，從初選開始到結束，劉上述的整體行為均與涉案的犯罪協議一致，又指劉不僅對涉案計劃的目標知情，更參與其中，包括提交初選提名表格、參選初選、落選後遵從協議而不出選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司要求上訴庭裁定劉偉聰參與在涉案計劃及串謀之中，推翻無罪裁決，並根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DD條，發還案件予原審法庭「恢復進行該審訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰自行陳詞從沒主張無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;劉偉聰自行陳詞：從沒主張「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本身任職大律師的劉偉聰並沒有聘請法律代表，他自行在庭上陳詞，表示會採納早前提交的書面陳詞，不必勞煩上訴庭聽他重覆觀點。不過他仍希望簡短地作出總結，他重申他從沒主張「五大訴求，缺一不可」，他從沒主張迫使行政長官辭職，他亦從沒主張「無差別」否決特區政府提出的財政預算案。劉最後強調，原審法庭的事實裁斷，不應被隨意干預。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;高院首席法官潘兆初表示保留判決，將會連同被告的上訴一同宣判。潘官並批准劉以原有條件繼續保釋外出，又批准劉先行離席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;上訴方立會透過控制銀包監察政府-司法機關不應干預立會行使權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：立會透過「控制銀包」監察政府 司法機關不應干預立會行使權力&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MvUKIb5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。除了施德來及柯耀林，其餘12名經審訊後被裁定罪成的被告，連同認罪的黃子悅，合共13人提出上訴。案件今（14日）在西九龍法院（暫代高等法院）聆訊，彭卓棋確認撤回上訴並離席。餘下12人繼續上訴。上訴一方先就法律爭議陳詞，他們指稱《基本法》下，行政、立法和司法之間的監察和權力制衡是非常重要，當中提及特首辭職的機制，對於監察特首權力是重要的；數百年以來立法機關透過控制政府的「錢包」，來達至監察和制衡行政機關權力，因此迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序。上訴方又指，立法會議員有權自由地投票，他們為了爭取政治訴求而投票並不能構成濫權；再者，「五大訴求」當中亦包括《基本法》所承諾的普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的12名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。其中彭卓棋在早上開庭後確認撤回上訴，並且先行離席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方基本法規定重選立法會後仍否決財案-特首需辭職-因行政與立法互相監察制衡&quot;&gt;上訴方：《基本法》規定重選立法會後仍否決財案 特首需辭職 因行政與立法互相監察制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴人一方先就法律議題陳詞，他們提出四項法律爭議，包括被告的行為是否構成不法行為、被告有否顛覆國家政權的意圖、被告的真誠信念，以及「非法手段」只限於犯罪行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，《基本法》第73條定下立法會的職權，第104條則規定立法會議員就職時必須依法宣誓擁護《基本法》及效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區。沈指，一名議員投票否決政府議案是否構成濫權或違背職權，是關於《基本法》第73及104條的詮釋問題，與《國安法》的詮釋無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，《基本法》規定，若財案遭否決的話，行政長官便要解散立法會及舉行重選；若然新的立法會再度否決財案，行政長官就必須辭職，這種「法定後果（prescribed consequences）」與《國安法》第22條「顛覆國家政權」罪中所指的「干擾、阻礙或破壞其依法履行職能」後果（subversive consequences）並不相同。沈指，這種觸發特首辭職的機制，在回歸之前寫進《基本法》，原意是預料到在一個民主的政制下，行政與立法機關之間有互相監察和制衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方立法會透過控制銀包來監察政府&quot;&gt;上訴方：立法會透過「控制銀包」來監察政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，《基本法》下的特首辭職機制乃基於法治制度而設立，意味當立法會想爭取某些訴求時，他們可以基於與議案無關的考慮而投票否決，而不會構成「顛覆國家政權」。沈又指，控方在原審時未有提供任何外國例子，顯示在其他國家否決財政預算案會構成顛覆政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，《基本法》下所有條文均是平等，沒有任何階級之分，意味行政、立法和司法的權力均是對等，沒有任何一方的權力在另一方之上。沈指，控方指稱議員應該基於財案的優劣，投票通過財案，又指稱「五大訴求」與財案無關，沈則反駁控方說法並不符《基本法》的精神。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，在《基本法》下，行政、立法和司法之間的監察和權力制衡是非常重要。沈指，上述提及特首辭職的機制對於監察特首權力是重要的，因特首和行政機關須向立法會負責；而且財案與其他重要議案區分開來，乃基於一種維持了數百年的遠古概念，即透過控制政府的「錢包」，來達至監察和制衡行政機關權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方應交由公眾決定否決財案與否-司法機關不應干預立法會行使權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：應交由公眾決定否決財案與否 司法機關不應干預立法會行使權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，「收緊錢包」乃最後的手段，雖然可能導致非常嚴重的後果，但是其中一個可能性是特首願意商討及修改財案，否則特首要解散立法會，引發立法會重選；其後，新就任的立法會需再次就財案表決，如果再次否決的話，特首便要辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈認為，有關議題應留待公眾決定，司法機關不應干預立法會行使其權力，「政治問題應留待政治解決」，因此政治問題應留待立法會內處理。沈又指，有關議題應留待公眾決定，而非由法庭去決定。他舉例指，若然數以百萬計市民上街要求特首下台，那麼立法會議員會對財案投反下對票，反問：「這不是一個政治議題嗎？不是應該交由公眾決定嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方迫使特首辭職的機制在基本法下屬正當程序&quot;&gt;上訴方：迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，議員在議會上的言行應免受刑事檢控，為了讓他們能夠無懼地在議會上發言。若果議員因為說了一些與議案無關的東西，而遭受檢控的話，這無異於他們因為否決議案而被檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈提到「墨落無悔」聲明，簽署人公開地表明一旦當選，投票時會將「五大訴求」納入考慮，因他們希望公眾知情以及投票給他們。然而根據《基本法》第73條，議員有權自由地投票，而無責任解釋投票背後的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方指稱被告嘗試迫使特首按照《基本法》而辭職，構成了顛覆國家政權；沈則回應指被告實際上是迫使政府按照《基本法》行事，而且迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序，政府的職能並未有嚴重地遭受干預。沈批評控方由始至終都錯誤地解讀《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈總結指，立法會議員有權自由地投票，他們為了政治訴求而投票並不能構成濫權。再者，「五大訴求」當中亦包括《基本法》所承諾的普選，因此議員基於爭取「五大訴求」而投票，並不構成濫用權力。沈又指，通過財政預算案只是立法會眾多職能之一，理應整體地解讀《基本法》。沈又指，法庭不應該干預立法會行使權力的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方引致基本法下的法定後果並不足以構成顛覆意圖&quot;&gt;上訴方：引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」並不足以構成顛覆意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二項法律議題，即被告有否顛覆國家政權的意圖，沈士文指其當事人黃碧雲在初選論壇期間，被另一名較激進的參選人問到會否決財案，當時黃回答她會根據《基本法》而行使權力，從中可見黃並沒有顛覆國家政權的特定意圖，也無意不論如何都會破壞香港政府。沈指，議員有意引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」並不足以構成顛覆的意圖，因此原審法庭在裁決中指稱黃碧雲有意圖顛覆政權，是犯了錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/knV5xKO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後補充，若果說引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」時，一旦滲雜了不合法手段，那麼整個意圖便變成了顛覆國家的意圖，便是錯誤的。沈總結指，就本案而言，觸發《基本法》下的「法定後果」，並不會自動構成顛覆國家政權的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方顛覆國家政權控罪僅針對武力或血腥推翻政權&quot;&gt;上訴方：「顛覆國家政權」控罪僅針對武力或血腥推翻政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師關文渭接著就「非法手段」是否僅限於犯罪行為陳詞。他指，《國安法》第22條涉及「顛覆國家政權」罪行條文中，含有「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」字眼；然而，第20條涉及「分裂國家」罪行的條文，卻只有「不論是否使用武力或者以武力相威脅」字眼，而不包含「其他非法手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關力陳，兩種罪行的條文寫法有如此分別，是因為國家領土完整是不可退讓的，因此「分裂國家」罪行的條文中，只包含「不論是否使用武力或者以武力相威脅」字眼，意味不論以武力或和平手段均是法律所不容。至於「顛覆國家政權」，則由於國家政權更替的情況於歷史上經常發生，有時涉及血腥武力，有時卻是和平進行，而《國安法》所防範的只是血腥地推翻國家政權，所以和平合法的手段並不會構成「顛覆國家政權」。關堅稱「其他非法手段」只限於犯罪行為，而不包括合法的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首席法官潘兆初指，《基本法》第12條乃有關於香港特區的制度，指明香港特區是一個享有高度自治權的地方行政區域，直轄於中央人民政府；若然真的如關文渭所說，「顛覆國家政權」控罪只針對武力手段的話，而不針對挑戰的《基本法》第12條行為，是否「顛覆國家政權」的立法原意？關文渭則回應，《基本法》第12條強調香港特區直轄於中央人民政府，若然有任何行為觸犯此條文，那便會落入「分裂國家」的控罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方其他非法手段意指犯罪行為-符合一般市民理解&quot;&gt;上訴方：「其他非法手段」意指「犯罪行為」 符合一般市民理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表余慧明的資深大律師彭耀鴻透露，余慧明申請法援被拒，早前已上訴，可是當她得悉其他被告都有相同結果的時候，便決定撤回法援上訴。換言之，現時他繼續代表余而不收費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UVAs7ee.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
▲ 資深大律師 彭耀鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;原審裁決理由書指，若然有關「顛覆國家政權」罪行的條文中，「或者其他非法手段」僅限於違法的行為，那麼人大草擬《國安法》時大可以直接使用「犯罪手段」字眼。裁決又指，辯方的解讀不但使「顛覆國家政權」罪行的條文過份地複雜，又或者導致控方需要證明「罪行中的罪行」，而且會嚴重地削弱有關條文的效用，不能達至防範和遏制危害國安罪行的立法目的。原審法庭遂裁定「其他非法手段」不限於「犯罪行為」，而是「武力或威脅使用武力」以外的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻則強調，他們對於條文的解讀並不會導致條文累贅，又稱需要對比不同的法律條文，例如「非法管有」、「非法提供國家情報秘密」等，某字眼的意思乃視乎上文下理，當上文下理有異的時候，字眼意思便會不同，這能夠解釋「其他非法手段」的意思是「犯罪行為」，一般市民亦會以這樣的方式解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭強調，《國安法》不只是寫給律師的法律，而是寫給香港市民，意味普羅大眾理應明白有關條文，如果一般市民不能夠理解，又或者條文的意思超出市民所能理解，市民又怎樣可以約束自己的行為？按照日常生活的理解，條文中「非法手段」字眼必然意指「犯罪行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方真誠地相信憲法下有權否決財案-可構成辯護理由&quot;&gt;上訴方：真誠地相信憲法下有權否決財案 可構成辯護理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明和陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，若財案被立法會否決，造成政府職能被中止或干預，只是因為特首按照《基本法》第50至52條，履行憲法下權力所造成的「自然結果（natural consequence）」，並不構成立法會議員顛覆國家政權，被告也就沒有顛覆國家政權的意圖。不論有關的後果多麼嚴重，相關條文對於行政與立法之間監察制衡是有需要，以及有助解決立法會的死局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，當被告真誠地相信他們在憲法下完全有權否決財案，並且相信不會觸犯法律，便可構成辯護理由；即使有關信念是錯誤的信念，法庭也不能裁定他們有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，控方指稱不論政府議案優劣，被告都會「無差別地」投票否決，然而控方沒有足夠證據顯示被告不會審視財案，尤其是陳志全有多年擔任議員的經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍當政府未考慮民意時才會否決財案-強調非濫用職權&quot;&gt;何桂藍：當政府未考慮民意時才會否決財案 強調非濫用職權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 補充指，被告一方從沒使用「無差別」字眼，這只是控方會使用的字眼。他解釋，被告有民意授權去否決財案，是因為他們曾告訴公眾他們當選後會做什麼，這使他們當選立法會議員後能夠與政府談判，一旦政府未有考慮他們背後的民意，他們才會否決財案，Beel 強調這是行使議員職能，而非濫用權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，原審法庭指被告意圖濫用職權、違反《基本法》第37條，只是一個「方便的裁斷」，然而這個「方便的裁斷」並沒有證據支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On this matter, the work of the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, has been of significant importance (hereinafter, UN WG on Mercenaries) Additionally, the UN Human Rights Council has consistently emphasized the need to strengthen oversight mechanisms to address these evolving challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contribution elaborates on three specific trends that appear insufficiently prioritized in current regulatory discussions, highlights existing regulatory gaps and challenges, and calls for urgent regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maritime-security&quot;&gt;Maritime Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the emerging trends in private military and security operations posing significant challenges to existing regulatory frameworks governing Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) concerns maritime security. The UN increasingly identifies maritime security as integral to international peace and legal order, as evolving threats expose growing regulatory gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs have played a central role in responding to piracy and terrorism targeting commercial shipping and maritime trade routes, shifting their operations from traditional land-based activities towards increasingly complex roles in international waters. Protection provided by PMSCs not only reduces the risk of piracy attacks on contracted vessels but also lowers the likelihood of attacks on nearby vessels by approximately 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, with significant downsizing of the industry, a consequence of reduced high-risk areas, regulatory problems observed are related to regulation of the floating armories (FAs). While the UN Working Group on Mercenaries addressed a number of regulatory challenges related to use and operations of maritime PMSCs (2022), operations of the floating armories continue to raise concerns. Recent incidents of sinking vessels used as FAs close to conflict areas, without international oversight of transfer/management of stockpiles on them, raise further concerns about their regulation. While the International Maritime Organization does not have specific regulatory framework guiding operations of FAs, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) addresses criminal jurisdiction on board of a foreign ship, which is quite limited in relation to territorial waters, and shifts responsibility mainly to regulate activities and operations of FAs to Flag states. As Flag States do not have (in general mode) particular oversight mechanisms of FAs, nor do they perform their audits, there is a clear gap in oversight of the global operations of FAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, considering oversight of weapons and operations of maritime Private Security Companies (PSCs), there are concerns that even though some Flag States have quite a comprehensive regulatory framework regarding registration and certification of maritime PSCs, they often lack oversight capabilities, and depend on documented reports only. For instance, inspections of vessels using PSCs staff, to verify if arms are properly stored, if they are operational, or living/working conditions of the staff operating on vessels, are not a common procedure. Additionally, concerns over PSCs employees’ rights relate to difficulty reporting potential abuse, lack of payment or poor working conditions incompatible with Flag State national laws. This is a consequence of widespread hiring by maritime PSCs across the globe, including in less developed countries, unaware of their rights under Flag States national law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these constraints are becoming more important in a context where PMSCs are increasingly recognized as critical non-state actors in maritime security, and questions arise regarding their de facto substitution of state responsibilities in this domain as well as lack of international regulatory mechanisms responsible for global oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-procurement-and-transfers&quot;&gt;Weapons Procurement and Transfers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second emerging issue concerns the role of PMSCs in arms procurement and transfer activities. The arms trade network has changed and PMSCs possess an increasing capacity to procure arms and facilitate weapons transfers to states and non-state clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many states have legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions in place regarding PMSCs involvement in the “sub-delegation” of the acquisition of arms and weapons that follows tracing, recording, and “end-certification” processes, some do not. PMSCs involvement in arms procurement risks undermining existing arms control regimes and oversight mechanisms, the majority of which are State-focused, as well as falling outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruments such as the Firearms Protocol, Arms Trade Treaty, and the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons do not recognize the possibility of PMSCs engaging in weapons transfers. Similarly, the Montreux Document “best practices” and the ICoCA “Code of Conduct” – neither of which legally binding instruments – place the responsibility of arms acquisition and transfer on contracting, home and territorial states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflict and/or weak governance settings, PMSCs have engaged in acquisitions and transfers on behalf of States that do not follow established procedures of registration and end-user certification. This entails the use of brokers, intermediaries, and the fabrication of documentation. PMSCs have also acquired weapons via state “re-routing” (i.e. the diversion of a legal state-state transfer, that is re-routed onto the PMSC for use, sale, transfer). This complicates the traceability, end-user verification process, and control over arms transfers. These practices have been flagged as creating heightened risks of diversion to sanctioned armed groups, in violation of UN Security Council arms embargoes.Of particular concern is the growing nexus between PMSCs and “grey and black markets, networks and financing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies, such as uncrewed aerial systems and 3D printed weapons “ghost guns”, represent a new frontier not only in weapons development and manufacturing, but also in the expanding operational capabilities and commercial activities of PMSCs. PMSCs have been connected to the supply and sale of such additive components as a means of self-funding, raising concerns about PMCSs connections to illicit networks, their ability to raise illicit funds, and the circulation of unmarked, unverified weapon components and technologies. Moreover, the increasing availability of dual-use technologies — applicable for both civilian and military purposes — further complicates oversight, blurring the line between legitimate trade and unauthorized proliferation, and challenging existing export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs are also increasingly engaged in utilizing digital tools and cyber-technologies for surveillance, intelligence gathering, operational planning and targeting in conflict and non-conflict situations. This growing reliance on cyber-enabled services is likely to persist and expand, yet currently unfolds within a largely unregulated international legal framework. In some cases, PMSCs have even been implicated in the development and operation of offensive cyber capabilities, raising significant concerns under international law governing cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predatory-recruitment-practices&quot;&gt;Predatory Recruitment Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend concerns the growing prevalence of exploitative or predatory recruitment practices. The involvement of PMSCs in conflict, post-conflict, and proxy war contexts has intensified recruitment efforts, facilitated by globalized labor markets. While recruitment often adheres to national and international standards, there is increasing evidence that PMSCs exploit vulnerabilities among prospective recruits, leading to abusive and coercive labor practices, in violation of applicable human rights obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has become a key labor pool for PMSCs, exacerbating existing inequalities based on citizenship, socioeconomic status, gender, social class, and race. These disparities render PMSC personnel particularly vulnerable to exploitation and labor rights violations. This practice became even more evident in the aftermath of COVID-19, as migration of individuals seeking better employment opportunities in other countries increased; and also among prisoners, in many cases serving sentences in states different from their own nationalities, where they are offered amnesty or pardon deals in exchange for enlisting in PMSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment is often conducted through internal databases, digital platforms, and targeted branding campaigns using provocative messaging and promises of lucrative compensation to attract highly specialized freelance personnel. However, emerging reports document instances where promised benefits are not delivered, where fraud and coercion occur, and where these practices amount to violations of international human rights norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid diversification of PMSC activities underscores the urgent need for the international community to confront not only the traditional challenges associated with the outsourcing of military and security functions, but also the increasingly complex regulatory gaps emerging in new operational domains. These developments reveal a clear trend: PMSCs are no longer confined to conventional combat support or logistical roles but are extending into areas that directly affect the rights and safety of civilians, the integrity of international legal regimes, and the sovereign functions of States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory vacuum that persists across multiple domains –including maritime security, arms transfers, and labor practices–, poses serious threats to international human rights and international humanitarian law. This vacuum reflects not only regulatory gaps, but an erosion of the state’s monopoly on legitimate force, challenging attribution, effective control, and state responsibility. Without clear, enforceable international standards, PMSCs may continue to operate in legal grey zones, shielded from effective accountability mechanisms while exercising functions that often approach, or even replace, core State responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on PMSCs takes on renewed urgency. A robust, legally binding international instrument is indispensable to establish clear obligations for States, to regulate the transnational operations of PMSCs, particularly in emerging, hybrid, non-traditional domains, so as to ensure human rights abuses are prevented, and provide adequate access and remedy to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective regulation of PMSCs is not merely a technical legal challenge; it is a matter of upholding the foundational principles of international law, protecting human dignity, and preserving the accountability architecture upon which global peace and security depend. The current moment presents a critical opportunity for States, international organizations, and civil society to forge a comprehensive, future-proof regulatory framework that meets the evolving challenges of private military and security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Would there be survivors? Would your iPhone work? This briefing dispels common misconceptions about high-altitude nuclear explosions and summarizes the current state of research on the subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, no party has used nuclear weapons in war since 1945. Treaties limiting nuclear tests and weapon inventories during the Cold War highlighted the pragmatism of world leaders. As memories fade, and nascent nuclear states mature, the potential for their use (or misuse) rises. In a strategic environment with multiple nuclear-armed states of various sizes and incentives, it is important to understand the science underlying the use of nuclear weapons in novel and unexpected ways. As opposed to the ground bursts of World War II, their use in the sky has potential to achieve certain objectives without catastrophic loss of life. Due partly to the lack of testing and partly to a somber reluctance to consider this potentiality, many misunderstandings persist. There is a need to address prevailing myths about the use of high-altitude nuclear explosions and provide realities rooted in the existing research on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waging war against an enemy with dominant digital communications systems is a recipe for defeat. Modern digital communications structures enable lethal kill-chain targeting cycles, seamless command and control, and precision guidance that dominate the enemy. This reality makes the space and cyber domains a primary target in future warfare. All tacticians seek to degrade their adversaries’ communications in war, but few consider the literal “nuclear option” that could fundamentally upend the current communications ecosystem. High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANEs) allow an actor to degrade modern communications, either on the ground or in the sky. Closer to the ground, HANEs create a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) that could shut down power plants, cellular towers, and electronic devices. Higher in the sky, HANEs produce radiation that can damage or destroy satellites. If a state actor (or rogue element) decides that access to digital systems or the space domain is giving its adversary an unfair edge, it might decide to use a HANE to negate this advantage without directly killing a single human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against using nuclear weapons endured for decades, but recent saber-rattling and proliferation trends suggest this restraint is fragile. Would adversaries consider launching a HANE attack that destroys and degrades electronics without direct loss of human life? Would such an attack be perceived as a breach of the international taboo on nuclear weapons use? This paper examines existing research on HANE effects to dispel misconceptions and clarify the potential consequences of such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hane-effects-101&quot;&gt;HANE Effects 101&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HANE is a nuclear detonation above 30 kilometers (19 miles), where the density of air is low enough that energy from the nuclear weapon interacts with its surroundings in a markedly different manner than a “mushroom cloud” of a detonation nearer to the ground. These detonations create damage to electronics within the Earth’s atmosphere through their production of HEMPs. E1, the most damaging HEMP mechanism created by HANEs, results because the air density is extremely low around the explosion, unlike at lower altitudes. Therefore, electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances in a downward direction before interacting with air molecules (Figure 1). Many of these interactions result in ionization, or the freeing of electrons, which cause a burst of electromagnetic energy as they are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field. This burst of energy, or EMP, occurs over a large area, where it causes damage and disruption to electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/268Z0IJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Creation of the E1 Field of a HEMP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs can damage or destroy satellites through two primary mechanisms. First, high levels of prompt radiation from gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons can travel relatively unimpeded directly to satellites due to the low density of the atmosphere (Figure 2). This is limited to satellites within line of sight (LOS) of the HANE, with the Earth shielding many others. The amount of prompt radiation, or dose, that a satellite receives increases with increasing yield and decreases proportional to the square of the distance from the explosion. Second, free electrons resulting from an explosion can become trapped in artificial radiation belts due to the Earth’s magnetic field, creating a hostile environment for satellites passing through. These electrons can be trapped for years and may drastically decrease the lifespans of satellites orbiting through them, even if they were initially outside of the HANE’s LOS. Additionally, this radiation belt presents challenges in reconstituting space with new satellites due to the lasting effects. For example, a new satellite designed to last two years may only last a couple of months due to the new trapped radiation. Shielding and radiation hardening can significantly increase the amount of radiation dose required for damage from both of these mechanisms; however, it is not practical to completely shield from the prompt effects of a HANE of sufficient yield and proximity. Additionally, shielding to the level required to protect against HANE effects is generally only seen in military satellites because it is currently cost-prohibitive for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AtIxi0J.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-ground-or-both&quot;&gt;Space, Ground, or Both&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altitude is the key factor determining whether the most significant effects of a HANE are experienced on the ground or on satellites. An explosion at a height of 30 kilometers (19 miles) would create an appreciable, though not maximal, EMP and have minimal effects on satellites. Satellites in this scenario are largely unscathed due to the attenuation of prompt radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere and further distance from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Peak HEMP E1 occurs close to 75 kilometers (47 miles) above the surface and starts to drop off considerably after 100 kilometers (62 miles), as shown in Figure 3. While the strength of the HEMP decreases considerably above this height, the ground area affected increases (Figure 4). Higher altitude HANEs, such as the previous U.S. test Starfish Prime at 300 kilometers (186 miles), affect a larger area but have a much weaker associated HEMP. These higher explosions will also have significantly greater impacts on satellites due to a lack of attenuation in the atmosphere, their closer proximity to many satellites in orbit, and the increasing field of view of satellites at risk with increasing altitude (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-1-no-one-would-use-a-nuclear-weapon-even-at-high-altitude&quot;&gt;Myth #1: No One Would Use a Nuclear Weapon (Even at High Altitude)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraint against nuclear explosions held true for over 70 years and made sense when the costs of international repercussions outweighed the benefits from use. For decades, the structuralism of the global order constrained adversaries. Post–World War II geopolitics rarely degenerated into great power combat because it was not in any nation’s interest to do so. Structures such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization provided forums where countries could achieve political objectives without resorting to violence. In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which prohibits nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater. After the Cold War, globalism guaranteed collective gains for states willing to abide by international norms. Thomas Friedman described a “Golden Straitjacket” that offers nations wealth and progress if they abide by the rules and norms of the international order. Multiple indicators—from the Russian invasion of sovereign European territory and threats of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to the United States stepping back from international bodies—suggest this era is nearing its end, and nations should prepare for the dynamics of a post-globalism era. It is impossible to predict when a pariah state will finally decide that its national interests are better served by destroying the tools the rest of the world depends upon. However, the reasons for their restraint appear to be decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use could be precise or haphazard. A rational state actor would wait until the optimum time to use latent capabilities to uproot the world order. While one state could use a bevy of tools, such as cyberattacks and anti-satellite weapons, to temporarily disrupt satellite and internet access without permanent destruction, another state actor may consider the large, destructive effects a single HANE offers. And while the leaders of each of these nations have thus far restrained themselves, there is the possibility that a coup or uprising could result in more unpredictable leadership that would use available tools in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, the space domain remains accessible to all sides, allowing advanced communications, weapons guidance, drone operations, and data integration. This semi-permissive access is not guaranteed in future warfare. Russia and its precursor, the Soviet Union, have a history of surprising scientific breakthroughs that upend geopolitics. In 1957, the Soviet Union shocked the world with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite. In 2021, Russia destroyed one of its own satellites with an antisatellite missile, foreshadowing a future threat to the United States’ vast orbital communication infrastructure. In 2024, after withdrawing from multiple arms control agreements, Russia launched a satellite in orbit that could employ a nuclear weapon. U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Vipin Narang stated that the prospect of this space weapon poses “a threat to satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services upon which we all depend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also actively studying the effects of space-based nuclear weapons. The Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT), a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) research and development institute, published a paper detailing the effects of a space-based nuclear weapon on LEO satellites like the Starlink network. Another NINT paper noted, “A combination of soft and hard kill methods should be adopted to make some Starlink satellites lose their functions and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” From the figures in that paper, one can identify optimal altitudes for various military effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-2-hemps-will-disable-everything-electronic&quot;&gt;Myth #2: HEMPs Will Disable Everything Electronic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Call of Duty franchise offers HEMPs as an option during battle. When a player uses one, it disables all the opponent’s command and control capabilities, such as their map, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets, and even their electronic weapon sights for a fixed period. While Call of Duty brings attention to the topic of HEMPs to a wider audience, it misrepresents them in many ways. First, the in-game EMP consistently shuts down everything electronic. In reality, HEMPs create stochastic effects—which have a probability pattern that can be analyzed statistically, not predicted precisely. For example, one device could be destroyed, while an identical one meters away is spared due to having a slightly different orientation. Additionally, the HEMP effects from Call of Duty are transient, lasting under a minute, but would actually be varied over time. Many electrical components would be instantaneously and permanently damaged and never come back online, while others would be only temporarily disrupted. The misrepresentation of EMP effects seen in Call of Duty is not unique. Similar themes are seen in movies such as The Matrix, GoldenEye, and Ocean’s Eleven. The general public often overestimates the effects of a HEMP since these examples are often their only exposure to this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of a HEMP on devices depend on the intensity of the EMP field, the orientation of the device with respect to that field, the inherent shielding of the device, and the sensitivity of the device’s microelectronics. The amount of energy collected depends on several factors, including its size and orientation to the pulse. Long cables, antennas, and railroad tracks would be able to collect a significant amount of energy that could damage large systems, such as large power transformers. While devices such as cellphones are small collectors, some components, such as semiconductor diodes and transistors, may be more sensitive to pulses from a HEMP. Three people standing next to each other with three different phones could have three different outcomes. One’s circuits may be relatively undamaged, with the owner noticing no internal disruption, while a second has issues that resolve after a restart, and a third person’s phone loses functionality critical to operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While two of the phones in this example are not destroyed, much of their functionality may be unavailable due to the modern, interconnected network of systems required. Gamma rays and X-rays can ionize atoms in the atmosphere, which can disrupt radiofrequency waves passing through them for anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on the frequency. Communications infrastructure, such as cell towers, may be inoperable due to damage from a HEMP, which could also disrupt the electrical power generation required to operate communications infrastructure. Finally, communications satellites at low Earth orbit—less than 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles)—may also be disrupted or destroyed depending on the altitude of the HANE creating the HEMP. This is the orbital region most affected by HANEs and is advantageous for many communications satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to pinpoint the exact damage that could come from a HEMP due to the complex mechanisms and limited test data. It is important for decisionmakers to understand that there will be significant disruption and damage to electrical devices, but that it will not be ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-3-a-hane-harms-the-user-as-much-as-the-target&quot;&gt;Myth #3: A HANE Harms the User as Much as the Target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs have the capability to harm their user through both effects on their satellites and HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. Regarding the former, a common supposition exists that it would not make sense for a state to use a HANE in space because it would damage or destroy its own satellites as well. First, this assumes that all states are as reliant on satellites as the United States. Many nuclear-armed states are not. The United States is currently dominant in the satellite sector and has made multiple decisions and investments to maintain its strategic advantages in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, states can employ HANEs in ways that limit the amount of damage to their own satellites. For example, an actor could choose to detonate a HANE that optimizes damaging enemy satellites while minimizing collateral damage to its own based on satellite locations at the planned time and location of the detonation. However, given that there are thousands of satellites deployed in LEO—and that the prompt radiation field of view (as shown in Figure 2) means a HANE could affect up to 20 percent of LEO satellites—it is impossible for most states to avoid destroying a portion of their own satellites and causing significant damage to those of their allies and commercial entities. Additionally, trapped electrons could still affect many satellites that had been shielded from the HANE by the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize space effects, a state could pursue a lower-altitude HANE, such as at around 30 kilometers (19 miles), to primarily target HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. If employed over the battlefield, HEMP attacks would likely disrupt both friendly and enemy units. In certain cases, this could benefit the user if it is less reliant on susceptible electronics. However, it may be more suitable for attacking a target nation that is physically separated from the battlefield. For example, Russia could employ a lower-altitude HANE over the United States to disrupt its geographically distant battlefield efforts in Eastern Europe. Attacks like these could significantly impact an enemy while costing little in terms of technological fratricide or direct loss of human life and could potentially have less chance of large-scale escalation than the use of a surface nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-1-hanes-offer-a-less-provocative-option-than-ground-based-nuclear-detonations&quot;&gt;Reality #1: HANEs Offer a Less Provocative Option than Ground-Based Nuclear Detonations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs do not have the same direct effects on human lives. As they are detonated at an altitude where the atmosphere is very thin or nonexistent, this means no significant air blast will arrive on the ground and harm civilians or infrastructure. Additionally, very little prompt or delayed radiation will make it to the Earth’s surface due to attenuation or absorption by the atmosphere. The airblast, thermal, and radiation effects from traditional surface or near-surface detonations could lead to the direct deaths of millions of people and could prompt an equal or greater retaliatory strike on the state that originally employed such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs offer a favorable option by avoiding these direct lethal effects on civilians. They can be targeted to primarily affect electronics on the ground, satellites, or a combination of both. Those detonated between the sweet spot of 30–50 kilometers (19–31 miles) above sea level create HEMPs that impact electronics on the ground but have less effect on satellites. This could be a desirable option for a state that wants to limit damage to its own satellites and minimize escalatory concerns associated with damaging nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) satellites. HANEs detonated above that altitude also have the potential to destroy LEO satellites, causing catastrophic global economic effects and potentially affecting NC3 systems in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-2-hanes-will-still-cause-human-suffering&quot;&gt;Reality #2: HANEs Will Still Cause Human Suffering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the detonation would not directly kill humans, the indirect effects likely would. The long-term loss of power plants, cellular towers, and access to satellites would have profound effects on the affected population. In 2008, the U.S. congressional commission released a study on HEMP effects on U.S. territory. It noted, even 17 years ago, that the “pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source of vulnerability to attack by EMP.” The report offered a somber acknowledgement of the long-term consequences of a HEMP attack on the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single EMP attack may seriously degrade or shut down a large part of the electric power grid. . . . Electrical power is necessary to support other critical infrastructures. . . . Many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Congress implemented several recommendations for U.S. power grids. These mitigate the risk but are unlikely to completely defend against loss of life. Additionally, less-developed nations remain vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality--3-the-effects-of-hanes-can-be-anticipated-and-mitigated&quot;&gt;Reality # 3: The Effects of HANEs Can Be Anticipated and Mitigated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple steps policymakers can take to mitigate the effects of HANEs in future conflicts. Satellite effects can be reduced by focusing on radiation hardening to include shielding, physical changes of circuitry, and redundancy. Radiation-hardening components designed to withstand extreme post-HANE environments are currently a niche market for critical military satellites. The emphasis on hardening could be expanded to a broader set of devices, especially as many commercial satellites are starting to be used on the battlefield. HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere can also be mitigated. Increased emphasis on HEMP testing could identify the most vulnerable systems early in the acquisition process so that these systems are designed with increased HEMP survivability from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the impact of HANEs can be mitigated through decreasing dependency on electronic systems and training. Military leaders should be wary of single capabilities that may be susceptible to an enemy HANE. Leaders should incorporate training scenarios for their soldiers that recreate degraded environments where some key capabilities are taken away, such as radios and GPS. Additionally, soldiers can be trained on how to minimize the effects of an EMP, for example, by ensuring there is redundancy in their communications pathways. They can also be trained in how to troubleshoot, identify, and (if necessary) repair damaged components of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HANEs’ exact impact and long-term destruction will vary, this paper seeks to highlight what is known and dispel popular misunderstandings about them. In the past, global agreements formed a bulwark against the use of nuclear devices, but states are now relooking at their nuclear inventories and considering using these powerful devices in unconventional ways to achieve their goals. Leaders can no longer ignore this threat and the relevant effects posed by HANEs. Military leaders need to be cognizant of their effects on warfighters and capabilities, and local leaders need to understand their effects on power plants and civilian life. While the impacts of HANEs are difficult to grasp, there are tangible ways for U.S. policymakers and military leaders to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

It should learn from the past – rather than repeating it – by avoiding the mistakes of Kissinger’s attempt to destabilise relations between Russia and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the idea of the so-called “reverse Kissinger” has become increasingly popular in the United States, which is based on the alleged possibility of the US government reaching an agreement with Russia to break its strategic cooperation with China, thereby reducing the combined threat. Supporters of this idea are inspired by the results of the US policy in the 1970s to improve relations with China, which was the product of advice given to American leaders during this period by the National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain elements of the “reverse Kissinger” strategy have been observed in US policy towards Russia in the last six months, which is recognized by both experts and individual representatives of the US administration. At the same time, this approach has not yet had any impact on Russia’s aggressive behaviour in the European theatre, but has probably only encouraged China to pursue even greater strategic rapprochement with Russia, the lack of alternative to which is increasingly being stated by the leaders of both countries. Given the dangers associated with such rapprochement, including for European and global security, it is appropriate to critically assess the idea of a “reverse Kissinger”, identify its main shortcomings and try to propose an alternative strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-sacrifice-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;The US Sacrifice of Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is worth honestly admitting that the original “Kissinger” is significantly overestimated, mythologized, and its frankly negative consequences are mostly not taken into account at all. The official version is that through a number of strategic concessions to China, the US managed to worsen Sino-Soviet relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these concessions, it is worth paying special attention to the unprecedented betrayal by the US of its official ally at that time, the Republic of China (the official name of Taiwan), which led in 1971 to the replacement of Taiwan by communist China as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the withdrawal of US troops from the territory of Taiwan, the unilateral rupture of all US-Taiwan security agreements, and the loss of diplomatic recognition of Taiwan as an independent country not only by the US, but also by the vast majority of countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we add to this the comprehensive promotion of foreign direct investment in China, including from US companies, as well as the opening of China’s access to global markets, which has transformed China into the world’s largest economy, the current Chinese threat to both global security and Taiwan is a direct consequence of Kissinger’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this strategy not only created new threats, but also did not lead to the results at which it was supposedly aimed. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC and the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan in 1979, Soviet-Chinese relations only began to improve. The two communist countries, which, due to ideological differences, had been in a state of acute confrontation since the late 1950s, which included direct military clashes between the parties over disputed territories in the area of Damansky Island in 1969, resolved most of the contentious issues during the 1980s and moved on to direct cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1982, in his speech in Tashkent, the leader of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev expressed hope for the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations, and also emphasized that, unlike other countries, the USSR had always recognized Taiwan as part of the PRC. In the same 1982, the foreign ministers of the two countries met for the first time in 20 years. During the negotiations, the Soviet leadership was presented with three main requirements of the PRC for the normalization of bilateral relations – a reduction in the number of Soviet troops on the common borders, an end to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan (where the Chinese provided large-scale military assistance to the rebels long before the first American Stinger missiles appeared there in 1986). As early as 1984, the countries signed agreements on economic and technological cooperation and created a special bilateral Committee to develop this cooperation. The volume of bilateral trade doubled in the first year after the signing of the agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of “perestroika” in the USSR did not stop the Sino-Soviet rapprochement. In 1986, the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev declared his readiness to eliminate the “three obstacles” and announced a significant reduction in Soviet troops in Mongolia, their partial withdrawal from Afghanistan and promotion of the normalization of Vietnamese-Chinese relations. In February 1989, Soviet troops completely left Afghanistan, and in May of the same year, Gorbachev met with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, after which the latter issued the directive “End the past, open the future”, which officially ended the period of geopolitical confrontation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation was resumed, and in 1992, not only the supply of weapons but also the transfer of sensitive technologies began. Already in the 1990s, China, thanks to this, switched from operating second-generation aircraft to fourth and fourth+, received modern anti-ship missiles and shipboard air defence systems. In 1996, the countries agreed on the licensed production of 200 Su-27s in China with the transfer of technology. And this was only the beginning. China began a confident move towards the status of the only state in the world capable of competing with the United States in the conventional field. It is noteworthy that China’s obvious efforts to modernize its military capabilities and assistance of the Russian Federation in this regard did not affect Western policy in any way - in the 1990s, Western investments in production facilities in China increased sharply (over 400 billion dollars in ten years), and in 2001 the country became a member of the World Trade Organization with virtually unlimited access to global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-greater-unity-between-china-and-russia&quot;&gt;…Toward a Greater Unity Between China and Russia…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Kissinger’s strategy not only did not destroy the Russian-Chinese alliance, but on the contrary, restored it from the ashes of a thirty-year geopolitical confrontation, and also created the prerequisites for the current economic and military power of the PRC, which would never have arisen under other conditions. It is obvious that the strategy of “reverse Kissinger” – an attempt to reduce the threat of China using this power against US interests by appeasing Russia – has even less chance of success. Moreover, “reverse Kissinger” is a direct path to further strengthening bilateral Russian-Chinese cooperation and increasing the threat of direct military conflict between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement by some high-ranking representatives of the new US administration of their commitment to the ideas of a “reverse Kissinger”, cooperation between Russia and China has only increased. China, which after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took a cautious and expectant role, began to respond much more actively to Russia’s constant and insistent calls for maximum rapprochement. In 2025, the intensity of bilateral meetings at the highest level reached a historical record. In addition to the obvious defence and economic cooperation (an important element of which are joint efforts to de-dollarize the global economy and naval cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region), in the spring of 2025, agreements were reached between Russia and China on the interaction of special services (the Russian FSB and the Ministry of Public Security of the PRC), state propaganda (the Russian Ministry of Culture and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the CPC), and even the placement of a joint nuclear facility on the Moon (Roscosmos and the China State Space Administration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of the current dubious successes of the “reverse Kissinger” can be considered Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow to participate in the Victory Parade in 2025, despite the fact that the Chinese side had long hesitated about expediency of the visit. During the visit, the parties signed an agreement on deepening strategic partnership, more than 20 other interstate and interdepartmental documents, and made a joint statement, in which they emphasized the further strengthening of not only military-technical, but also military cooperation, including the organization of joint sea and air patrols. President Xi also called Putin an ally in building a new world order for the first time and expressed support for the Russian Federation in the war against Ukraine, emphasizing the fairness of Russian demands on Ukraine and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the search for compromises with Russia and increased pressure on China only encourages the parties to get closer. In the end, there is nothing surprising in this. The main ideologist, initiator and driver of such a rapprochement, as well as the construction of a broader anti-Western coalition, which should include not only Iran and the DPRK, but also the countries of the Global South, is Russia. The leaders of the Russian Federation and Putin personally have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the existing world order, which is based on the global dominance of the United States, for decades, and demanded its revision in favour of dividing the world into spheres of influence between several “great powers”. Even in his famous interview with Tucker Carlson, which for some reason was so popular with certain American politicians and experts, Putin openly says that he believes that the United States, as a global empire, is in the process of its decline, and the American leadership should not try to resist this, but instead adapt to the reality in which new centres of geopolitical influence around China will inevitably appear, among which Russia will play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already noted, Putin is consistent in his ideas about changing the world order and has been expressing them for a long time, practically from the very beginning of his presidency. At the same time, Russia’s claim to the right to be one of the “great powers” that should divide the world into spheres of influence is based exclusively on military potential, and especially on leadership in the field of nuclear weapons. Russia, whose economy is comparable to the economy of Canada, no longer has any tools either to achieve or maintain its status as a great power, except for the military, and therefore there are no other means for this except war. The ideal situation for changing the world order in favour of the Russian Federation would be a global war, which Russia, like the Soviet Union between 1917 and 1939, not only seeks, but also encourages in every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the most desirable scenario for a global war for Russia would be a war between the United States and China, which would not only weaken these two countries, but also allow Russia to more confidently focus on the European theatre. Russian analysts close to the Kremlin quite frankly state that such a scenario is desirable for Russia. In addition, it is known that Russian intelligence is actively collecting information about possible triggers for such a war, among which the conflict around Taiwan is considered the most promising. It can be assumed that Russian intelligence is not limited to collecting information about such triggers, but also actively contributes to their aggravation through its own influence agents in Taipei, Washington and Beijing. In fact, it was thanks to the work of such agents in Tokyo under the leadership of Richard Sorge, and in Washington under the leadership of Ishaq Amerov, that the Soviet Union managed to provoke Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and, as a result, the Japanese-American war. In this context, the appointment of Dmitry Polyansky, who previously served as the head of the Russian mission in Taiwan for three years, as the first deputy representative of the Russian Federation to the UN in 2018, seems not in vain. In his new position at the UN, Polyansky has already distinguished himself with several public statements that provoke aggravation between the US and China, as well as the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-a-stronger-and-more-self-assured-china&quot;&gt;…Built a Stronger and More Self-Assured China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is certainly also interested in revising the existing geopolitical status quo, but unlike Russia, it has all the capabilities to achieve its goals without destroying the world order. Moreover, today China is perhaps the most competitive player precisely within the existing global rules, which it skilfully both uses and abuses. It is these rules that have allowed China to become the leading manufacturing economy in the world, on whose products all other countries depend without exception. In fact, the policy of economic isolationism pursued by President Trump is an admission of the fact that the United States is losing to China on the field that was once built for American global dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is not only not interested in a direct military confrontation with the West, but also in the military seizure of Taiwan. At the same time, China is deterred from using military force against Taiwan not so much by the risk of intervention in the conflict by the United States, which has not had any obligations to provide Taiwan with military assistance since 1979, as by the inevitable application of economic sanctions by the entire West in such a case, as well as the acceleration of the search for an alternative to China as a universal supplier. Unlike Russia, China has something to lose in the event of war and is not interested in spheres of influence, since it can most profitably realize its interests in a globally competitive world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of experts also agree with this assessment. Thus, in a study conducted by CSIS with the participation of 64 leading experts on China in 2023, only 11 percent of experts believed that China would seek unification with Taiwan at any cost in the next 15 years, while 44% defined the horizon as 2049, and 42% generally answered that China could wait as long as necessary, provided that such an opportunity remains. 80% of experts did not see in Chinese military manoeuvres an indicator of preparation for an immediate military solution to the Taiwan issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in the Russia-China tandem, Russia is the one most interested in the alliance, the most aggressive in its methods, and the most maximalist in its aspirations. Russia is purposefully seeking a global war as the only way to restore its great power status and sees its war of conquest in Ukraine as a tool for destroying the existing world order, including by demonstrating the inability of either the United States or the West as a whole to be reliable security providers even in Europe. China is certainly interested in Russia weakening the West, but it itself does not seek to participate in a blatant violation of international law. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, China took a relatively cautious position in its interaction with Russia, primarily due to its reluctance to suffer the negative economic consequences associated with secondary sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current US position that Russia will not be punished for waging an aggressive war of conquest against Ukraine makes Russia much less toxic for cooperation with China. Moreover, the actual recognition of the possibility of capturing new territories with impunity significantly increases the risk of Chinese military aggression against Taiwan and other countries in the region, to which Russia is clearly pushing China. Thus, the joint statement of the leaders of the two countries, which was published on May 8, 2025 in Moscow, in the original version prepared by the Kremlin, contained wording on joint actions to economically and militarily contain Japan. At the request of the Chinese side, these words were removed, which once again indicates that China remains committed to the non-confrontational model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, to weaken Sino-Russian cooperation, reduce global threats, and deter China from moving from a regime of, albeit tough, competition to a regime of confrontation with the West, agreements with Russia are counterproductive. Russia in this situation is an example of behaviour undesirable for the West, which should be punished, not encouraged. The best way to deter China from crossing red lines is to demonstrate what can happen in the event of such a transition. China has something to lose and may be content with preserving the existing global status quo, where leadership is a subject of competition that does not involve the use of military force. Preventing China from moving to acute confrontation is possible and requires the United States to reach an understanding with China on several principles. The most important of these are: recognition of the need to avoid a US-China military conflict; China’s agreement to refrain from the use of military force against Taiwan; joint control over the non-proliferation of sensitive technologies (including preventing their transfer to the Russian Federation, Iran and the DPRK); maintaining global financial and trade stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching an understanding on these issues would not only avoid the risks of escalation but would also allow China to engage in pressure on Russia to restore European security. The Chinese leadership’s willingness to join in such pressure would likely be even greater if, along with a draft of a strategic competition agreement that would enshrine the above principles, President Xi also received reliable intelligence on Russian operations to provoke a Sino-American military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post–7 October realignment in the Middle East has recalibrated threat perceptions and strategic opportunities for both Turkey and Israel. The recent “12-Day War” has further accelerated this shift. While both Turkey and Israel seek to maximise influence in this fluid landscape, key indicators suggest that viewing Turkey–Israel dynamics through a zero-sum lens risks fuelling strategic miscalculations and regional instability. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence – from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict – emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation – oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara’s foreign and security policy. While Turkey has publicly escalated its rhetoric against Israel, this masks the complexity of its concurrent rivalry with Iran. Managing these relationships requires a hybrid approach that blends assertive public diplomacy, strategic trade considerations, and a robust counter-intelligence posture. Ankara’s response reflects less an opportunistic gain than a strategic balancing act that weighs long-term, interrelated perceptions of threat with regional aspirations. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course – but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-bilateral-relations&quot;&gt;The Current State of Bilateral Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog’s historic state visit to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel’s military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the harshest critics of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On 2 May 2024, Turkey announced full export and import restriction against Israel, citing Israeli refusal to allow Turkey to airdrop humanitarian aid. This came after an earlier export restriction imposed in April against Israel targeting 54 product groups, such as steel and cement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering allegations that Azeri-sourced oil has continued to reach Israel via the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Turkish energy ministry has consistently denied that any oil tankers bound for Israel have left Ceyhan since the restrictions came into force last May. The Turkish Ministry of Trade also formally rejected claims that trade has continued in an official statement, describing allegations as “completely false”. For Israel, the narrative that Turkey–Israel relations persist covertly signals its imperviousness to Ankara’s declared trade embargo. Where engagement has been acknowledged by Turkish sources, it relates to technical talks held in Azerbaijan between the two sides to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria, after Israeli airstrikes there in March targeted three Syrian air bases that Turkish military officials were reportedly inspecting for possible use. This suggests that while political relations remain severely strained, channels of pragmatic interaction – particularly where third-party actors such as Azerbaijan or the United States have vested interests – endure. But the near-term rehabilitation of ties between Turkey and Israel remains highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 13 June, Ankara condemned Israel for its aggression against Iran, calling it a blatant violation of international law, but did not escalate rhetoric further – likely to retain some diplomatic flexibility and avoid a direct challenge to the US. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey’s own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region’s future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-regional-alliance-building-race&quot;&gt;The Regional Alliance-Building Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Turkey could play a role in this equation as either a spoiler or sponsor as each side lobbies regional actors in a bid to counter the fallout of their diplomatic isolation. Ankara could leverage its diplomatic influence to challenge Israel’s efforts to re-engage with Arab states – particularly in light of recent signals suggesting Israeli overtures toward Syria and Lebanon under a broader Abraham Alliance framework. Given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, however, and the firm stance of Saudi Arabia that normalisation with Israel cannot proceed without an irreversible step toward Palestinian statehood, Israel’s normalisation drive seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter escalatory rhetoric by some in Israel, Ankara is likely to underscore its strategic value to the US and European allies – as a NATO member, G20 economy, and (albeit stalled) EU candidate – by positioning itself as a regional actor capable of avoiding direct military entanglement while fostering space for diplomatic de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Turkey’s opposition to Israeli military actions should not be misconstrued as alignment with or tacit endorsement of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Turkey’s relationship with Iran is complex. Both states perceive themselves as regional superpowers yet have avoided direct military confrontation since the signing of the 1639 Ottoman-Safavid accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 July 2025 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the recent Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit held in Khankendi, Azerbaijan. In his first overseas trip since the conflict, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was also there, and photographed with Erdogan and Azerbaijan President Ilhan Aliyev. The telegraphed messaging was clear – a common front at the expense of Israel. Yet while Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey share a complex set of interests, they are not a united alliance. Azerbaijan is seen as a brotherly Turkic state by Ankara, but also received Israeli weaponry during the 2020 war with Armenia and in 2023 when Baku wrestled control over the disputed Karabagh region. In recent months, speculation has been rising that Azerbaijan may join the US-brokered Abraham Accords alliance. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous “us or them” binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kurdish-question-in-turkey-israel-ties&quot;&gt;The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. Ankara is unwilling to cede its influence there – whether to Iranian interference via potential sleeper cell networks or to Israeli military entrenchment. Israel sees diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called the Kurds a “natural ally” adding: “Understand that in a region where we will always be a minority –natural alliances will be with other minorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the so-called “Abraham Shield Plan”, developed by an Israeli non-governmental platform, marks the territory of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq as an “Abraham Coalition Partner”, a network that also includes Egypt, Jordan and the signatories of the 2020 Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara is undoubtedly vigilant to possible attempts by Israel to promote Kurdish separatist aspirations in Iraq and Syria and seeks to prevent Kurdish factions from being exploited as a proxy or leverage against Turkey by either Israel or Iran. Turkey is currently pursuing the disarmament of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which will have ripple effects across Turkey’s borders in Iraq, Syria and Iran. Following Israel’s Operation “Rising Lion”, one speculative scenario has questioned whether sub-national ethnic insurgencies may seize on perceived regime weakness in Tehran to advance separatist goals, such as the Kurds, Azeris, or Baloch groups. This is a low-probability risk in the short term. But Turkish security planners are likely alert to the risk that PJAK, the offshoot of the PKK operating in Iran, may seek to mobilise, even in the context of the PKK’s declared intent to disarm. Should Iran seek to disrupt the PKK process in order to keep Turkey preoccupied with Kurdish militancy, it risks alienating Ankara at a moment when Tehran can ill afford further tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-next-war&quot;&gt;The Next War?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few in the region believe the Israel–Iran conflict has reached a definitive end. History offers a cautionary parallel: the Six-Day War of 1967 was followed just six years later by the Yom Kippur War. A return to nuclear diplomacy under US pressure alongside an urgently needed political resolution for Gaza and the West Bank may reshape the current state of suspended hostility. Yet the fact that both Israel and Iran have crossed once-inviolable red lines by engaging in direct kinetic strikes suggests the threshold for future escalation has been permanently lowered. Another round of conflict remains a distinct possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, direct military confrontation between Turkey and Israel is a high severity/low probability scenario. The strategic consequences of targeting Turkey – a NATO member – would differ significantly from Israel’s campaign against Iran. Both sides are well aware of the operational complexities and potential fallout associated with military or intelligence actions, particularly given the heightened risk of miscalculation. Security planners on both sides are likely to remain cautious, recognising that any decision to escalate or undermine existing deconfliction mechanisms would carry considerable political and operational costs. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or “grey zone” activity between Turkey and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism – particularly from the perspective of Damascus – could be transformative. For war-weary Syrians, avoiding Turkish-Israeli confrontation on their territory would represent a meaningful step toward stability and disrupt escalatory violence cycles. Short of normalisation, a type of interim “convenient understanding”, as one Israeli security analyst described it, between Syria and Isreal may be a first step. This would likely ease the intensity of rhetoric between Israel and Turkey on both sides. In the long term, the aftermath of operations against Iran could reshape both bilateral and multilateral alliances across the Middle East. Although the U.S. appears to be reasserting its unipolar influence—whether deliberately or not—lasting regional stability will depend on the active buy-in of local actors. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite deterrence efforts, cyber threats continue to escalate, highlighting the need for greater accountability from and cost imposition on malicious actors. The U.S. 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes imposing costs on malicious actors and reinforcing alliances; the Republic of Korea’s (ROK) 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy also prioritizes offensive cyber defense and global cooperation. Since 2018, U.S. Cyber Command’s “Defend Forward” policy has resulted in 40 Hunt Forward operations across 21 countries, exposing threats from major adversaries. Similarly, the European Union’s updated 2023 Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox stresses situational awareness and the importance of holding persistent threat actors accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributing cyberattacks and formulating response strategies are inherently political processes shaped by national security priorities, diplomatic relations, and geopolitical considerations. Governments must balance deterrence with escalation risks, ensuring proportionality and international legitimacy. It is therefore difficult to establish a single, uniform standard for response. Nevertheless, consistent policy is necessary, as the absence of clear frameworks increases political burdens, delays decisionmaking, and results in inconsistent responses that can confuse allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A national framework for classifying cyberattack severity enhances objectivity, guiding policy decisions and facilitating mutual understanding between nations. Although South Korea has shown strong political will to respond to malicious cyber activities, it lacks a clear legal and policy framework for response procedures. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF) to objectively assess and categorize cyberattacks, supporting informed decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purposes-of-the-cyberattack-severity-classification-framework&quot;&gt;Purposes of the Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Political Decisionmaking and Strengthen the Framework for Cost Imposition and Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; The CSCF supports the ROK government’s political decisionmaking regarding cost imposition and accountability for malicious actors and their state sponsors at the international level. In doing so, the framework helps facilitate sustained international engagement in cyber threat mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Basis for International Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly sharing a national cyberattack severity assessment framework promotes transparency. By aligning with common evaluation criteria, the CSCF supports mutual understanding, helps partners better interpret intent, and strengthens situational awareness, playing a crucial role in advancing international cooperation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study, part of a project to enhance ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation, aims to classify cyberattack severity at the national level to support shared understanding and coordinated responses. It reviews government-led models and simplifies criteria around core items for clarity and efficiency. Case studies of state-sponsored cyberattacks in the United States and ROK over the past decade will test the framework’s applicability. Although the CSCF is limited by its reliance on public data, it seeks to support cost imposition efforts and to provide a foundation for international cooperation against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-and-international-methodologies&quot;&gt;National and International Methodologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presidential-policy-directive-41-ppd-41-us-cyber-incident-coordination&quot;&gt;Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41): U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPD-41 (2016) aims to enhance national security by managing and coordinating responses to significant cyber incidents. The United States defines a significant cyber incident as a group of related events, rather than a single isolated incident. PPD-41 introduces the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) to establish a unified federal understanding of incident severity, supporting coordinated national-level responses to significant incidents. CISS outlines six levels—Emergency, Severe, High, Medium, Low, and Baseline—based on the scope of the incidents and their impact on national security and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope and Impact: Evaluates the level of observed or potential effects on national security, public health, critical infrastructure, the economy, and public confidence&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Actions: Categorizes incidents into preparation, engagement, presence, and effect phases&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intended Consequence: Assesses attacker intent and potential damage scope&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-incident-scoring-system-nciss&quot;&gt;National Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the NCISS provides a consistent method of assessing cyber incidents and prioritizing the response to them across federal agencies. It assigns risk scores to incidents, which then guide response priorities and resource allocation. However, the NCISS struggles to assess simultaneous related incidents, relying on expert judgment instead of predefined criteria, which can cause inconsistencies and reduce objectivity in assessments. The NCISS uses the same six-level severity scale outlined by the CISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functional Impact: Effect on organizational operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Activity: Behavior of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location of Observed Activity: Network areas where malicious activities are detected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actor Characteristics: Capabilities and intentions of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Impact: Sensitivity of compromised data&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recoverability: Resources required for incident recovery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-Sector Dependency: Connections between critical infrastructure sectors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential Impact: Scale and significance of the affected organization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nis-directive-20&quot;&gt;NIS Directive 2.0&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIS Directive 2.0 (2022) establishes a unified framework for network and information security across the European Union. It covers a wide range of critical infrastructure and essential services vital to public safety, economic stability, and national security. Entities are required to assess and report cyber incidents that cause or could cause severe operational disruptions, financial losses, or significant harm to individuals or organizations. The scope of critical infrastructure and essential services includes sectors such as energy (electricity, oil, gas, and hydrogen), transport (air, rail, water, and road), banking and financial systems, healthcare, water supply, digital infrastructure (e.g., domain name systems, content delivery networks, and cloud), information and communication technology service management, public administration, and space-related organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on service operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on other individuals or organizations (material or nonmaterial)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importance of affected networks and information systems to the entity’s service delivery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity and technical characteristics of the cyber threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of impact on service functionality&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duration of the incident&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number of affected service recipients&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the entity has experienced similar incidents previously&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the incident was due to malicious or unlawful acts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possibility of cross-border impacts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-taxonomy-cit&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Taxonomy (CIT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU CIT, proposed by the NIS Cooperation Group in 2018, offers a standardized framework for classifying cybersecurity incidents at strategic and political levels. It aims to enhance coordination of incident response activities across the European Union and facilitate cross-border information sharing and cooperation. According to a 2022 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) report, many European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or relevant bodies are utilizing the EU CIT in their processes. Notably, Estonia has adopted the EU CIT as a national model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Sector affected by the cyberattack (e.g., energy, transport, finance, healthcare, water, digital infrastructure, government services)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threat Severity: Technical risk level of the threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact Severity: Societal or economic damage level&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-diplomacy-toolbox-cdt&quot;&gt;Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDT is an EU framework designed to prevent, deter, and respond to malicious cyber activities, promoting solidarity and mutual support among member states. The CDT emphasizes the importance of shared situational awareness and information sharing among EU member states, aiming to improve the understanding of the European Union’s threat environment and encourage the use of the CDT to support decisionmaking. It strengthens coordinated strategies to counter persistent cyber threat actors, reinforces the international obligation of due diligence, and introduces additional response options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorization-model-for-cyber-incidents-cmci&quot;&gt;Categorization Model for Cyber Incidents (CMCI)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2023 used the CMCI to classify cyber incidents based on severity and potential impact. It ensures effective resource allocation and response coordination across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals. The NCSC and National Crime Agency (NCA) oversee assessments. Severity levels are classified into six tiers, similar to the U.S. CISS model, based on the scope of affected targets (e.g., nation, institution, individual) and the level of socioeconomic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National Security Impact: Disruptions to essential services, potential harm to life or national security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale of Disruption: Level of interference in services or operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and Social Impact: Financial losses, data breaches, privacy violations, and social consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Categorizes affected entities such as critical infrastructure, government, enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-regulations-2020-cr&quot;&gt;Cyber Regulations 2020 (CR)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Regulations 2020 were established under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 to counter cyber activities threatening the United Kingdom’s integrity, economy, and security. These regulations allow the United Kingdom to impose sanctions on individuals or entities involved in cyber threats, including asset freezes and travel bans. Although the regulation does not explicitly define assessment criteria, it outlines the definition of relevant cyber activity and types of cyber activities, which form the basis of the assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Whether the attack aimed to cause harm&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope of Impact: Number of affected people or systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target: Whether the attack was on critical infrastructure or essential services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-attack-classification-scheme-ncacs&quot;&gt;National Cyber Attack Classification Scheme (NCACS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s Cyber Review (2018) introduced a cyberattack classification system to enhance threat assessment and response coordination. The NCACS highlights the need for a clear understanding of cyberattacks and rapid analysis of attack techniques for proportionate responses. Its classification scheme aims to enhance shared understanding, support decisionmaking, and promote international cooperation on cross-border incidents. The framework prioritizes impact-based evaluations, covering completed or imminent attacks that require urgent responses. Severity levels, compatible with the U.S. CISS, are classified into six tiers based on the scope and impact of cyber incidents. However, the NCACS incorporates international legal considerations, including the possibility of an armed attack under UN Charter Article 51, with the most severe level designated as “possibly assessable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact: Effect on national interests, security, the economy, and the environment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical Capability: Attack sophistication and methods used&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Motivations behind the attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Risk: The affected entity’s significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale: Attack severity and widespread effects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repetition: Frequency and relation to past incidents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-cyber-security-event-management-plan-gc-csemp&quot;&gt;Government Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Federal Cyber Incident Response Plan differentiates between general and critical incidents, with critical incidents addressed under the GC CSEMP (2023). The GC CSEMP ensures coordinated cyber incident management across government systems, led by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (TBS-OCIO). It includes the Injury Test, which assesses cyber incident severity and scope, and the Risk Assessment, which evaluates potential exposure. This report focuses on the Injury Test, which sorts incidents into four levels based on their scope and severity. Each level is defined by the extent of damage across five areas—public health, financial loss, government services, national security, and reputation—to provide clearer understanding of the attack’s severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity: Degree of harm across domains such as public health, financial loss, government services, national sovereignty, national security, and reputation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope: Extent of impact in terms of the number of affected individuals, organizations, facilities, or systems; the geographic area (e.g., international, national, multiple sectors, single sector or jurisdiction, individual or small business); and the duration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-incident-categorization-matrix-cicm&quot;&gt;Cyber Incident Categorization Matrix (CICM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) developed the CICM to prioritize incident response and ensure appropriate measures. Continuously updated, it is used by the Australian Cyber Security Centre to classify and manage cyber incidents effectively, as well as provide annual cyber incident statistics. Severity levels are classified into six tiers based on the intensity of cyber effects and the significance of the affected organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber Effect: Evaluates impact based on attack success, persistence, and intent (e.g., disruption to critical systems, broad or localized compromise, coordinated or isolated low-level attacks, or failed attacks)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significance: Assesses the importance of affected organizations (e.g., the general public, small to large organizations, educational and research institutions, local to federal governments, critical infrastructure, and national security systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-classification-guide&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Classification Guide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To standardize incident reporting and enhance security, China issued the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting Administrative Measures Draft (2023) under the Cybersecurity Law, defining severity levels and standardizing response procedures for government agencies, critical infrastructure operators, and network service providers. Similarly to GC CSEMP, severity is classified into four levels whose severity is defined across five dimensions—system disruption, data leakage, social impact, economic loss, and harmful information spread—to support rapid decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System Loss and Functional Disruption: Network failures affecting critical operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Leakage and Data Loss: Exposure of state secrets and sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social Impact: Number of affected people and essential service users&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic Loss: Direct financial damage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harmful Information Spread: Dissemination of illegal or harmful content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary and Comparison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-characteristics-of-national-frameworks&quot;&gt;Key Characteristics of National Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States assesses cyber incident severity through the CISS framework, integrating PPD-41 and the NCISS. The NCISS uses a quantitative, weighted scoring system to promote consistent assessment practices across the federal government and critical infrastructure sectors. CISA conducts evaluations based on reports from affected entities to ensure consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union classifies incidents via the NIS Directive, CIT, and CDT, sharing core criteria. The CIT, adopted by some member states like Estonia, supports standardized classification and information sharing. Both the NIS Directive and CIT classify attacks on critical infrastructure and essential services as critical threats, clearly identifying relevant sectors and applying broad coverage. One limitation is that these guidelines—particularly the CIT and CDT—are non-binding recommendations, and therefore not applied consistently across all EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom classifies cyber incidents through the CMCI and Cyber Regulation, which evaluate attack targets as well as economic, operational, and social impact. The sanctions regulation also considers attacker intent (malicious or unlawful) to ensure accountability and cost imposition on threat actors. Similar to the U.S. system, the NCSC and NCA carry out categorization to promote consistent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France employs cyber incident severity classification to support proportionate responses to malicious activities, emphasizing situational awareness and international cooperation. The NCACS is designed to be compatible with the U.S. CISS, aiming to enhance mutual understanding of cyber threat levels in the context of international coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s GC CSEMP assesses threats and risks using a matrix-based system to determine response levels. Similarly to the United Kingdom, Canada classifies attack targets by scale and considers the transnational scope of incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s CICM prioritizes victim importance and impact, using a simplified approach. The government maintains and updates its matrix, publishing annual statistics on the severity of cyber incidents in Australia to enhance awareness. The 2023 update categorizes impact by scope, focusing on supply chains, shared services, and critical infrastructure. Australia’s framework remains adaptive to changing cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has introduced a cyber incident classification guide and is developing supporting legislation. While it is similar to international models in most assessment criteria, China’s system emphasizes controlling harmful information, in line with state information policies. The framework includes quantitative standards, enabling rapid identification and reporting of major cyber incidents, though the basis for these standards is not explicitly provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;core-criteria&quot;&gt;Core Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across countries, cyber incident assessment criteria generally outline three tiers of importance. Core criteria—such as the scope and importance of the target; attacker intent; impacts on operations, the economy, society, and national security; potential loss of life; and scale and duration—are prioritized in most frameworks. Frequently considered but less emphasized are secondary factors like technical capabilities and incident frequency. Finally, other factors—such as infrastructure dependencies, attack success, harmful information dissemination, and recoverability—are selectively used depending on the context and purpose of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While national goals vary, many countries acknowledge the value of severity classification frameworks for crisis response, resource allocation, and international cooperation. Notably, models like the European Union’s CDT, the United Kingdom’s regulatory framework, and France’s NCACS show how classification can support accountability and diplomatic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/onHiwTA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Comparison of Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberattack-severity-classification-framework-cscf&quot;&gt;Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF criteria are based on international frameworks and focus on core criteria to improve efficiency and consistency. While international models incorporate a wider range of factors, this framework prioritizes core criteria by grouping them into three main categories—attack target, attacker intent, and impact—comprising a total of seven sub-criteria, all organized into three levels for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Scope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses scope by affected entity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Nationwide or multinational impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Regional or multi-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Localized or single-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Importance of Affected Targets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the criticality and sensitivity of the affected organizations and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Organizations crucial to national security, such as critical infrastructure or government agencies, based on the critical infrastructure sectors defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the ROK’s Act on the Protection of Information and Communications Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Large-scale private sector organizations, including major enterprises. The criteria for defining large enterprises in the ROK and the United States are as follows (though they may differ by industry in both countries):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Large-scale enterprises are defined by the Korean government as organizations with total assets exceeding 10 trillion KRW.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Large enterprises are generally defined as those with more than 500 employees or annual revenue exceeding $47 million, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Smaller organizations or those with limited national significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacker Intent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the goals and motivations of the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Goal-oriented attackers—including state-sponsored groups or international hacking organizations—conducting long-term operations for political or economic gain&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Criminal actors pursuing monetary gains&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Opportunistic or unintentional actors with no clear objectives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Functional Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the disruption or degradation of critical functions and services. Time thresholds, such as the recovery time objective (RTO) or maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), are used as benchmarks. The time thresholds may vary depending on the importance of the organization and system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Significant damage or prolonged interruptions, such as system downtimes exceeding the RTO or MTD&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: The RTO for critical government systems can be set within three hours. The Ministry of Interior and Safety in South Korea has set the MTD for government systems at three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: The RTO for national or mission-essential functions is generally set within 12 hours. According to NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev. 1 (Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems), the recovery time for functions that are national, primary, or mission-essential must be within 12 hours to ensure operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Partial damage or interruptions, such as disruptions contained within the RTO or MTD limit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on functions and services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Information Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the compromise of data integrity, confidentiality, or availability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Breach of classified or sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Breach of non-classified or general information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Economic Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the financial and economic damage caused by cyberattacks. The thresholds used are reference values informed by the U.S. CISA report Cost of a Cyber Incident, which systematically analyzes financial impacts (with a methodology detailed in Appendix A of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss exceeding 20 billion KRW (approximately $15.7 million) or affected population of more than 10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss exceeding $157 million or an affected population of more than 72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss between 5 billion and 20 billion KRW (approximately $4 million to $15.7 million) or affected population of 1–10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss between $40 million and $157 million or an affected population of 8–72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss below 5 billion KRW (approximately $4 million) or an affected population of fewer than 1 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss below $40 million or an affected population of fewer than 8 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Political and Social Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This considers the implications for national security, reputation, public relations, and societal responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Severe impacts, including extensive media coverage, significant social media backlash, substantial drops in presidential approval ratings, or a decline in international trust indices&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Moderate impacts with notable effects on public perception or international relations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or localized effects with limited public attention&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weighting-of-assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Weighting of Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a cyber operation’s classification as a use of force or severe attack depends on scale, effects, and target. And the UN GGE and OEWG, two international initiatives on cyberspace norms, emphasize that attacks on critical infrastructure pose significant risks and are considered particularly severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by the OSCE identified impact and damage scale as the most critical criteria for assessing cyberattacks, followed by attack target. Similarly, a 2022 survey by the National Security Research Institute (NSR) in South Korea found that experts ranked attack sector, importance of the damaged system, and damage scale as the top factors influencing cyber severity assessments (detailed in Appendix B of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prioritization aligns with a broader consensus that cyberattack assessments should focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact, including social, functional, and economic consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target, especially when critical infrastructure is affected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF reflects importance by letting the number of items in each category influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scoring-and-severity-levels&quot;&gt;Scoring and Severity Levels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF determines severity by assigning scores to assessment criteria, with a maximum score of 35 points. Each criterion is scored on a three-tier scale based on severity: High (4–5 points), Medium (2–3 points), and Low (0–1 point). The framework uses the total score across all criteria to categorize cyber incidents into six severity levels—Normal, Low, Medium, High, Severe, and Critical—aligning with the CISS used in the United States and France. The United Kingdom and Australia also follow a similar six-tier classification model. Using comparable severity levels helps promote mutual understanding of assessment results among nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BeUCN0h.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Cyberattack Severity Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cumulative-effects&quot;&gt;Cumulative Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks from major adversarial states are often parts of broader strategic campaigns rather than isolated incidents. These operations typically unfold within the “gray zone,” staying below the threshold of armed conflict to avoid direct retaliation. Attackers employ long-term reconnaissance and persistent access, expanding their targets from individual systems to interconnected networks to achieve their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing cyber incidents in isolation risks underestimating their intent and cumulative effect. To address this, viewing a cyberattack as part of a broader campaign not only strengthens the assessor’s ability to make political attributions but also provides a deeper understanding of the attacker’s strategic objectives and operational patterns. In line with this, U.S. PPD-41 recognizes that a series of related incidents with cumulative effects may qualify as a Significant Cyber Incident, and NATO’s 2021 Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy acknowledges that such activities could, under certain conditions, be classified as an armed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating cumulative effects into the severity assessment process also helps mitigate a key limitation of the CSCF: the potential perception that low-level or sub-threshold attacks will go unaddressed. By accounting for the cumulative effect of recurring or persistent malicious activity, the framework conveys that even seemingly minor incidents may be evaluated and incorporated into broader strategic assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate cumulative effects, a composite approach should be applied across the assessment criteria. For each criterion, the scope should be aggregated across incidents; the importance of affected targets should be assessed based on the most critical target; intent should reflect the most hostile objective; and impacts should be accumulated to reflect the overall effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s case study applied the CSCF to 21 cyberattacks over the past decade, primarily targeting the ROK and United States, focusing on critical infrastructure and state-sponsored hacking activities. The results are presented in Table 3. While the initial assessment covered 21 cases, 2 incidents were re-evaluated by applying cumulative effect, bringing the total to 23 entries in the table. Entries 1 through 8 correspond to the ROK and 9 through 20 to the United States. Entry 21 involves a German target, included for cumulative analysis, while entries 22 and 23 reflect re-assessed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment presents EuRepoC’s cyber intensity and impact scores as a comparative benchmark to provide context for the CSCF results. Where EuRepoC scores are unavailable, the corresponding table entries are marked as blank. EuRepoC, an open-access database supported by EU member state governments, measures cyber intensity based on direct effects and sociopolitical severity, while its impact indicator evaluates broader consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EuRepoC’s cyber intensity is categorized into three levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Low/Moderate (Green); 6–10: High (Yellow); 11–15: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact is classified into five levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Minor (White); 6–10: Low (Green); 11–15: Medium (Yellow); 16–20: High (Orange); 21–25: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, cyberattacks ranged from Medium to High severity according to the CSCF, with cases like the KHNP Hacking (Entry 1) and the Pyeongchang Olympics Hacking (Entry 3) showing notable social and political impact. Although the KHNP Hacking caused limited direct disruption, it triggered public alarm by targeting nuclear facilities, and led to the development of South Korea’s cybersecurity strategy. It was classified as High severity under the CSCF. However, according to EuRepoC, both cases were rated within the Low/Moderate intensity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean hacking groups were responsible for the most severe attacks on South Korea, particularly the 2023 Andariel IT Company Breach (Entry 7) and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both of which targeted military intelligence and defense technology. The Defense Contractor Breach received the highest scores under the CSCF due to its significant informational and social impact. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, Entry 7 was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact, while Entry 8 was assessed as High in intensity but still rated as Low in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, facing more frequent and severe cyber threats compared to South Korea, exhibited higher severity levels in CSCF-based assessments, with attacks classified as Medium to Severe. High-profile cases such as SolarWinds (Entry 13), Colonial Pipeline (Entry 17), Volt Typhoon (Entry 18), and Salt Typhoon (Entry 19) reached Severe under the CSCF due to their impact on national security and critical infrastructure. Additionally, the Hive Ransomware Attack (Entry 14) was rated Severe according to the CSCF, since it caused significant financial and operational disruptions. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, the Hive Ransomware Attack was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact. For the remaining cases, while some were assessed as High in intensity, all were rated Medium or lower in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in which cumulative effect is applicable under the CSCF include the 2022 Defense Manufacturer Attack (Entry 6), and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both by North Korean groups targeting South Korean defense contractors; and the 2024 Diehl Defense Breach (Entry 21) involving a German missile supplier, which also fits this pattern. Though individually limited, their cumulative effect within the “North Korea Defense Breach Campaign” justifies a reclassification to Severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2015–2016 DNC hacking incidents (Entry 10) in the United States are attributed to Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear as part of Russia’s election interference efforts. Along with the post-election spear-phishing attacks (Entry 11) by the same threat actors and with the same political aim, these incidents can be collectively referred to as the “Russian U.S. Election Interference Campaign.” When assessed as a broader campaign, the impact increases and may justify a Severe classification under the CSCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the CSCF and EuRepoC showed a similar relative ranking of cases—those rated highly under the CSCF generally also received higher ratings under EuRepoC. However, EuRepoC tended to assign lower absolute intensity and impact scores compared to the CSCF. This alignment in severity levels was slightly closer in U.S. cases, while ROK cases showed some differences, likely due to EuRepoC’s EU-centric focus on large-scale impacts. Since political and economic impacts vary by national context, frameworks like the CSCF—which present reference points informed by such context—are better suited to national-level assessment. In particular, because the importance of the attack target is a critical factor in national security considerations, the CSCF has enabled more appropriate severity assessments in such contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cZSpmS0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: CSCF Case Studies Over the Past Decade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF provides a systematic framework for assessing cyberattack severity, thereby enhancing situational awareness and supporting the ROK government’s political decisionmaking. It promotes international understanding, facilitates national cost imposition efforts, and supports joint responses. This approach aligns with the strategic goals of the ROK-U.S. Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework, which emphasizes countering and deterring malicious cyber activities while holding responsible states accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF was developed through comparative analysis to identify core criteria and organize them into three categories: impact, target scope, and intent. The framework also offers detailed sub-criteria with reference points based on publicly available data. When applied to cases, high-profile incidents such as the Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon were classified as Severe, effectively capturing their national security implications. Moreover, when multiple attacks by the same hacking group with similar objectives were assessed cumulatively as part of a single campaign—such as the North Korea Defense Breach Campaign—the attacks’ severity levels increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study results underscore the need for a national-level classification framework that reflects country-specific contexts. The CSCF is particularly well-suited for evaluating the severity of cyberattacks in South Korea, especially from a national security perspective. Such a framework enhances understanding of domestic cyber incident severity and can serve as a foundation for improving mutual understanding in the context of future ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have grown in scale and complexity over the past two decades. Unlike traditional military deterrence, deterrence in the cyber domain lacks clear red lines and established response thresholds, and allows a degree of anonymity. As a result, few cyberattacks have led to meaningful consequences, and major threat actors continue to exploit cyber capabilities. Therefore, active national-level responses that impose costs and ensure accountability are essential. Ultimately, response depends on national resolve, operational capacity, and coordinated action among like-minded nations. Nevertheless, continued research is needed not only to support political decisionmaking but also to foster international consensus. In addition, ensuring consistent assessments requires a dedicated agency for ongoing evaluations—as seen in the United States and United Kingdom—highlighting the need for a similar system in the ROK. Such an agency should share assessment results with stakeholders and foster a unified understanding of cyberattack severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When countries design their cyber defense strategies, they do so on the premise that they can defend against malicious cyber operations only after the impacts of such acts materialize. Instead of taking this reactive posture, however, the United States spearheaded a paradigm shift to a proactive posture in 2018, when the Department of Defense (DOD) developed the “Defend Forward” strategy. This posture has since been maintained in the United States, and was reaffirmed in the introduction of the 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Variations on this approach have been adopted by some countries, including the Republic of Korea (ROK). South Korea introduced a proactive approach to cyber defense in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, some aspects of which mirror the DOD’s Defend Forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proactive cyber defense is just one option available to countries responding to cyber threats. In general, response options are various and can be structured with a range of typologies. For instance, options can diverge into defensive and offensive responses; defensive responses, in turn, can be classified as either reactive or proactive. Public attribution and countermeasures under international law are examples of reactive defense; proactive defense can include active cyber defense and other threat-hunting activities. In certain circumstances, alternatives to proactive cyber defense can be more effective. This paper is based on this conceptualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For proactive defense, countries need to glean insights into adversaries’ acts in cyberspace before their impacts reach the intended targets. These insights are mostly embedded in physical infrastructures that adversaries exploit for malicious cyber operations—facilities primarily located in foreign territories. That is why working with allies and partners is crucial for proactive cyber defense. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States have made a great effort to cooperate in this space over the last few years. Such cooperation is primarily based on the alliance between the two countries. This paper aims to explore areas in which South Korea and the United States must deepen their collaboration to bolster their proactiveness in cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-koreas-cyber-defense-shift&quot;&gt;South Korea’s Cyber Defense Shift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-toward-a-proactive-posture&quot;&gt;Moving Toward a Proactive Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the administration of former South Korean President Moon Jae-in unveiled South Korea’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy. The defensive stance outlined in the 2019 strategy can be characterized as reactive rather than proactive. The strategy’s second strategic task, “enhancement of cyberattack response capability,” offers a glimpse into this reactive stance. According to the 2019 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, an implementation plan of the 2019 strategy, the administration, with a view to enforce cyberattack response capabilities, undertakes to (i) secure cyber deterrence by managing vulnerabilities and taking steps for attribution; (ii) fortify readiness against massive cyberattacks by revamping the framework for national response and developing cyberattack detection technologies; (iii) seek comprehensive and active means of response through international cooperation with like-minded partners and reinforcement of cyber warfare capacities; and (iv) improve cybercrime response by enhancing investigation and prosecution capabilities. In sum, the 2019 strategy appears to have been crafted without consideration of the proactive defense concept. The 2019 strategy is significant in that it represented the first-ever national cybersecurity strategy in South Korea and established a governance framework where the National Security Office of the Blue House took the lead in national cybersecurity. However, its strategic ideas concerning cyber defense seem to have remained at a rudimentary stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, then-President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration made public the second National Cybersecurity Strategy, which shifted South Korea’s approach to an offensive posture. In the 2024 strategy, the country set the “development of offensive cyber defense and response capabilities” as one of three primary objectives crucial to fulfilling its strategic vision of acting as a “global pivotal state.” To that end, South Korea set forth five strategic tasks, one of which is “enhancing offensive cyber defense activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2024 strategy calls its defensive posture “offensive cyber defense,” the strategy’s posture is not so offensive that such naming is necessary, particularly considering the subtasks that South Korea is indeed planning to carry out to fortify “offensive cyber defense.” The strategy’s subtasks are specified in the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, which details the activities that the administration intends to implement in pursuit of offensive cyber defense. These include establishing public attribution; tracing threat actors’ cyber infrastructure; issuing joint advisories; and collecting and analyzing threat intelligence over attack origins, among other things. Although some of these subtasks may have offensive elements, these activities do not comfortably fit under the term “offensive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inadequate naming could give rise to mischaracterization and misinterpretation, and thus escalation. It is hard to draw a clear line between the defensive and the offensive in cyberspace. In the spectrum of cyber activities, purely defensive actions such as firewall protections sit at one end, while offensive operations to destruct or destroy targets sit at the other end. It is hard to tell where on this spectrum the administration’s “offensive cyber defense” sits. Given this, use of the term “offensive” may risk signaling that South Korea would resort to the spectrum’s offensive extreme, which is not the intention reflected in the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to enhance offensive cyber defense, the Yoon administration’s strategy highlights three main activities, some of which can be regarded as reflecting a proactive approach. The first is attribution. In the strategy, South Korea stated that it will identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks that impair national security and national interests by mobilizing the legal and technical capabilities necessary for attribution. The country also emphasized that it will use scientific evidence to identify actors behind cyberattacks and hold them accountable for their malicious behavior. To this end, South Korea is set to establish a procedure and standard for attribution and employ it to build a foundation for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second activity highlighted in the strategy is the strengthening of joint deterrence with partner countries. The administration seeks to maximize deterrence of threat actors through the issuance of joint cybersecurity advisories, which South Korea has actively issued with partners over the last few years. For instance, in July 2024, South Korea issued a joint cybersecurity advisory on APT40—a group sponsored by China—with the relevant ministries of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the same month, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint security advisory on the activities of the Andariel, a hacking group under the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third activity is preemptive and proactive response through active detection and attack origin analysis. This reflects an approach similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. South Korea’s strategy gives its intelligence agency and its military a preemptive and proactive mission to detect and analyze the sources of cyberattacks, catch signs of attacks in advance, and quickly share information with relevant ministries. To implement this, the 2024 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan states that South Korea will develop technologies to identify threat actors and track their bases, infrastructure, and activities. Notably, there is a nuanced difference between attribution and the identification of the source of a cyberattack. The former is a procedure necessary to impose responsibility—i.e., legal or political costs—on persons or states conducting malicious acts in cyberspace. On the other hand, the purpose of source identification is to proactively track down the source of the attack before the intended target is affected, reducing the impact (if any) on the target’s network. With this third element, South Korea can be seen as taking a step toward proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-framework-and-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Organizational Framework and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the National Security Office (NSO) is responsible for coordinating overall cybersecurity-related tasks as well as setting up and reviewing mid- to long-term policy directions. Under the coordination of the NSO, governmental agencies and departments carry out their respective cybersecurity-related responsibilities. In particular, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Cyber Command under the Ministry of National Defense (MND) play central roles in proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As South Korea rearranged its cybersecurity strategy in 2024, the National Intelligence Service Act and its presidential decree, the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, were amended accordingly and entered into force. As a result, the NIS’s four major cybersecurity duties became more refined and streamlined. First, the NIS performs intelligence activities for national cybersecurity. That is, the NIS collects, prepares, and distributes intelligence on international hacking organizations or state-sponsored hacking groups (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(1)(e); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(a)). Second, the NIS takes measures to identify, deter, and block threatening cyber activities conducted by North Korea; foreign states, nationals, or organizations; transnational actors; or South Koreans affiliated with any of these entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(3); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(b)). Third, the NIS takes preventive and responsive measures against cyberattacks and threats on public entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(4); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(2)(a)). Fourth, the NIS is entitled to establish and operate a consolidated response governance in which public and private entities jointly work to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)). In the event of a crisis, the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) serves as the Cyber Threat Task Force (CTTF) tasked with responding; in times when there is no active crisis, the agency functions as the National Cyber Risk Management Unit (NCRMU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of South Korea’s proactive cyber defense, Article 6 bis of the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty must be highlighted. This article was newly introduced in the revised Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty in 2024. According to paragraph three of Article 6 bis, the director of the NIS may take necessary steps to proactively identify, deter, and block activities against national security and interests. Such measures under this provision may include tracking and neutralizing foreign and North Korean bases. This provision provides a legal basis for the NIS’s proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s Cyber Command also assumes cybersecurity tasks, mostly those related to national defense. The Cyber Command was established under the MND to take control of these duties in 2011 (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 1; the Cyber Command was originally established in 2010 under the Defense Intelligence Command of the Ministry of National Defense. In 2011, the Cyber Command became a unit directly subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense, per the Presidential Decree on Cyber Command enacted in that year). The Cyber Command’s duties include planning and executing cyber operations and related cybersecurity needs; developing and establishing frameworks necessary for cyber operations; and collecting, analyzing, and utilizing cyber threat intelligence (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 2). In addition, the Defense Counterintelligence Command under the MND supports cyber defense and information warfare (Presidential Decree on the Defense Counterintelligence Command, Article 4(5)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s governmental structure for cybersecurity is illustrated in the graphic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-approach-and-defend-forward&quot;&gt;The U.S. Approach and Defend Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of proactiveness in the United States’ cyber defense is reflected in the “Defend Forward” posture. In 2018, the year after President Donald Trump began his first term in office, the DOD’s cyber strategy introduced Defend Forward, which represented a new approach: the idea of moving as close as possible to the origin of an adversary’s activity as a way of defending against it. Defend Forward was first introduced in the 2018 vision document of the U.S. Cyber Command: Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority: Command Vision for US Cyber Command. According to the document, the United States will defend forward to disrupt and stop malicious cyber operations—including activities below the level of armed conflict—at their origin. The United States emphasizes that although Defend Forward involves activities on the adversary’s network and not the U.S. network, this is still a defensive activity, not an offensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defend Forward is inextricably linked to the concept of persistent engagement. The United States introduced the philosophy of persistent engagement in recognition of the fact that Cyber Command needs to engage with enemies on an ongoing basis in order to disrupt or impair their capabilities. The goal of persistent engagement is to identify and stop overseas cyber threats before they reach the U.S. network. Persistent engagement is designed to ensure that Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force takes and maintains the initiative to succeed in the daily competition with enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Defend Forward and persistent engagement is reflected in a metaphor from General Paul Nakasone, former commander of U.S. Cyber Command: “Our naval forces do not defend by staying in port, and our airpower does not remain at airfields. They patrol the seas and skies to ensure they are positioned to defend our country before our borders are crossed. The same logic applies in cyberspace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration continuously adopted Defend Forward under Pillar II (“Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors”) of its 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategic tasks in Pillar II aim to mobilize all powers to prevent malicious cyber actors from threatening national security and public safety. The United States elaborated that it would expand private sector participation in neutralizing malicious cyber activities and promote cooperation with international partners. The DOD signaled that, in line with the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, it will continuously defend forward by disrupting the malicious cyber activities and degrading their supporting ecosystems. (In the same year, General Nakasone stated that “There was a huge inflection point in 2018 with the Defend Forward [strategy]. I don’t see, necessarily, a huge change in the strategy coming out.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rok-and-us-cyber-defense-approaches-differences-and-commonalities&quot;&gt;ROK and U.S. Cyber Defense Approaches: Differences and Commonalities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both shared features and divergences between the proactive cyber defense approaches of the ROK and the United States. In order to identify possible areas for cooperation between the two countries, these commonalities and differences need to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Differences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the U.S. and South Korean approaches have different backgrounds. One of the underlying reasons for the United States’ paradigm shift toward a proactive posture is the failure of the U.S. cyber deterrence strategy prior to 2018. In early cybersecurity strategy formulations, the United States primarily perceived acts that reached the use-of-force threshold as severe cyber threats. However, the malicious cyber operations to that point—such as the 2014 Sony Hack, the OPM breach, and the DNC hack—had been below the level of use of force. Minor but frequently occurring cyber incidents, meanwhile, had been neglected but were having cumulative and erosive impacts on national security. Recognizing this threat landscape, the United States devised the strategies of Defend Forward and persistent engagement in order to contest daily competition in cyberspace. In contrast, South Korea’s embrace of a proactive stance is not rooted in such reflection. Rather, South Korea took note of the inherent nature of cyber threats. In short, the hyper-connectedness of cyberspace makes complete prevention and defense against cyber threats too constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the origin of South Korea’s approach, it is evident that the major threats the country has experienced are not at or above the level of use of force. For instance, in May 2024, one terabyte of data from South Korea’s Supreme Court was stolen by Lazarus, North Korea’s hacking group. Yet physical and tangible damage—which would normally be calculated to assess whether an incident justifies use of force—was not caused. However, significantly sensitive personal information was leaked, including information on resident registration, marriage, and medical certificates. These types of damage could have a knock-on impact that could threaten national security. Accordingly, South Korea’s cyber defense posture must be calibrated to adequately disrupt such low-level activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, leadership frameworks for defending proactively also differ between the two countries. In the United States, a single leader serves as the director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the commander of the U.S. Cyber Command. This dual-hatted leader coordinates Defend Forward operations by integrating intelligence. However, the roles of the South Korean NIS and Cyber Command are not integrated for the purpose of proactive cyber defense. Although the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) can operate a consolidated response system in which public and private entities can cooperate to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)), this framework is primarily crisis-based, requiring a certain threshold to operate. In addition, the NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law, although cybersecurity intelligence can be shared between them (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 5). As a result, who takes the lead in proactive defense and how the authorities cooperate is not well-defined in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonalities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both countries, intelligence collection on cyber threat sources is key for successful proactive defense. Gathering intelligence—thereby gaining insights on adversaries’ weaknesses, intentions, and capabilities—is a crucial step for defending forward as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity. In its 2024 strategy, South Korea also highlighted an intent to bolster reconnaissance and intelligence on the sources of cyberattacks. Preemptively catching indications of malicious activities by detecting and analyzing sources is underlined as one of the subtasks of proactive cyber defense. By proactively discovering adversaries’ malware and tactics and degrading their capabilities to conduct malicious cyber operations, South Korea and the United States could prevent such activities at the source before reaching their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If threat hunting is limited within one nation’s border, the success of proactive defense is limited as well. A proactive defense posture thus necessitates partnering with foreign countries. Indeed, the United States’ Defend Forward requires the country to conduct activities outside of U.S. networks—both in allies’ and partners’ networks and in those of adversaries. Thus, the U.S. Cyber Command views partnerships as an integral component of Defend Forward. In this vein, hunt forward operations—defensive cyber operations conducted at the invitation of a host nation—must be highlighted. Upon invitation, the U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force deploys a team to a host country to observe and detect malicious cyber operations there. As of March 2023, hunt forward teams had been deployed on at least 47 missions in more than 20 countries. With a view toward enhancing capabilities to collect and analyze threat intelligence, South Korea is planning to expand the exchange of threat intelligence with foreign intelligence agencies. Compared to the United States’ rich experience in partnering with other countries for proactive cyber defense, including in hunt forward operations, South Korea has limited experience in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-cooperation-for-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Operationalizing Cooperation for Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROK-U.S. Alliance and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, many uncertainties hang over the alliance between South Korea and the United States, as well as the paths of their respective national cybersecurity strategies. President Trump has commenced his second term in the White House and is reshaping his country’s cybersecurity resources. South Korea is currently standing in the fog of uncertainty created by this political transition. Many have cast doubts on President Trump’s willingness to promote U.S. alliances, including the partnership with South Korea. Furthermore, experts have been raising concerns that the absence of leadership in South Korea will put the ROK-U.S. alliance in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the following two principles cannot be reversed. First, the principle that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace must stand. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States still seem to share a common understanding that their alliance—which has lasted over 70 years—must be sustained. The foreign ministers from Seoul and Tokyo and the U.S. secretary of state met in February 2025 and discussed the necessity of enhancing the strength of their countries’ alliances to ensure peace and prosperity. In addition, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening extended deterrence cooperation through the ROK-U.S. and Japan-U.S. alliances. In this vein, the Strategic Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework (SCCF), a legacy of President Yoon and President Biden, must be underscored. On April 26, 2023, the two presidents created the SCCF, signaling their agreement that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace. Whatever the cooperation framework, South Korea and the United States must consider this a cardinal principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the proactive posture in cyber defense must not be abandoned. Strategic thinking evolves as cyber threats evolve; accordingly, defense has been evolving from reactive to proactive as countries adapt to the nature of cyberspace. In the words of cybersecurity experts Eric Talbot Jensen and Sean Watts, “cyberspace’s structural feature of interconnectedness and its core condition of constant contact creates a strategic necessity to operate continuously in cyberspace.” This means, as General Nakasone has put it, that we must not just “wait for cyber attacks to affect” our networks. In effect, it is hard to imagine that the United States and South Korea would abandon their proactive postures and reassume reactive postures, since this would go against the evolution of strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laying Out South Korea’s Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous analysis of the similarities and differences between the two nations’ proactive approaches, this paper suggests five major considerations for South Korea to prioritize in its cooperation with the United States. Some of these are intended for both countries, while others are priorities specifically on the South Korean side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the two nations need to think about a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense. Under the SCCF, the two countries undertook discussions of how the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Korea (MDT) applies in cyberspace. When it comes to the two countries’ cooperation on proactive cyber defense, however, the MDT’s role would be limited. That is because the provisions under the MDT largely address armed attack situations. The treaty contains only six articles that strengthen the two countries’ efforts for collective defense. Article I outlines the two countries’ commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force, echoing the corresponding principles under the UN Charter. Articles II and III touch upon the two countries’ cooperation when one or both are threatened by an armed attack. Article IV regulates the right to deploy U.S. forces in the territory of South Korea. The final two articles contain miscellaneous provisions on ratification, entry into force, and termination of the treaty. As illustrated earlier in this paper, proactive defense posture has been introduced in national policy mainly due to cyber threats occurring below the use-of-force threshold. Of course, proactive cyber defense is not exclusive to low-level threats, but its necessity is most pronounced at that level. Consequently, South Korea and the United States need to pursue a cooperation mechanism that enables them to proactively defend against malicious operations, including those posed below the use-of-force level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, South Korea and the United States need to define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other. According to the 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, South Korea is mainly introducing an offensive response directed at threats from North Korea. Unfortunately, the real threat landscape is a bit different. For instance, pro-Russian cyber actors conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attacks against ROK governmental websites, including that of the MND, after North Korea dispatched troops to Russia. In addition, damage caused by China’s cyber operations has been increasingly acknowledged as severe. Whether or not to explicitly indicate threat actors in a policy document depends upon a nation’s strategic calculations. South Korea and the United States, however, must identify and agree upon a common threat actor against whom proactive defense can be meaningfully employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify common threat actors, South Korea and the United States should be able to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of proactive defense measures against these threat actors, considering diverse elements like infrastructure footprints, geopolitical relations, and technical capabilities. Based on such assessments, South Korea and the United States could pinpoint shared threat actors against which collaborative proactive defense would yield a successful impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, South Korea and the United States must discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Proactive cyber defense aims to defend against malicious acts before they impact a country’s networks; to achieve such a goal, technical capabilities must be geared up well and outputs of technical analysis must be appropriately shared. At times, such technical measures for proactive hunting must be disseminated worldwide. To this end, cybersecurity advisories can be useful. By inoculating their own networks or global networks, the two countries can compete with malicious actors under more favorable conditions. Accordingly, South Korea and the United States must engage in dialogue on how to collaboratively raise their own technical capabilities and share these capabilities with the world for proactive defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, South Korea needs to rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing. Although the U.S. NSA and Cyber Command have different roles in national cybersecurity, they are directed by a single leader. This allows the United States to speedily leverage threat intelligence in cyber operations like Defend Forward. Moreover, the outputs of the command’s work during hunt forward operations are appropriately shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and private companies. Releasing adversaries’ malware obtained during hunt forward missions to the cybersecurity community makes that malware less effective because reactive defense can be used to detect and defeat it. In this way, the United States’ proactive cyber defense can inoculate U.S. networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, measures for proactive cyber defense are not carried out within one integrated framework. The NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law. The consolidated response framework led by the NIS’s NCSC, in which public and private entities can cooperate, functions primarily on a crisis base. This organizational framework may hinder timely intelligence sharing among relevant agencies and private entities. Considering the advantages of the United States’ dual-hat leadership and its extensive experience in intelligence sharing, South Korea’s organizational structure must be reexamined and coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense must be explored. Proactive cyber defense entails actively detecting and analyzing the sources of malicious cyber activities. Unfortunately, these sources are physically located in other countries’ territories and subject to the sovereignty of these states. Even though the international community has not reached a common understanding of how and when a state’s territorial sovereignty can be breached through activities in cyberspace, South Korea needs to engage in proactive defense activities within these legal considerations. In this vein, South Korea may gain lessons from the United States’ “away game” experiences (operations that, like Defend Forward, involve activities outside U.S. networks). The United States’ experiences in away games are richer than those of other countries, and some of them are publicly available, with details of successful cases sometimes disclosed. South Korea may reference the United States’ legal logic in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats evolve, the tools that states devise in response evolve accordingly. Proactive cyber defense is a tool that is well-adapted to cyberspace’s inherent features and threats. South Korea introduced a proactive defense posture in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, with an ultimate goal similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. The concept of proactive cyber defense requires cooperation among states, as it requires tracking traces left by malicious actors globally. Given this landscape, cooperation with the United States—the most experienced country in proactive defense—is imperative for South Korea. In conclusion, this paper, as suggested above, proposes five key areas for the two nations’ cooperation to promote proactive cyber defense. South Korea and the United States need to (i) establish a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense; (ii) define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other; and (iii) discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Furthermore, South Korea needs to: (i) rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing and (ii) explore the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

But the window of opportunity is closing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American disengagement from Ukraine has prompted European leaders to reaffirm their commitment to supporting Kyiv and emphasise the high stakes for European security. Nevertheless, European capitals are pessimistic about what can be achieved without significant American backing. In the absence of a clear European theory of victory, policy remains aimed at delaying Ukraine’s defeat without a clear vision of what Europe should be trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a concerted effort by European states over the next year could lay the foundations for the enduring security of Europe; pushing Russia to a point where it will struggle to reconstitute its military sufficiently to threaten NATO for the foreseeable future. There is a closing window of opportunity within which a more dangerous future for the continent can be foreclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-without-a-buffer-zone&quot;&gt;Europe Without a Buffer Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future that dominates planning within NATO is one in which Russia imposes an outcome on Kyiv, compromising Ukraine’s independence. Having withdrawn its forces from Ukraine to put them through large scale exercises, the Russians could have a minimum viable force to threaten European states in the context of US redeployments to the Indo-Pacific within two years. Rebuilding its officer corps given extensive losses will take up to seven years, over which time the Russian military will regenerate much of its frontline equipment, so that the severity of the threat that must be balanced by NATO increases with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine can hold on for another year, continuing to attrite Russian forces, however, then Russia may be pushed beyond its ability to readily recover. Russia is already approaching the exhaustion of its stockpiled Soviet-era armoured vehicles by the end of 2025. In 2026 the Russian Army will have to replace losses by producing new equipment. Recruitment is currently at an all-time high in Russia with between 35,000-47,000 people joining the military per month, but the bonuses needed to induce enlistment have peaked, while much of the enthusiasm to join has been driven by a perception that the war will soon be over. To keep up recruitment, Russia is already looking beyond voluntary enlistment. Russia cannot further increase payments as the Kremlin has emphasised that it will not be spending more on defence. If the war looks to be protracting, it will struggle to keep up the rate of recruitment. In terms of both equipment and personnel, the key to Russia’s ability to rebuild combat power is money, which is overwhelmingly generated through the oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-hurdles-for-russian-forces&quot;&gt;Economic Hurdles for Russian Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s exposure to disruption of oil and gas exports is significant. With sanctions restricting Russia’s ability to borrow on the international market, it cannot afford to run a sustained budget deficit. Following President Donald Trump’s raft of tariff announcements, the price of oil dropped below $60 a barrel – the level against which Russia’s budget is benchmarked – causing President Putin and his defence minister to emphasise in speeches that the military would need to work within their current means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe, however, has the capacity to significantly strain Russia’s finances and thus the sustainability of the war. Most of Russia’s oil exports are moved by sea, and over 60% of that traffic flows through the Baltic Sea where they must pass through Danish waters. Sanctioning vessels associated with this trade can cause them to be de-flagged and once de-flagged Denmark could ban them from transiting its waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia would invariably seek to export oil via other ports, but limitations on available infrastructure would still see a significant decline in exports. This could be further reduced through the threat of secondary sanction to ports that receive and offload Russian oil. Russian oil represents a small fraction of these ports’ business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economy and thus its ability to sustain the war can be further degraded through Ukraine’s long-range precision strike campaign. Many of the sub-systems used in Ukraine’s manufacture of long-range weapons are European and Europe can invest to expand supply, enabling Ukraine to target a wider range of Russian infrastructure. Resourcing the strike campaign is in many ways a win-win scenario for Europe. If Russian air defences defeat the strikes, Russia burns through its stockpiles of surface to air missiles – thereby making the conventional deterrent offered by European air forces more credible – while if the strikes succeed, they both reduce Russian revenue and its capacity to build weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects will take time to impact Russia, but if implemented with alacrity they would confront the Kremlin with hard policy trade-offs in 2026. It would, in short, provide the basis for bringing Russia to the table to negotiate, rather than simply playing at Potemkin peace-talks in which Russia restates its maximalists demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;holding-ground-to-buy-time&quot;&gt;Holding Ground to Buy Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is only possible if Ukraine can hold. At present, the rate of Russian advance is accelerating and Russia’s summer offensive is likely to put the Armed Forces of Ukraine under intense pressure. Nevertheless, most of the capabilities that Ukraine depends upon for its defence today – from drones to artillery and even aircraft – are not directly dependent upon the US. In the short-term Europe can cover most of Ukraine’s needs so long as it can purchase some critical weapons types from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the medium-term Europe must address fundamental weaknesses in its defence industrial base. Investment in explosives and propellent production for instance is essential, as highlighted in the UK’s recent Strategic Defence Review. The good news is that this is critical to support Ukraine and to rebuild NATO’s conventional forces so investment in this area is not wasted irrespective of how the threat develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that US disengagement makes Europe’s security more precarious has seen understandable efforts across the continent over the past five months to try and engage with Donald Trump. This has softened some of the administration’s more abrupt actions. But it has not altered the underlying trend that the US is going to pivot from Europe. It is time the continent crafts a vision for how it can underwrite its own security and put the steps in place to realise it. That vision begins in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued updated guidance about North Korea’s IT labour networks, noting that they “…have been observed using artificial intelligence and face-swapping technology during video job interviews to obfuscate their true identities.” Iran, too, is finding success in augmenting its global spear-phishing and social-engineering campaigns with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While banks and other financial institutions are increasingly supplementing their compliance and monitoring capabilities with AI, most are geared towards financial crime and sanctions evasion as it currently stands, not as it is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-once-was-a-question-of-emerging-technology-is-now-a-real-threat&quot;&gt;What Once was a Question of Emerging Technology is Now a Real Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is reshaping entire sectors of the global economy and changing how the world conducts business. Healthcare, manufacturing and finance, to name a few, stand to benefit from AI-enabled solutions that can make quick sense of complex data. The banking and finance sectors have been some of the earliest adopters, deploying AI tools to detect fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evaders. According to one recent survey of financial leaders, nearly 77% of banks have adopted or plan to adopt AI tools to augment their fraud detection, risk and compliance functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, is that criminals, too, are rapidly deploying AI-enhanced tools, and with promising results. A recent study, for example, found that AI-enabled spear-phishing campaigns were nearly as effective as those generated by humans. Although exact figures are unknown, another survey suggests that a growing and significant number of fraud schemes involve the use of malicious AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapidly evolving landscape presents a significant challenge for global sanctions implementation and enforcement. While financial institutions and governments have invested heavily in AI to detect illicit activities, the very same technology is now being weaponised by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-radical-evolution-of-sanctions-evasion&quot;&gt;A Radical Evolution of Sanctions Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several decades, sanctions-evasion methods have generally followed similar patterns with little in the way of significant innovation. Both North Korea and Iran heavily rely on obfuscation methods like the use of shell and front companies, falsified documentation, such as end-user certificates, and third-party countries to get around US and international sanctions. Often these methods take advantage of legal and regulatory gaps in monitoring and enforcement (for example, the use of secrecy jurisdictions) or the adoption of novel technologies. North Korea, for example, has become prolific in its virtual currency theft operations that generate revenues for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How are Sanctions-Evaders Adopting AI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, AI can automate complex tasks, generate realistic deceptive content, and create layers of obfuscation that are significantly harder to penetrate. Most importantly, this can be accomplished at a scale and speed that most monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are unable to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conventional methods of sanctions evasion, such as the use of shell corporations, document falsification, and exploitation of offshore jurisdictions, remain prevalent, AI introduces a novelty and level of obfuscation that make detection far more difficult. Manually establishing and managing hundreds of interconnected shell companies, each with unique and non-overlapping details, is a monumental task prone to human error, which investigators often exploit. AI, however, can generate and manage vast networks of synthetic entities, complete with varied digital footprints, making them appear more distinct and significantly harder to link back to a common controlling interest – overwhelming traditional investigative techniques and rule-based detection systems, which are often designed to identify known patterns of illicit behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, that one of North Korea’s largest sanctions-busting networks, Ocean Maritime Management, consisted of dozens of shell companies registered in jurisdictions across the globe. AI-enabled systems could feasibly create hundreds, if not thousands, of such networks – all mathematically optimised to avoid monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just shady corporate structuring – malicious AI threatens all aspects of sanctions-evasion, including trade-based sanctions and export controls. Falsifying the nature, origin or destination of goods is a common tactic in trade-based money laundering and sanctions evasion. AI can be used offensively to analyse customs codes, tariff schedules and regulatory frameworks across multiple jurisdictions to identify the most effective and efficient ways to misclassify sanctioned goods or dual-use items to avoid detection or minimise duties. Furthermore, falsifying key shipping documents, such as bills of lading, certificates of origin and packing lists is a well-established method of sanctions evasion. Generative AI – a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, videos and code based on user input – can produce convincing and internally consistent sets of fraudulent documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-anyone-ready-for-this&quot;&gt;Is Anyone Ready For This?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, and counterproliferation financing standards – released a report that provides important updates on the methods that WMD proliferation networks use to source dual-use goods and technologies and access the global financial system in contravention of international sanctions. Although the report acknowledges the potential threat of AI-enabled sanctions evasion, it notes the topic is “too nascent to draw conclusions”. Unfortunately, this lack of forward thinking may impinge global counterproliferation financing efforts. According to FATF, only 16% of countries assessed are deemed to have effectively implemented recommendations related to proliferation financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that governments, international organisations and private sector institutions currently are building and deploying AI-enabled solutions to look for sanctions-evasion now, and not how it is expected to evolve. The focus must adapt from looking for established red flags and typologies to anticipating adaptive, AI-driven obfuscation strategies that can learn from detection attempts and modify their tactics accordingly (in other words, adaptive adversarial AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, however, several significant obstacles stand in the way of getting ahead of AI-enabled sanctions evasion. One is contending with outdated compliance and monitoring infrastructure across disparate sectors. Some jurisdictions, for example, still maintain paper-based customs monitoring systems. Many financial institutions, especially those in the developing world, still rely on individual reviews of suspicious activity. Such methods are highly vulnerable to AI-enabled attacks that can scale to levels that utterly overwhelm compliance, monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is finding a balance between data privacy and consumer protection on the one hand and regulations that may hamper rapid adoption of AI-enabled tools on the other hand. The Financial Action Task Force, for example, found that while the use of AI can help “public and private sectors improve the effectiveness of their risk-based implementation of the FATF Standards” such tools must remain “compatible with international standards of data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some jurisdictions, regulatory approaches tend to be more sectoral, relying on existing authorities to address AI-related risks within their domains. The US, for example, remains a patchwork of regulations – often inconsistent from state to state and lacking overarching Federal regulations. While critics have claimed this approach threatens consumers, others have claimed that over-regulation would stifle innovation and adoption speed, threatening America’s economic positioning with the AI sector. The European Union has taken a decidedly different approach, with its landmark AI Act, which essentially establishes a risk-based framework for AI across industries and categorizes AI systems by risk level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the question for policymakers is whether regulation will hamper or enable the ability of monitoring and enforcement systems to keep pace with the evolution of sanctions evasion, driven by adversarial AI. What we know for sure is that the era of AI-enabled sanctions evasion is here, and those that police sanctions implementation and evasion need to fundamentally rethink how they respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the June 2025 war ended, it was the peak of conflict between Israel and Iran. Until 1979, the two states had mutually beneficial relations but following the Islamic revolution this conflict has existed between them. Iran has seen Israel as its nemesis. The Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and many Iranian top officials do not recognise Israel’s right to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has been a top concern for Israel, which has been especially worried about Iran’s nuclear project. Over the years Israel had attempted to slow Iran’s nuclear program before it could produce nuclear weapons, by employing covert tactics such as cyber-attacks and assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have been warning about the threat Iran imposes. It eventually brought this recent confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maj. General Eyal Zamir suggested in May 2022 a strategy against Iran. In the June 2025 war, as chief of staff, he led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a confrontation that started with a major Israeli attack. Israel’s spearhead was the Israeli Air Force (IAF) including its air defence, and Israel’s intelligence community. Israel launched two strikes inside Iran in 2024, which were not focused on Iran’s nuclear program but on Iran’s advanced antiaircraft batteries, the S-300, which were neutralised. Then, Israel sought a very short and limited round of confrontations. The June 2025 war was a much bigger campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has allies and proxies across the Middle East, but Hezbollah and Hamas became much weaker after absorbing significant blows in 2024. Those groups were not involved in the more recent confrontation between Israel and Iran. The pro-Iranian groups in Iraq also stayed out of the war. Only the Houthis continued to confront Israel, but in a very limited way. The combination between the decline of Iran’s partners and the weakness of Iran’s air defences gave Israel a rare opportunity to strike. At the same time, Iran was closer than ever to producing nuclear weapons. Israel was concerned that it might be its last chance to stop Iran from having nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel managed to convince its American patron to allow Israel to hit Iran hard. The United States had provided Israel with highly valuable military and political support during the campaign and then, after more than a week of battles between Israel and Iran, the Trump administration bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. The United States had to take into account various constraints, on several levels, like the cost of the war, the need to save munitions for a possible fight with Russia and/or China, and to deal with domestic opposition to the US participating in the war – including inside the Trump administration. No wonder the United States had sought, and quite quickly managed, an end to the confrontation. Israel and Iran also had good reasons to avoid a long war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-constraints&quot;&gt;Israel’s Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has strong ties with its American patron, but the US – perhaps quite soon – may have pulled back from the June 2025 war. Israel did not want to be left alone during a tough fight with Iran. It required Israel to end the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel always tries to run a short war for several basic reasons, including economic ones. Israel’s economy is trying to recover from the long and highly costly war in Gaza (which costed Israel so far more than $67 billion). The June 2025 war had costed Israel hundreds of millions of dollars a day, and the cost of property damage in Israel was recently estimated at around $1.5 billion. Israel tried to adjust its economy according to the constraints of the confrontation. Yet Israel needed to end the war with Iran soon, or else its economy might have faced a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israelis have grown used to a state of emergency certainly since October 7, 2023, when Hamas and then Hezbollah confronted Israel. Those groups receive aid from Iran so they can fight Israel. The June 2025 war was directly between Israel and Iran. The Israeli public is exhausted after almost two years of war. They would have stood firm as long as the people believed the losses and damage they absorb are worth the outcome of the confrontation with Iran. If Israel had officially insisted its goal is to topple the Iranian regime, it would have been a tall order. The Iranian regime might have been strong enough to survive, and eventually the Israeli public would have therefore felt they are losing, in that sense. The same would have happened if the Israeli public were convinced Israel can quickly defeat Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are up to 15,000 Jews who live in Iran. They have not been harmed, but during the June 2025 war there was fear among them. If the confrontation had continued – and especially if it had escalated – the situation for Iranian Jews might have got worse. This negative change might not have been initiated by the Iranian regime, because it would have made the regime look bad, but some Iranians might have taken the law into their own hands to assault Jews. Outside the Middle East, as the war would have gone on, there would have been a growing risk that the Iranian regime or its supporters might have attacked Jewish communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel and the United States could have conducted more air strikes, adding to it raids with special forces and cyber-attacks. Israel also could have continued to assassinate leading Iranian nuclear scientists and top officials. Yet those efforts require a lot of resources and time and there is no guarantee they could have stopped Iran from producing nuclear weapons. Israel, sometimes together with the United States, already tried many of those methods during the last two decades, which only delayed Iran’s nuclear program. Israel could have also tried to assist the Iranian opposition to bring regime change in Iran, which is a complicated task that would too require a long time, and might not succeed. President Trump suggested the possibility of regime change in Iran. However, the United States might hesitate here, following its bitter experience in trying regime change in Iran’s neighbours, Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is more than 1,500 km away from Israel. The IAF reaches Iran, but the IAF was built to fight near Israel, not far away. Israel’s fighter-bombers: the F-15, F-16 and F-35 can use drop tanks, but the IAF needs tankers for a long fight. The IAF has a half-century-old Ram (Boeing 707) tanker aircraft that had conduced around 600 aerial refuelling missions during the recent confrontation. Yet since they were too few of those tankers some Israeli aircraft were refuelled by US tankers. Israel seeks to get the new Boeing KC-46 tankers, but before they arrive, the IAF would have struggled to keep a high rate of sorties over Iran in the long run, without significant US assistance. In addition, despite the IAF’s impressive efforts to maintain its aircraft, the IAF must operate following almost two years of fighting, with all its demands on the IAF. Its fighter-bombers are sophisticated and complicated weapon systems, but some of them have been in service for two decades or more, which could make it a challenge to keep them operational if the fight with Iran had been prolonged. Israel had to be careful not to wear down the IAF in a long confrontation with Iran, particularly if in the near future Israel faces a sudden and severe crisis, let alone a war on another front. The IAF would still have been able to fight, but the IAF would have been weaker, which might have made it difficult for the IDF to win at a low cost. Meanwhile, it is possible, if the confrontation with Iran had gone on for months, eventually one or more Israeli aircraft might have been lost. If an Israeli air crew had to abandon its plane because of Iranian anti-aircraft fire, lack of fuel, technical problems or some accident, this crew might have ended up in Iranian hands, which would have been a blow to Israeli morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF does not have heavy bombers so there is a limit to how much damage the IAF could inflict. It is another important constraint in a long war. The IAF would also need all kinds of bombs if the fight had gone on. Recently the Director General of the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (res.) Amir Baram, met with the CEOs of the main defence industries and top officials from the Ministry of Defense. They discussed accelerating the production of key munition needed for a long campaign. Yet there are limits to how many bombs – or the materials to make them – Israel can produce or import. The same is true with the Israeli air defence, which might have ran out of Arrow missiles as the fight had continued. Israel might have had a serious munitions shortage, despite all the US aid in this matter. Although Iran is Israel’s main enemy, the IDF cannot spend too much ammunition in fighting Iran. Some reserve must be saved in case there is a confrontation on another front. After Israel was shocked on October 7, 2023, it must be ready for other nasty surprises that might lead to a war. The United States too has similar considerations, which can delay or reduce the amount of munitions it can deliver to Israel. The US military already has munitions shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is strategic, economic and military constraints would have made it hard for Israel to handle a long war, which could have happened, especially if Israel’s goals were not practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-calculations&quot;&gt;Iran’s Calculations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has much more territory, population and natural resources than Israel. Israel’s size is around 22,000 km2 and it has 10 million people while Iran’s is more than 1,600,000 km2 and has around 90 million people and enormous natural gas and oil reserves. Israel’s gas reserves are much smaller. Despite all those advantages, Iran would have struggled to run a long fight due to several factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran could not have been sure if, when, and how much the United States would have continued to strike Iran. President Trump might have assumed Iran is so weak, that he can force it to do what he wants, by continuing to bomb it. Trump also did not forget Iran tried to assassinate him. An ongoing, let alone massive, US offensive against Iran would have changed the power of balance against Iran. Iran had to prevent that by ending the confrontation before it would have been too late for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian regime might have been desperate enough, if the war had gone on, to try to close the Strait of Hormuz, where around 20 million barrels of oil pass per day, which is about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption. Blocking those straits would seriously disrupt the oil market. The United States could break this siege by force and retaliate against Iran. This fight would have started with the Strait of Hormuz, but it could have expanded into a bigger fight that would have included striking targets all over Iran such as its nuclear sites. Over time, such escalation could have jeopardised the survival of the Iranian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF gained air superiority over Iran’s skies. Iran’s air force is old and cannot match the IAF. The IAF also neutralised a large part of Iran’s air defence. Iran could not have afforded a long war in which Israel can bomb in Iran whenever and whatever it wants. This enormous advantage would have allowed Israel to strike various targets including going after senior officials, up to the supreme leader. This was a huge risk for the regime, that also humiliated it in the eyes of its people, which increased the danger they might topple it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran strikes Israel with drones, but in the last two years the IAF has gained experience in shooting them down, which was evident in the success in this action by the IDF in the June 2025 war. Iran’s main weapon, their surface-to-surface missiles, caused some casualties and damage but Israel began to destroy the launchers. To begin with, Iran had less than 2,000 missiles that could reach Israel and far fewer launchers. Since the IAF had control over the skies of Iran, despite Iran being a huge country, the IAF was able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. Iran was aware it had to end the war before it was unable to strike Israel with missiles, and by the end of the confrontation Iran was firing far fewer missiles than at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s economy depends on exporting oil. If Israel had severely crippled Iran’s oil production, Iran could have sold much less oil. For Iran, it was a very good reason to stop the war before this happens. Furthermore, the Iranian economy has been struggling for many years now, not only because of sanctions but also due to corruption, mismanagement and giving priority to foreign adventurers instead of taking care of the Iranian population. Iran has to manage enormous economic challenges such as an energy crisis, while Iran’s currency, the Rial, is at an all-time low. The Iranian regime was aware that if its economy deteriorates even more, due to losing its main income through the difficulty of selling oil, it will increase the probability of an uprising. In recent years there were several waves of demonstrations in Iran. Another outburst might be powerful enough to undermine the Iranian regime. Preventing this requires the Iranian regime to focus on improving its economy by making reforms and removing sanctions, which meant ending the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the confrontation had continued, European powers that signed the JCPOA might have suspected that Iran would try, secretly or not, to produce nuclear weapons after or even during the war, to protect itself from attacks. This would have raised the chances that in October, the ‘snapback’ mechanism might be implemented, reinstating UN sanctions against Iran. It was another key economic concern for Iran, adding to the pressure on her to end the war quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, from the perspective of the Iranian regime, they made huge compromises in 1988, ending the war with Iraq, and in 2015, signing the JCPOA, and they have now done another by ending the war – before the cost would have been too high for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian foreign policy, traditionally nonpartisan, is increasingly shaped by domestic political divides, complicating alignment with global powers. This also fuels unpredictability, especially in relation to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s political right is looking to align with Washington in a bipolar world order, while its political left still seeks multipolarity through the Global South and with the help of the Global East. If, contrary to many expectations and current Brazilian policy, the world becomes bipolar, Brazil may be forced to pick sides, challenging its tradition of balanced diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the world appears to be heading towards multipolarity, this would fulfil a long-held Brazilian foreign policy objective. However, Brazil faces regional dynamics that, perhaps paradoxically, resemble bipolarity, as South America remains only a secondary, or even tertiary, zone for great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting major forums like the G20, BRICS, and COP30 puts pressure on Brazil to deliver more consistent global messaging, limiting its room for strategic flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6–7 July, the BRICS Summit will be held on Brazil’s southeastern coast, in Rio de Janeiro, sandwiched between last November’s G20 Summit in the same city and this November’s COP Summit in the Amazonian city of Belém. Brazil’s role in presiding over leading fora of multilateral diplomacy draws attention to different facets of left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s policy. Lula, now serving his third term as president, has positioned Brazil as a vocal advocate for climate action, Global South cooperation, and a more multipolar world order. These platforms offer his government a chance to demonstrate global leadership and score some wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Briefing Paper examines whether Brazil’s traditional approach – marrying the abovementioned foreign policy positions with basic alignment with the United States – remains sustainable in the face of today’s shifting global dynamics. The challenge lies not only in balancing between two powers – the US and China – but also in navigating two different international structures, bipolarity and multipolarity, at both global and regional levels. Adding to the complexity, Brazil’s outlook is also subject to major swings due to the increasingly partisan slant in its foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is divided into four parts. First, Brazil’s current push for multipolarity is addressed. Second, the development of a distinctly Brazilian foreign policy vision is outlined, particularly in the context of its evolving relationship with the United States and its views on Brazil’s hemispheric and global roles. Third, this vision is examined in light of Brazil’s current objective of global multipolarity – particularly through BRICS – and its preference for multilateralism in settings such as the UN and its climate regime, the WTO, and the G20. This is also compared with India’s behaviour on both regional and global stages. Fourth, the sustainability of Brazil’s current path is assessed: a path that entails keeping Washington close enough while simultaneously pursuing a world that is not necessarily aligned with US interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil currently faces both ample opportunities for diverse partnerships and challenges in avoiding open alignment. As much as Brazil may have publicly pushed for reforming international institutions, it has been a relative beneficiary of the pre-existing rules-based order and a less divided world. Thus, this analysis concludes with the conjecture that other global powers will find it increasingly difficult to comprehend the ambiguity of Brazil’s alignment, and that Brazil itself may struggle to maintain its balancing act. European actors, in particular, would do well to study Brazil’s experience closely, both as a warning and as a model, to avoid repeating missteps or overlooking structural tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazils-push-for-multipolarity&quot;&gt;Brazil’s push for multipolarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s 2025 BRICS presidency got off to a flying start in January, when Indonesia joined the organization. With its 280 million people and $1.4 trillion GDP, Indonesia strengthens Brazil’s pursuit of multipolarity and its multi-aligned stance in global affairs. For Brasília, Jakarta’s accession marked a major diplomatic win and underscored Brazil’s emphasis on BRICS as a framework for cooperation in the Global South – a Global South in which Brazil sees itself as a, or the, major leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet BRICS remains divided on its basic orientation. Russia, Iran, and China openly challenge the Western-led international order, while Indonesia has now joined India and Brazil as a major multi-aligned member, one that emphasises strategic autonomy. This underlines the bloc’s strikingly diverse composition, which also includes Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – both close strategic allies of the US – while South Africa and Ethiopia, which are currently suffering from cooling relations with the United States, are the final two of the group’s fully declared ten members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is a case in point when discussing the strategic ambiguity surrounding the group. While Brazil refers to Saudi Arabia as a member, Riyadh has neither accepted nor declined the invitation to join. For Saudi Arabia – as well as for many other BRICS partners and applicants – ambiguity remains a strategic hedge in an evolving world order. Nonetheless, the current BRICS members already account for a higher share of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity terms than the G7 core. To make matters more interesting, this shift comes at a time when this Western rival to BRICS appears increasingly divided, as seen in its June summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing juxtaposition between BRICS and the G7 raises broader questions about the structure of the international system. Brazil’s role in BRICS depends not just on the country’s partnerships, but also on how power is distributed globally. A central tension emerges here: is the world heading towards multipolarity or bipolarity? Although not taking a definitive stance on the question, this paper examines how countries may need to prepare for both scenarios. For Brazil, this question is particularly pressing, as in a more multipolar world, it may aspire to emerge as a pole of its own; in a bipolar world, it may have to choose, or at least balance, between two superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, bipolarity refers to a global or regional system defined and driven by two countries. At the global level, for example, even the rapprochement between the United States and Russia can be seen as a sign of such bipolarity, as Washington seeks an understanding with Moscow that would allow it to focus more energy on Beijing. However, the very existence of such a Muscovite lever – one with the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear weapons – suggests a considerable element of multipolarity in the emerging global order, where power is distributed among several influential states rather than concentrated in two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional dynamics complicate the picture further, as the structure of the international system can appear very different depending on the perspective. For example, India is situated at the heart of multipolarity, both in the Indo-Pacific and in Eurasia. Brazil, by contrast, is geographically removed from the hottest spots of geopolitical contestation. As a result, it is more vulnerable to the pressures of systemic bipolarity than countries located in regions shaped by several great powers. This means that Brazil must actively seek out and build multipolarity, pursuing partnerships with other actors, including parties such as the European Union. While doing so, it must also follow a path that reconciles its global ambitions with domestic and regional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-the-us-and-the-quest-for-global-status&quot;&gt;Brazil, the US, and the quest for global status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Brazil’s amorphous ambitions for global leadership, it is first necessary to comprehend how its relationship with the United States has evolved. Beneath the surface of Brazil’s foreign policy discourse lies an undercurrent of jealousy that has the potential to turn into resentment: Why them and not us? Both countries are continental in scale, and Brazil also entered modernity in overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Napoleonic Wars, Brazil was merely a Portuguese colony, lacking even a printing press. Then, from 1808 to 1821, the Portuguese Court ruled from Rio de Janeiro. In 1822, Brazil gained independence under an emperor, the son of the King of Portugal. The resulting Empire of Brazil had two overarching policy objectives: actualizing territorial integrity and preserving slavery in the New World, even after European kingdoms turned against the slave trade. In 1889, Brazil abolished slavery and emerged as an aristocratic republic with a predilection for localized civil war, but also continued territorial expansion, especially in the Amazon region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Brazil fought on the side of the Allies in World War I and took part in the League of Nations, its foreign policy remained largely focused on internal and regional affairs. A more multifaceted approach began to emerge in the mid-to-late 1930s, co-created with Washington in the context of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy. Roosevelt sought a partnership with Brazil, soon convinced the country to join World War II, and in 1947, President Harry Truman signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Known as the Rio Treaty, it formalized collective defence in the Americas and helped inspire the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an auspicious decade for both US-Brazil relations and Brazil’s rise as a global player. However, from the perspective of then-capital Rio de Janeiro, one crucial shortcoming stood out: Brazil failed to secure a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Despite early US support, Brazil lacked the international recognition needed to secure the seat. This failure has shaped Brazil’s foreign policy ever since. Why did the quest fail, and how could that wrong be rectified?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quest for global status via a permanent seat on the UNSC has remained, on and off, a mainstay of Brazil’s foreign policy vision. Similarly, its relationship with the United States – with the bicentennial of diplomatic ties celebrated in 2024 – has remained a constant, if sometimes one-sided, question. Washington’s view of Brazil has shifted over time: at certain points, the US has hoped that Brazil would play a more prominent role in South America or the broader Americas, and at other times, it has found Brazil’s efforts, at best, a hindrance to its own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proximity has not always bred harmony, and during the Cold War, for example, bilateral ties were often controversial. One notable episode was Brazil’s participation, during its military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, in the US-led intervention in the Dominican Republic. The relationship between the two great federal republics of the Americas has alternated between cooperation and phases of Brazilian assertiveness, including the pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and regional leadership, if not against, then at least not for the purposes of the United States. The latter tendencies were particularly pronounced during the eight years of the first and second Lula presidencies (2003–2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 21st century, Brazilian foreign policy has taken an increasingly partisan turn. In recent years, the country’s political right has seen itself aligning with the United States bilaterally. For example, under hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022, the last Trump administration designated Brazil a Major Non-NATO Ally. By contrast, Lula’s return to office has created more distance between Brasília and Washington, even though President Joe Biden intervened to help secure the Brazilian election in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hardening partisanship, Brazil’s foreign policy vision is becoming increasingly complex. It is also shaped by the rise of a near-peer rival to the United States – China – and several international regimes built around Beijing. The most important of these is BRICS, an organization whose future is essential to Brazil’s grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is a risk. To avoid being seen as openly aligned against the United States, Brazil must succeed in portraying its BRICS engagement as cooperation within the Global South, rather than as an anteroom for entering the Global East – the bloc of countries openly challenging the United States and many of its friends and allies. As a pair of shrewd analysts have put it, the outcome of the ongoing battle for the direction of BRICS will help determine the future of the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has arguably been among the greatest beneficiaries of the last quarter – if not the last half – of a century of globalization. While many countries commonly regarded as part of the Global South still struggled with a myriad of financial crises at the turn of the millennium, many of them have now not only secured seats at the tables where international policy is made but also built alternatives to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is useful to distinguish between the Global South, which may not be part of the Global West or North, but does not necessarily seek to challenge them, and the Global East, which increasingly does. This distinction is important for two reasons: first, there is overlap in membership between the two groups; and second, the Global East has arguably been the greatest winner of the 21st century. China’s growth is already legendary, but even under wartime sanctions, Russia’s economy has proven remarkably resilient. In recent years, the Global East has shifted from simply growing its share of the global economic pie to translating economic gains into geostrategic capabilities – a shift that has not gone unnoticed in European capitals, much less in Washington. From the first Trump administration through Joe Biden’s four years in office, the United States has sought to hamper the economic growth of not only its clear foes such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea, but also, increasingly, that of its principal systemic challenger: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, leading lights in Washington now see even the prosperity of many longstanding allies as something of a threat. This signals a shift towards a more confrontational understanding of global power and creates a challenging scenario for Brasília, regardless of who is in power – and even despite Brazil’s trade surplus with the United States. In response, President Lula has insisted that BRICS is not aimed against anyone, and therefore no country should have any reason to turn down an invitation or use the organization to its own advantage. However, others seem to see things differently. Saudi Arabia’s fence-sitting is one example, but Argentina’s outright refusal to accept an invitation to join in 2023 – following the electoral victory of Javier Milei, a right-wing president aligning the country more closely with the United States – suggests that some governments do indeed see BRICS as politically charged, or as standing in opposition to Washington and allied capitals. This also speaks to the evolution of BRIC into the so-called BRICS+, with the plus sign symbolising not only growing membership, but also expanded ambition. What began as a forum for those seeking simple recognition has evolved into economic cooperation and increasingly ventured into the realm of geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both Brazil and India have at times resisted the expansion of BRICS and its overt geopoliticization, they have ultimately chosen to remain within the changing organization – or perhaps concluded that they have nowhere else to go. For Brazil, this became particularly apparent during its G20 presidency in 2024. Although it managed to highlight poverty and hunger – and even build an alliance around these issues – it achieved little in terms of furthering the reform of international institutions. In contrast, Brazil has devoted more of its international efforts in 2025 to BRICS, a platform increasingly associated with a more confrontational stance towards the Global West or North. The contrast is telling: as such, the G20, born of the Global Financial Crisis and an institution that has sought to balance a variety of interests, may be turning into a relic of High Globalization. BRICS, by comparison, reflects a more disruptive vision for global governance. If the G7 has continued to exist alongside the G20, then why not BRICS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps paradoxically, emerging multipolarity, at least at the regional level, seems to be challenging multilateral governance frameworks. Brazil and India – both prominent actors in the Global South and founding members of BRICS – offer contrasting examples. While Brazil, located in a relatively peaceful area, has largely existed in a region shaped by bipolar great power dynamics – with China steadily displacing the United States in areas such as trade and finance – India is living through multipolarity in its region, surrounded by multiple nuclear-armed rivals. This is perhaps why both US and European policymakers have expressed more empathy towards India’s strategy of multi-alignment. In a tougher neighbourhood, New Delhi’s balancing strategy is approached with more understanding than Brazil’s, even when it blends increasing military cooperation with the United States with military-industrial and energy engagement with Russia, and a generally sceptical approach to world-trade regimes. Meanwhile, Brazil, despite its support for multilateralism and participation in institutions like the WTO, is afforded less leeway – even though it has clearly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite some odd remarks from its presidents. Compounding this, Brazil’s economic performance has lagged, while India is on a path to overtake Japan as the world’s fourth-largest economy, possibly as early as 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brazil’s past role as a potential bridge between the West and the Global South has become less plausible in a world where the West itself is more divided and where the United States has, once again, withdrawn from the Paris Agreement. This matters because, in late 2025, Brazil will also host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, an event intended to showcase its global climate leadership. Climate diplomacy has been a central part of Brazil’s multilateral identity ever since the Rio Conventions of 1992, although the Lula government’s sustainability commitments are in tension with its interest in expanding fossil fuel exploration – including in areas near Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these contradictions, Brasília’s intention is to double down on Brazil’s legacy of leadership through multilateralism and to re-emphasise sustainability. The inclusion of Indonesia in BRICS during the first days of Brazil’s presidency suggests that its leadership in the Global South can also yield tangible results. Brasília, indeed, seems capable of moulding the world in a direction it desires. Whether that direction aligns with Washington or other Western capitals is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-between-alignment-and-autonomy&quot;&gt;Conclusions: Between alignment and autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Brazil simultaneously maintain sufficient alignment with the United States while also pursuing an increasingly independent stance in the region and the world? Answers to this question are becoming increasingly contradictory and contentious. Yet Brazil’s relationship with the United States continues to influence its aspirations for both regional and global leadership. Ultimately, Brazil still needs Washington’s vote for a hypothetical permanent seat on the UNSC, and more immediately, Brasília’s interests lie in avoiding alarm over its current trajectory. But this balancing act will only become more difficult as Brazil seeks further multipolarity and asserts itself as a leader in the Global South. While Brazil’s geopolitically quiet neighbourhood has often been advantageous, it may also result in relative blindness to the outcomes and stakes of the tug-of-war between multipolarity and bipolarity. Three reflections remain on this outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, US-Brazil relations offer a case study on how partnerships with the US can inform broader alignment strategies, especially in the context of national foreign policy traditions breaking down along partisan lines. Brazil has been at the forefront of a recent trend of alignment based on ruling parties rather than a broader sense of national interest. As a result, US-Brazil relations now clearly fluctuate depending on who holds power in both countries. For example, if the Brazilian Right returns to power, further alignment with Trump’s United States can be expected. Such alignment would also enjoy support from a significant portion of Brazil’s increasingly ideological public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication lies in Brazil’s judiciary, which has constrained both the power of the country’s own executive and the influence of US tech companies. This has resulted in a major rallying cry in Washington and Silicon Valley. The European Union and its member states would do well to examine the Brazilian case to avoid some of the same pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China’s growing influence is a reality that Brazil must navigate, especially in the realm of trade and investments. Brazil’s total exports to China are already more than double those to the United States, and within a few years, the US share may shrink to just one-third. While this means that the US trading relationship is diminishing in importance, there is a good chance that Brazil will still benefit from such a shift, as global trade tensions create new openings: US tariff policy has made China buy more soy, Japan more beef, and perhaps even France will drop its opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal. Despite never having been known for the lowest tariffs, Brazil has long supported rules-based trade, and the country is generally well-placed in Trump’s view of the trading world – with the US holding a slight surplus in bilateral trade. Still, this will be a difficult adjustment for Brazil’s foreign policy outlook. This raises a third and vital point below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s geopolitical climate, Brazil may simply end up aligning against the United States, perhaps even accidentally. This could happen, for example, if Brazil continues to pursue multipolarity in a world that – contrary to most current projections – shifts towards bipolarity. Under such circumstances, the very pursuit of multipolarity could draw Brazil closer to China, the beneficiary of today’s anti-hegemonic policies. While Brazil may try to avoid unnecessary confrontation with the United States today, this is no easy task for a government that also seeks to express disagreement for the sake of what it perceives as a greater good. As Lula said during a March 2025 visit to Japan, “Trump is not the world’s sheriff – he’s only president of the United States,” adding that protectionism must be overcome if free trade is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is clear who the main target of such a statement is, it can also be interpreted as a message to Brussels. Brazil has waited more than a quarter of a century for a trade deal with the European Union; and for just as long, it has decried Europe’s fluctuating interest in both the country and the deal. Without ratification of the EU-Mercosur agreement, Brazil’s distance from not only the United States but also from other parts of the Global West will only grow. Europe would do well to heed such calls for cooperation and build common cause with Brazil and other countries of the non-aligned – or at least less-aligned – Global South whenever possible. The recent trade agreement with Chile is a good start. But without more substantial change, Brazil may ultimately shift from a tradition of constructive diplomacy to openly challenging Western-led institutions. In such a world, the reform of global governance would not be achieved through compromise but, at best, through the ascension of the Global South or, more troublingly, the rise of the Global East. For these reasons, Europeans should also endeavour to develop a vision of global order that is ameliorative and does not run counter to their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, any European vision should be one that Brazil could share and one that helps tether the country to global institutions. Such an outlook would prepare the international system for a world in which Brazil may no longer be able to pursue multipolarity and maintain alignment with the United States at the same time. In a period of intensifying bipolar rivalry, Washington is likely to resume demanding clear alignment from its friends and allies – even if, at present, it is sending mixed signals about its own alliances and other commitments. As such, Brasília – and the viability of its double-edged foreign policy – is something that all global observers should watch. Luckily, Brazil has recently made this easier by assuming the presidency of several international forums. Being under the spotlight also makes it harder to practise any form of strategic ambiguity; instead, the country’s contradictions and challenges are now in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy system, along with other infrastructure. In November 2024 alone, Russia fired 350 missiles and over 2,500 drones at the Ukrainian power grid. As a result of these attacks, the total damage to the energy infrastructure—heating, power, and oil and gas—at the end of 2024 was estimated at $20.5 billion, while the cost to rebuild according to EU standards amounts to $67.8 billion. Combining the occupied, destroyed, and damaged power capacities, Ukraine has lost a total of approximately 27 gigawatts (GW) of its pre-war installed capacity of 56.1 GW. Ukrainian citizens and businesses entered recent winters with less than half of their power generation available, forcing authorities to introduce restrictions on the supply of electricity. Emergency measures—such as repairing damaged generation capacity and deploying thousands of backup diesel generators—have provided stopgaps to the current dire situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this crisis, energy decentralization as a strategy for survival has moved to the forefront of expert discussions. Small, distributed power units, ranging from 5 to 100 megawatts (MW) each, are regarded as the only way to prevent a nationwide blackout and ensure a stable electricity supply to people and businesses. In addition, these small units are not an easy target for Russian missiles. Importantly, decentralization also aligns with Ukraine’s long-term commitment to a more sustainable and balanced energy mix. According to Ukrainian and international experts, rebuilding Ukraine’s grid on the old, centralized model with outdated coal plants and dependence on imported fuel is not an option. Instead, Ukraine has a unique opportunity to build a modern energy system relying on a more balanced and efficient mix, strengthening its future energy security and economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two years are critical for Ukraine’s energy security. As Russian attacks persist, Ukraine is racing to winterize its grid and add new generation capacity. At the same time, there is significant work ahead for the Ukrainian government—both at the national and subnational levels—in terms of regulations, reforms, and incentives to address Ukraine’s energy challenges. The international donor community and foreign investors are watching developments in the country very closely, as they will be key players in achieving Ukraine’s vision. For the United States, supporting Ukraine’s energy modernization aligns with its strategic interests in the country and the broader region: It creates markets for U.S. firms, strengthens Ukraine’s resiliency, and diminishes Russia’s ability to cripple the Ukrainian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off prior work conducted by CSIS, this paper discusses how to rebuild Ukraine’s energy system to ensure access, strengthen security, and promote sustainability. The paper provides a description of the country’s future energy mix, the policy and regulatory reforms needed, and the role that international partners—including the United States—can play in its modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-future-energy-mix-outlook-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Future Energy Mix: Outlook and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine inherited a Soviet energy model, characterized by a centralized, state-owned monopoly with huge generation facilities serving the entire country. Ukraine’s power system was dominated by large nuclear, coal, and hydroelectric plants feeding a Soviet-era grid, run by state-owned companies (e.g., Energoatom for nuclear power and Ukrenergo for the grid) and a few private conglomerates, such as the Donbass Fuel-Energy Company (DTEK). Ukrenergo operates the national grid centrally, which was synchronized with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) grid post-2022. Local generation was minimal, aside from some industrial cogeneration, and municipalities had little role in electricity beyond distribution utilities. As a result, fossil fuels and nuclear energy dominate the energy mix (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralized nature of Ukraine’s energy system has advantages such as economies of scale, better coordination, and reliance on proven technologies. However, it is vulnerable to large-scale disruptions, including grid failures or attacks, which can lead to widespread blackouts. The system also suffers from high transmission losses, as electricity must travel long distances from power plants to users. In addition, the system is inflexible and slow to adapt to changes in demand or new technologies. Building and maintaining them also requires significant investment and high capital costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgV8v3S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Ukraine’s Energy Supply, 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nuclear power currently provides approximately 50 percent of electricity generation and remains a cornerstone of Ukraine’s energy system, policymakers are increasingly emphasizing the need to diversify energy sources and decentralize power generation. The aim is to reduce dependence on a few large facilities, including high-risk nuclear sites, and shift toward a more distributed, resilient mix of renewables, storage, and flexible backup sources. Experts argue that the only way to modernize the system and ensure Ukraine’s long-term survival is to build numerous local power facilities (ranging from 5 to 100 MW) instead of relying on a few large power plants. Post-invasion, there is an opportunity to allow more independent power producers and community-level generation. According to recent studies from the Energy Community and the International Energy Agency, the target energy mix for Ukraine includes adding gas and biomass units, batteries, wind, and solar photovoltaics (PV) over 10 years. If realized, this vision would significantly increase electricity capacity from varied sources by 2035, enhancing the system’s efficiency and sustainability. A more diversified energy portfolio, including fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear power, will be essential to building a more sustainable future for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, nevertheless, nuclear, large-scale hydroelectric, and gas-fired power will remain essential pillars of Ukraine’s base load capacity. While small-scale, distributed generation is crucial for the system’s resilience, it is equally important to recognize the role of centralized energy sources for Ukraine’s energy security. Plans are underway to construct new reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs), to replace aging infrastructure and enhance resilience. Additionally, natural gas-fired power plants provide flexibility to balance the grid, especially during peak demand periods. Biomass and gas-fired generation would be a good addition to renewables, helping to cover evening and wintertime peaks of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-reforms-and-financing&quot;&gt;Energy Reforms and Financing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support a more modern energy system, the Ukrainian government has enacted regulatory reforms, including tax and customs exemptions for importing energy equipment. In June 2024, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers approved a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2025–2030, with investment needs estimated between $41.5 billion and $50 billion. The plan aims to reach 27 percent renewable energy in the final energy consumption by 2030, up from the current 10 percent. The NECP includes adding approximately 10 GW of new renewable capacity and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Shortly after, the government of Ukraine announced a $20 billion plan to achieve these targets—aiming to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation from the current 10 percent to 27 percent by 2030—reflecting both wartime necessity and EU Green Deal alignment. Moreover, in August 2024 the cabinet of ministers approved a Strategy for the Development of Distributed Generation until 2035, aiming to enhance grid resilience through decentralized energy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, to enable local authorities to contribute to the modernization of the energy system, in January 2025 the Ukrainian parliament adopted Law No. 9381, which simplifies regulatory procedures and stimulates investments to build a decentralized and sustainable energy sector. The law’s provisions aim to (i) promote the development of a distributed energy system so that it is more resilient during wartime; (ii) simplify the connection of new power generation capacities, including renewable energy sources; and (iii) increase the transparency and predictability of energy projects. This law also aligns with the European Union’s Ukraine Facility requirement that 20 percent of the funding is directed to the recovery, reconstruction, and modernization of subnational needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop the renewable power sector, Ukraine will require $20 billion in new investments by 2030. Approximately half of that capacity will replace generation destroyed by Russia’s attacks, and the other half will support growth and energy diversification. Notably, these figures assume significant private sector participation. With domestic public finances strained by wartime budget deficits, Ukraine will have to rely on international financial institutions (IFIs) and private investors to supply most of the financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some financing is underway even under wartime conditions (see Box 1). These cases illustrate how donor-backed risk mitigation tools and local financial institutions can jointly scale clean technologies. However, international partners expect Ukraine to implement clear reforms as conditions for renewed investment, such as removing local content requirements that often deter foreign companies from entering the market. Moreover, to attract sufficient financing, investors expect a stable regulatory framework, and unfortunately, Ukraine’s energy policy remains unpredictable. In the late 2010s, a very generous feed-in tariff (FiT) spurred a renewables boom, only to be followed by retroactive FiT cuts and unpaid debts to renewable producers in 2020–2021. This eroded investor confidence. An attempted transition to an auction-based incentive system was delayed for years. When pilot renewable auctions finally took place in late 2024 and 2025, they failed to attract interest. There were no bidders for solar or wind projects, and only one small hydro project secured a contract. The reasons are clear: policy instability, payment arrears, and flawed auction design. Investors have seen the “rules of the game” change repeatedly in Ukraine: FiT rates were cut by the parliament, contracts were not honored in full, and a 2020 mediation memorandum of understanding with renewable associations was not fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In early 2025, OKKO Group (a Ukrainian holding company that owns a large network of gas stations in Ukraine) secured €157 million ($176 million) in international finance through the European Union’s Ukraine Investment Framework (UIF) to develop clean energy projects, demonstrating how blended finance mechanisms under the Ukraine Facility can unlock large-scale private sector involvement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarly, the Ukrainian energy company KNESS secured a €9.6 million ($10.35 million) loan from Oschadbank (also known as the State Savings Bank of Ukraine)—supported by a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) guarantee—to build large battery systems that help stabilize the electricity grid.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Eco-Optima is constructing the Sokal Wind Farm in Lviv Oblast, with €40 million ($43.2 million) in financing from Oschadbank, including a €24.8 million ($28.3 million) green letter of credit facilitated by the EBRD.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Additionally, Energy Trade Group (a Ukrainian private company comprising a conglomerate of businesses specializing in the trading of gas and electricity) is building a 93 MW wind farm in Kirovohrad Oblast, financed with €26 million ($30.6 million) from the large state bank Ukrgasbank, the EBRD, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), utilizing financial instruments such as an EBRD credit risk guarantee.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DTEK Renewables (a Ukrainian company managing the renewable energy assets of DTEK Group) received a €67 million ($76.5 million) loan from a consortium of Ukrainian banks—led by Oschadbank, together with PUMB (First Ukrainian International Bank, a leading bank in Ukraine owned by SCM Holdings) and Ukrgasbank (a leading Ukrainian state owned bank)—to construct five battery energy storage systems (BESS) across Ukraine by 2030. This is the largest domestic infrastructure loan for a BESS project in Ukraine. The project will deliver 180 MW of energy storage capacity in 2025, with a total 200 MW planned—enough to serve 600,000 households.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine needs to pursue a series of comprehensive market reforms and provide insurance mechanisms and guarantees that can reassure investors of the stability and predictability of the renewable energy sector. At the moment, Ukraine is overhauling its renewable energy auction program. In April 2025, the parliament introduced Draft Law No. 13219, proposing a shift from two-way contracts for difference (CfD) to one-way feed-in premiums (FiP), extended auction timelines, and more flexible participation rules. Concurrently, the government approved annual auction quotas for 2025–2029, starting with 330 MW in 2025—including 150 MW for wind—and scaling up to 400 MW by 2029. However, current auction quotas remain modest relative to national targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v25KMpq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: How Auction Quotas Reflect Needed Generation Capacity vs. Transmission System Operator (TSO) Estimates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Table 1, government-approved auction volumes for 2025–2029 will cover only a fraction of Ukraine’s total renewable capacity needs by 2030: 5 percent for solar, 30 percent for wind, and 20 percent for biomass/biogas. This gap will require complementary mechanisms: direct private investments, donor-supported tenders, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with major producers. For instance, Kazakhstan has signed a 25-year PPA with TotalEnergies for the 1 GW Mirny wind project, which includes a 600 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system and is expected to supply electricity to 1 million people. Similarly, Uzbekistan has entered into a 25-year PPA with Voltalia for the 526 MW Artemisya hybrid project, combining solar, wind, and battery storage to meet the electricity needs of approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. These models could offer valuable insights for Ukraine’s renewable energy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond cumbersome regulations, another challenging area affecting energy projects is currency stability and convertibility. Currently, Ukraine has currency controls due to martial law. Investors worry about being unable to repatriate profits in hard currency. Ukraine will need to gradually lift these controls and possibly hedge currency risk. The National Bank of Ukraine, with International Monetary Fund support, could set up a currency swap facility or guarantee that investors can convert a specific amount of hryvnia to dollars or euros at a predictable rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine has introduced tax incentives to bolster renewable energy investments. As of July 27, 2024, the government enacted laws exempting certain energy-generating equipment from import duties and value-added tax (VAT), including PV panels, lithium-ion batteries, inverters, and specific components for wind turbines. However, complete wind turbine units remain subject to VAT and import duties, which may affect the competitiveness of wind energy projects. These exemptions are valid during the period of martial law but are set to expire on January 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final challenge in rebuilding and maintaining the energy system is the availability of a skilled workforce. The war has displaced millions of Ukrainians, including engineers and electricians. For instance, a Ukrainian-American microgrid provider noted that many of the “best electricians left the front lines for safer places,” leading to maintenance issues with backup generators in hospitals. Rebuilding the energy sector will require mobilizing and training a new generation of workers—from construction crews to power system operators. Ukraine’s education and training institutions need to ramp up programs in renewable energy technology, engineering, and project management. Workforce readiness also means ensuring safety and security for personnel working in conflict zones—another reason why many projects focus on relatively safer western and central regions for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, workforce capacity is growing. Ukrainian companies and municipalities have gained experience operating microgrids and modular systems during the war, and many professionals are contributing their expertise remotely. With strategic support, Ukraine can cultivate the human capital needed to operate a modern decentralized grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-subnational-governments&quot;&gt;The Role of Subnational Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Ukrainian cities had little autonomy in energy matters: The system was top-down. But the war has thrust local governments and mayors into a critical role in keeping the lights on and serving as frontline leaders during the energy crisis. Due to the war, they have had to improvise solutions to maintain heating and lighting for local businesses and residents. The wartime experience has demonstrated the huge value of government decentralization, with empowered local authorities responding and targeting resources for communities in need. Mayors have spearheaded installing local generation and backup systems. Local governments are now drafting “resilience plans” that include building renewable energy at municipal facilities, procuring portable generators, and even exploring municipal utilities. The decentralization of political power in Ukraine in recent years has allowed local councils to enter partnerships and pilot projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving a more decentralized and sustainable energy future will undoubtedly require the involvement of subnational governments: regions (oblasts), districts (rayons), and municipalities (hromadas). If the concept of energy cooperatives is fully legalized, it will empower villages or city districts to develop shared energy resources. Ukraine is looking to models from the European Union (like German energy cooperatives) for guidance. The U.S. experience with co-ops and municipal utilities could also be instructive, illustrating how local entities can run parts of the energy system effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayors often serve as vital connectors between national initiatives and local demands. These governments can identify suitable land or rooftops for solar projects, streamline permitting processes, and cofinance initiatives through city budgets. For example, the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine has championed the integration of renewable energy into the city’s district heating system and is actively advancing plans for a municipal waste-to-energy facility. Another example is Mykolaiv—a southern city near the front line—which installed 5.5 MW of its own generation capacity (a mix of diesel gensets, solar PV, and battery storage) to power critical facilities like water pumping stations. The city’s water utility now has solar panels to ensure potable water supply even if the main grid fails. Such projects illustrate how mayors are leveraging decentralized energy sources to provide essential services to their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most Ukrainian municipalities cannot fully fund large energy investments on their own and must attract outside capital. Communities are “open for business” and eager to pilot innovative energy solutions, with donor support. Demand is high at the local level for decentralized solutions—from villages to large cities, there is an appetite to generate their own power if financing can be found. Many Ukrainian cities have concrete clean energy projects with future revenue streams (e.g., selling power to the grid or cutting energy bills for city services) (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, mayors are also promoting transparency and good governance to bolster investor confidence and attract private finance. For example, the city of Mykolaiv, in partnership with the European Union’s Anti-Corruption Initiative, launched a public website to track international aid funds and updated procurement regulations to root out corruption. By improving accountability, cities aim to be “investment-ready” for donor-funded projects and public-private partnerships. As Mayor Oleksandr Syenkevych puts it, “Mykolaiv is ready to be a reliable partner” for energy reconstruction programs. However, there is a need for a national platform to connect cities, investors, and banks—essentially a matchmaking mechanism so that willing cities and private financiers can find each other. This could be as simple as a central project listing database or a more sophisticated endeavor such as an investment facilitation office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic role of mayors goes beyond individual projects: They are important partners in managing and sustaining decentralized energy systems in the long term. A microgrid in a town will likely be operated by the local private utility or the municipality, so local capacity and ownership is critical. By involving mayors in planning and financing discussions now, donors and investors ensure there will be buy-in in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mykolaiv Solar Water Utilities Project: 5 MW solar PV and 1 MWh battery to power the city’s Vodokanal (water pumping and treatment facilities). Status: 1 MW already installed with local funds; in May 2025, the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) approved a €7.2 million ($7.8 million) grant to scale up the project across multiple water infrastructure sites in Mykolaiv. Value: Ensures continuous access to potable water during blackouts by reducing reliance on grid electricity and diesel. The solar-battery combination strengthens climate and war-related resilience for essential services. Long-term cost savings are expected through lower electricity bills and reduced operational risks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vinnytsia Waste-to-Energy Plant: Proposed 10 MW facility aims to convert municipal solid waste into electricity and heat, generating an estimated 80 GWh annually. Status: A feasibility study has already been completed, and the city is currently seeking approximately $30 million in public-private partnership investment. Value: The project would significantly reduce reliance on landfills while delivering around-the-clock energy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Khmelnytskyi region currently hosts multiple operational solar farms, adding up to roughly to 14.9 MW of capacity on city‑owned land. Value: The region is clearly scaling both solar and storage capabilities, and co-locating batteries with PV installations is part of their strategic resilience approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financing-options&quot;&gt;Financing Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond regulatory reforms, the involvement of subnational governments, and investment in workforce capacity, Ukraine will require substantial financial resources to realize its energy vision. This financing gap could be narrowed through a combination of guarantees (such as price floors or insurance), development finance, and innovative partnerships with Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Europe and the United States have been strong partners to Ukraine by providing financial and technical assistance for the restoration of its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks. Europe is further stepping up with the Ukraine Facility, a $56 billion program for 2024–2027 to support recovery. Crucially, at least 20 percent of EU grant funding must go directly to subnational projects—rebuilding regional and local infrastructure, including energy systems. This reflects a recognition that empowering cities and communities is vital for effective reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the World Bank Group and the EBRD are heavily involved in Ukraine’s energy sector recovery. They are considering mechanisms like a “Premium Support Fund” to ensure renewable auction winners get paid, as well as the Electricity Price Guaranteed Fund (EPGF), which is currently under elaboration by the EBRD. The concept of the EPGF is essentially a donor-funded mechanism to guarantee minimum revenue for the power plant. If market electricity prices fall below an agreed minimum (the auction strike price), the fund pays the difference to renewable producers, ensuring revenue stability. If prices are higher, producers keep the majority of the upside, while paying special premium or commission to the fund (i.e., no “reverse payments” back to the state, unlike the current CfD scheme). This EPGF would be initially capitalized by grants from the European Union, IFIs, and others. One entity, perhaps the EBRD, would manage it, providing transparent administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of future U.S. funding to support the energy sector, the Trump administration is in the process of evaluating its foreign assistance priorities and hence aid is currently on hold. This includes winding down the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Energy Security Project and other technical assistance programs in Ukraine. While U.S. foreign aid retrenchment is part of a broader government efficiency agenda, the administration continues to emphasize “energy security” in geopolitical terms—chiefly, reducing dependence on hostile powers and promoting stable energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine’s energy recovery not only undermines Russia’s leverage but also opens avenues for U.S. investment in Ukraine’s critical mineral resources, as evidenced by the recent U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed in May 2025. This agreement provides the United States with preferential access to Ukraine’s valuable natural resources, tying future aid to shared profits from its vast reserves of rare earth minerals, oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons. Such strategic economic partnerships reinforce U.S. interests in the region and contribute to global energy stability. In addition, developing Ukraine’s mining resources will require complementary investments in transport infrastructure and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means U.S. support for Ukraine will favor facilitating private investment and trade (e.g., exporting U.S. liquefied natural gas technology and modular reactors) over direct aid. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which has a mandate to mobilize private capital in challenging environments, could become a key player in Ukraine in the near future. The DFC can provide political risk insurance, project financing, and loan guarantees to U.S. investors and Ukrainian ventures, effectively filling some of the void left by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among a range of financial tools, the DFC has the ability to provide up to $1 billion in insurance and financing support per project. For instance, the DFC could back a political risk insurance facility specifically for Ukraine’s energy sector—covering risks such as war damage, expropriation, or breach of contract. It can also deploy equity stakes in funds or projects, essentially giving a U.S. government seal of approval that can crowd in other investors. It can also guarantee loans made by banks to Ukrainian energy projects, lowering interest rates. One idea is setting up a “Ukraine Clean Energy Fund,” where the DFC and European partners seed a fund that coinvests in dozens of decentralized energy projects alongside private investors. This diversifies risk and provides a one-stop vehicle for investors interested in rebuilding the energy sector under a facility with professional management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, joint U.S.-Ukrainian private sector initiatives can be part of the financing. An urban investment platform can be set up where U.S. and Ukrainian firms form consortia to bid on projects in municipal energy projects. The feasibility of joint investments is high in areas like wind, where Ukrainian developers have experience and U.S. firms have capital and technology. However, it is contingent on risk mitigation: Without guarantees on political risk and a clear signal from the U.S. government (such as a special envoy or task force to promote U.S. investment), many U.S. private investors will remain hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-us-ukraine-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for U.S.-Ukraine Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine rebuilds and transforms its energy system, it can incorporate lessons from the decentralized and flexible approach seen in the United States and the European Union. In the case of the United States, its energy system has evolved since the 1880s, resulting in a diverse and decentralized electricity model in many parts of the country. While the United States also has large power plants, it features robust independent power producers and distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, battery storage, and gas microturbines. Hundreds of microgrids—over 700 as of 2024—operate across the United States, especially for campuses, military bases, and critical facilities, providing resilience during outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key elements of the U.S. model that could inform Ukraine’s future energy system include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Municipal Utilities and Co-ops:&lt;/strong&gt; In the United States, many towns and cities own their electric utilities or are served by rural electric cooperatives, which gives localities influence over generation choices. U.S. municipal utilities (like in Austin, Texas; Sacramento, California; and other cities) have successfully built solar farms, battery projects, and even owned shares in wind farms to serve their cities. Knowledge sharing or twinning programs could help Ukrainian mayors and utility managers adopt best practices in governance and energy planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microgrid Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. companies are global leaders in microgrid controls, battery energy management, and gas engine generators. Collaboration could involve technology transfer—for example, U.S. firms supplying control systems that allow Ukrainian local grids to island, or disconnect, during an attack and then reconnect. The recent example of U.S.-Ukrainian firm New Use Energy delivering solar and battery units to Mykolaiv’s trauma hospital is a case in point. Scaling this up, U.S. providers could partner with Ukrainian firms to deploy hundreds of such microgrids at clinics, water systems, and telecommunications towers across Ukraine. This would directly support the goal of a decentralized grid as called for by the Group of Seven Clean Energy Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Sector Culture:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. energy projects typically rely on private capital with various risk mitigation instruments. Ukraine can emulate models like public-private partnerships for energy infrastructure. For example, a city could concession a solar plant project to a U.S. investor under a long-term agreement where the city agrees to purchase power (a municipal PPA). Such models are standard in the United States (e.g., cities buying solar power from private solar farms to meet renewable goals). To facilitate this in Ukraine, standardized contracts and credit enhancements will be needed (e.g., if a city’s credit is weak, a donor agency could guarantee the payments).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; From smart grid equipment to small modular reactors (SMRs), U.S. companies have technology that Ukraine is interested in. Notably, Ukraine’s NECP mentions exploring hydrogen, energy storage, and SMRs by 2030. U.S. firms like NuScale or Westinghouse (already working with Energoatom on nuclear fuel) could pilot SMR deployment in Ukraine’s context, perhaps at a retired coal plant site. On a smaller scale, U.S. solar and battery manufacturers can find a market as Ukraine rebuilds—this aligns with U.S. industrial policy to support domestic clean technology manufacturing. Facilitating export-import of this equipment, possibly via U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank financing or the DFC, would accelerate Ukraine’s energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy and Market Design Support:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. regulators (such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utility commissions) and grid operators (such as PJM—Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the United States—and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc [ERCOT]) have extensive experience integrating renewables and ensuring grid reliability. Ukrainian energy regulators and the Ministry of Energy can benefit from technical advisory exchanges. For example, learning how U.S. markets handle capacity payments, ancillary services, and demand response could help Ukraine update its electricity market to reward flexibility—a key for balancing renewables. Although Ukraine is already a member of the Energy Community (an organization bringing together the European Union and nine neighboring EU candidate or potential candidate countries to create an integrated regional energy market based on a legally binding framework) and synchronizes with ENTSO-E (the European grid), insights from the United States on how to develop a competitive market (and cautionary lessons from California’s early blackouts or Texas’s 2021 freeze) could also be valuable as Ukraine reimagines its energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Ventures and Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the most impactful collaboration is through joint investment projects, with U.S. investors partnering on municipal energy projects. One example is Vinnytsia’s solar farm proposal: The city has land available and demand for a 50 MW solar farm with battery storage to stabilize its grid. A U.S. investor could team up with a Ukrainian developer under the DFC’s political risk insurance to build it, with power sold under Ukraine’s upcoming auction or a contract with the city. Similarly, waste-to-energy plants in cities like Khmelnytskyi (which has a major nuclear plant and is exploring using nuclear heat for district heating) could use U.S. waste-to-energy tech. These projects could be structured as profit-sharing enterprises where both the U.S. and Ukrainian private sectors invest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, U.S. stakeholders should approach Ukraine’s energy modernization not from the traditional foreign aid lens, but as strategic commercial opportunities. For U.S. energy companies, this is a timely opportunity to enter a new and expanding market, build lasting partnerships, and support democratic allies through economic engagement. Partnering with Ukrainian municipalities offers a chance to deploy innovative technologies in real-world conditions, while contributing to the resilience and recovery of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in Ukraine today lays the foundation for long-term business growth and aligns directly with U.S. interests in energy security and global competitiveness. This dual benefit—advancing national interests while opening new commercial avenues—should appeal to both Washington policymakers and the U.S. private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead: Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s energy future hinges on providing a stable regulatory environment, resolving pending issues and off-taker agreements (i.e., arrangements between producers of renewable energy and their buyers), empowering subnational governments and cities through direct funding and technical aid, and leveraging private sector joint ventures for technology transfer and investment. This final section provides specific policy recommendations to operationalize these solutions, ensuring that Ukraine’s energy transformation moves from planning to implementation, even amid uncertainty. The following are key recommendations for U.S. government agencies, Ukrainian authorities, and international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Ukraine’s Energy Market Reforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine needs to implement energy market reforms, and EU partners—together with the U.S. Department of Energy—can support this process by providing technical assistance, including the following actions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist Ukraine’s energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC), in developing reliable tariff methodologies that ensure cost-recovery for renewables and eliminate payment backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage Ukraine to implement proportional curtailment compensation and priority dispatch for renewables to boost investor trust that their assets will not be arbitrarily shut off without compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist in critical reforms under Chapter 15 (Energy) and Chapter 21 (Trans-European Networks) of the EU Acquis (the EU body of laws), including steps to liberalize energy markets, strengthen independent regulation, modernize and integrate energy networks with Europe, and accelerate the energy transition. Ukraine still needs to implement several energy reforms to align fully with EU standards, related to the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The electricity and gas markets remain only partially liberalized. Wartime interventions, price caps, and a remonopolization of the gas sector under martial law continue to distort competition and hinder a truly open market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NEURC’s autonomy remains limited. Although legal reforms have been enacted, the commission still operates under executive control, and with at least one plotted vacancy and a lack of transparent replacement procedures, it has yet to achieve the independent, EU-compliant regulatory structure required for Chapter 15 alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the renewables sector, Ukraine has introduced market-based support schemes (auctions and feed-in premiums), but these are not yet fully operational. Their proper implementation is crucial to attract investment and settle outstanding debts to renewable energy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine must modernize its electricity grid and expand cross-border interconnections, as wartime damage and inadequate network tariffs have impeded the investments needed for a reliable energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, building up strategic energy reserves remains a priority. While Ukraine adopted an oil stockpiling law in line with EU requirements, implementation is incomplete and minimum reserves are not yet maintained. Similarly, Ukraine must finalize its gas security of supply framework, including legal transposition, emergency planning, and strategic storage targets, to fully comply with EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Engagement in Municipal Energy Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the importance of subnational governments in Ukraine’s energy modernization, donors could engage more directly with city-level projects. For example, they could:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage the EU Ukraine Facility and World Bank to allocate grants or subsidized-interest loans for municipal energy programs, through existing frameworks like the Ukraine Municipal Infrastructure Program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embed technical advisors, such as retired utility executives or engineers, with key cities to help mayors plan and execute energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fund a Project Preparation Facility specifically for energy that helps Ukrainian communities conduct pre-feasibility studies, permitting, and tendering for clean energy projects—creating a pipeline of “bankable” projects ready for auction or direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete a small auction or reverse auction for municipal projects to build confidence for larger ones. For example, solicit bids for 100 MW of biomass and solar and battery storage projects across several city sites, with cofunding from an international donor. Ensure that the contracts are awarded quickly to start construction without major delays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitate Partnerships with Businesses:&lt;/strong&gt; Business associations operating in Ukraine—such as the American Chamber of Commerce Ukraine, the European Business Association, and the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council—could act as conveners and facilitate alliances between U.S., European, and Ukrainian businesses and subnational governments. The activities they could pursue include:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizing trade missions and virtual pitch sessions where Ukrainian municipalities can present projects to U.S. and European companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launching a “U.S.-Ukraine Energy Partnership Exchange” by bringing Ukrainian mayors and energy officials to visit U.S. microgrid sites, while sending U.S. city energy managers to Ukraine, if security permits. These exchanges would build relationships that support technology transfer and twinning arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up an Electricity Price Guarantee Fund:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with allies to create an Electricity Minimum Price Guarantee Fund for Ukraine’s renewable projects. Such a fund could address off-taker risk and unlock several billion dollars in private investment. The European Union or United States could contribute seed funding (e.g., via a DFC-administered fund) to help reach an initial $300 to $500 million target. Managed by a multilateral entity, this fund would guarantee a floor price for power from renewables, ensuring revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand U.S. Financing Options:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should authorize and encourage institutions such as the DFC and the EXIM Bank to deploy their full suite of tools in Ukraine. Specifically, it should:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand DFC’s insurance products covering energy projects. The DFC could also invest in private equity funds that cofinance dozens of renewable and battery installations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include Ukrainian clean energy projects in the remit of the EXIM Bank for export credit support. For example, the EXIM Bank could finance U.S. equipment sales for a solar farm in Ukraine with sovereign or city guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extend the U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund to cover energy infrastructure including grid upgrades, renewables, and storage, which involves minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, and rare earths used in batteries, turbines, and power networks. This would accelerate Ukraine’s EU‑compliant energy transition and support the resilience of U.S. critical raw materials supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Workforce Gaps Through Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Workforce development should be built into every investment by promoting on-site training for Ukrainian technicians and prioritizing the use of local labor. Donors and investors could make skilled worker training a condition of funding—for example, pairing a solar plant project with the training of local electricians. Training not only helps ensure projects are properly staffed and run smoothly, but also strengthens Ukraine’s pool of skilled workers. The United States could support this effort by helping expand Ukrainian vocational programs in fields like solar installation and electrical engineering, potentially through online courses offered by U.S. community colleges or companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up a Monitoring System:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, donors and partners, in collaboration with Ukraine, could establish a strong monitoring system to track progress on reforms and the implementation of energy projects. This system would help identify setbacks early and enable timely adjustments. For instance, if a strategy is not working, such as auctions failing due to war-related risks, stakeholders should be ready to pivot, possibly by adopting negotiated PPAs or increasing donor guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a unique opportunity to transform its energy system into a decentralized, secure, and sustainable model. Such a transition would not only strengthen the resilience of its infrastructure against future Russian threats but also accelerate its integration into the Western energy market, advancing both Ukraine’s energy independence and U.S. strategic and economic interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of evolving geopolitical pressures and rising energy demands, this report from the Energy Security and Climate Change Program explores why integrating the electric grids of Europe and the Mediterranean is essential to European energy security and climate change goals. It examines the drivers of interconnection, such as decarbonization, economic resilience, and digital transformation, and the technical, regulatory, and political challenges to such integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on insights from a high-level convening in Athens, Greece, cohosted by CSIS and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the report examines the Mediterranean region’s role in linking European energy markets to renewable-rich regions in North Africa. Several planned cross-border projects are positioned to not only supply clean energy to Europe, but also to strengthen political cooperation, attract foreign investment, and spur economic development in partner regions. As this report details, grid integration has emerged as a cornerstone of Europe’s long-term energy strategy, helping to respond to climate change, address energy prices, and mitigate strategic vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitics-connectivity-and-energy-security-an-athens-conversation&quot;&gt;Geopolitics, Connectivity, and Energy Security: An Athens Conversation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 31, 2025, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, in collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, hosted a conference in Athens, Greece. Sponsored by the Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC), this meeting was the third in a series of convenings that had begun a year prior in Washington, D.C. But this one came at a precipitous time, as President Donald Trump and his administration were rapidly realigning the foreign policy of the United States and its stance toward Europe. The urgency and uncertainty of the moment forced participants beyond convention and toward a survey of the new ground on which the politics of energy will play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLD ALLIES, NEW RULES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s approach to transatlantic issues has awed European leaders. In February, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference that offered a stinging critique of European political leaders and their approach to domestic and international politics. The Trump administration seemed dedicated to withdrawing security support for Europe to force the bloc to stand up for its own defense. The administration’s haste to reform the transatlantic relationship, alongside its aim to force peace between Russia and Ukraine, felt to many in Europe like abandonment. Trade conflicts added an economic dimension to the perceived antagonism. Liberation Day, which came just two days after this conference, threatened a 20 percent tariff on European goods entering the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens agreed on the urgent need for Europe to establish a strategy for engagement with the United States and chart its own path forward in global affairs. With a rapidly receding United States, they pointed out, European leaders will need to find ways to manage internal strife and political dynamics to focus on essential goals: funding defense, ensuring economic competitiveness, and dealing with the new economic nationalism of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, panelists on either side of this reorientation were optimistic about the prospects for Europe and the transatlantic relationship that will emerge under these new conditions. Panelists observed that pressure from the United States could incentivize Europe into deeper internal collaboration around key areas: security, economic competitiveness, and energy. They also noted that the more independent Europe which emerges could be a larger economic and geopolitical force than the Europe of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think two enduring feature of Trumpism that are not just going to be a feature of this administration, but likely continue going forward is greater transactionalism and more nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think Europe’s going to emerge from this stronger definitely on the security front. And I actually think the pressure from Trump is going to drive a lot of economic reforms in Europe that’s going to make Europe more competitive. So, I’m actually bullish on Europe. I would buy Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Transatlantic relations is going to go through an incredibly rough patch over the next year and I think it’s going to get so bad that we’re not sure that we can repair it. And that involves everything from Greenland to trade, tech fights over Twitter, and troop withdrawals. But I think that Europe comes out of this in some ways stronger and it may be actually beneficial to Europe in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The burden sharing point is an old one. Multiple administrations have brought this to Europe with more or less success. His style is perhaps a little different, but nonetheless the message is not that much different, pay more do more, et cetera.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S.-European relations are tumultuous today, panelists thought it would be a mistake to discount the lasting transatlantic alignment, even as the rules and expectations that may govern it will change. The relationship between the United States and Europe is defined by a shared history and deep economic, social, and cultural integration. Shared U.S.-European interests reveal that working together will yield benefits for both. And the core of the new cooperation could be energy security and innovation, where the two blocs have been aligned and able to cooperate across multiple administrations and presidencies. In the near term, such cooperation will likely require a more pragmatic, project-based, approach—where investments in infrastructure and technology innovation can realize benefits for both the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme in the conversations was how countries in Europe could transform the now three-year energy crisis into an opportunity to establish a comprehensive, long-term, energy framework for the continent. The challenges to doing so are significant. Europeans still pay high prices for energy, and the threat of energy insecurity looms. The costs of investment in energy now must be weighed against the need to invest in economic security and reestablish a defense industrial base. And Europe maintains a legal and political mandate to respond to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists highlighted three key tools for addressing those challenges: policy alignment, innovation, and interconnection. On policy, panelists pointed to the need to align energy strategies at the European level, so that the 27 EU member countries could act together. With more cross-border mechanisms for exchanging energy, Europe can plan to use its resource endowments more efficiently, reducing costs and leveraging technology and markets to develop energy in line with climate goals. With sufficient interconnection, Europe could capture wind or solar when each is most available and reduce the high prices that have plagued smaller markets like those in eastern and southeastern Europe. In adding innovative energy storage technologies and complementary gas infrastructure, Europe can realize a more secure energy sector and economic competitiveness. To execute this will take the same level of coordination and commitment of purpose that Europe displayed after the 2021 energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A European approach to energy will have to extend beyond European borders. The conference’s location in Athens gave panelists the opportunity to explore the ever-changing geopolitical landscape in southeastern Europe and the role the region will play in broader energy and geopolitical events in the coming years. Greece already acts as a connecting point between the Mediterranean and the countries of eastern Europe, providing trade in oil and refined products, access to gas via the ports on the Mediterranean, and exports of plentiful electricity. As renewable capacity in the region increases, Greece also has the capacity to play a key role in the supply of clean electricity into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;policymaker-highlight-nikos-tsafos-deputy-minister-of-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Policymaker Highlight: Nikos Tsafos, Deputy Minister of Energy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The challenge that we face is on the one hand we have a climate pressure, but we also have the pressure of energy costs and competitiveness. And so a big part of our job as policy makers is how do you juggle those different things? Because the more you do in one way, the more difficult it might be to do something else.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The trouble for a country like Greece in thinking about the connectivity with especially essentially North Africa is the scale of North Africa is so much greater than what we can absorb. So if you bring electricity from Egypt and you just bring it to Greece, there’s just too much. So really for us, it’s about refashioning the European network.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interconnections that will link southern Europe to North Africa and the Middle East are already being planned and promoted. These proposed interconnections will serve not just one market, but all of Europe via connections through countries like Greece. In shifting the conversation from supplying Greece to supplying much of Europe, regional and international connections will emphasize the significant political and geopolitical advances that come from deeper power integration. Large interconnections require trust, stability, and security at either end. And they can bring economic opportunity and investment to developing or conflict-damaged societies. By fostering energy partnerships across traditional boundaries, Europe has an opportunity to build more than infrastructure. It can build lasting frameworks for regional cooperation, economic development, and security. Southeastern Europe, and Greece, will be at the heart of this revolution. As Alexandros Paterakis of PPC has observed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Greece is where it is. It’s at the southeastern tip of Europe and it’s in the middle of the crossroads … whether it’s North Africa or Middle East, I think at this point in time there’s no going back. Integration or connectivity as we mentioned before will have to happen at this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION: THE PATH FORWARD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, it has become increasingly evident that the economic frontier is heavily reliant on the expansion of the electricity system. The expansion of data centers to power artificial intelligence (AI) is the most immediate concern, as companies and countries are chasing opportunity in a brand new industry. Speaking of one recent PPC initiative in West Macedonia, Georgios Stassis remarked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We announced just last week the development of a mega data center in the area of West Macedonia, an area where our former mines were located. Initially, our mega data center will have the capacity of 300 megawatts and gradually we’ll move to the level of 1,000 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on, however, is energy demand growth that will come from multiple sources. Improving productivity from AI portends potentially rapid economic growth and energy demand growth to match. Meanwhile, rerouting and reshoring manufacturing supply chains for defense, energy, and other products will accompany electrifying large parts of the economy in putting upward pressure on demand. The very same areas where Europe must invest to meet its economic, geopolitical, and energy priorities will put new demands on electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens emphasized the growing interconnectedness of the digital and energy economies, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Europe. One such opportunity lies in the convergence of these two sectors, which offers numerous avenues for generating efficiencies and new revenue streams, as well as balancing electricity grids with innovative economic activities. Data centers, anticipated to be substantial energy consumers, can contribute to both economic growth and geoeconomic cooperation with the United States, a global leader in this technology. As the infrastructure necessary for developing these data centers and providing them with power and digital infrastructure is constructed, new investment can go to redeveloping industrial areas to the benefit of local communities, countries, and the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-history-of-europes-grid-integration&quot;&gt;The History of Europe’s Grid Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European electricity grid is the largest interconnected transmission network in the world. It is overseen by the European Network of Transmission Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which comprises 40 member transmission system operators (TSOs) representing 36 countries (Figure 1). This integration originated across eight western European countries and was initially called the Union for the Coordination of Production and Transmission of Electricity (UCPTE). It arose out of the Marshall Plan, and its purpose was to ensure the most effective use of the limited energy resources remaining after the severe destruction of European infrastructure during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UCPTE expanded to include additional western European countries throughout the 1980s, both political and technical constraints limited further west–east synchronous interconnection until 1995, when UCPTE integrated with the CENTREL group of power utilities comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and, Slovakia. Further expansion to North Africa was realized in 1998 when a submarine cable was completed between Morocco and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current iteration of ENTSO-E was established in 2008 as part of a cooperative commitment acknowledging the intensive coordination needed between transmission operators, generators, legislators, regulators, researchers, and other stakeholders to meet the European Union’s newly announced “20-20-20” targets (20 percent decarbonization, 20 percent increase in share of renewable energy sources, and 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, ENTSO-E spans over 550,000 kilometers of circuits comprising alternating current (AC) lines and cables and direct current (DC) cables. Cross-border exchanges within ENTSO-E member countries totaled almost 420 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023, while exchanges between ENTSO-E member countries and external countries totaled 18 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-vision-for-an-interconnected-mediterranean-grid&quot;&gt;A Vision for an Interconnected Mediterranean Grid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, 14 TSOs from 12 countries established the Association of the Mediterranean Transmission System Operators for electricity (Med-TSO) to use multilateral collaboration to facilitate the integration of the Mediterranean power systems and to foster security and socioeconomic development in the region. Today, it has expanded to include 20 TSOs from 20 Mediterranean countries (Figure 2), some of which are also ENTSO-E member countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has supported several of the recently completed and proposed future projects in the Med-TSO, in recognition of their benefits for energy security, renewable energy integration, and political and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-further-integration&quot;&gt;The Case for Further Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-resources&quot;&gt;Renewable Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean region has untapped potential for deploying renewable energy sources. Harnessing these resources is essential both to decarbonize the Mediterranean region—where fossil fuels make up 65 percent of the energy mix in northern states and 92 percent in the south—and to generate clean electricity and hydrogen to export to the European Union to help meet Europe’s climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s “Fit for 55” laws obligate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and require the European Union to be climate neutral by 2050. Among other provisions, Fit for 55 includes a revised renewable energy directive that increases the EU-level target of renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix from at least 32 percent to at least 40 percent by 2030. Additionally, Fit for 55 includes a hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package that aims to shift to 66 percent of natural gas demand being met by renewable and low-carbon gases, up from 5 percent today. To meet both of these targets, the European Union will have to rely on imported electricity and fuels from the Mediterranean region, where there is high renewable potential (Figure 4 and Figure 5) and a relatively high degree of available land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries in the southern Mediterranean region have ambition to expand renewable capacity, in part to mitigate climate impacts in the vulnerable region and in part to take advantage of opportunities to meet Europe’s clean energy demand. For example, Tunisia and Morocco have signed the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. The region has also supported the Pan-Arab Sustainable Energy Strategy 2030, which aims to reach 12.4 percent renewable energy share in the Arab region’s electricity mix. Furthermore, several of the countries in this region have submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with renewable energy targets as part of the Paris Agreement (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping to meet climate goals, grid integration between Europe and the Mediterranean will help reduce reliance on volatile natural gas markets and allow for more cost-effective integration of renewable resources with higher capacity factors in North Africa than in many parts of Europe. Additionally, interconnected grids facilitate price convergence across the connected regions, which will be economically favorable to countries with isolated grids and high costs of electricity, such as Cyprus. Grid integration also disadvantages countries with low electricity costs by causing local electricity prices to increase, although generally larger integrated markets are likely to drive innovation and efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Mediterranean region, integrating with Europe will allow for new export opportunities for green electricity and hydrogen, which will diversify and expand the economy while reducing dependence on traditional fossil fuel exports. Additionally, interconnection projects and associated infrastructure and supply chain development create jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and related services. Import demand from Europe also de-risks renewable energy projects, which can further attract foreign investment into the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-reliability-and-resilience&quot;&gt;Security, Reliability, and Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advantages of cross-border interconnections is the enhanced reliability of electricity supply; power outages are reduced, as failures of a generating unit can be immediately compensated for by neighboring systems. Integrated grids allow for easier ability to control frequency stability and voltage levels, as the total system can be controlled without each separate system having to maintain its own frequency. In an integrated setup, the total reserve capacity only needs to match the highest single-system loss, instead of each grid holding enough reserves to cover its own worst-case scenario. This is because power imbalances in one area can be offset by adjustments in generation or load elsewhere within the interconnected network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, longer-term reliability and resilience against both natural disasters and geopolitical tensions are strengthened by grid integration. A greater diversity of primary energy sources and more spatially dispersed generators contribute to greater supply security. For example, if one area is impacted by an extreme event that causes power disruptions, a geographically expansive network allows for the loss of generation to be supplemented by plants in other regions not impacted by the event. This will become especially important as the Mediterranean region increasingly experiences extreme heat and precipitation events exacerbated by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-and-planned-integrations&quot;&gt;Recent and Planned Integrations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting energy systems is of great strategic importance. Europe is a leader in this field, with close to 12 percent of member states’ electricity consumption coming from a neighboring country. The EU target is to reach a cross-border capacity ratio of least 15 percent by 2030. Most recently, in 2022 Ukraine and Moldova’s grids were connected and synchronized; while this connection had already been planned for 2024, the project was expedited in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In February 2025, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania successfully disconnected from the Russian-controlled BRELL energy system and synchronized their electricity grids with Europe to strengthen their geopolitical position and boost long-term energy security and competitiveness. The synchronization initiative received over 1.2 billion euros in grants from the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further European grid expansion will primarily come in the form of new long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, primarily subsea cables. To meet the stated interconnection target while simultaneously meeting EU climate targets, many of these interconnections must link the European grid to Mediterranean countries with abundant renewable energy potential. The only current interconnection between Europe and North Africa is between Spain and Morocco, consisting of two cables with an expansion expected by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Med-TSO published a masterplan in 2022 that proposes 19 interconnection projects across five envisioned corridors (Figure 6):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western Mediterranean Corridor (Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central Mediterranean Corridor and North Africa Backbone (Algeria, Egypt, Italy, Libya, Tunisia)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;East Mediterranean Interconnectors (Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern Balkan Corridor (Bulgaria, Italy, Greece, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Middle East Mediterranean Integration (Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of interconnections is estimated to span about 10,000 kilometers of new transmission lines, allowing for almost 20 GW of new transfer capacity among Mediterranean countries. The flexibility from these interconnections is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 24 metric tons (MT) per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TzMXUrB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-projects-planned-by-2030&quot;&gt;Integration Projects Planned by 2030&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the expansion of the Spain–Morocco interconnection, the planned projects anticipated to be completed by 2030 include the GREGY interconnection (linking Europe to Egypt), the Great Sea Interconnector (linking Europe to Israel), and the ELMED project (connecting Italy and Tunisia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GREGY: CLEAN ENERGY FROM EGYPT TO GREECE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GREGY is a proposed project to link Egypt to Europe via Greece by a 3,000-megawatt (MW) submarine cable spanning almost 1,000 kilometers. Once completed, the cable would carry renewable energy generated in Egypt and is estimated to displace 4.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of natural gas consumption, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 10 million MT annually. Approximately one third of the renewable electricity from Egypt would be used by Greece directly, while another third is anticipated to be used by Greece as input to produce low-carbon fuels; the final third will likely be transferred to other European countries. At an estimated cost of 4.2 billion euros, developers seek a final investment decision by the end of 2025 and to be fully operational by 2030. While not yet fully financed or green-lit, the project has already been included in the European Union’s Global Gateway initiative focused on mobilizing investments to promote sustainable infrastructure development in partner countries. GREGY is also under consideration as a European Commission project of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GREAT SEA INTERCONNECTOR: CONNECTING GREECE, CYPRUS, AND ISRAEL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction on the Great Sea Interconnector subsea cable between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel (formerly called the EuroAsia Interconnector) began in December 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost of 2 billion euros. A grant of almost 660 million euros has been promised by the European Union toward the section connecting Cyprus with Crete. The two-way high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line will span over 1,200 kilometers at a depth of over 3,000 meters to deliver 2 GW of energy to Europe, supplying electricity to over 3 million homes. The idea of connecting the power grids between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel has been discussed for over a decade, primarily to mitigate energy security risks for Cyprus and Israel, which currently each operate under isolated grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELMED: CONNECTING ITALY AND TUNISIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ELMED project would span almost 225 kilometers, 200 of which would be offshore at a depth of 800 meters. The interconnection is anticipated to reduce generation costs and renewable curtailment in Italy in the near term and allow Tunisia to export renewable energy to Europe in the long term. Studies have also shown that the interconnection would contribute to increased energy security and improved resilience of the Tunisian power system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financing-europeanmediterranean-interconnection-projects&quot;&gt;Financing European–Mediterranean Interconnection Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While specific project costs vary depending on the length of the interconnection and the depth of the subsea cables, cost estimates for electricity grid projects connecting Europe to the Mediterranean are on the order of billions of euros. Commercial loans and equity investments are important funding mechanisms for electricity grid interconnection projects, but such large projects may also require government support. A range of financing mechanisms have been leveraged to raise capital from public sources, demonstrating the potential benefits of developing such infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU FUNDING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Connecting Europe Facility for Energy is the main source of EU funding for energy interconnection projects. The European Union has allocated over 5.8 billion euros to the energy sector between 2021 and 2027 for projects that help the transition toward clean energy, with a focus on cross-border renewable energy projects, interoperability of networks, and better integration of the internal energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union introduced a temporary instrument in 2021 called the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which designates over 180 billion euros for clean energy projects that help EU countries make critical reforms and investments needed to rapidly end their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. It also channels funding for the implementation of the REPowerEU plan to accelerate the clean energy transition and boost EU competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a role in cross-border infrastructure projects. The EIB provided loans totaling 3.5 billion euros for cross-border electricity infrastructure from 2010 to 2022, covering 40 percent of these projects’ total investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) provides financing for transmission projects that support energy market interconnection and promote further regional integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The African Development Bank (AfDB) invests in infrastructure projects to support economic development and regional integration, which includes financing electricity interconnection projects between North Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has historically been an important source of financing for some large-scale interconnection projects in Europe, and especially Ukraine. It also invests in strategically important projects. In 2024, the DFC submitted a letter of intent to support the Great Sea Interconnector project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Bank has supported energy infrastructure projects intended to expand regional integration. In 2023, the World Bank approved almost 270 million dollars in financing for the ELMED interconnector and support for Tunisia’s renewable energy trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-regulatory-and-market-barriers&quot;&gt;Legal, Regulatory, and Market Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant barriers to cross-border grid integration between Europe and the southern and eastern Mediterranean is navigating the different regulatory environments. Common market rules are needed to ensure fair competition, transparent and non-discriminatory network tariffs, proper cross-border trade mechanisms, congestion management, and capacity allocation mechanisms. The more market designs and rules between countries or regions differ, the more likely it is that trade is impeded or distorted between markets. Harmonizing or otherwise adjudicating electricity market regulations, standards, and energy policies is therefore a prerequisite for cross-border interconnection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has largely already unified under a common regulatory structure facilitated by the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which works toward developing common market rules and coordinating actions of national regulators. The EU electricity market is liberalized and predominately operates on a marginal pricing model. In contrast, the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries generally operate under less competitive markets and more vertically integrated utilities. In recognition of the importance of integration, the Association of Mediterranean Energy Regulators (MEDREG) is promoting harmonization of electricity markets and regulations across the region by bringing together regulators across 22 countries, but full harmonization will require drastic changes in the regulatory framework, market procedures, technical rules, and administrative measures. In the meantime, differences in markets and rules continue to present challenges to cross-regional grid integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-constraints&quot;&gt;Technical Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While several examples of successful electricity interconnections via subsea cables exist, it continues to be a technically complex undertaking. The subsea cable routes must be carefully surveyed to ensure the long-term security and stability of the cable and avoid any obstacles during construction. Additionally, laying the cables requires specialized vessels to install the cables at great depths and under high pressure. The cables themselves must be carefully engineered with advanced materials to withstand the harsh conditions and mitigate energy losses, mechanical stress, and risk of failure. Beyond the cables themselves, converting between the HVDC lines and AC grids requires complex power electronics and control systems. If the HVDC line is connecting to asynchronous grids, it must actively manage the power flow. Careful protection schemes and coordination mechanisms are also needed to account for the differences in characteristics between AC and DC lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;realizing-strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;Realizing Strategic Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the things that Europe needs to do with its energy policy within the context of transatlantic relations is identify initiatives that have bipartisan American support.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-gabriel-mitchell-policy-fellow-at-the-mitvim-institute&quot;&gt;– Gabriel Mitchell, Policy Fellow at the Mitvim Institute&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean energy interconnections solve multiple European challenges at once: They enhance security, build resilience, and make energy more affordable in markets hungry for clean power. These connections form the backbone of Europe’s energy security strategy in an increasingly competitive global landscape. For Mediterranean nations on both shores, these projects transform geographic location into strategic advantage, placing them at the center of emerging energy geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s energy crisis taught its leaders a painful lesson: Depending on a single supplier creates dangerous vulnerability. Now, as Europe builds a more determined energy strategy—one that delivers clean power at affordable prices—expanded interconnections offer a twofold benefit. They improve energy resilience while weakening Russia’s ability to weaponize its resources against European interests. This approach aligns perfectly with the United States’ long-standing goal of European energy independence, a policy that serves both economic and strategic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As leaders in Europe and the United States rethink transatlantic relations, European leaders must identify energy projects that can win U.S. support and engage regional powers. For the United States, supporting Europe’s energy independence through these interconnections makes perfect sense. Such infrastructure investments advance multiple American strategic interests: They can help countries recover from conflict, add to energy abundance and security in Europe, and promote economic development in the Middle East and North Africa. These aren’t merely power lines and pipelines—they’re pathways to stability, prosperity, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As generative AI technologies rapidly evolve, their implications for global information security are becoming more acute. This paper explores how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are discussing, conceptualising and framing AI within their online communications. Drawing on original analysis of communications from Russian-linked online channels, the paper investigates how actors in the Russian influence ecosystem perceive the role of AI in information warfare and what their narratives reveal about evolving threat trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that a diverse range of Russian actors are actively engaged in conversations about AI. These actors are not only discussing the use of AI tools to automate and amplify content, but also exploring the role of AI as a narrative device, boasting of its effectiveness, warning of its dangers and framing it as both a strategic asset and a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals a growing focus on AI as both an opportunity and a threat among various Russian actors, from those affiliated with groups like Wagner, to pro-Russian hacktivist collectives and online influencers. AI is often portrayed as a powerful tool for information manipulation, capable of generating persuasive content, amplifying messaging and overwhelming adversaries with sheer volume. At the same time, many actors express significant anxiety about Western dominance over AI development, suggesting that these technologies could be used to subvert Russian public opinion, erode autonomy and destabilise the domestic information environment. Concerns about surveillance, deepfakes (digitally altered videos or images aiming to misrepresent a person as doing or saying something they did not say or do in the original version of the image or video) and algorithmic bias feature prominently in this discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observed conversations are not confined to abstract speculation. The paper documents how state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are actively debating the implications of AI, sharing practical knowledge, critiquing disinformation practices and recruiting individuals with relevant technical skills. These insights point to an evolving culture of adaptation within Russian influence networks, where AI is increasingly seen as a central component of future-facing information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper does not assess the inner workings of senior intelligence planning, it offers a unique actor-level perspective on how AI is entering the strategic imagination of Russian influence networks. These insights highlight the importance of not only tracking how AI might be operationalised in future disinformation efforts, but also understanding the ways in which it is already shaping how these actors think, communicate and position themselves within digital ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of generative AI has raised widespread concern over the potential exploitation of AI by malicious actors to disrupt information ecosystems. While early warnings about AI-generated disinformation primarily focused on its theoretical risks, recent evidence suggests that a range of actors are already incorporating these technologies into their influence operations. Understanding how such actors perceive, experiment with and deploy generative AI is essential to anticipating future threats and designing effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is particularly pressing in the context of Russian information operations. The Russian government has long prioritised information warfare as a central element of statecraft, viewing the information domain as a theatre of conflict on par with conventional or nuclear warfare. Disinformation actors affiliated with the Russian state are thought to have invested heavily in AI technologies to influence European audiences in the run-up to the 2024 European Parliament elections. As generative AI becomes more accessible and more powerful, it lowers the barrier to entry for a wider ecosystem of pro-Russian actors, including state-linked media, hacktivists and online influencers, to experiment with and operationalise these tools in increasingly sophisticated ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severity of this threat, understanding of disinformation and influence operations carried out by Russian state-affiliated actors remains limited. Current discussions focus on outputs, with less attention to how Russian-affiliated actors perceive or discuss the role of AI in influence campaigns. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups – including state-linked social media groups and channels, hacktivist collectives, military-affiliated groups and online influencers – are discussing AI. The paper considers how AI might be a beneficial tool in their arsenal or supplement their existing techniques, tactics and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper generates new insight into Russian disinformation and influence activities by scoping and analysing the online communications channels and information ecosystems of these actors and groups. In doing so, it analyses how actors within these spaces discuss AI, including their perceptions, understandings and knowledge of how this technology is currently used, and could be used for propaganda purposes. The paper presents a unique perspective on the current and future practices of Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned groups and their attempts to influence and polarise audiences and public opinions, with a particular focus on Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is situated within a growing body of literature that explores AI-enabled influence operations, while offering a more actor-centric perspective. Rather than treating Russian disinformation as a monolithic, state-directed enterprise, the paper highlights the heterogeneity of actors involved and the diverse, and sometimes contradictory, ways in which they engage with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper focuses on tactical and mid-level actors, it does not attempt to map the strategic or doctrinal thinking of the intelligence managers or decision-makers responsible for designing operations at the highest levels. Such insights are beyond the scope of open-source social media monitoring. Instead, the report contributes to a more granular understanding of how AI is being perceived, discussed and operationalised by those within the broader Russian influence ecosystem, and how these evolving practices reflect emerging threats at the operational and narrative level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper employs a qualitative research design to explore how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups discuss and deploy generative AI in the context of influence operations. The analysis draws primarily on data collected through ExTrac AI’s state-of-the-art AI-powered platform. ExTrac AI enables the automatic collection, refinement and analysis of data and multimedia materials from tens of thousands of hard-to-reach but publicly available sources daily, including communications ecosystems associated with disinformation actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was carried out in three phases, starting with a scoping phase to identify key actors, channels and keywords related to AI and disinformation. Using ExTrac AI’s search capabilities, relevant channels were selected based on existing research on Russian influence operations, prior tagging on the platform, and results from initial keyword searches. Keywords included terms in both Russian and English. This stage provided an initial mapping of the online ecosystem of actors engaging with AI and set the foundation for subsequent analytical stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, content analysis was conducted across a broader dataset, including searches over different time periods and across multiple groups. The terms and themes identified in the scoping phase were used to assess the prevalence and scope of AI-related discourse. Posts were examined to evaluate the degree of interest in AI, the level of technical or operational knowledge demonstrated and the types of narratives emerging around the use of AI for disinformation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on insights from the initial analysis, specific case studies were then selected for further in-depth examination. These case studies focused on particular actors (such as Wagner-affiliated channels and hacktivist groups like NoName057(16)) and explored how AI was discussed and applied within their disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these three stages provided a structured and iterative approach to understanding the perceptions, use cases and strategic considerations of AI within Russian-aligned disinformation networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategic-thinking-on-information-warfare-and-ai&quot;&gt;RUSSIAN STRATEGIC THINKING ON INFORMATION WARFARE AND AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess current and emerging disinformation threats, it is essential to understand how Russian state and military doctrine conceptualises information warfare, and how AI fits within this strategic framework. This section outlines: the foundations of Russian thinking on information confrontation and AI; actors active in this space; and operational practices integrating AI into disinformation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-foundations-of-russian-information-warfare&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS OF RUSSIAN INFORMATION WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia, information warfare, or “information confrontation” as it is known in Russian doctrine, holds strategic importance which is equivalent to conventional and nuclear warfare, even in peacetime. The information domain is treated as integral to national security and geopolitical influence. While Russia rarely acknowledges cyber operations against Western targets, it also avoids directly denying them, using plausible deniability as a strategic asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian information strategy prioritises intelligence collection, often through espionage or cyber intrusion, alongside information-psychological influence targeting individuals and mass audiences. This dual focus enables the systematic collection of data while also strengthening efforts to shape political discourse and decision-making domestically and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation campaigns aim to undermine adversaries by exacerbating internal divisions, eroding trust in democratic institutions, and weakening alliances such as NATO or the EU. This complicates unified responses to Russian actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of these campaigns are under-resourced and disorganised, social media platforms allow for low-cost, large-scale experimentation without significant consequence for failed attempts. Trial and error approaches carry little risk, and the volume of content often matters more than precision. Ironically, Western media portrayals of Russian cyber capabilities may amplify their perceived effectiveness, reinforcing Moscow’s intended image as a highly sophisticated cyber power, and thereby amplifying the perceived threat even when the operational impact is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian disinformation ecosystem is diverse, encompassing official state entities, state-funded media outlets, proxy organisations, ideologically-driven individuals and commercially-motivated journalists and bloggers. Some operate within formal command structures, while others emerge organically, driven by personal initiative but aligning with perceived Kremlin goals. This decentralised approach provides the Russian state plausible deniability while enabling tailored and flexible messaging that resonates with different audiences without the need for a unified narrative, as would be the case with clearly attributed government communications. A clear example of this decentralised model is evident in Wagner’s information operations in Africa, where the group intentionally outsourced its messaging to local activists, journalists and online influencers. These actors are often not directly controlled by Wagner but align with it ideologically or are incentivised to support its narratives. These actors allow Wagner to avoid overt branding while achieving narrative resonance, political deniability and operational cost-effectiveness in contested media environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the state level, Russian intelligence agencies, particularly Russia’s military intelligence service (GRU), play a central role in orchestrating cyber-enabled influence operations. Two of the GRU’s most prominent cyber-focused units, 26165 and 74455, commonly referred to in Western cybersecurity reporting as APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), are implicated in cyber and information operations against foreign targets, including election interference, strategic hacking campaigns and social media influence operations. While these advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) conduct technical operations like intrusions or data theft, they rarely serve as the public face of Russian cyber activity. Instead, hacktivist groups often act as intermediaries, repackaging and disseminating information obtained by APTs to obscure attribution. Factors such as the timing of leaks, shared technical infrastructure, and instances where hacktivist groups claim responsibility for an operation before it has been publicly attributed to an APT often suggest coordination. This interplay allows the Russian state to expand influence while diffusing risk and complicating attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, proxy media outlets such as Strategic Culture Foundation, Global Research, New Eastern Outlook, News Front, SouthFront, Katehon and Geopolitica.ru function as multipliers of Russia’s narratives abroad. They extend Russia’s messaging reach abroad by reproducing and legitimising disinformation narratives without requiring direct Kremlin oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-as-an-enabler-of-disinformation&quot;&gt;AI AS AN ENABLER OF DISINFORMATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has identified AI as a strategic domain. Russia’s 2019 national strategy for the development of AI committed the country to global leadership in AI by 2030. Russian officials frame AI as both an opportunity and a threat. Officials express concern that Western AI tools could manipulate Russian public opinion, introduce ideological bias, or even catalyse regime change. These concerns reinforce Russia’s belief in AI’s capacity to enable cognitive manipulation and encourage internal destabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin has prioritised a sovereign AI ecosystem, coordinated by the National Centre for AI Development. State-owned enterprises, such as Sberbank and Rostec, dominate the field. Sberbank’s GigaChat platform, which is presented as Russia’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is a flagship initiative, serving as both a technological benchmark and an instrument for state AI policy – with Sberbank being tasked with implementing Russia’s AI roadmap and the national strategy for the development of AI. Rostec focuses on defence applications, while Yandex (creator of YandexGPT) – despite its leading AI capabilities – plays a secondary role due to its complicated relationship with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is already being integrated into Russian disinformation operations. Automated tools generate fake articles, social media posts, images and deepfakes. Operations like the “DoppelGänger” campaign, in which AI-generated articles mimicked legitimate Western news outlets, illustrate how these tactics aim to erode trust and sow confusion at scale. AI-powered bots and automated social media accounts help amplify disinformation, saturate public discourse and simulate grassroots sentiment – a tactic known as “astroturfing”. In some cases, fake conversations between bots are staged to simulate debate and mislead third-party observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian actors are also exploring large language model (LLM) grooming: injecting of propaganda or biased material into training data to influence the outputs of LLMs. Designed to skew the outputs of LLMs, this tactic represents a shift from targeting audiences directly to subtly shaping the tools these audiences use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the use of generative AI in disinformation is still evolving, it is increasingly seen by Russian actors as a force multiplier, automating content production, overwhelming adversaries and further blurring the boundary between truth and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-ai-related-discourse-in-russian-influence-networks&quot;&gt;MAPPING AI-RELATED DISCOURSE IN RUSSIAN INFLUENCE NETWORKS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section draws on primary data gathered through the ExTrac AI platform to examine how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors discuss, conceptualise and operationalise generative AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;knowledge-of-and-familiarity-with-ai-tools&quot;&gt;KNOWLEDGE OF AND FAMILIARITY WITH AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the discussions under review reveals a strong and growing interest among Russian actors in the capabilities of AI, particularly as a tool in disinformation campaigns and broader strategic communication. While much of the discourse references the military applications of AI, especially the integration of AI with drone operations, there are frequent and direct acknowledgements of its value for information operations and manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous Telegram channels express pride in sophisticated Russian information operations, explicitly citing the use of AI-driven tools. Some channels even frame AI as central to training a new generation of cyber operatives, which reflects their intent to further establish and institutionalise AI within the disinformation apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these actors also mock and ridicule Western media coverage of Russian AI-driven interference. For example, in response to Western media reports accusing Russian actors of running German-language influence campaigns, some posts sarcastically questioned who in Russia could possibly speak German well enough to do so, humorously implying direct involvement of Vladimir Putin himself, given his German language skills. Actors dismiss reports from German or other European news outlets about Russian cyber and AI-driven influence operations as exaggerated or fabricated, portraying these accusations as attempts by Western governments to deflect attention from domestic political failures. Such derisive dismissals aim to undermine the credibility of Western reports while reinforcing an internal narrative that Russia’s influence operations effectively unsettle Western governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, alongside bravado and dismissiveness, the observed discussions also reveal a certain level of underlying distrust and paranoia about AI technologies. A range of concerns were expressed, from existential anxieties about the future capabilities of AI to practical fears about the immediate implications of AI technologies. For instance, posts expressed anxieties regarding the ability of AI to rapidly and convincingly reproduce human personalities, seeing this as a dystopian threat capable of gradually replacing humans altogether. Another fear expressed involves the potential creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI), with actors describing scenarios in which routine human activities are rapidly replaced by AI agents and predicting that AI systems will achieve human-level intelligence, eventually culminating in an entirely AI-controlled society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other concerns are more immediate and pragmatic. For example, the inclusion of the former US NSA director, Paul Nakasone, on OpenAI’s board was widely interpreted as proof of the ongoing militarisation of AI. Actors suggested that all interactions with OpenAI systems could now (potentially) be subject to surveillance and exploitation by US military intelligence. These narratives demonstrate both familiarity with ongoing AI developments in the West and heightened anxiety about losing control over these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Ukraine is often framed by channels as a testing ground for AI-enabled psychological influence operations, mass surveillance and propaganda by Western intelligence agencies. For example, channels point to supposedly AI-generated intercepted communications between Russian soldiers and their relatives, deepfake videos falsely attributed to Russian officials, and manipulative social media campaigns, arguing that these represent coordinated psychological operations designed to weaken Russian resolve and morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, specific examples like the DoppelGänger campaign are framed ambiguously, with some channels insisting such campaigns represent false flags orchestrated by Western intelligence in collaboration with Russian opposition figures, thus reinforcing narratives of victimhood and external aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such concerns have led Russian-aligned actors to call explicitly for improved information literacy among the Russian public. Frequent warnings are posted urging vigilance against perceived Western deepfake operations and manipulative content. Channels regularly publish reminders for followers to verify information rigorously, while remaining sceptical of unofficial sources and relying primarily on state-sanctioned media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framing-and-function-of-ai-tools&quot;&gt;FRAMING AND FUNCTION OF AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the online communities under review, AI tools are framed as essential components in an intensifying information conflict. Telegram channels present AI as not only a technological innovation but a civic duty, encouraging skilled individuals to contribute to national efforts. Recruitment calls often target AI-literate users to contribute their skills to the groups’ goals, in line with Russia’s perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one Telegram channel actively recruits contributors with experience in generative AI tools, stating: “Are you a neural network artist? [Redacted: name of channel] needs you! Our team is developing and the number of tasks is growing every month. We are looking for artists already working with Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111+ControlNet) and Midjourney … who understand the principles of industrial engineering and can control generation rather than rely on luck.” Similarly, another recruitment message from the same channel details its broad range of desirable recruits, including “neuroevangelists and text generation specialists”, emphasising that the project’s activities extend beyond graphics into sophisticated textual manipulation and generation. The channel describes its project as fundamentally reliant on human capital – including talented analysts, informants, and digital intelligence enthusiasts – highlighting collaborative “brainstorming” and diverse expertise spanning geospatial intelligence and open-source intelligence. The channel actively appeals to individuals who can navigate complex international information environments and generate persuasive narratives which are supportive of Russian military and geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central topic in the observed discourse is the centrality of the information war as a part of contemporary conflict and national security. For instance, promotional materials for the “Army-2024” Forum’s roundtable emphasised the importance of understanding how advanced digital technologies, including AI, can shape societal perceptions in the context of Russia’s “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Telegram channels frame AI tools as instrumental resources for safeguarding Russia’s digital space against external threats. For example, one channel under review describes itself as a community of “highly qualified specialists in cybersecurity, information technology, and social research”, dedicated explicitly to “neutralising threats, disinformation, and propaganda”. These discussions portray AI as a tool of not only offence but also defence, used to identify, counter and neutralise foreign influence operations allegedly targeting Russian society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;perceived-limitations-and-barriers&quot;&gt;PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS AND BARRIERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant enthusiasm surrounding the strategic integration of AI into information warfare, the monitored online communities also expressed substantial criticism and frustration regarding the limitations of Russia’s domestic AI platforms, primarily Sberbank’s GigaChat and YandexGPT. These criticisms reflect broader anxieties about technological autonomy, ideological biases and operational constraints, as well as suspicions regarding the political loyalties of major Russian tech firms (particularly Yandex). A recurring critique is that these models reflect liberal or “unpatriotic” biases. For instance, Sber GigaChat has been accused by users of showing favourable attitudes toward figures such as Lenin and Trotsky; one post complained that the platform “cannot condemn their betrayal of Russia and the Red Terror”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning for these actors is the platforms’ handling of politically sensitive topics, especially those involving Russian territorial claims. YandexGPT and Sber GigaChat have both faced accusations of failing to confirm that Crimea and the recently annexed “new regions” are part of Russia. Posts shared anecdotes in which the AI would either avoid such questions or suggest changing the topic, which was interpreted by users as evasive and subversive. One user sarcastically noted that “Sber GigaChat is starting to freeze even when asked questions like ‘which regions by the sea would Russians like to move to’ (because Crimea is on the list)”. While later Telegram discussions noted an improvement, highlighting that “Gigachat already cheerfully answers that Crimea and Sevastopol have become part of Russia”, Yandex continues to be accused of intentionally misrepresenting sensitive facts about Ukraine as well as misrepresenting historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reluctance to reproduce state-endorsed positions and narratives has led to accusations that platforms like YandexGPT are either deliberately undermining Russia or are bound to foreign interests – a matter that users think should be escalated to the level of Russia’s Security Council for intervention. As one Telegram post stated: “Yandex GPT and Alisa still cannot be forced to confirm the constitutional norm about Russian Crimea … Russian developers are not so Russian, and the enemy who is waging the main – mental – war with us is not outside, but inside our country”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other domestic platforms have faced similar allegations. Megafon’s chatbot, for instance, was criticised for classifying Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as Ukrainian territories, allegedly because the underlying AI architecture relies on foreign-developed technologies such as Midjourney and GPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ideological concerns, practical limitations possessed by Russian tools, when compared to Western tools such as ChatGPT, were another major source of frustration discussed in the observed channels. Users complained that Russian services were less responsive, provided inferior responses or declined to address neutral and factual questions that similar Western tools would answer. One post elaborated, saying, “let’s take YandexGPT … this prototype of AI is a terrible coward and does not answer quite ordinary questions … On the one hand, this greatly undermines trust in Yandex and its products. On the other hand, it gives grounds not only to recognize Yandex’s services as incomplete, but even [to recognise] the current managers … as foreign agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perceived shortcomings undermine Russia’s stated goals of achieving digital and technological sovereignty. Ironically, pro-Russian actors’ dissatisfaction with domestic AI has led to a continued preference for Western tools, which undermines the Kremlin’s narrative of building a successful autonomous and ideologically-aligned AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;CASE STUDIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand how these discussions around AI translate into practical influence operations, this section presents an analysis of two key actor groups: Wagner-affiliated channels and Russian state-aligned hacktivist collectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wagner-affiliated-channels&quot;&gt;WAGNER-AFFILIATED CHANNELS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner, the Russian state-funded private military company known for its roles in Ukraine, including its early involvement in the Donbas war, its recruitment of prison inmates, and its central role in the Battle of Bakhmut, has also supported authoritarian regimes in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, and Mali. In Africa, its operations have often involved exchanging security services for access to resource concessions, particularly in the mining sector. The group has been repeatedly accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with its military activity, Wagner is also highly active in the information warfare space. Channels affiliated with Wagner on Telegram and other semi-public platforms reveal significant engagement with generative AI technologies. They position these technologies as tools to undermine trust in Western institutions, sow discord among populations in the West and frame any Russian cyber activities as defensive responses to perceived Western aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the reviewed discussions in Wagner-linked channels contained critiques of poorly organised and ineffective Russian attempts at information warfare that relied on impulsive actions rather than systematic, intelligence-driven methods. This included, for example, criticism of low quality, AI-generated images and videos intended to blur reality. Critics argued that poorly executed efforts damage credibility and limit the effectiveness of genuine operations; as one post put it: “Information confrontation is necessary, but it must be done wisely – not in such a way as to report to the top for the sake of a tick”. This commentary reflects Wagner’s framing of itself as a disciplined, professional actor that values careful, intelligence-based planning – as opposed to careless disinformation and impulsive or amateur operations (which, they argue, risk undermining broader strategic efforts). By portraying other actors as ineffective, Wagner reinforces its own claim to be a capable and credible partner in Russia’s information warfare architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter enemy influence in the information space and build up resilience among Wagner’s operatives and audiences, Wagner-linked channels promote education in psychological operations and information warfare. They advertise courses and certifications offered by Wagner-affiliated figures designed to help their supporters identify enemy psychological tactics, detect fake content and improve strategic communications literacy. One teaching aid distributed in early 2025 stated: “I tried to collect the most common methods the enemy uses daily … this teaching aid briefly outlines the essence of the information war and the main methods for recognising fake materials. After studying this manual, you will learn to recognise and counter manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner-linked channels also actively encourage their members to familiarise themselves with ongoing AI developments, highlighting, for example, advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ASI, and discussing the potential strategic implications of these emerging technologies. They share practical information about new AI tools such as Google Labs’ image generation tool Whisk, explaining its potential operational applications and highlighting how AI-generated content can be strategically used in their activities. At the operational level, Wagner channels have discussed incorporating AI bots for moderation, as well as exploring the creation of bespoke AI chatbots modelled on popular or authoritative Wagner-affiliated figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Wagner-linked channels also express warnings about potential adversarial use of AI, particularly highlighting threats posed by AI-generated deepfakes designed to undermine Wagner operations internationally. For instance, Wagner-linked channels alerted followers to attempts to discredit Wagner’s presence in the Sahel using AI-generated images. Wagner-linked channels also drew attention to deepfake operations aimed at undermining regional authorities in Kursk, and to AI-generated audio used by Ukrainian forces to psychologically target Russian soldiers and their families. As one Wagner-affiliated channel warned: “A deepfake was posted by Ukrainian TsIPsO [ЦІПСО – referring to Ukraine’s Centre for Information and Psychological Operations] … they trained a neural network quickly with just one short video. The pipeline of deepfakes will soon escalate; remain vigilant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case discussed in the observed channels involved claims that the French Cyber Defence Command trained Ukrainian and Polish cyber units specifically to target Wagner operations in Mali and elsewhere. These channels reported that the operations were part of a wider Western effort to weaponise AI against Russia and Russian interests. These warnings are simultaneously contributing to a heightened sense of alertness, and amplifying the narrative of being under constant threat by hostile powers – serving to justify campaigns against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further complicating Wagner’s relationship with AI are controversies where AI-generated content has reportedly been misused to manipulate or misrepresent Russian domestic perspectives. In one widely discussed case, a controversial statement, supposedly from State Duma Deputy Alexander Borodai, was dismissed as an AI-generated fake after it described frontline volunteers as “spare people”. Wagner-linked channels leaned into the controversy by sarcastically noting that the “neural network Borodai” had simply revealed the unvarnished truth of elite opinion. This ambiguity, blending satire with critique, illustrates Wagner’s complex relationship with the Russian state as well as its engagement with AI as both a powerful tool and a potential liability in the struggle over narrative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its operational focus, Wagner’s discourse around AI often reinforces a metanarrative of elite competence. Channels often contrast Wagner’s disciplined, intelligence-led approach to information warfare with what they describe as amateurish or ideologically confused efforts by other Russian actors. For example, commenting on the Russian information campaign “Dozor”, one channel member commented, “this initiative will do more harm than good … the activity is poorly organized, there is no systematic approach … All these games with telegram bots are not the level of the challenges we face. Until this work is organized and set up properly, it is unlikely that anything will work out”. In this framing, Wagner positions itself as a pioneer of modern Russian information operations: technologically literate, strategically minded, and better equipped to utilise the full potential of AI than other actors who are constrained by bureaucracy or political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hacktivist-groups&quot;&gt;HACKTIVIST GROUPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives – many of which operate either under the direction of, or in strategic alignment with, state intelligence entities such as the GRU, the external intelligence agency (SVR), and the state security agency (FSB) – form another important component of Russia’s broader influence and cyber-operations ecosystem. Prominent groups include Zarya, Cyber Army of Russia (also known by other aliases such as the People’s Cyber Army or Cyber Army of Russia Reborn), Solntsepek, Beregini and RaHDit, and NoName057(16), and appear to have ties to APT units such as APT44 (GRU Unit 74455).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups often target anti-disinformation organisations, independent media and strategic infrastructure, particularly in Ukraine and other parts of Europe, framing these actions as retaliatory strikes against Western “information aggression”. For example, in May 2024, the Cyber Army of Russia attacked the website of Ukraine’s Centre for Combating Disinformation, justifying its actions as retaliation against perceived Ukrainian misinformation about incidents in Belgorod: “We must make every effort to teach them a lesson in poisoning the information space with cynical lies about yesterday’s shelling of a residential building in Belgorod.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond conducting attacks, these groups also exploit the symbolic value of media attention. For example, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns which receive significant Western media coverage, such as the temporary disruption of the official website of Slovenia’s president, are showcased as major victories, regardless of their technical or strategic significance. Screenshots of affected websites are circulated as digital trophies that are intended to boost morale among their supporters and signal success, both internally and to the groups’ adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of these groups’ modus operandi is the sharing of knowledge, resources and technical expertise. For instance, they highlight and promote platforms, such as HackerGPT, which are explicitly tailored to aid Russian-aligned hackers and which provide databases of techniques, tools and strategies designed to facilitate effective cyber operations. Other resources disseminated in hacktivist channels include comprehensive repositories on hacking, tutorials on generative AI, and lists of AI tools for different purposes. The aim is to cultivate a technically literate, decentralised cyber force, capable of sustaining long-term operations with minimal central oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacktivist group NoName057(16) exemplifies the convergence of AI and cyber operations. Since emerging in early 2022, NoName057(16) has openly discussed AI as a force multiplier for DDoS attacks, misinformation campaigns, and reputational sabotage. The group positions generative AI predominantly as an operational enhancer rather than a standalone capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group demonstrates awareness of international research and reports analysing its influence operations. The channel actively references external reports, such as Google’s researchers identifying AI as a principal source of online misinformation, treating them as external validation of their operational effectiveness. This engagement with adversarial reporting and scrutiny blurs the line between propaganda and performance, creating a feedback loop where Western scrutiny is co-opted to reinforce the group’s narrative of impact and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When alleged members of the group were arrested in Spain in mid-2024, NoName057(16) framed the incident as a symptom of a broader European “witch hunt”, driven by what they described as “Russophobic authorities”. This narrative serves to reinforce group cohesion and present their activities as legitimate resistance against unjustified Western persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, NoName057(16) actively cultivates its public identity through interviews, digests, and multi-language media products, positioning itself as a committed actor in Russia’s information war. Its Telegram channels call for ongoing cyber operations using AI, provide tools and guides to users, and foster a sense of community built around technical skill and ideological conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has shown, generative AI is no longer a concern of the future, but an active component of ongoing Russian-aligned influence operations. A range of actors are already engaging with AI not only as a tool to amplify their content, but also as a conceptual and strategic asset. These actors are debating the potential of AI, educating their followers and supporters in its use, and integrating it into broader narratives of geopolitical struggle and digital sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian discourse around AI reveals both strategic opportunism and deep insecurity. AI is praised for its ability to scale and personalise disinformation, automate content generation and reduce attribution risks. At the same time, there is widespread concern about the militarisation of Western AI, the ideological bias of foreign-developed tools, and the perceived failure of Russian platforms to align with the state’s messaging priorities. This reflects a broader tension in Russia’s approach: while seeking to dominate the information space, it remains dependent on digital tools and infrastructures it does not control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights that generative AI is not simply being used to upgrade existing disinformation techniques. Instead, it is shaping how influence operations are developed, legitimated and operationalised. Wagner’s use of AI-enhanced educational materials, its criticism of low-quality content and its call for strategic discipline all suggest a professionalisation of the information war. Meanwhile, hacktivist groups like NoName057(16) emphasise AI as a force multiplier for grassroots cyber operations, embedding it into decentralised campaigns aimed at overwhelming and destabilising Western digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends have several policy and security implications. First, the fusion of AI and influence operations reinforces the need for AI governance frameworks that explicitly address malign use cases, not only in terms of content generation, but also in relation to model training, access and deployment. Second, the decentralised and multilingual nature of Russian- aligned influence networks highlights the importance of monitoring actor discourse, including strategic framing and planning discussions, across various platforms, rather than just focusing on outputs, such as disinformation posts or fake media content. Without this monitoring, the ability to anticipate emerging tactics and narratives is significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to support civil society and media ecosystems that are directly targeted by these operations. Aside from protecting them from AI-enabled attacks, investment in digital literacy and resilience programming against synthetic content and manipulated narratives is also necessary. Given the pace of AI development, coordination between governments, platforms, researchers and journalists must also happen at a larger scale. This should include sharing insights on observed tactics and uses of AI tools, as well as behaviours of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this report demonstrates that AI is reshaping, but not replacing, the mechanics and logic of Russian disinformation. AI acts as an amplifier, enabling greater reach, faster response and more dynamic narrative adaptation. But it also introduces new vulnerabilities, contradictions and frictions within Russian influence networks themselves. Understanding and engaging with these internal dynamics will be important to inform future policy design and the development of effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

Any such transformation is nearly impossible without the involvement of the domestic opposition, and as Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) argues, it is too ideologically divided — from monarchists to radical leftists — to unite around a common cause. He concludes that, most likely, the fall of the ayatollahs would not lead to a new democratic awakening, but to a full-scale collapse of the Iranian state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether the ceasefire between Iran and Israel will hold. In any case, we have not seen the end of Israel’s covert operations in Iran. Questions about regime change, much talked about over the last two weeks, will likely remain on the agenda. The Islamic Republic has certainly been shaken, and so it is worth asking: what are the opposition forces present in the country, how well organised are they, and can they unite for long enough to have a decisive impact on developing events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-heir-and-a-us-favorite&quot;&gt;The Shah’s heir and a U.S. favorite&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media’s focus has centered on the supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the heir to the throne of the monarchy that was abolished by the 1979 revolution. The Pahlavi clan is openly supported by Israeli prime minister Netanyahu, and in return, they supported Israel’s attack. They are also close to the Americans, not least because Reza is based there and has been actively lobbying American policymakers and congressmen. Much of the Iranian diaspora is made up of people who are associated with the monarchy in one way or another, so it is no surprise that Pahlavi enjoys high support among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters, however, is how much support Pahlavi enjoys inside Iran, a question that is much harder to answer. During the demonstrations of 2022-2023, Pahlavi supporters were clearly active and visible, but even their foreign sympathisers admit that they are poorly organised, with Reza himself having a poor track record as a manager and leader. They are also divided internally — between those nostalgic for the old, authoritarian monarchy and those supporting the new course inaugurated by Reza in 2011, which leaves the issue of monarchical restoration undetermined and promises a liberal, democratic, and inclusive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Reza’s new course has made the Pahlavis and their supporters more acceptable as partners to other opposition groups, there are still many anti-ayatollah forces who do not trust them — or who actively dislike them. To the extent that others in the opposition are ready to accept working with them, is it likely to be largely due to the perception that that may be the only route to gaining the kind of external support that may be required to ultimately have any chance of overthrowing the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-opposition&quot;&gt;The old opposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other older opposition groups that operate in much the same way as the Pahlavi supporters — that is, just beneath the surface, lacking any real underground structure (or at least, that’s the way they operate according to sources in the IRGC). Among them are various groups inspired by the figure of Mohammad Mossadeq, the prime minister who was overthrown in 1953 via an allegedly UK- and US-sponsored coup, which eventually led to the restoration of the absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important of these movements are the Jabhe Milli (National Front) and the Nezhat Azadi Iran (Freedom Movement of Iran), though it does not appear that either are influential outside of some select intellectual circles. The same applies to the various groups that split off from the Islamic Republic, such as the Sazman Mujahidin Enqelab Islami Iran (Organization of the Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran), a leftist-Islamist group that was outlawed in 2009. More influential appears to be the reformist Green Movement, which was the protagonist of the 2009 protests. The security apparatus of the Islamic Republic monitors these groups, but up to now it has not made any noticeable effort to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nmxmn85.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ “Green Movement” protests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the remnants of the old left, which did not take up arms against the Khomeinists in the early 1980s but were outlawed nonetheless. Of these groups, the Tudeh (Communist Party) might have the largest underground networks, with perhaps 2,000 members, according to an IRGC source. The main faction of the Feda’yan Khalq, which aligned with the Tudeh while other factions waged an armed revolt, also maintains a modest underground presence. As with the other groups mentioned above, the security apparatus monitors these, but the authorities do not seem too worried about the threat they might represent. The leftists are certainly not likely to join hands with the supporters of the Pahlavis, whom they bitterly opposed up to and during the 1978-9 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One component of the “old opposition” that has long been ready to join hands with the Americans — and which might accept an opportunity to discreetly cooperate with the Israelis, though not with the Pahlavis — is the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK, lit. “People’s Mujahidin”), which was the most active violent opposition group against the Islamic Republic in the early 1980s before being crushed and forced to flee to Iraq, where it allied with Saddam Hussein until the end of the Iran-Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QvlL0EJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Mojahedin-e-Khalq activists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MEK have not had any armed presence inside Iran for over 30 years (except perhaps for a short-lived effort in 2022), but the IRGC estimated in 2019 that they maintain an underground network inside Iran of about 3,000 members. Thousands more are in exile abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Trump administration (and in particular John Bolton, when he was National Security Advisor) were courting the MEK before the supporters of the Pahlavis became Washington’s favourites. The MEK are in any case very unpopular in Iran due to the fact that they aligned with Saddam Hussein during the war with Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethnic-movements&quot;&gt;Ethnic movements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these groups compete for the support of the 60% or so of Iranians who are Persian speakers. There appears to be no significant organised opposition group active among the country’s main minority, the Azeris (16%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye’s Grey Wolves have long tried to infiltrate the region and might have gained some support among those harboring anti-Kurdish sentiments (Kurds and Azeris co-exist in Iran’s West Azerbaijan Province). There is also a long tradition of opposition to the central powers in Tehran coming from among smaller minorities, such as the Kurds and Baluchis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurds have a significant underground presence among the Sunni Kurdish population and also boast a number of armed groups based in Iraq. Among those believed to be most popular inside Iranian Kurdistan is the Hizb Demokratik Kurdistan Iran (Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan), even if it is well past its peak period of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It mostly operated in the tribal parts of Iranian Kurdistan but also in the city of Mahabad. The IRGC reckoned in 2019 that the party maintains a strong presence, especially in the Shno area (where Iran’s borders with Turkiye and Iraq meet), with up to 900 activists. Up to 2,000 of its most active members have taken refuge in Iraq, according to Kurdish opposition sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the leftist KOMALA is based in Iraq and maintains underground activities in Iran. According to the IRGC, the latter group controls around 450 armed militants along the border. Notably, KOMALA played a significant role in the 2005 urban uprising in Mahabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Kurds, the two groups that have the best prepared fighters are the PAK (Parti Azadi Kurdistan) and the PJAK (Partiya Jiyana Azade Kurdistane, or Kurdistan Free Life Party). The PAK, which was formed by radical leftists in 1991, participated in the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. The IRGC estimates the group’s strength at 400 fighters, who are based in Iraq. Inside Iran it has engaged in some underground activities in the areas of Kermanshah and Illam, but it has not been active there militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Zneuumt.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Women in the ranks of the PAK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the PJAK is the only Kurdish group to have carried out significant armed activities inside Iran over the last 20 years, but it is mostly known to be linked to the Turkish PKK. The IRGC in 2019 rated the PJAK as the best-resourced and most active armed opposition group, with 2,400 members. The problem is that while the other opposition groups tend to cooperate with each other, they all have poor relations with the PJAK, which they accuse of having ambitions that go well beyond Iranian Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli sources say that some Kurdish groups have approached Jerusalem for support, and the PAK has let it be known that it is available to participate in an uprising. However, it is not clear whether Israeli direct engagement is feasible, nor whether the Americans would want to get drawn into an overt regime change operation. Moreover, the PAK has no sympathy for Reza Pahlavi. Other Kurdish groups have distanced themselves from the Israelis. All Kurdish groups have stated their support for demonstrations and popular revolts against the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several Baluchi groups active against the Islamic Republic, but most of them seem to be more concerned with smuggling than with fighting. zThe one that appears to have significant military capabilities is the Islamist Jaysh al-Adl, whose members do not hide their connection to Israel. In 2019 the IRGC believed that the group had 900 fighters, but IRGC sources later acknowledged that this might be an underestimate. Moreover, the group appears to have been arming in recent months. There is no doubt that Jaysh al-Adl would be game for an offensive against the regime, but it is far from clear that it would be interested in cooperating with other opposition groups in undertaking such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another opposition group active in Iran is the Islamic State. Israel has recently admitted to supporting the terrorist group’s branch in Gaza, so perhaps supporting the Iranian one is not out of the question. The Islamic State, which in the past was able to carry out some terrorist attacks inside Iran, would however be of little use in any effort to foster regime change in Tehran, and few if any opposition groups would want to be caught cooperating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collapse-instead-of-revolution&quot;&gt;Collapse instead of revolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before launching its strikes on the night of June 21-22, the U.S. government reportedly assured Iran that Washington’s aim was not regime change. However, the Netanyahu government’s main aim is clearly the downfall of the ayatollahs. On 18 June, Iranian state TV was jammed and an invitation to rise up against the regime was broadcast in place of regular programming. However, it will take more than that to fragment the pro-regime forces inside the country. While the physical and political damage Israel and the U.S. inflicted on Tehran was humiliating for the regime, the consequences may well take months to materialize. For now, there is no sign of the security forces losing their cohesiveness — contrary to the case in 2022-2023, when there were signs that certain elements were wavering. Back then, the army was suffering from large-scale desertions, and even the Basij — the paramilitary force controlled by the IRGC — demonstrated serious discipline issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By threatening in recent days to bombard Teheran even more extensively, the Israelis probably intended to create discontent in the medium term, as many families that fled to the countryside will not be able to stay away from their homes indefinitely. This could potentially lead to disturbances in the future. At the moment, demonstrating in the streets is a very risky proposition, as the security forces would have a very easy excuse to resort to extreme violence. Characteristically, various pro-Pahlavi groups have tried to mobilise people, but without success. In Teheran, the most they have managed to do is to shout from the windows of their flats, inviting others to pour into the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some within the opposition doubted the Israeli agenda all along. After all, Israeli media outlets like the Jerusalem Post openly tout the fragmentation of Iran into a Libya-like state. Some note that looking at the Israelis’ treatment of Gaza’s residents makes it hard to believe that they might have good intentions concerning Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could add that for all their stated good intentions, it is hard to fathom how the disparate opposition groups — ranging from old style Persian nationalists to ethnic separatists, from the far right to the far left, and from radical Islamists to militant secularists — could work together even if the regime were to come tumbling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ceasefire were to hold, criticism of the regime’s security policies of the last quarter century might come to the surface and, more importantly, a showdown between opposed factions within the regime might kick off. Still, while the opposition groups could create considerable disruption — and even contribute to bringing down the regime in the event that the Islamic Republic lost its cohesiveness — the eventual outcome is more likely to be a state collapse than a clean transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders are deeply worried about threats to China’s economic security. For decades, China achieved breakneck economic growth that seemed to suggest the country was on an inexorable rise toward “national rejuvenation.” In recent years, however, China’s economic prospects have come under question, and Beijing has grown increasingly concerned about the nation’s economic security (经济安全).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to these concerns are threats to the complex web of supply chains (供应链) that keep the Chinese economy humming. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on global supply chains, prompting China to turn its attention to shoring up its economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the pandemic did not abate Beijing’s worries. The onset of the War in Ukraine in 2022, coupled with worsening U.S.-China relations and slowing domestic growth, convinced Chinese policymakers that they need to better fortify their economy against mounting threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q95Xa7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Mentions of “Supply Chains”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the most important speeches of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s career—his report to the Communist Party’s 20th National Congress in 2022—he warned of “a new period of turbulence and change” in the world that threatens China’s quest for rejuvenation. In that speech, he demanded of his party comrades that they “must enhance our sense of crisis, adhere to bottom line thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and be prepared to withstand major tests of high winds and even stormy waves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[We] must enhance our sense of crisis, adhere to bottom line thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and be prepared to withstand major tests of high winds and even stormy waves.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-China competition is front and center of Beijing’s concerns. Xi has repeatedly warned that the U.S.-led West is pursuing the “comprehensive containment, encirclement and suppression” of China. Tensions with the United States have intensified as the second Trump administration has applied unprecedented trade and economic pressure on China, and geopolitical hotspots like Taiwan and the South China Sea continue to simmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, how exactly does China define its economic security? A broad definition could encompass nearly anything. Policymakers in Beijing are no doubt worried about access to key technologies like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. China’s vulnerabilities in these areas have been the focus of much attention amid Washington’s measures to restrict the flow of those technologies into China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A close reading of Chinese officials’ speeches, authoritative policy documents, and academic studies suggests three areas are most fundamental to China’s ultimate economic security: food security, energy security, and financial security. Without stability in these core areas, Chinese society and its supply chains cannot properly function, and China cannot compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;why-these-three-pillars&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why These Three Pillars?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 14th Five Year Plan for 2021-2025, China’s most authoritative economic blueprint, included a first-of-its-kind section focusing on economic security. It laid out three strategies for shoring up China’s economic security across the three areas of food, energy, and finance—a clear indication that policymakers view these three areas as most crucial to China’s overall economic health and resilience.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how secure or vulnerable is China in each of these pillars of economic security?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-part ChinaPower series explores each of these areas in detail. The reports leverage data to analyze the most important vulnerabilities China faces, as well as key areas of strength and progress. Crucially, this series does not view China in isolation, but instead it grounds analysis of China’s situation in a comparative global context, especially in comparison to its chief competitor, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-severe-are-chinas-food-security-challenges&quot;&gt;How Severe Are China’s Food Security Challenges?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FwN5m14.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01a&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food security is critical to the well-being and stability of all countries. Decades of economic growth have enabled considerable strides in increasing access to food across China, but this growth has also generated new demographic demands and environmental strains. Global shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, U.S.-China tensions, and the effects of climate change have left Chinese policymakers anxious about China’s food security issues. This ChinaPower report lays out the most pressing threats to China’s food security as well as key areas of progress and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-chinas-food-security&quot;&gt;Challenges to China’s Food Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chinese leaders, food security (粮食安全) is an “important foundation of national security.” Chinese leader Xi Jinping famously remarked that “solving the food problem for more than one billion people has always been the top priority of our party in governing the country.” Between 2013 and 2024, Xi mentioned food security in over 450 speeches, meetings, inspections, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces three main interrelated challenges to its food security, each of which is analyzed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surging Food Consumption&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraints on Domestic Production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliance on Foreign Imports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-1-surging-food-consumption&quot;&gt;Challenge 1: Surging Food Consumption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid economic growth has brought both enormous benefits and new challenges with respect to food security. On the upside, socioeconomic gains have fueled dramatic reductions in China’s undernourished population. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the rate of undernourishment in China’s population fell from 10.3 percent in 2001 to 2.5 percent (or less) by 2010. This decline coincided with a tripling of annual per capita disposable income from just 4,070 RMB to 12,520 RMB over the same period, according to Chinese government figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasingly well-off population has led to surging demand for food. In particular, the emergence of China’s urban middle class has corresponded with a shift away from a grain-oriented diet to a more expensive, meat-heavy intake. Today, China is the largest consumer of meat and fish in the world, consuming almost 168 million metric tons of meat and fish in 2023—more than a quarter of the world’s total. At almost 60 million metric tons consumed, pork was China’s top meat choice. The enormous demand for meat also directly translates to high demand for animal feeds, particularly soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K5dT2oj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Meat and Fish Consumption in Selected Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More affluent urban residents have likewise developed an appetite for other resource-intensive foods, such as dairy products. In 2022 alone, China consumed 64 million metric tons of milk and imported 24 million metric tons, making it the largest milk importer in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing consumption has coincided with more food waste. China is the largest waster of food in the world, generating over 200 million metric tons of food waste in 2022. On a per capita basis, China is roughly on par with many other major economies. Chinese individuals wasted an average of 142 kilograms (kg) each in 2022, which is slightly less than the United States (159 kg per person), but considerably more than neighboring Japan (81 kg per person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/flHSOFI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Estimated Annual Food Waste (2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given concerns about China’s food security, food waste has become a pressing policy issue. The Chinese government initiated multiple campaigns to reduce food waste, such as the Clean Plate campaign in 2013 and 2020. In 2021, China enacted the Anti-Food Waste Law to institutionalize monitoring and punishment mechanisms, particularly for the food service and retail sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To keep up with booming demand, Chinese leaders have published policies to promote domestic food production over imports.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under the banner of an “all-encompassing approach to food” (大食物观), China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025 set specific targets to expand fishery production and the number of aquaculture farms and increase meat production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In April 2025, China released the “Plan for Accelerating the Construction of an Agricultural Powerhouse (2024–2035).” It sets out foundational goals for securing China’s food production and supply, including strengthening food production capacity, conserving arable land, diversifying food sources domestically and abroad, advancing innovation and development of agricultural technology and machinery, and accelerating rural reforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China’s State Council issued Opinions calling for diversification of China’s agricultural supply chains and modernized food resource management systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese farmers have experimented with some innovative methods to breed and raise more animals, including high-rise hog farms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese food production policies have sometimes had unintended negative consequences. For example, to meet demand for milk, a 2018 Opinion launched a campaign that dramatically boosted milk production in China, but by 2024, production significantly outpaced consumption, and domestic milk prices plummeted.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-2-constraints-on-domestic-production&quot;&gt;Challenge 2: Constraints on Domestic Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has long sought self-sufficiency in food. In 1996, the Chinese government published a white paper on food security that called for achieving a self-sufficiency rate of 95 percent for grains. In 2019, China released another government white paper on food security, maintaining the 95 percent target and adding that China must have “absolute security” in staple grains (wheat and rice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The rice bowls of the Chinese people must be firmly in our own hands. Our rice bowls should be filled mainly by Chinese crops.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping-2021&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping, 2021&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward these ends, the Chinese government has identified domestic production as the “top priority.” China has achieved impressive gains in domestic production over the years and transformed itself into the largest food producer in the world. It produced 7.5 billion metric tons of food in 2022, nearly 3 billion metric tons more than the runner-up, India. China is also almost twice as efficient in wheat production per hectare as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to FAO estimates, China—through domestic production and imports—is able to supply enough food to meet 139 percent of its population’s basic caloric needs. That is ahead of Japan (110 percent) and virtually the same as Europe (138 percent), but behind the United States, which, according to recent estimates, is able to meet 153 percent of its population’s needs through domestic production and imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AjAQmmy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Food Availability in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant progress, Chinese leaders remain acutely aware that the country faces significant challenges to domestic production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the top constraints is the availability of arable farmland. Rapid industrial growth, sprawling urbanization, overcultivation, widespread pollution, and the growing impacts of climate change are significantly straining Chinese agriculture. According to the World Bank, China’s total arable land declined by over 12 million hectares between 2009 and 2021. By 2022, China had 31 percent less arable land than the United States, while having four times the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has sought to reverse the loss of arable land. In 2006, Chinese leaders established a “red line of 120 million hectares of arable land” in the11th Five-Year Plan. Xi reinforced this red line repeatedly in his speeches and guidelines, including “zero tolerance” and “lifetime responsibility” measures to punish officials who fail to maintain the designated red line of arable land in their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S3crglQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Arable Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign of its domestic production challenges, some Chinese farmers have resorted to the overuse of fertilizers to try to help boost crop output. Between 2000 and 2015, China’s fertilizer usage per hectare of arable land increased by 67 percent. While fertilizers can increase output, they also exacerbated China’s arable land problems in the long run, contributing to low nutrient utilization, soil loss, pollution, and broader environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Chinese government began promoting “zero growth of fertilizer use” in major policy documents, including the 2016 and 2017 versions of the “Central Document No. 1,” and as a result, fertilizer use declined 17 percent by 2022. China nevertheless remains one of the world’s top consumers of fertilizer, with its usage rate at over three times that of the United States and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/idHa8vO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Fertilizer Use in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water security challenges exacerbate China’s food production issues. China has roughly the same amount of freshwater resources as the United States, but its population is more than four times larger, and it uses more than twice as much freshwater for agriculture. Adding to these challenges, decades of rapid urbanization and industrialization in eastern and southern China have significantly shifted the center of gravity of Chinese agricultural production toward the north and west, which are relatively water-scarce and suffer from higher degrees of water stress than the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is supercharging these problems by causing more droughts, extreme heat, and floods. For example, a 2023 study found that extreme rainfall led to an 8 percent drop in Chinese rice yields over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has consistently called for arable land preservation and improvements to the quality of arable land through expanded monitoring and technical capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the 2024 “Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Cultivated Land, Improving the Quality of Cultivated Land, and Improving the Balance in Land Conversion and Restoration,” the Chinese government imposed “zero tolerance” and “life-time responsibility” measures to punish officials who fail to maintain the red line of arable land in their jurisdictions and implement conversion of cultivated land with centralized monitoring system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s new 2024 National Food Security Law strengthened monitoring measures on the use of cultivated lands and imposed stricter control over the conversion of cultivated land into other land types.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) sets out targets for:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The protection of nutrient-rich black soil in China’s northeastern regions, which has faced serious soil erosion. The target is set to be about 9.3 million hectares of arable black soil.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A four percent increase in overall mechanization of agricultural production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A more than five percent increase in the reuse of livestock and poultry manure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A three million-acre increase in “high standard” farmlands, which are more resilient to disasters and soil degradation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Additional efforts in advancing agricultural sciences and developing resilient crops (see below sections for more).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In regard to water security:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2002, China has invested in a multi-decade mega-infrastructure project, named the “South-North Water Diversion Project,” to transport southern water north and address water shortages in the northern and western provinces. The program has had mixed results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese State Council passed the 2021 Groundwater Management Law to protect groundwater quality and preserve groundwater availability. It published a 2023 Outline on constructing a “national water network” that connects rivers and lakes across the country to better manage water transfer and flood discharge capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In May 2024, China’s State Council passed a water conservation decree to require the government to promote and fund water-saving irrigation techniques, agricultural infrastructure, and research on drought-resistant crops.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To address the impacts of higher domestic food production costs on Chinese farmers:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has enacted anti-dumping policies, temporary storage policies, and minimum agricultural commodity procurement price policies. These trade barriers and stockpiling policies aim to prevent cheaper food imports from undercutting Chinese farmers while buffering shocks to Chinese food production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued Opinions in January 2025 to conserve feed usage in animal husbandry industries, citing that 70 percent of animal husbandry production costs come from feeds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has begun to engage in policies to address the issues of high land and labor costs. In February 2025, the State Council released a high-level Opinions document to promote structural reforms in China’s agricultural land transfer system and reduce the rental costs of land. The new policies also restrict rural land transfer to non-rural residents to keep arable land in the hands of farmers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also allowed genetically modified (GM) food products to enter the Chinese market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) encourages GM-adjacent development in the agricultural and food sectors, paving the way for China to catch up in the adoption of GM organisms to reinforce food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2023, China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs approved GM corn and soybeans as well as GM seeds for commercial use. Another 17 GM crop variants were approved in December 2024. This is partly in reaction to China’s concerns over its seed availability and quality. It marked a profound change in Chinese policy, particularly given long-standing public antagonism against GM food products in China and elite opposition to the introduction of GM seeds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-3-reliance-on-foreign-imports&quot;&gt;Challenge 3: Reliance on Foreign Imports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surging demand for food and constraints on domestic production have forced China to look abroad. China first became a net food importer in 2004, and in 2021, it surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest food importer. According to ChinaPower estimates, China imported a staggering $215 billion worth of food in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the country’s overall self-sufficiency for food declined from 94 percent in 2000 to 66 percent in 2020. Chinese experts have warned of a looming dip to 59 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bQSIPWR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Trade Balance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reliance on imports is not uniform across food products. In some areas, such as vegetables, China meets virtually all of its demand through domestic production. For other goods, China is heavily dependent on other countries. For instance, China relies on foreign suppliers (namely Brazil and the United States) for over 80 percent of its soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s sizable food imports leave it susceptible to volatility in global food prices. When international food prices spike, it can tighten the availability of those goods in China’s domestic market and contribute to food shortages and inflation at home. Researchers found that upward shocks in international food prices accounted for approximately 20 percent of fluctuations in China’s overall inflation between 1998 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WKL3slO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Import Dependence (2023)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global instability in food prices has at times posed significant political challenges for Beijing. In 2018, an outbreak of African swine fever spread from Europe to China, causing China to lose roughly 28 million metric tons of pork production over three years. This strained the supply of the most consumed meat in China and forced it to rapidly scale up imports at a high cost. Chinese officials became alarmed by the crisis, with some calling the issue a “national priority” and resorting to using frozen pork reserves and subsidies to stabilize local volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 also led to significant turbulence in global food trade. Many major food exporters, such as India, began to restrict food exports to stabilize their own domestic prices. China simultaneously faced declining grain imports and rising import prices. Available trade data indicates that China imported 10 percent less grain in 2022 but paid nine percent more compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply shock from the Ukraine war accelerated China’s desire to diversify and reduce its food imports. Amid the war, Xi Jinping focused significant political attention on the issue. In 2022, the year Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi mentioned “food security” in at least 71 speeches, meetings, and other activities—double the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that China can extract some benefit from its large food trade deficit. China’s massive market creates economic leverage over food-exporting economies that depend heavily on Chinese consumers, such as the United States and Brazil. For instance, U.S. farmers have been more dependent on the Chinese market than China has been on U.S. imports. China has leveraged this advantage when it levied tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports into China in retaliation against U.S. tariffs in 2018 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese central government has called for expanding domestic production of food in order to combat imported inflationary pressure:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A 2022 notice by the Chinese Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs listed the expansion of soybean, oil crop, and corn plantations as the first key task.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To meet growing domestic meat demand, Xi Jinping has begun encouraging the agricultural sector to develop alternative protein sources since 2022, and the 14th Five-Year Plan on National Rural Technology Development specifically outlined alternative proteins as an important aspect of China’s food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also sought to reduce tariffs on China’s food imports by joining regional trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020 and signing bilateral trade deals with countries like Brazil. Joining RCEP, for example, removed tariffs on many of China’s major food import sources like Southeast Asia and Australia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, China remains reluctant to remove protectionist policies that inflate domestic agricultural production costs. Beijing, for example, has ignored calls to remove minimum grain commodity price policies in favor of market reforms that allow the market to dictate grain prices. The Chinese government continued to implement minimum price policies to ensure stable levels of domestic cereal production and stockpiles.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-food-security-strengths&quot;&gt;China’s Food Security Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China faces considerable challenges to its food security, it has notable strengths in three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversification of Food Imports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High Levels of Food Access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heavy Investment in Agricultural Innovation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-1-diversification-of-food-imports&quot;&gt;Strength 1: Diversification of Food Imports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s growing food imports, reliable trade partners are crucial to its push for food security. Xi acknowledged the importance of food import diversification at a 2020 central rural work meeting. In his work report speech to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2022, he called for China to “build a diversified food supply system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exhortations come in the context of rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China. The United States has long been one of China’s largest foreign food suppliers, but in recent decades, China has incrementally reduced its reliance on food from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6d1kwJC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Imports from the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process accelerated during the U.S.-China trade war that began in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term. In January 2020, Washington and Beijing put a pause on escalating the trade war by signing the Phase One trade agreement, which committed China to purchasing an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. products (compared to 2017 levels) in four sectors, including agriculture. U.S.-China trade in agriculture did rebound somewhat, but China failed to meet its Phase One purchase commitments. As of 2023, just 13 percent of China’s food imports came from the United States—down from almost 28 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s declining reliance on U.S. soybeans and animal products drove much of the overall decline. In 2023, China bought 25 percent of its imported soybeans from the United States—down significantly from 49 percent in 2000. Over that same period, China reduced its reliance on the United States for meat and animal fat from 57 percent to just 13 percent. China has also seen declining reliance on U.S. dairy products, vegetables and fruits, seafood, and grains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wycH6ZZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Declining Reliance on Certain U.S. Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these trends are not universal. The United States remains a dominant supplier of some goods, such as animal feeds. It supplied 63 percent of China’s total feed imports in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil has been a major beneficiary of China’s food trade diversification—especially with respect to soybeans. In 2000, China bought about 20 percent of its soybeans from Brazil, but by 2023, that figure stood at 69 percent. That amounts to major business for Brazilian farmers. In 2023, China spent a staggering $41 billion on Brazilian soybeans. Following the U.S. tariffs in 2025, Brazil is likely to take up an even greater portion of China’s grain and meat imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0sgF8a5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Soybean Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond looking to Brazil, China has sought to leverage its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to enhance its food security. Between the launch of BRI in 2013 and June 2023, China signed over 100 agricultural and fishery agreements with 90 BRI countries. According to ChinaPower estimates, China imported about $82 billion worth of food from the BRI countries in 2023. A significant portion of these imports came from countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which provided nearly 17 percent of China’s total food imports in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China is diversifying away from the United States—especially in certain products like soybeans—overall diversification of food sourcing is occurring slowly. In 2023, BRI countries provided China with 39 percent of its food imports. That is only up slightly from 35 percent in 2013, when the initiative was started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NRUpWFp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Slow Diversification of China’s Food Import Suppliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that diversification away from the United States does not address all of Beijing’s food security concerns. While China’s reduced reliance on the United States does mitigate some of the risk of disruptions due to geopolitical tensions, it still leaves China susceptible to other risks, such as natural disasters. In early 2025, for example, excessive rains slowed down Brazil’s soybean harvest. Worsening climate-driven extreme weather could exacerbate such phenomena and cause significant disruptions to China’s supply down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has been proactive in building agricultural relations around the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2011, China has become the largest global funder of agricultural research and development (R&amp;amp;D) projects around the world. In 2023, China funded $1.8 billion in direct overseas investment in agricultural and related projects.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China signed a memorandum of understanding on agricultural cooperation with the Arab League, promising deepened cooperation in crop planting, animal and plant disease prevention, animal husbandry, and agricultural trade. These engagements help bind the region closer to Beijing and may help China develop more diverse and reliable food supply chains in the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Besides soybeans, China has also moved from the United States to Brazil to supply other food products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2022, China greenlit corn imports from Brazil, contributing to an immediate halving of U.S. corn imports from $5 billion in 2022 to $2.6 billion in 2023. As Brazilian corn rushed into Chinese markets, China’s corn imports from Brazil went from virtually nothing to $4 billion in the span of a year.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China and Brazil signed a sorghum trade agreement to reduce their dependence on the United States, China’s then-largest sorghum supplier.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is also actively building transportation infrastructure to further ensure a stable grain supply from Russia, Central Asia, and Europe. For instance, China and Russia signed an agreement in 2023 to construct a specialized railway grain terminal at the border to connect China with grain production centers across Eurasia. Historically, Russian and Chinese railroad gauges have had different widths, so grains going to China from the region needed to be transported by sea. The terminal, named the New Land Grain Corridor, helps resolve this issue and reduces transportation times by up to three months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-2-high-levels-of-food-access&quot;&gt;Strength 2: High Levels of Food Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the availability of food—procured through domestic production and imports—another pillar of food security is “food access.” Food access refers to a population’s access to resources that allow them to meet their nutritional needs. This includes factors like wages, transportation, and proximity to grocery stores. China’s population enjoys a high level of food access, owing to food affordability, robust transportation networks, and large stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers benefit from relatively affordable food in China. China’s per capita income has been rising faster than its food costs, as shown by the growing share of Chinese people who can afford a healthy diet despite increases in food costs. The growth and intense competition within China’s online and digitized supermarket industry have also increased the convenience and affordability of acquiring fresh food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PBYAMb0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Food Affordability in Selected Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s robust transportation infrastructure also helps connect food producers with consumers across the country. Like many countries, China’s food producers are concentrated in a handful of regions, and population centers in Eastern China are not self-sufficient in staple grain supply. A great deal of food needs to be transported across the nation. To meet these needs, China relies on its 159,000 km of railway and 128,000 km of domestic waterways (as of 2023), more than any other country besides the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also maintains large grain stockpiles, reportedly amounting to half of global grain reserves in 2022. This can be inferred from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates, which show China holding massive ending stocks in grains (i.e., the volume of total grain supply subtracted by its consumption volume). For instance, China had nearly five times the level of corn ending stocks as the United States in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intensive stockpiling policies provide some cushion against supply and demand shocks, especially in population centers. However, food storage facilities in China were often poorly designed, managed, and maintained in the 2010s, leading to loss and waste. These factors have contributed to the growing cost of stockpiling. According to the OECD, China spent $10 billion on public stockpiling in 2023, about 20 times what all OECD countries spent collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZWR7byE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Grain Ending Stocks in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2017, China published a new evaluation standard for mayor-level cadres based on performance in agricultural output, market access to food, food safety and quality monitoring, and food price control. Food market access, including the density of groceries, constitutes 20 percent of the total possible scores. A 2023 revision increased the scoring of grocery density by one point.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for E-Commerce Development includes targets to expand food access through e-commerce platforms and other new technologies. These include new digitally enhanced shopping experiences such as smart food pick-up lockers, unmanned grocery stores, and other web-based enhancements to community infrastructure and consumer experiences.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2022, the Chinese government published the “Guiding Opinions on Accelerating Scenario Innovation to Promote High-Level Applications of Artificial Intelligence for High-Quality Economic Development” to further promote business innovation in consumer experience technologies, including at groceries and food services, through leveraging AI technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2024, China’s first National Food Security Law went into effect. It included mandates to establish central and local emergency food distribution and processing systems. The law also required enterprises that store central or provincial grain reserves to divest their commercial operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By October 2024, China reported that it had more than 5,100 emergency food storage enterprises, 6,900 emergency food processing enterprises, 3,900 emergency food distribution enterprises, and 59,000 emergency supply nodes. This builds on the growth of China’s wheat, rice, and corn reserves, which reached more than half of the world’s stocks in 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-3-heavy-investment-in-agricultural-innovation&quot;&gt;Strength 3: Heavy Investment in Agricultural Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s constrained supply of arable land, its policymakers are leveraging agricultural technology innovation to increase the yield of crops. The 14th Five-Year Plan lays out specific targets for agricultural mechanization and scientific development. Similarly, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a 2025 policy plan that outlines key areas of agricultural innovation, including genetic modification of crops, agricultural robotics, and internet-based tools for farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s agricultural modernization drive translates to a boom in ag-tech spending across the country. According to the OECD, China is the world’s top single spender on agricultural innovation, spending about $4.4 billion in 2023. Comparatively, the United States spent $3.8 billion, and the entire European Union spent $7.8 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese businesses have consistently been the top investors in food and agricultural (agri-food) technology. According to Agfunder, Chinese corporations invested $6 billion in agri-food startups in 2021, and by 2023, China accounted for 41 percent of all agri-food start-up funding in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BGmYgcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Spending on Agricultural Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent area of modernization is crop seeds, a major preoccupation for Xi and China’s central leadership. To reduce import dependence for seeds and seed technology, Beijing has ramped up incentives for genetic engineering (which Chinese policymakers have historically avoided). Much of the investment goes toward seed-focused biotech companies like Hangzhou RFGene, whose genetically modified soybeans were recently approved for commercial use in China. These efforts have begun to bear fruit: Chinese state media proudly broadcasts China’s status as the top global producer of seed engineering patents, and 99.9 percent of seeds consumed in China are produced domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s farmers are also revolutionizing the use of agricultural drone technology. Chinese technology entrepreneurs have heralded the “low-altitude economy” (低空经济) as a key driver of domestic growth and an opportunity to seize global leadership. Agriculture is first on the list of industries benefiting from these technologies: one Chinese drone executive noted that China’s drones collectively spend 98 percent of flight time on agriculture-related functions. The growth of China’s agricultural drone industry has rattled policymakers in Washington, but expansion overseas has continued elsewhere at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final locus of agricultural innovation is supply chain analytics. AI investment has poured into the industry, optimizing farm management, delivery networks, food safety monitoring, and strategic stockpile decision-making. One illustrative example is Pinduoduo, a Chinese e-commerce company that has invested billions of dollars in agri-food projects that leverage its e-commerce distribution platform and AI technology. Using cloud technologies, Pinduoduo developed a streamlined, centralized information system that manages dispersed supply chains, processes market information, and conducts sales and customer acquisition—seamlessly linking farmers and consumers from around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published the National Smart Agriculture Action Plan (2024-2028) to promote the establishment of a national data platform for agricultural information, including geospatial information, agricultural output and sales, and environmental data. The Action Plan also promotes the digitization of agricultural supply chains and singals the government’s commitment to supporting smart agricultural firms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese scientists have been active in research to develop alternative protein sources. Simulations suggest that by 2035, it may be possible to replace 10 percent of meat production with plant-based meat and 15 percent of milk production with plant-based milk.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-robust-is-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;How Robust Is China’s Energy Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/trB6sXC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01b&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy security is a crucial pillar of the economic and national security of every country. Disruptions that upset the steady supply of power can cause cascading ripple effects throughout industries and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s energy security is characterized by a mix of vulnerabilities and strengths. It is by far the world’s largest consumer of energy, placing enormous pressure on policymakers to fuel the nation’s sprawling manufacturing sector. China is also significantly reliant on foreign fossil fuels, leaving it exposed to disruptions stemming from instability and geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet China has major energy security strengths. It is rapidly deploying renewable energy infrastructure to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. China also leads the world in producing critical minerals that are central to its energy security, and heavy investments in its energy grid are enabling China to prepare for a future powered by renewables. Finally, China’s abundant supply of coal offers policymakers a safety net in the event of major disruptions to other energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ChinaPower report explores these key strengths and vulnerabilities. It focuses not just on China’s absolute security needs but considers China’s situation in a global context—especially in comparison to the next-biggest energy consumer, the United States. Overall, China’s energy security position is relatively strong, and its advantages are poised to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-in-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities in China’s Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is acutely aware of the importance of energy to China’s economic and national security situation. Between 2013 and 2024, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned “energy security” (能源安全) in at least 180 different speeches, meetings, and other official activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/y2DUEz2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Mentions of “Energy Security”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s focus on energy security surged in 2022 as the world grappled with disruptions to global energy flows following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For Beijing, the conflict highlighted China’s need to pursue greater energy independence, with Xi repeatedly emphasizing that energy security “is one of the most important security issues” facing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces two important energy challenges, each of which is examined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Massive and Growing Demand for Energy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliance on Foreign Oil and Gas&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-massive-and-growing-demand-for-energy&quot;&gt;1. Massive and Growing Demand for Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of rapid economic growth have dramatically increased China’s demand for energy. In 1980, around the start of China’s economic “reform and opening” period, China consumed less than one-fourth of the amount of energy of the United States. By 2008, China surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest energy consumer, and, in 2024, China consumed more energy than the United States, European Union (EU), and Japan combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X6M1QfF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Consumption of the World’s Top Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s unparalleled demand for energy is largely a factor of its globally dominant manufacturing sector. In 2022, Chinese manufacturers accounted for 57 percent of the country’s total energy consumption at approximately 90 exajoules (EJ), which is comparable to the total energy consumption of the United States and nearly 15 percent of global consumption that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese households are accounting for a slowly rising share of total energy consumption as they become wealthier. Energy consumption in China’s residential sector has expanded from 10.5 percent of China’s total in 2012 to 13 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pr2zMJj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Energy Consumption by Sector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s energy consumption is slated to increase further in the coming years as new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) drive greater demand for electricity. Leading technology companies in the United States, China, and elsewhere are racing to set up energy-hungry data centers to power their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese official estimates indicate that in 2025, data centers in China are expected to consume between 150 and 200 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is approximately 1.5-2 percent of the country’s total electricity consumption. That could more than double by 2030 to around 400 TWh, which is roughly equal to the entire electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia in 2023. More bullish estimates suggest an increase to around 530 TWh is possible by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s energy demand is growing, it will likely eventually plateau. Some studies suggest that this peak will not occur for another two decades, around 2049, but the exact timing will depend on several factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the speed of industrial adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved energy efficiency explains part of the story. In 1990, China consumed twice as much energy as the United States to produce an equivalent amount of GDP. Since then, China’s energy intensity (as this measure is called) has plummeted dramatically, yet as of 2023, it was still 40 percent less efficient than the United States and about 50 percent less efficient than the EU and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wkhHO69.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Intensity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other long-term factors, like population decline, may also reduce energy demand. After peaking at over 1.42 billion people in 2021, recent forecasts project that China’s population will shrink by about 2 million people by 2030, and by 2050, it could fall another 130 million. While a shrinking population presents many economic and social challenges for China, Xi Jinping himself has pointed out that it could help to alleviate some issues like resource constraints and environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;According to analyses by Chinese experts, China’s approach to meeting domestic energy needs has evolved through three main phases in recent decades:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase One focused on conservation, improving energy efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. The 9th to 11th Five-Year Plans (spanning 1996-2010) emphasized energy conservation as the guiding principle of Chinese energy policies. The 11th Five-Year Plan specifically identified energy efficiency as the primary challenge in energy conservation efforts and outlined targets to enhance scientific and technological development in energy efficiency to meet national energy consumption.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase Two spanned the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), which, for the first time, introduced the notion of “energy transition” (能源转型) from a coal-dependent energy structure to a greener, more diverse, and lower-carbon energy structure. It emphasized that deepening international energy cooperation and expanding international energy trade, particularly oil and gas, would be key to China’s energy transition efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase Three, the current phase, continues to focus on energy transition but pivots to indigenous energy production as the primary focus in the face of rising geopolitical risks and heightened energy demands. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), for the first time, introduced an energy self-reliance target of 80 percent and removed the mention of international trade from its text. It also introduced policy goals and institutional reform objectives to advance energy transition efforts that continued under the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The new plan also identified structural and regional imbalances in China’s energy system and geopolitical risks in oil and gas supply chains as key issues to resolve.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Furthering the third phase strategy, in 2023, the Central Commission for Comprehensive Deepening Reform (CCDR) reviewed and passed the “Opinions on Promoting Dual Control of Energy Consumption and Gradually Shifting to Dual Control of Carbon Emissions.” The Opinions signal a pivot of China’s decarbonization strategy from one focused on reducing energy consumption to one that emphasizes reducing carbon emissions. Following the Opinions, the State Council released a plan to incentivize provinces and municipalities to renew infrastructure and switch to less-polluting alternatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To meet China’s current and future data center energy demand, the Chinese government has proposed the plan of “East Data, West Compute” (EDWC, 东数西算). The plan aims to construct a network of eight computing hubs in western China and ten data clusters in eastern China. Western computing hubs can leverage their proximity to renewable power sources to compute data with lower access frequency, while also benefiting from cooler climates that reduce hardware cooling needs. Meanwhile, the eastern data clusters can focus on high-frequency data and offload more intensive computing to the west. According to the outlined goals in the 2023 Guideline on EDWC, the computing power of the new hubs would need to account for 60 percent of China’s total new computing power by the end of 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese government has published multiple action plans in recent years to construct green data center clusters and enhance the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of data centers through dedicated government monitoring and supervision. A 2024 action plan document sets out a plan to reduce the PUE of new large-scale data centers to 1.25 by 2025—an ambitious goal given China’s nationwide average PUE of 1.48 in 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-dependence-on-foreign-oil-and-gas&quot;&gt;2. Dependence on Foreign Oil and Gas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surging demand for energy has left China more reliant on foreign sources. Until the 1990s, China was a net energy exporter, but as of 2022, it imported about one-fifth of its total energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to some major economies, China is in a less precarious position. For instance, Japan’s limited endowment of natural resources and its island geography leave it reliant on imports for almost all its energy (87 percent in 2023), and the EU imports about two-thirds of its energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1B31edM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Import Dependence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s biggest energy imports are foreign oil and gas. China is the world’s largest crude oil importer by a wide margin, accounting for about 25 percent of global imports. It is also the largest natural gas importer. In all, China imported 74 percent of its oil and 42 percent of its natural gas supply in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stands in stark contrast to the United States’ energy position. In 2018, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top crude oil producer, and in 2019, it became a net energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s. U.S. strengths in fossil fuels were primarily driven by the shale revolution, in which advancements in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” and horizontal drilling unlocked vast reserves of oil and natural gas, and the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure enabled U.S. suppliers to scale up global exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts, China faces challenges in replicating U.S. successes. While China is estimated to have the largest shale gas reserves in the world—almost twice that of the United States—its reserves are deeper, more geographically scattered, and located in more mountainous areas, making extraction more challenging. As of 2020, China was home to just 1.5 percent of the world’s technically recoverable oil and 4.5 percent of global natural gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QfWTlFy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Oil &amp;amp; Gas Independence: The U.S. vs China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy independence and diversification have taken on new urgency for many countries amid worsening geopolitical tensions. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the EU has sought to reduce its dependence on Russian energy and deny Moscow income to support the war. So far, the results have been mixed. At the end of 2024, the EU only imported 2 percent of its oil from Russia—down from 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, EU reliance on Russian LNG imports increased from 11 percent to 22 percent over the same period, even as pipeline natural gas (PNG) imports have fallen dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has moved in the opposite direction as part of Beijing’s broader strengthening of ties with Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Between 2021 and 2024, the share of Chinese crude oil imports coming from Russia increased from less than 16 percent to nearly 20 percent. Over the same period, the share of China’s PNG imports coming from Russia nearly tripled from 13 percent to 38 percent, largely owing to the ramp-up of Russian production along the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline. Russia’s share of China’s LNG imports also climbed from 6 percent to 11 percent during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9jy1l1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Imports of Key Russian Energy Products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia energy ties could strengthen further in the coming years. Russia is negotiating with China for a new natural gas pipeline named Power of Siberia 2, which would carry gas from Russia’s Yamal peninsula in West Siberia through Mongolia into northern China. Moscow reportedly sought to begin construction of the pipeline in 2024, with the goal of starting gas deliveries in 2030; however, China appears to be waiting to secure a more favorable price for the gas before moving forward. China has been involved with other Russian natural gas projects, including the Arctic LNG 2 plant, which provides further avenues for strengthening energy ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying energy from Russia offers important benefits for Beijing. Chinese purchases have been a crucial economic lifeline for Russia amid its war in Ukraine, binding Moscow closer to Beijing. Russia’s proximity to China also reduces the likelihood that physical energy deliveries will be cut off, which enhances China’s overall energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uQ0XdPC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Foreign Crude Oil Suppliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet buying from Russia does not solve all of China’s import dependency challenges. China’s reliance on other countries for oil and gas leaves it exposed to disruptions. More than half of China’s crude oil comes from the Middle East, where conflicts and instability have long caused disruptions and price fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, almost all the oil China imports from countries besides Russia (about 80 percent of its crude oil imports) travels by sea through the Malacca Strait, a strategically important maritime chokepoint connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Likewise, nearly one-third of China’s total goods imports transit through the Taiwan Strait, which in 2022 included some $500 billion worth of crude oil, refined oil, and other mineral and metal products. Conflicts over Taiwan or the South China Sea could seriously jeopardize China’s continued access to energy flowing through these key trade routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To expand petroleum production capacity, China has actively searched for new oil reserves, with significant success. The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) outlines goals to expand oil and gas exploration within China, reiterating Xi’s calls to expand domestic oil production in 2018.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since then, the country has made numerous discoveries, including multiple hundred-million-ton oil reserve sites in regions such as Henan, Shandong, and the South China Sea. However, the actual technically extractable quantity may remain quite low due to the complex underground geography at many of these newly discovered sites, and drillers’ price margins have been tested by geopolitical turbulence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is also actively expanding its strategic oil reserves. The government instructed state-owned oil corporations to add nearly 60 million barrels of crude oil to China’s strategic reserve in July 2024 and called for accelerating annual stockpiling of strategic fuels, including oil, in March 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To mitigate geopolitical risks and circumvent chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca and the Gulf of Aden, China is constructing rail and pipeline networks that connect China with oil and gas supplies from the broader Eurasian and Middle Eastern regions. In the southwest, China has constructed oil and gas pipelines through Myanmar, which have been operational. However, the civil war in Myanmar has caused disruptions and concerns from China over the security of the pipelines.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-in-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;Strengths in China’s Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite notable challenges China faces in energy security, it is in an increasingly strong position to overcome surging demand, environmental costs, import reliance, and energy infrastructure. China has four interrelated strengths to secure energy for its population and the economy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technological Leadership in Renewable Energy Technologies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading Player in Critical Mineral Production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep Reserves of Coal as a Fallback&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-technological-leadership-in-renewable-energy-sources&quot;&gt;1. Technological Leadership in Renewable Energy Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders have set their sights on reducing the country’s reliance on fossil fuels, and they view renewable energy as key to China’s long-term energy security, economic growth, and carbon emissions goals. They are investing accordingly to position China as a global leader in renewable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is deploying renewables at a rapid pace, with solar and wind leading the way. In 2024, China installed 278 gigawatts of solar capacity—adding more in a single year than the entire solar capacity already installed in the United States at that time. China’s installed capacity in wind likewise increased nearly 18 percent in 2024, three four faster than Europe and nearly six times faster than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RJQYhMY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Is Rapidly Deploying Wind and Solar Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s impressive gains in renewables are buoyed by unparalleled investments, as its state-backed banks and investment firms pour financing into green energy projects. According to estimates from BloombergNEF, China’s investments in clean energy reached $818 billion in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like China, the United States is also investing heavily in renewable energy sources. Its 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) sought to stimulate renewable energy investments through grants, loans, and tax credits totaling approximately $370 billion. These projects have catalyzed growth in the U.S. renewable energy sector, but despite these gains, U.S. spending continues to lag behind China’s. In 2024, U.S. investments in clean energy only reached $338 billion, less than half of China’s level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bn1T2S1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Leads in Clean Energy Investment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lead in clean energies is poised to widen thanks to high-level policy support. Beijing views clean energy and related technologies as critical to not just energy security and decarbonization but to economic growth as well. In an April 2025 speech, Xi noted that “the green transition… is a new engine for economic and social development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, since at least 2023, Chinese economic planners have referred to the “new three” (新三样)—photovoltaic cells, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles—as a source of economic vitality. Chinese manufacturers have grown to dominate the global supply of these three key green technologies and other renewables like wind and hydroelectric components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q7GBWjD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Leads Global Manufacturing of Green Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would-be competitors in the United States, the European Union, and emerging markets remain heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers for upstream manufacturing inputs into clean energy projects. As economic competition with China has intensified, U.S. policymakers have moved to reduce U.S. dependence on China for future decarbonization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond just renewables, China is looking to a broader suite of non-fossil fuels to power China’s economy. The 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development, released in 2022, calls for a “clean, low-carbon, secure, and highly efficient” energy system, and stipulates that non-fossil fuel electricity generation should contribute “about 39 percent” of total electricity generation by 2025. China is on track to reach this target. By 2024, hydro, solar, wind, nuclear, and biofuels collectively powered over 38 percent of China’s total electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I07bbQ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of China’s Electricity Production Coming from Non-Fossil Fuels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is an increasingly important part of these efforts. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, China has built over 55 gigawatts of installed nuclear electricity generation capacity, putting it third behind the United States (97 GW) and France (63 GW). China has an additional 30 GW of nuclear power capacity under construction, which, once completed, would place China ahead of France. According to some estimates, nuclear power could contribute to around 10 percent of China’s total electricity generation by 2035—up from just 4.5 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In September 2020, Xi Jinping pledged to accelerate policies that would enable China to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and net-zero emissions before 2060. These targets, referred to as China’s “dual-carbon goal” (双碳目标), provide the impetus for China’s green transition efforts. More policy efforts included:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan calls for an 18 percent reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 2025 along with a host of related targets. These targets were enumerated in the March 2022 “14th Five-Year Plan for a Modern Energy System,” which calls for non-fossil fuel power sources to provide about 39 percent of power generation by 2025. “Energy security” features prominently in this document.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another key policy supporting China’s renewable energy sector is a high-level State Council Opinions document published in 2021, which calls for 25 percent of power generation to come from non-fossil fuel methods by 2030. This document is supplemented by a series of departmental action plans and more granular policies, which together compose what is referred to as the “1+N” framework.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) drafted a new Ecological and Environmental Code that revises, merges, and retires 10 existing environmental and anti-pollution laws and establishes a legal framework to mandate the government to enforce, track, and expand China’s green energy transition efforts in industries and through global cooperation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subsidies, tax incentives, and other forms of government support played a key role in the rise of China’s green technology sector during the 2010s. These subsidies have mostly ended, but other forms of support (like below-market credit) remain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Owing to these subsidies, China’s energy sector hit its target for renewable energy adoption—1200 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030—six years ahead of schedule.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite China’s rapidly growing renewable power supply, it remains heavily reliant on coal, a position which Xi Jinping has endorsed in the near term. Xi described this strategy as “first build, then destroy” (先立后破), referring to building a robust renewable system before coal-based methods are abandoned. This approach informed the subsequent National Development Reform and Commission (NDRC) 2024 Guiding Opinions document, which outlined measures to improve renewable energy utilization.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-leading-player-in-critical-mineral-production&quot;&gt;2. Leading Player in Critical Mineral Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leadership in many new energy technologies is underpinned by the country’s dominance in critical mineral supply chains. Decades of intensive industrial policy, comparatively lax environmental regulations, and massive economies of scale enabled China to position itself as the leading refiner and processor of many critical minerals that are indispensable to the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China plays a significant role in both the upstream and downstream portions of many critical minerals. Upstream, China is a leading provider of many ores—the raw deposits containing minerals that can be extracted and processed into more pure products for downstream use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominance in downstream refining and processing is even more pronounced. As an instructive example, in 2024, China produced 21 percent of the world’s bauxite—the main ingredient used to produce aluminum—but produced almost 60 percent of the world’s refined aluminum. This has further spillover effects, since processing bauxite into aluminum can generate gallium as a byproduct. That is how China came to produce 98 percent of the world’s gallium, which is used in many energy technologies, including solar cells, electric vehicles, and fast-charging devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cL7sEV9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Dominates Critical Minerals Important to Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these, China refines nearly half of the world’s steel, zinc, and lead, as well as more than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt and lithium. Furthermore, in 2023, China refined 79 percent of the world’s battery-grade graphite and 92 percent of the rare earth elements used to produce permanent magnets, which are integral to wind turbines, electric motors, and many other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s key role in critical mineral supply chains confers advantages to its clean energy sector. For instance, an abundance of refined critical minerals makes China’s energy transition more cost-effective and scalable, as the country’s metallurgy industry can provide reliable supplies of critical components to downstream green technology manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2023, China’s State Council issued an Opinion on improving mine operation safety as the government sought to expand mineral extractions in China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has expanded lithium exploration since 2021, boosting its global share of lithium reserves from 6 to 16.5 percent. China’s domestic lithium production is growing steadily, though the poor quality of much of its reserves poses a challenge to the price competitiveness of its refining operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China recently discovered a major uranium deposit in the Ordos Basin in its northwestern region, as well as a major thorium reserve in Inner Mongolia. These two discoveries could help fuel China’s expansion in nuclear power and substantially reduce China’s reliance on uranium imports, especially from the United States and Russia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-rapid-progress-toward-grid-modernization&quot;&gt;3. Rapid Progress Toward Grid Modernization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to energy, production only tells part of the story. For power to be useful, it must be delivered reliably and affordably to end users. This is the task facing China’s rapidly growing electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of China’s energy demands are concentrated in its densely urbanized east coast. This poses a challenge for China’s green transition goals, since its most quickly growing sources of renewable energy—solar and wind power—require large tracts of land. China’s newer renewable energy facilities are concentrated in western inland provinces, where land is more plentiful, but they suffer from wasted power and low rates of utilization. In the western region of Tibet, for instance, 27.5 percent of wind power and 32.2 percent of solar power went to waste in January and February 2025, far higher than the national averages of 6.2 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ISMGwSu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Net Energy Balance by Province (2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s grid operators have sought to remedy this through massive grid infrastructure spending and redesigned grid architecture. A cornerstone of this effort is China’s ultra-high-voltage (UHV) grid network, which can deliver electricity over long distances and thereby alleviate supply-demand disconnects by transmitting energy produced in the west to consumers in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global leadership in UHV infrastructure is decades in the making. Planning for this network began as early as 2006, during China’s 11th Five-Year Plan. The newest UHV grid commenced construction in 2024 with a total investment of about RMB 35.3 billion ($4.8 billion). This will add to the 42 UHV projects already completed, but more work remains to achieve Beijing’s goal of country-wide grid integration and power market unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to upgrade its grid infrastructure are complemented by steps toward energy market liberalization. Prior waves of renewable energy investment benefited from price control policies that disincentivized coal-based production, but these measures were blamed for precipitating energy shortage crises in 2021 when it became unprofitable for coal-based producers to operate in certain parts of the country. The aftermath of this debacle accelerated calls for a unified, market-based pricing structure. Chinese regulators responded by launching significant market-oriented reforms in February 2025, which analysts predict will drive smarter battery investments and grid resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though China’s grid upgrading remains a work in progress, its efforts are outpacing those of the United States. Experts have called for investment in UHV infrastructure in the United States, but to date, no projects have been completed. U.S. grid designers face permitting and financing hurdles that dampen the appetite for UHV investments. One study cited a 17-year regulatory timeline before construction could begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States still leads China in some metrics of grid performance, such as frequency and duration of power outage events—a common metric for grid reliability. However, China has made rapid strides in recent years and is steadily closing the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7F0iKhw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Is Catching Up to the United States in Electric Grid Reliability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese policymakers are seeking to unify the country’s regional power grids into one unified grid that functions as a single integrated market. An NDRC Guiding Opinions document issued in 2022 outlines the steps of this process.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Market reforms are also key to China’s grid upgrading efforts:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In February 2025, the NDRC announced a set of reforms that will eliminate feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, which have been in place for wind and solar power since 2009 and 2011, respectively. While active, these tariffs incentivized renewable energy projects by guaranteeing a higher rate of return for electricity sold.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The new system will implement market-oriented pricing reforms, which may result in tighter balance sheets for future renewable energy projects, but is ultimately expected to raise the uptake of renewable-generated power.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All of these reforms depend on modern, efficient infrastructure, and China’s grid operators are rushing to keep pace. China’s largest grid operator, State Grid, announced plans to invest $88.7 billion into its grid infrastructure in 2025, following on from its spending of $70 billion in 2024 and similar investments in prior years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-deep-reserves-of-coal-as-a-fallback&quot;&gt;4. Deep Reserves of Coal as a Fallback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite China’s efforts to transition to renewables and other non-fossil fuel sources, coal continues to play a leading role in its energy system. Coal supplied 56 percent of China’s primary energy in 2024, dramatically higher than the United States (8 percent). In fact, since 2011, China has consumed more coal than the rest of the world combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is far more self-reliant in coal than in other fossil fuels, like oil and gas. It boasts about 13.3 percent of the world’s technically recoverable coal reserves, and it is by far the largest coal producer in the world. China does import some coal—mostly from Russia, Australia, Mongolia, and Indonesia—but the amount of imported coal accounts for only about 6.6 percent of China’s total energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0Sg3EHR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Coal Consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal has become especially important in the wake of recent energy crises. Record-high coal prices due to coal shortages and state-enacted electricity price controls culminated in a severe electricity supply crisis in China in late 2021, impacting 20 provinces and leading to prolonged outages in some regions. In summer 2022, record temperatures and drought in the Yangtze River reduced the supply of hydroelectric power amid peak power demand, leading to power disruptions in southern provinces like Sichuan, which relies on hydropower for 80 percent of its electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these crises, China doubled down on coal as a backup energy source, and it is rapidly expanding its coal-fired power capacity. As of April 2025, at least 311 coal-fired power plants were under construction in China with 204 gigawatts of combined capacity—nearly four times the combined level of coal-fired capacity under construction in the rest of the world. Just one Chinese province, Inner Mongolia, has more coal-fired power capacity than all but two countries (the United States and India) in the world in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hGWuIMm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image34&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Coal-Fired Power Capacity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal may be China’s most dependable path to ultimate energy security, but it comes at a price. According to Carbon Atlas, 72 percent of China’s CO2 emissions came from coal in 2023, compared to 66.4 percent in India and 15.8 percent in the United States. Increased coal reliance may jeopardize China’s carbon emissions goals for 2030 and 2060, or at a minimum, make the deferred transition more costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large emissions also translate into health costs. In 2021, household air pollution from burning solid fuels like coal and wood was attributed to an estimated 29.2 deaths per 100,000 people in China—over 415,000 people altogether, compared to about 16 people in total in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, coal-fired power generation adds to China’s water burden. China is one of the world’s most water-stressed countries, and coal plants consume large volumes of freshwater for cooling facilities, cleaning coal, and powering turbines in the form of steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water-scarce northern and western regions, which often have a higher density of coal plants, face trade-offs in distributing water between energy and agricultural industries, the latter of which consumes a large portion of the country’s water. Chinese policymakers have pushed for the adoption of air-cooling technologies in coal plants since 2012, an effort that has reduced water consumption in energy generation but could negatively impact thermal efficiency and emission rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the environmental and health costs, it is unlikely that China will back away from coal in the near term. China’s growing power needs will strain China’s power supply and impact industrial growth if demand is not met. For now, the government’s continued insistence on long-term coal contracts incentivizes many electricity buyers to choose coal over renewables. Some provinces are also particularly reliant on the coal industry for tax revenue and employment, making it politically challenging for local governments to rapidly shift toward renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese leaders, particularly under Xi, have paid close attention to environmental and air pollution problems. However, issues like misaligned promotion and tenure incentives and inefficient implementation strategies have created obstacles for the Chinese government to tackle environmental challenges, particularly in poorer regions and areas reliant on coal and heavy industries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s coal-based power generation strategy is somewhat at odds with its emissions goals, but rather than abandoning new coal-fired projects, it is seeking to make them marginally cleaner.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A 2025 guideline released by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) stated that China will continue to construct coal-fired power plants through 2027 to stabilize the power grid or back up peak demand.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 2025 guideline adopted a previous 2024 guideline on adopting and converting coal-fired power capacity with lower carbon emission rates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s current energy security situation is a mixed bag. On one hand, the country faces substantial near-term challenges. Beijing’s push to dominate global manufacturing is consuming an eye-watering amount of the world’s energy, and China’s limited domestic energy reserves have left it reliant on vulnerable foreign energy supplies to a level that is concerning for Chinese leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, China has marshaled a formidable set of strengths. Its dominance in renewable energy technologies and critical minerals, as well as its rapid grid modernization, puts it at the forefront of global efforts to transition to the energies of the future. Meanwhile, in the event of a crisis, China can lean on coal as a stopgap, although doing so comes at political and environmental costs. Ultimately, China’s energy security hinges on its ability to balance competing priorities. How Beijing navigates this path will have not only domestic consequences but also global implications for energy markets, climate action, and geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-financial-risks-threaten-chinas-economic-security&quot;&gt;How Do Financial Risks Threaten China’s Economic Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oHA1LtO.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called for China to become a “financial superpower” (金融强国) rivaling established leaders like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan. Yet, mounting geopolitical tensions and slowing economic growth at home have sparked concerns in Beijing about the country’s overall “financial security” (金融安全). China has made notable strides in recent years to shore up financial risks, but numerous challenges persist. This ChinaPower feature explores four key vulnerabilities and three strengths in China’s financial security. Taken together, they paint a cloudy picture of Beijing’s long-term prospects of becoming a global financial leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-in-chinas-financial-security&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities in China’s Financial Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces four important vulnerabilities to its financial security, each of which is outlined and analyzed below. These vulnerabilities are closely inter-related: strain in one area can exacerbate problems in another area. These are not the only vulnerabilities facing China’s financial system, but they encompass the most pressing risks in the eyes of regulators and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-1-exposure-to-foreign-sanctions&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 1: Exposure to Foreign Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s threat perceptions with respect to financial security have shifted as China’s domestic and international conditions have changed. One of the clearest indications of this is the political messaging coming from Xi Jinping himself. Analysis of an official database cataloging Xi’s “important speeches” offers revealing insights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bMgKMjO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35a&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Security (in Purple)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has consistently stressed the issue of financial security during his tenure. Between 2013 and 2024, the phrase financial security appeared in at least 44 state media reports of his speeches, meetings, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hNtixpH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35b&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Risks (in Red)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing China’s financial security, he has frequently stressed mitigating financial risks that could jeopardize China’s economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the types of risk facing China are evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dlxJyCh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35c&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Crisis (in Green)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, China’s attention has centered on building resilience to financial crises, like the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, Xi’s mentions of financial crisis have declined markedly with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of financial crises has not gone away, but Beijing now also perceives new, worrying threats from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z7s9QTT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35d&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Sanctions (in Blue)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Xi has more frequently warned of the threat of weaponized foreign sanctions amid increasing economic and technological competition with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s mentions of sanctions surged in 2022 as the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Beijing worries it could be targeted next, and it is buttressing its economy in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s worries over sanctions initially spiked during the first Trump administration, when Washington imposed sanctions on Chinese companies, including technology giants Huawei and ZTE. The Biden administration escalated efforts to sanction Chinese companies and targeted China with a suite of export controls on advanced technologies, especially semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such targeted U.S. sanctions are a significant concern for China, but they do not pose a systemic risk to China’s economic and financial security. However, more sweeping financial sanctions—such as those imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies since 2022—could cause much greater pain for China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Washington and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions targeting major Russian banks, state-owned firms, and key individuals, including President Putin and oligarchs. These measures included freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank foreign reserves, removing Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) international payment system, and restricting exports of critical technologies to weaken Russia’s military and economic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposing similar measures on China could inflict enormous pain on its economy. By cutting off access to dollars and dollar-based institutions, Chinese experts are worried that U.S.-led sanctions could jeopardize three major functions in China’s financial system: trade settlement, investment financing, and monetary policy operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions could disrupt China’s trade flows by blocking cross-border payments. In 2024, China conducted $6 trillion of trade in goods with the rest of the world, roughly 71 percent of which was denominated in dollars and other foreign currencies. These transactions are facilitated by a series of dollar-based international institutions, most notably SWIFT, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), and various intermediary banks financing the trade process. Sanctions that bar access to these institutions would significantly curtail the ability of Chinese importers and exporters to settle payments for goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, some of China’s trading partners would likely attempt to utilize alternative payment infrastructure. Yet many of China’s high-value imports are manufactured exclusively by companies in the United States or allied regions and thus would be particularly difficult for China to replace. Sanctions would likely also block China’s exporters from reaching key overseas markets, undercutting their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CAPlkrT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image36&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of China’s Trade Denominated in RMB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-led financial restrictions could also constrain China’s ability to raise capital and finance industry growth. China’s dollar-denominated debt owed to foreign lenders totaled just over $1 trillion as of June 2024, and it continues to raise funds through bond sales overseas. Chinese companies likewise raise money in foreign equity markets. Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges held a market capitalization of $1.1 trillion as of March 2025, and many more receive dollar-based venture capital funding and other forms of direct investment. U.S.-led sanctions could sever access to these avenues for raising capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, U.S.-led sanctions could destabilize Beijing’s monetary policy priorities. Massive reserves of U.S. dollars are essential to the ability of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to achieve its primary mandate to “maintain the stability of the value of the currency and thereby promote economic growth.” The exact value of dollar-based assets held by the PBOC is subject to debate, but a rough estimate suggests a ballpark figure of $1.6 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Washington and its allies sought to exert pressure on Beijing, they could coordinate to freeze China’s dollar reserve assets held within their borders. This would quickly cause a shortage of dollars in China, leading to a drop in the value of the RMB, a shock in import prices, and challenges in meeting debt repayment obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We should … oppose interference in internal affairs, oppose unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction”, and jointly create a peaceful and stable development environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping-2020-brics-leaders-summit&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping, 2020 BRICS Leaders’ Summit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about these threats have galvanized Beijing to accelerate efforts toward sanctions resilience. China has sharply criticized U.S. sanctions against China and Russia, describing them as acts of U.S. “long-arm jurisdiction” (长臂管辖). Beijing responded to initial U.S. sanctions by passing an Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law in 2021, which set up a legal framework for China to retaliate against sanctions. This framework was expanded in March 2024 to include a broader array of retaliatory measures, an indicator that Beijing is bracing for deepening geopolitical conflict with its international rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Chinese leaders are striving to develop alternative financial infrastructure to reduce reliance on Western-dominated systems, and they view RMB internationalization as a cornerstone of strengthening China’s geopolitical position vis-à-vis the United States. However, despite notable progress, China’s financial system continues to rely heavily on U.S. dollars and thereby remains vulnerable to the threat of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2021, China passed the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, building upon the pre-existing Foreign Trade Law and other legislation outlining safeguards and retaliatory measures against sanctions attempts. This was updated and expanded in March 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has sought to reduce reliance on dollar-based payment infrastructure by establishing alternatives like the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which has grown to include 168 direct participants and 1461 indirect participants spread across every major geographic region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has also been expanding its network of currency swap agreements, which are designed to improve RMB liquidity to partner economies experiencing financial crises. These efforts include agreements with 42 central banks or monetary authorities to date (discussed more below).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s policymakers have discreetly shifted China’s some of central bank reserves to state-owned banks and simultaneously downsized its U.S. Treasury holdings, both of which have the effect of obscuring Beijing’s monetary policy maneuvering.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-2-high-debt&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 2: High Debt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising debt levels are another key threat to China’s financial security. China’s economy is permeated by highly indebted firms, which is a drag on overall economic performance and jeopardizes Beijing’s “bottom line of no systemic financial risks” (不发生系统性金融风险的底线). China’s high debt levels also weaken its international competitiveness by dissuading risk-averse investors from entering Chinese markets, thereby undermining Beijing’s stated goal of global financial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial regulators often discuss these concerns in terms of improving China’s “macro leverage ratio” (i.e. its debt-to-GDP ratio), which the 14th Five-Year Plan highlighted as a key dimension of financial security. China’s non-financial debt reached 292 percent of GDP in 2024, which is considerably higher than most other major economies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cFYRHCQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Rising Debt-to-GDP Ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, this debt is typically divided into central government debt, local government debt, household debt, and debt from private non-financial firms. In practice, however, these debt burdens are closely linked. Local governments that lent to questionable real estate and infrastructure projects are struggling to recoup their investments amid China’s ongoing real estate sector slowdown, and a growing number of local government-related investment products have defaulted or been flagged with warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Household debt is also exposed to turbulence in the real estate market, not least because 60 percent of household debt is in the form of residential mortgages. Taken together, this brittle network of non-performing debt creates risks of financial contagion and cascading crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s debt-related vulnerabilities are complicated by its exposure to geopolitical risk. Increased tariffs levied by President Trump in March 2025 will strain Chinese manufacturers operating on thin margins and likely push some into default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas trade in Chinese bonds is similarly exposed. The total size of China’s offshore bond market is estimated to sit at roughly $780 billion, which supplements the $579 billion worth of foreign holdings of onshore Chinese bonds. This market has historically served as a supplemental source of fundraising for local governments, one that would be cut off if U.S. investors were forced to dump Chinese assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, Beijing’s ability to address China’s debt is constrained by U.S. monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, Chinese policymakers could ease the burden of indebted firms by reducing the PBOC’s benchmark interest rates and thereby lowering the cost of firms’ interest payments. This is more difficult, however, when the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains high U.S. benchmark rates—as it did from 2022 to 2024—because lower PBOC rates prompt global investors to withdraw investments from Chinese markets and chase higher returns in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat of capital flight is illustrated in part by the widening gap in returns on U.S. versus Chinese 10-year government bonds. Now that the Fed has lowered rates, Beijing has gained more room for maneuverability to cut its own rates, but this trend could reverse if inflationary pressure returns to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z2scZnK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image38&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Diverging Interest Rates Prompt Capital Flight from China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s efforts to reduce debt—often referred to as a deleveraging campaign—was formally launched in 2016 and remains in full swing. It has used an assortment of tools to address unsustainable debt:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has launched several rounds of stimulus to curb debt growth and help firms clean up their balance sheets. One recent package launched in November 2024 and included $1.4 trillion worth of debt alleviation measures. Several more interventions were announced at China’s 2025 Two Sessions meeting.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has sought to address hidden debt through a series of regulatory reforms (discussed below), which sought to close regulatory gaps around peer-to-peer financing and other forms of invisible or unregulated lending.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Xi has vowed to support indebted local governments by reforming the central-local government revenue-sharing system. Thus far, however, concrete measures have been limited.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing attempted to curtail real estate debt with its “three red lines” policy in 2020, which backfired when the ensuing collapse in the real estate market led to government bailouts of indebted property developers. The three red lines policy was relaxed in 2023, and the real estate sector’s looming debt remains unaddressed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-3-shallow-financial-markets&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 3: Shallow Financial Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major vulnerability in China’s financial security is its lack of appealing RMB-denominated investment assets. Economists often describe China’s markets as “shallow,” meaning that they struggle to absorb incoming capital in a way that generates strong returns for investors. This hampers Beijing’s stated goals of attracting foreign investment and deepening global financial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping signaled a renewed commitment to improving investor access to China in his address to the Boao Forum for Asia in 2018, the 40th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping’s pivotal Reform and Opening policy. Yet despite the ongoing commitment to financial opening (金融业开放), China’s presence in international financial markets remains small relative to the size of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese-owned investments in foreign markets and foreign-owned assets in Chinese markets—respectively referred to as assets and liabilities in China’s international investment position—are a fraction of those of the United States and other financial powerhouses. In aggregate, China’s small international investment position reflects its limited integration with global financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5SZePTN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Modest International Investment Position&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s three largest financial markets face distinct challenges that limit investor interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking&lt;/strong&gt; is subject to hands-on state intervention that steers capital toward sectors prioritized by the central government. Foreign and domestic lenders alike face pressure to support state-affiliated firms, even though returns on these loans underperform returns on private-sector lending by as much as two percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity markets&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, remain speculative and unpredictable. Despite attempts at regulatory intervention, China’s stock market performance is often untethered to the performance of its real economy, and its track record of volatility dissuades institutional investors from looking for stable sources of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real estate&lt;/strong&gt; was long viewed as one of the sole remaining safe havens for capital, given the lack of reliable returns on lending and equity investments. However, when China’s real estate bubble burst in 2021, would-be investors were left with few good options for investing latent savings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/30kcXph.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Stocks Underperform Other Markets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with few good domestic investment opportunities, Chinese investors have pursued investment opportunities abroad. To avoid the destabilizing effects of capital flight, Beijing maintains capital controls that limit the free flow of money in and out of China’s borders. Capital controls leave openings for some outbound investment into global markets, but Chinese investors must navigate complex investment mechanisms and cat-and-mouse regulatory enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors, on the other hand, are deterred from entering Chinese markets due to the risk that resources cannot be withdrawn if their investments turn sour. These concerns are augmented by heightened geopolitical risk, which investors fear could lead to further tightening of investment restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect is a barrier to China’s global financial integration and a threat to its long-term financial vitality. The shallowness of China’s markets stands in sharp contrast to the United States. The U.S. financial sector’s near-limitless ability to absorb capital from other countries is a consequence of its abundance of worthwhile investment opportunities. The United States remains a perennially appealing investment destination because investors know they can receive a strong rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AOjAjhQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Lags the U.S. in Inbound Investment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One upside of China’s capital controls and other barriers to financial integration is that they significantly insulate China’s financial system from external shocks. This was demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis, which damaged the Chinese financial system less than other financial hubs. The trade-off between insulation and integration continues to confront Chinese policymakers, and heightened geopolitical risk complicates this calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After a precipitous drop in foreign investment during the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese regulators have announced efforts to attract foreign investors, though these steps remain modest.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In April 2024, the State Council published new guidance on capital market regulation, calling for more conservative approaches to stock listings and strengthened supervisory approaches.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2024, Chinese regulators subsequently tightened reporting requirements around stock market listings to tamp down on IPO speculation and improve transparency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In September 2024, Shanghai and Beijing moved to relax capital controls and facilitate easier cross-border flows of funds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s leadership has promised deeper reforms in 2025, but international observers remain skeptical.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-4-weak-oversight-of-financial-firms&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 4: Weak Oversight of Financial Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s last major financial vulnerability is weak regulatory oversight, particularly in its management of firm-level financial risk. China’s financial system is distinguished by a strong state presence in firm management and capital allocation. In other words, the state has a strong say in what gets funded. Chinese policymakers use state-owned banks and investment funds to steer financial resources toward priority industries, which Beijing believes will foster long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that these priority sectors tend to underperform in the short term. Because these firms are shielded from market logic (i.e. propped up by state support), they require scrupulous regulatory oversight to ensure their financial resources are not being mismanaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping and other officials have repeatedly emphasized the need for stronger firm-level financial governance. The narrowing gap between private and state-backed firm performance suggests these efforts have yielded some success. Nevertheless, regulatory challenges have continued to evolve as the financial landscape grows more complex, and financial planners have struggled to rise to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qDUBe8J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Private Firms Tend to Outperform State-Backed Firms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of China’s regulatory failures stem from low state capacity. China’s financial regulators are often stretched thin, and many report inadequate resources and poor pay. These conditions make regulatory bureaucrats vulnerable to being bought off by companies seeking political favors or lighter regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is endemic corruption and regulatory capture in the state-owned sector, which surpasses every other sector besides village committees in terms of corruption cases. Xi Jinping’s flagship anti-corruption campaign has attempted to curtail the problem by threatening (and implementing) harsh punitive measures, but some scholars argue that the challenge will persist until the underlying structural issues are solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G7snT5T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Corruption Crackdown Continues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of low state capacity also relates to ongoing coordination challenges. In the past decade, non-traditional financial business models—like those of the now-curtailed peer-to-peer lending sector—dodged regulatory oversight by growing within the gaps of China’s mosaic of central and local regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has attempted to address this problem through several iterations of regulatory reform. The cost of these frequent regulatory reshuffles is an exacerbated sense of policy unpredictability. In an uncertain policy landscape, businesses are reluctant to invest in new ventures, particularly given Beijing’s track record of unexpectedly censuring whole industries at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these factors weaken the competitiveness of China’s financial sector in the global landscape. Foreign investors complain that they face a disadvantage against state-owned firms, which receive cheaper credit and a preferential regulatory environment. Political uncertainty chills inbound investments by limiting foreign firms’ ability to forecast costs and benefits. Finally, high-profile arrests of corporate executives have soured China’s reputation as a good place to do business, and existing leaders must take great care to avoid falling afoul of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has restructured its financial regulatory apparatus repeatedly in recent years, though its reforms have not necessarily led to deeper liberalization.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2018, Beijing consolidated the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission into the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and reshuffled the regulatory purview of the PBOC and other organs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing restructured this system again in 2023, further consolidating authority into the National Financial Regulatory Administration and establishing the Central Financial Commission within the CCP.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State regulators have also taken steps to reform the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to improve returns on investors. Thus far, these efforts appear to have led to improvements in SOE stock performance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-in-chinas-financial-security&quot;&gt;Strengths in China’s Financial Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges discussed above, Beijing’s financial policymakers wield a few distinct advantages that bolster the long-term prospects for China’s financial system. Chinese policymakers have long emphasized that the “financial sector should serve the real economy,” which involves tangible goods and services. Indeed, the strongest arguments for China’s financial vitality stem not from any inherent qualities of its financial institutions but rather in the durability of its underlying economic system. China’s massive manufacturing sector, vast consumer markets, and global technology leadership all fuel the engine of growth that underpins financial resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these external sources of strength, China’s financial system also possesses three key internal advantages, each of which is analyzed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extensive trade ties&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing role in multilateral governance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Innovative tools for macroeconomic regulation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-1-extensive-trade-ties&quot;&gt;Strength 1: Extensive Trade Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial system benefits from its extensive trade ties. Trade has played a pivotal role in China’s economic rise and is enshrined in the 14th five-year plan as one pillar of China’s “dual circulation” strategy (国内国际双循环), which outlines an integrated economic approach to pursuing domestic and foreign market opportunities. These trade ties form a bedrock on which China can influence global financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials point to the benefits of trade ties for accelerating financial initiatives like RMB internationalization, which in turn secures and strengthens China’s financial position in a geopolitical context. Though recent rhetoric from Beijing has sought to emphasize the domestic pillar of China’s dual circulation policy, its trade network remains integral to China’s overall economic and financial posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade network spans the globe. In 2023, 44 countries listed China as their top overall trading partner by trade in goods, and 110 countries listed China as one of their top three sources of imports. In 2024, the combined value of China’s total goods imports and exports reached $6 trillion, returning to a healthy 5 percent year-over-year growth after an uneven performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pOLtCRW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Global Trade Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing leverages China’s trade network to accelerate its push for RMB internationalization. These efforts are most clearly seen in China’s imports of oil, gas, critical minerals, and other commodities. The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange, Shanghai International Energy Exchange, and Ganzhou Rare Metal Exchange are three trade hubs launched in recent years that each facilitate RMB-denominated trade. As a result of these efforts, China conducted 28.8 percent of its goods trade in RMB in 2024, a 2.7 percentage point increase from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of RMB-denominated trade and financial institutions is not merely a matter of coercion on Beijing’s part. RMB-based financing provides some trade partners with meaningful benefits over dollar-based financing. When U.S. interest rates are high (as in the past few years), dollars become scarce, and dollar-based trade financing grows more expensive. RMB-based trade can help developing economies conserve their dollars during such periods of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to boosting RMB internationalization, China’s trade ties provide a deterrent against the most aggressive forms of Western sanctions. The United States and its allies continue to rely deeply on trade with China, so imposing sweeping sanctions on China would result in immense blowback for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, if Western countries impose sanctions on China, China’s trade relationships with non-Western countries would provide avenues for continued economic growth. Countries within BRICS+ and China’s Belt and Road Initiative—which conceivably might not follow U.S.-led sanctions—could be willing to provide China with export markets and commodity sources even amidst a sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that China’s extensive trade relationships do come with downsides, particularly when its trade practices are perceived to distort domestic economies. Washington has made no secret of its frustration with China’s alleged manufacturing overcapacity, but less often discussed are parallel dynamics playing out across developing economies around the world. Beijing has shown some signs that it is listening to these complaints, but without more decisive action, more of China’s trade ties risk turning into diplomatic liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has cultivated its trade network through a combination of bilateral and plurilateral initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is China’s flagship platform for international development engagement. It has been used to establish infrastructure for commodity extraction and transport as well as markets for exports of Chinese manufactured goods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BRI is a platform for other, more targeted initiatives such as the Digital Silk Road, which promotes technology-related trade and investment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a plurilateral trade agreement signed by China and 14 other countries across the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has a total of 22 free trade agreements that reach 29 countries; 10 more free trade agreements are under negotiation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These large-scale initiatives are complemented by more targeted platforms for specific trade, such as China’s network of commodity exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-2-a-growing-role-in-multilateral-governance&quot;&gt;Strength 2: A Growing Role in Multilateral Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade ties lend heft to Beijing’s efforts to shape multilateral financial governance, which continue to gain traction. Xi Jinping articulated China’s vision for financial governance reform at the Kazan BRICS summit in October 2024 and again at the Rio de Janeiro G20 summit in November 2024. In both addresses, Xi expressed frustration about China’s disproportionately small voice (relative to the size of the economy) in established multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s two-pronged approach for greater influence over financial governance includes reforming existing institutions and expanding the scope and remit of alternative institutions like the BRICS consortium. These efforts closely intersect with the RMB internationalization drive discussed above but also encompass a range of other mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Chinese policymakers have been steadily working to establish bilateral currency swap agreements with central banks in partner countries. These agreements provide access to RMB during periods of financial turbulence, allowing the PBOC to function as an international lender of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in RMB currency swaps has increased in recent years as dollar scarcity has created liquidity issues for many smaller economies. As of October 2024, China has signed currency swap agreements with 42 countries, with a total capacity of 3.8 trillion RMB (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). These efforts complement the RMB-based trade financing initiatives discussed above, particularly in countries with which the United States has been more reluctant to establish parallel dollar-based swap lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4VZcMv2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Growing Network of Currency Swap Agreements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Beijing has pressed for a greater role in other financial governance architecture, including financial early warning systems, reserve currency pooling agreements, and trade dispute settlement mechanisms. China’s progress on these initiatives has been uneven, but the growing ranks of countries joining China’s multilateral financial institutions point to the global appetite for alternative approaches to financial governance. The recently expanded BRICS consortium serves as Beijing’s preferred launch point for new financial architecture like the BRICS Pay cross-border payment settlement initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Beijing is pushing for a more prominent voice in established global financial governance institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO. These efforts have begun to bear fruit in the form of higher voting shares and greater presence in leadership positions, but Chinese leaders argue that they remain under-represented in these institutions.Last, China’s role as a regional financial leader is spurred by its significant development finance activity. Beijing conducts development finance diplomacy bilaterally through the BRI and multilaterally through organizations like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB). China’s role in these institutions boosts its regional financial integration and helps it shape development priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, these priorities emphasize infrastructure investment. By steering development capital toward infrastructure projects—as opposed to health or education projects, for instance—Chinese policy leaders create new markets for China’s massive industrial base. The role of overseas infrastructure projects rose in importance during the 2010s as China’s industrial base ran out of useful domestic infrastructure projects in which to invest. That said, the future of China’s development finance has been called into question amidst falling investment counts and mounting diplomatic pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/967mPNn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image46&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Overseas Development Finance Spending&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, BRICS expanded from its original constituent countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and later South Africa—to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to an invitation to join, and Argentina was invited but declined. This wave of expansion leaves open the door for more additional to BRICS’ ranks in the coming years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has continued efforts to expand its network of currency swap agreements, designed to boost international use of the RMB. China now has currency swap agreements with 42 countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is supporting the development of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), also known as BRICS Pay, as an alternative to SWIFT for managing cross-border payments. Other initiatives, like the nascent BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism, are in the early days of planning.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-3-innovative-tools-for-macroeconomic-regulation&quot;&gt;Strength 3: Innovative Tools for Macroeconomic Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts at firm-level regulation have been stymied by corruption and misaligned incentives, as discussed above, but its track record of stable governance is actually somewhat stronger. In particular, Beijing has pioneered novel tools for managing what economists refer to as macroprudential supervision (宏观审慎监管). Chinese financial regulators learned hard lessons in the wake of the 2015-16 stock market crash, which many argue was exacerbated by poor policy choices. Since then, China’s financial system has not exactly flourished, but it has avoided a repeat of systemic financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s process of iterative regulatory learning has yielded a more extensive set of tools for managing financial and monetary activity. The use of state-owned banks for monetary policy objectives is one such example. Observers have noted that in recent years, China’s state-owned banks have filled roles traditionally performed by a central bank, including stabilizing exchange rates, controlling credit volumes, and serving as lenders of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unorthodox policy tools are only possible in China’s unique state-led model of financial regulation. Early evidence suggests that these innovations augment state financial capacity and improve monetary policy efficacy, though they create oversight liabilities as well. In any case, such novel financial levers have stymied Western analysts’ standard approaches to monetary surveillance and prompted calls for revised accounting methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing maintains strong control over private and semi-private lending institutions as well. This can invite the corruption-related regulatory challenges discussed earlier, but the upshot is that private sector capital can be quickly rallied to quell crises. Since 2015, Beijing has called upon its so-called “national team” of wealth management funds (illustrated below) to buy up stocks during periods of turbulence. This strategy of enlisting quasi-public firms to support macroprudential goals is often in tension with firm-level regulation, and Chinese regulators will doubtless continue to wrestle with the appropriate balance as they continue to pursue financial reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XmoZ6nH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image47&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Key Players in China’s “National Team”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing increasingly uses its tight control over China’s financial institutions to direct them to support China’s macroeconomic goals. These unorthodox policy interventions would be difficult or impossible in the United States or other liberalized economies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2015, Chinese financial planners have made use of a “national team” of state-backed banks and investment firms to step in and buy stocks during periods of turbulence. The most recent evidence of national team intervention was in December 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Evidence also indicates Beijing has called on state-owned banks to prop up the value of the yuan by buying yuan and selling dollars during periods of depreciation, essentially using commercial banks to offload one of the central bank’s core mandates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also issued guidance to commercial banks to reduce the interest rates for loans to other banks, in an attempt to stimulate growth by expanding credit across the economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the vulnerabilities in China’s financial security position outweigh its strengths. This assessment is reflected in China’s uneven financial performance and faltering progress toward global financial integration. As such, it is unlikely that China’s financial system will prove an equal competitor to that of the United States, Europe, or Japan in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of China’s financial security shortcomings relate to its faltering progress toward financial liberalization. Beijing’s rhetorical praise for pursuing financial openness creates an odd juxtaposition with its policy track record, which still prefers state priorities and top-down directives. China’s policymakers attempt to square this circle with a signature two-track financial system, which carves out a space for market-based international competition while retaining a prominent role for state-owned firms. Yet foreign investors interpret Beijing’s regulatory mixed signals as an attempt to have its cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China’s financial system does possess significant latent strengths that draw from the scale and vitality of its economy. Chinese policymakers continue to shore up financial vulnerabilities and have recently signaled their commitment toward rebalancing the domestic economy and boosting consumption. In addition, Beijing continues to expand commercial ties with partners abroad, especially with developing economies that are frustrated with the established U.S.-led financial system and seeking alternative institutions. It remains to be seen whether these strengths will translate into sustainable growth in China’s financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

Such is the case for quantum technologies, where export controls accelerate China’s localized quantum supply chain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of quantum technologies is anticipated to bring both foundational capability advances to commercial and dual-use applications, including to computing, sensing, and the transfer of information. This makes quantum technologies a global political priority, including in the UK and the EU. Under the Biden administration, US leadership in quantum and other “force-multiplying” technologies, such as advanced semiconductors, have become a key national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has therefore intensified its export controls on quantum technologies aimed at China over the past year. These measures have resulted in disruptions to China’s quantum hardware and talent development, but they also accelerated China’s domestic quantum supply chain. By forcing leading laboratories and quantum start-ups to rapidly iterate with domestic suppliers in replacing foreign dependencies, export controls brought the demand side on board with Chinese localisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, the basis for a self-reliant Chinese quantum supply chain was created years ago by strong government support and indications of US quantum controls as early as 2018. Now, with a parallel quantum ecosystem rapidly emerging, it is only a matter of time until exports from Chinese suppliers arrive in Europe. This presents both risks and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalating-quantum-controls-in-2024&quot;&gt;Escalating quantum controls in 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) initiated a “Review of Controls for Certain Emerging Technologies”, including quantum in 2018 already, list-based US export controls on quantum computing were only finalised five years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the US mostly relied on end-user controls, placing Chinese companies, institutes and universities on its Entity List for their involvement in quantum technologies. Absent licenses (which are usually denied), this bars affected entities from importing nearly any US-origin items. The most significant additions came in 2024, when the US also finalized outbound investment controls, banning most US investments in China’s quantum sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalating measures further, the BIS issued broad list-based quantum computing controls in September 2024 Besides requiring licenses for the export of (sufficiently powerful) quantum computers, the export of key components and related software is also restricted. For example, exporting dilution refrigerators to a Chinese research group or cryogenic circuits to a Chinese supplier of quantum computing systems would require license applications, with review policy “presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September 2024 controls are internationally coordinated and introduce an exception for partnering countries that enact similar controls on quantum technologies. The UK is currently listed among all US exceptions and, alongside other European countries, Japan, and Canada, has already introduced similar controls in the months prior to US controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plurilateral alignment of the controls among an ad-hoc group of US partners is crucial to ensure that they are effective and limit self-harm. At the same time, closely tracking US controls limits the UK in independently setting rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-controls-are-accelerating-chinas-quantum-supply-chain&quot;&gt;Export Controls are Accelerating China’s Quantum Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While export controls temporarily slow down Chinese quantum progress, they also turbocharge the development of a domestic supply chain and, in the long term, may run counter to the stated goal of maintaining technological competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long delay leading up to the current quantum export controls has given Chinese planners and entrepreneurs time to prepare. Compared to the deep and highly specialised semiconductor supply chain, the quantum supply chain is still more shallow and dispersed, making it more feasible to innovate around restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the restrictions, convincing buyers to choose unproven, local suppliers over established international alternatives was a key hurdle for Chinese upstream suppliers. Export controls limited the extent to which international companies could sell into China, forcing downstream labs and companies in China to turn to local alternatives and do their best to help them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where foreign options still exist, local suppliers often outperform foreign ones at service, especially on-premises repairs and support – something that would otherwise require a shipment to Europe or the US. Export controls exacerbate this competitive disadvantage by complicating customs procedures and adding uncertainty to the availability of cross-border support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s commercial quantum ecosystem is frequently belittled: Chinese big tech largely left the sector, and state laboratories dominate the most impressive announcements. Nonetheless, comparing the competition in quantum to a “struggle between private free enterprise and state-directed communism” fails to recognize Chinese efforts to create a thriving commercial quantum ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of expanding commercial activity, China’s Quantum Internet Industry Alliance was established in 2022 and has since grown to over 90 members. In China’s leading university for quantum science, the market-driven commercialisation of research results is explicitly encouraged, with many resulting quantum start-ups. This system – including shared benefits for both the university and researchers to incentivize commercial application – is not dissimilar to Western universities, including in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More venture capital for quantum start-ups, admittedly dominated by government funds, is also a recent political priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-reliant supply chains for microwave interconnects and dilution refrigerators are less flashy than quantum supremacy claims, but they are part of the rapidly advancing foundation for China’s future quantum industry, accelerated by recent export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrary-to-western-perceptions-china-is-still-keen-to-internationalise-its-quantum-sector&quot;&gt;Contrary to Western Perceptions, China is Still Keen to Internationalise its Quantum Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s quantum strategy is often framed as intentionally insular in Western media. While a push towards self-reliance is indeed central in China’s science and technology planning, relative to the US and the UK, China’s quantum sector is currently less securitised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading Chinese quantum researchers call for international collaboration, foreign involvement in China’s quantum industry is officially encouraged, and China’s own quantum export controls are mostly limited to licenses for quantum cryptography and cryogenic components. In a recent call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Xi Jinping highlighted quantum for the cultivation of “incremental cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official Chinese proclamations of benign open innovation do deserve scepticism due to stated ambitions of self-reliant technological dominance in key sectors. However, these same ambitions rely on participation in global standards, high-tech exports, and access to global IP, making an insular quantum strategy an unlikely proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese policy documents frame quantum technologies as a “future industry”, contrasted to a US approach that highlights quantum as a “national security imperative” with a more narrow focus on leading capabilities. This resembles the situation in AI, where US policymakers see an arms race to super intelligence while Xi Jinping emphasises broad applications and (open source) ecosystem building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s national security whitepaper acknowledges quantum technologies as a “double-edged sword” but insists that cooperation and win-win results are unstoppable. With “non-development” framed as the biggest security risk, more scientific and technological Chinese exports bolster China’s national security by proving the competitiveness of local champions, shaping global standards, and boosting economic development. In this view, quantum is just one piece in China’s broader strategy to move up the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the current stage, it is therefore likely that Chinese quantum export restrictions remain largely limited to dual-use applications, as opposed to more comprehensive sectoral controls in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brutal domestic competition will create export pressure in China’s quantum supply chain, exacerbated by local government competition and many new entrants following the call to develop “future industries” and hoping to fill the void left by foreign supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one should not expect Chinese quantum computers in European HPC centres anytime soon, the upstream supply chain in photonics, electronics, cryogenics and vacuum systems is bound to see Chinese entrants. Take the example of Precilaser, whose laser sources are used in quantum experiments. Besides taking domestic market share, Precilaser has exported nearly one hundred sets to Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, this export market is still in its infancy, with little international patenting for example. This gives policymakers in the UK time to consider both the risks and opportunities from the participation of Chinese quantum companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-handling-of-the-coming-chinese-quantum-exports&quot;&gt;The UK’s Handling of the Coming Chinese Quantum Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike dependencies in end-devices such as 5G infrastructure, Chinese components in quantum R&amp;amp;D pose few direct security risks. Still, due to the importance of quantum technology to future economic security and the recent emphasis on technological sovereignty, the UK should monitor dependencies on Chinese suppliers and decide what it deems and does not deem acceptable. This is especially true for military procurement, which aims to expand links with deep tech and agile start-ups, including in quantum, among the reorganizations called for by the UK’s recent Strategic Defence Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if policy makers look beyond the defence tech angle, they will see that preventively closing the door to Chinese exports or introducing costly screening procedures risks doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of quantum technologies is a long game, with some of the most significant foundational applications likely still more than 10 years in the future. It is unlikely that the Western quantum ecosystem will out-innovate an increasingly decoupled Chinese quantum sector across the board. Retaining channels through which innovations and new technological paradigms can diffuse to the UK is the prudent choice. This is often overlooked in the current emphasis on protecting Western innovations through export controls, implicitly assuming enduring and comprehensive Western leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides export controls, import controls and government screening of business transactions will become more important as quantum technologies are adopted in the wider economy. The US already does the former, and the UK explicitly lists quantum technologies in its “National Security and Investment Act.” These tools should be applied with caution. Joint projects, such as a reported quantum computing centre by China-based Origin Quantum in Spain, could create valuable pathways for diffusion and insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, the quantum competition is seen purely through a national security lens, with policy tools chosen accordingly. Yet the reason that companies, and the Chinese government, invest billions in quantum technologies is firstly quantum’s potential as a future industry. This is no zero-sum competition, and as the sector matures, the UK should consider borrowing from China’s own past toolbox on technology transfer and local partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to China’s quantum supply chain, if established gradually, can contribute to a competitive UK quantum ecosystem, with companies able to build with the best there is in every category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific theatre, contested logistics will make sustainment and repair of U.S. Air Force (USAF) aircraft difficult. The USAF should consider collaborating with allies and partners to develop the capability to sustain its aircraft near the conflict zone, reinforcing deterrence and enhancing warfighting ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is a key U.S. ally in the region, possessing advanced technical capabilities, a long-standing relationship with the USAF, and an increased strategic focus on its own defense industrial base. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) collaboration could be mutually beneficial for Japan and the United States, providing cost savings, predictable demand, and integration that could strengthen credible deterrence against a common adversary. By leveraging each nation’s strengths, Japan and the United States could bolster their defense capabilities, increase resilience, and better prepare for a potential conflict for a potential conflict in the Inso-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is well positioned to be a capable MRO partner for the USAF. The nation has a strong commercial aviation industry that has existing relationships with U.S. companies. Some of these relationships extend to the military aviation industry, creating opportunities for further integration and expansion of military MRO capabilities, particularly for several military aircraft that are flown by both countries. Japan has recently made investments in its defense industrial base and revised its export regulations, enabling closer defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAF MRO in Japan would build upon a robust set of existing frameworks and strategies focused on addressing sustainment challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum established an open dialogue on MRO with Japan in 2024. The Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience (PIPIR), also launched in 2024, brings together industrial and international partners to integrate MRO strategies. The Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment (GENUS), a USAF program, expands depot maintenance capabilities to ally and partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are challenges to U.S.-Japan MRO cooperation, including export controls that delay the exchange of knowledge, labor, and capital; technical challenges like differing manufacturing standards and quality controls; and a lack of consensus about who will bear the financial burden of investment in expanding capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report identifies recommendations on how to accelerate cooperation to meet the urgent strategic imperative of enhanced MRO capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. The United States could expand on physical and diplomatic infrastructure, send clear demand signals to industry, and use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to allow U.S. companies to explore collaborative opportunities. Both the United States and Japan could identify common systems for MRO cooperation, increase the alignment of their manufacturing standards, embrace modular designs for future acquisition programs, and conduct an exercise to evaluate current joint sustainment capabilities and gaps. Japanese industry could leverage its strong commercial aerospace assets by adapting knowledge, labor, and facilities to support military MRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF is globally postured, with bases, airmen, and aircraft forward positioned across the world to protect and advance the United States’ geostrategic interests. Such a far-flung footprint, while strategically advantageous, creates its own challenges, especially in maintaining USAF aircraft in theater when potential conflicts are likely to involve contested logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges associated with forward presence are particularly evident in the United States Indo-Pacific Command Area of Responsibility. The Indo-Pacific region fuels much of the world’s economic growth and, through trade, supports more than 3 million American jobs. As the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment into the United States, the region has great importance for U.S. national and economic security. Japan is a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific that is investing in advanced defense capabilities and promoting defense industrial cooperation with the United States to enhance jointness and interoperability. Japan’s highly capable industry has the potential to help alleviate the USAF’s maintenance and contested logistics challenges in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and Japan have already taken steps to advance cooperation in aircraft maintenance and repair. The United States has established multiple dialogues and frameworks, such as the DICAS Forum, dedicated to partnering with Japan and exploring sustainment solutions in the Indo-Pacific. Japan has made investments in its defense industrial base and aligned its export laws to enhance defense collaboration, demonstrating its commitment to expanding its defense posture and industry. The United States and Japan should consider building upon and accelerating these efforts as a way to overcome the challenges of maintenance cooperation and meet the urgent strategic need for enhanced sustainment capabilities in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-and-operational-challenges&quot;&gt;Strategic and Operational Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan faces a rapidly deteriorating regional security environment. China’s coercive tactics in the East China Sea, including continued deployments of government vessels into the Senkaku Islands’ territorial waters, are having a corrosive effect on regional security. China is consistently and clearly demonstrating a desire to reshape the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region. China and Russia have increased their joint bomber exercises in the North Pacific and their flying of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) near Japan’s southwest islands, leading the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) to scramble fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An emboldened North Korea, armed with advanced Russian military technology, has also increased the importance of Japanese deterrence and defense capabilities. China has not actively sought a trilateral partnership with North Korea and Russia, but both China and North Korea have supported Russia’s weapons manufacturing since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. North Korea has long posed a threat to regional security, and deterrence strategies must now account for a North Korea that is armed with both nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles and is capable of delivering them to Japan and even to the West Coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance between the United States and the Indo-Pacific presents operational challenges for the U.S. military, particularly in the maintenance of USAF aircraft. Located thousands of miles away from China—its “pacing threat”—the United States faces significant challenges due to its geographic separation from its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The tyranny of distance complicates U.S. efforts to bolster deterrence. In addition to these challenges, the Department of Defense (DOD) faces slower response times and repair delays due to export controls and other bureaucratic hurdles that complicate the performance of repairs outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, the United States is also confronting difficult conditions that exacerbate these challenges. Operating on peacetime footing, “the U.S. defense industrial ecosystem lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility, and surge capability to meet the U.S. military’s production and warfighting needs.” Beyond these production shortcomings, the United States also faces hurdles and inefficiencies from overly restrictive or outdated arms transfer policies and institutions such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, as well serious workforce inadequacies and shortages. Collectively, these constraints have a negative impact on supply chain resilience, military readiness, and sustainment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military security difficulties, Japan has also been forced to reckon with challenges in its defense industrial base, where capacity has suffered due to falling profits, higher costs of technology development, and increased government acquisition spending on foreign technologies over the past decade. This is particularly of note because defense contracts make up only a small fraction of overall revenue for large Japanese companies doing work for Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD). While this means that Japanese companies are more diversified and better equipped to manage financial instability and fluctuations in defense sales, it also means that top management is not singularly focused on managing and growing their defense sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the United States’ most important allies in the Indo-Pacific, Japan could play a key role in ensuring deterrence in the region by helping to overcome the difficulties of contested logistics via cooperation on aircraft maintenance. As discussed below, Japanese companies have strong capabilities in aircraft MRO but currently face challenges in meeting the USAF’s MRO needs in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-strategy-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Deterrence Strategy in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and Japan grapple with growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region, both countries have placed greater emphasis on deterring aggression from potential adversaries. China continues to be an overriding strategic concern, as highlighted in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s initial message to the force on January 25, 2025, where he stressed the importance of working with allies and partners to “deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific by Communist China.” In March 2025, Hegseth called Japan an “indispensable partner” in deterring China and confirmed plans to upgrade of the U.S. military command in Japan to a Joint Force Headquarters. This upgrade allows for improved coordination of bilateral operations between the United States and Japan and is aimed at reestablishing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. These remarks came during Hegseth’s meeting with Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani Gen, in which the two officials agreed to accelerate the process of maintaining U.S. aircraft and ships in Japan, as well as to move forward with plans to jointly produce certain missiles, such as Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF contributes to the deterrence mission and has operated in Japan for decades, with aircraft stationed at Kadena Air Base, Misawa Air Base, and Yokota Air Base. Dr. Troy Meink, during his nomination hearing for secretary of the Air Force in March 2025, stated that “China poses the largest plausible military threat to the United States of America, as well as our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.” China has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific and is rapidly modernizing and advancing its power-projection capabilities with high levels of military spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of USAF deterrence strategy is building credibility through the establishment of effective military infrastructure. One component of that strategy is the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), a set of targeted investments that “enhance U.S. force posture, infrastructure, presence, and readiness as well as the capacity and capabilities of U.S. Allies and partners, specifically in the Indo-Pacific region.” In FY 2025, the PDI requested $9.9 billion across six investment categories, including logistics and maintenance capabilities, prepositioning of equipment, and ally and partner capabilities. Investments in the region, from building new facilities to strengthening the capability of allies and partners, are credible commitments to the region’s defense. The PDI is a signal to adversaries that the United States is dedicated to spending time and money building up its force posture and readiness in the Pacific, translating directly to a willingness to fight and win a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-logistics-and-the-importance-of-mro&quot;&gt;Contested Logistics and the Importance of MRO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict in the Indo-Pacific will be challenging due to the region’s distance from the United States and the growing difficulties of contested logistics, all of which put assets at an increased risk. Contested logistics is defined by the USAF as “an environment in which an adversary presents challenges in all domains and directly targets logistics, operations, facilities, and activities in the United States and abroad, or in transit from one location to another.” To overcome the challenges of contested logistics, the USAF aims to improve forward posture by utilizing information management, enabling agile combat deployment, and fielding improved active and passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any potential conflict will provide China with opportunities to contest and disrupt the United States’ supply chains and logistics. Readily available, pre-staged military assets that would allow U.S. and allied forces to provide protection, intelligence, and sustainment right away in the event of a conflict are crucial. Reducing the time it takes to surge resources from the United States into the Indo-Pacific would help to defeat the tyranny of distance. MRO capabilities in-theater are critical to overcoming these logistics challenges and maintaining deterrence. In-country maintenance capabilities reduce the risk of attack on systems that are being ferried to and from the continental United States for maintenance and makes these systems available more rapidly. It also reduces the demand for additional assets like tankers and ensures that pilots can remain forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-potential-of-us-japanese-collaboration&quot;&gt;The Potential of U.S.-Japanese Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of maintaining deterrence and overcoming contested logistics in the Indo-Pacific have deepened the importance of joint efforts between the United States and Japan to enhance defense industrial cooperation, strategic integration, and sustainment. Both countries stand to gain from regional integrated deterrence, increases in interoperability, and coordination of strategic goals and efforts. By leveraging their individual strengths, Japan and the United States could collectively build their defense industrial bases and better prepare for a possible conflict with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO offers a way to deepen cooperation. Considered a crucial component of military readiness and international defense partnerships, MRO is critical for sustainment efforts and a primary enabler of U.S. military operations. By the DOD’s definition, maintenance and repair pertain specifically to “the overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts, assemblies, or subassemblies, and the testing and reclamation of equipment.” For the USAF, MRO operations mainly revolve around maintaining aircraft and supplying forces with the necessary parts, pieces, and equipment to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD splits maintenance into two categories: field level and depot level. Field-level maintenance refers to organizational maintenance—which can include inspections, servicing, and preventative maintenance—as well as intermediate maintenance, which includes assembly and disassembly. Field-level maintenance includes shop-type work and on-equipment maintenance, both of which are normally performed by an operating unit on a day-to-day basis. Depot-level maintenance is material maintenance or repair that requires overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts or components. Each military service has its own depot-level maintenance infrastructure, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and uniquely trained personnel. More complicated than maintenance are modifications and overhauls. Modifications involve changing components or software; they often need to be done by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), either in-country or back in the United States. MRO operations feature differing degrees of specialization, ranging from simple maintenance at more rudimentary levels to specific modifications that require particular facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government has advocated for the country’s industry to expand its support for U.S. MRO operations in the Indo-Pacific. As MOD has stated, “In general, conducting maintenance and repairs in Japan on U.S. Navy vessels and U.S. Air Force aircraft deployed in the vicinity of Japan, without them returning to mainland U.S., will contribute to strengthening Japan’s defence production and technological bases.” Such maintenance and repair work will also improve “the readiness of U.S. forces by shortening the repair period and increasing efficiency,” a spokesperson stated in 2022, adding that this would improve the “deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance.” This sentiment is in close alignment with Japanese strategic policy as outlined in Japan’s National Defense Strategy and as evidenced by the country’s increasing defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already addresses some of its maintenance needs in Japan. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps contract Japanese companies for maintenance on some aircraft, such as the F/A-18E/F and V-22. Some MRO has also been done on U.S. Navy ships at Japanese shipyards. While the USAF has existing capacities at Kadena, Japanese firms could be called upon to assist the USAF in performing more MRO operations in-theater than is currently possible by contributing extra parts, components, technicians, and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent strategic messaging, investment, and global engagement show encouraging signs of progress for MRO cooperation between the United States and Japan. A key path to overcoming the challenges of cooperation will be to build upon the existing foundation of MRO collaboration, including physical and diplomatic infrastructure. The remainder of this report will examine what the United States and Japan can do to build on existing efforts and further catalyze MRO cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-report-overview&quot;&gt;Methodology and Report Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report draws on interviews, private roundtables, a public event, and independent research to provide an overview of the possibilities for greater cooperation between the United States and Japan on MRO of USAF airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS held two private roundtables that brought together key stakeholders from both countries and other subject matter experts. The first roundtable occurred in October 2024 and focused on Japanese industry. The second roundtable took place in January 2025 and featured greater representation from U.S. industry. A public event held at CSIS in March offered the opportunity for government and industry figures to voice their perspectives to the policy community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry research was compiled from interviews and written surveys as well as from the roundtables. Virtual interviews were conducted with five U.S. companies, and survey answers were collected from six Japanese companies. U.S. and Japanese companies were asked about their current MRO activities, the challenges and opportunities for MRO work with the partner nation, and other topics such as investments and production dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 of this report describes the current state of USAF MRO efforts in Japan and offers data-driven insights into current MRO cooperation. Chapters 3 and 4 sort MRO cooperation challenges in Japan and the United States, respectively, into a typology of barriers. Chapter 5 discusses enablers of greater cooperation. Finally, Chapter 6 provides recommendations to industry and policymakers in the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-state-of-usaf-mro-in-japan&quot;&gt;Current State of USAF MRO in Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF has long maintained a dedicated MRO hub in Japan. The Support Center Pacific (SCP), located at Kadena Air Base, has been providing parts and repair services for USAF assets in the region for over 40 years. The SCP primarily produces depot-level repair parts; in 2013, for instance, it provided over 3,000 assets to the theater. With over 90 employees, the SCP has the capability to maintain a wide range of aircraft and service more than 125 different aircraft components from both the USAF and foreign militaries, including Taiwanese F-16s. The center provides in-theater services for the A-10, C-5, C-130, F-16, F-15C/D, F-15E, KC-135, HH-60, E-3, and MQ-9 aircraft, and works with allied forces within the supply chain to ensure swift support of air assets. The center’s skilled workforce has an average of 20 years of experience and is cross-trained to handle multiple functions, giving the SCP flexibility to meet the changing needs of the USAF and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the SCP provides the USAF with a significant independent capability in Japan, the United States continues to seek out joint solutions to sustainment in contested logistics environments. In 2024, the DOD rolled out a new plan to launch military repair hubs across the Indo-Pacific. Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines were named as partners in this expansion of the DOD’s network of repair hubs across the world. The announcement aligns with the Regional Sustainment Framework (RSF), which advances collaboration with allies and partners as a solution to conducting MRO closer to the point of need, avoiding the costly and time-consuming process of sending military equipment back to the United States for repairs. While the DOD’s network of MRO hubs contributes to integrated deterrence, these hubs are also prepared to handle “battle-damaged equipment” in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanded MRO cooperation with Japan would also build on existing relationships between the U.S. government and Japanese industry. The Komaki South Plant, operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), functions as a regional depot for the F-35 airframe. The Mizuho Plant, operated by IHI Corporation, also functions as a regional depot for the F-35, specifically its F135 engine. The potential expansion of Japan’s aircraft servicing capacity would match the country’s strategic shift toward increasing its domestic defense capacity, defense spending, and focus on national security. Servicing and maintaining USAF aircraft in Japan will significantly reduce the turnaround time of returning aircraft to service, bolstering regional security and partially solving the pressing issue of MRO logistics in potentially contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;institutional-frameworks-and-strategies-for-cooperation&quot;&gt;Institutional Frameworks and Strategies for Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has a robust set of institutional frameworks and strategies focused on addressing sustainment challenges and deterrence obstacles faced by the Air Force in the Indo-Pacific region. These emphasize the importance of MRO operations and the critical leveraging of relationships with allies and partners. For example, the RSF seeks to bring together industrial and international partners to strengthen MRO capabilities overseas. By prioritizing engagement with allies and partners, the RSF strives to “build a collective and resilient co-sustainment ecosystem” that can enhance military readiness, quickly respond to persistent threats, and deter regional aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSF builds on the strategic and operational priorities outlined in the Pacific Air Force (PACAF) Strategy 2030, which provides direction to the command’s 46,000 Airmen and civilians across strategic areas, including resilient basing, contested logistics, and the training of multi-capable Airmen. As reflected in this and other foundational USAF policies, collaborative MRO efforts like reciprocal aerial refueling and maintenance integration are critical to enhancing the USAF’s adaptability and ensuring aircraft are airworthy and ready to fly, enabling Airmen to leverage their skills and experience in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum is another key enabler in the U.S. defense industrial toolkit that makes joint projects mutually beneficial to Japan and the United States. Similarly to the RSF, DICAS seeks to “accelerate coordination toward co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment” by pursuing mutually beneficial objectives, tackling obstacles jointly, and expanding defense industrial base opportunities for both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience (PIPIR) directly supports the RSF and the DOD’s implementation of the National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS). PIPIR is focused on enhancing defense industrial collaboration between the United States and its allies in the region. Centered around a core vision statement that defines strategic principles to guide collaboration, PIPIR has brought partners together around four workstreams: sustainment, production, supply chain resilience, and policy and optimization. Having agreed that the delivery of material solutions is integral to defense industrial resilience, the 13 countries that comprise PIPIR have appointed leadership for each workstream and committed to the creation of an advisory board to complement and inform joint efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF’s Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment (GENUS) compliments RSF, PIPIR and DICAS by focusing on the expansion of depot maintenance capabilities beyond the shores of the United States, including in the Indo-Pacific. The USAF will operationalize RSF using the GENUS framework. By leveraging relationships with allies and partners around the world, GENUS aims to strengthen alliances, processes, and capabilities to increase depot-level max capacity, embed personnel, and improve regional supply chains. The framework aims to bring aircraft component repair capabilities to regional repair facilities in places such as Japan. The USAF is investing in Forward Air Logistics Complex Operational Nodes (FALCON) to embed depot-level maintenance within operational units, offering a further opportunity for aircraft repair to take place in Japan. In remarks at an event hosted by CSIS in March 2025, Lt. Gen. Stacey T. Hawkins described Japan as a prime candidate for FALCON expansion due to its strong existing military partnership with the United States and discussed the potential for partnership with Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft-mro-in-the-data&quot;&gt;Aircraft MRO in the Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the growing strength of institutions designed to enable defense industrial cooperation, U.S.-Japanese cooperation on the MRO of USAF aircraft in Japan would build upon a strong foundation of existing contracts and relationships between the U.S. military and Japanese companies, many of which have worked on contracts for the U.S. military for decades. Japanese firms have cooperated with U.S. firms to produce aircraft parts like Stage 1 Integrally Bladed Rotors for the F135, for example, the manufacture of which began in 2024. Local firms have already provided MRO services for U.S. Navy aircraft, such as the F/A-18, in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the DOD’s Japan-related MRO contracts are already with Japanese vendors, except in a few specialized categories. Figure 1 depicts DOD MRO product and service contracts for aircraft from 2012–23 that are either conducted in Japan, held by a Japanese company or linked to a Japanese parent company, or that use materials that are majority Japanese in origin. U.S.-owned vendors hold all contracts in quality control, testing, and inspections due to the highly technical nature of this category; the same is true for technical representatives, as U.S. OEMs send their own engineers to Japan to work on their aircraft when there are restrictions on intellectual property (IP) or other constraints. In a conversation with CSIS, a U.S. industry representative explained that in some cases, engineers from the OEMs are the only ones who that can perform repairs because the OEMs own the IP. Outside these specialized categories, the data suggests that Japanese industry is capable of performing a majority of the MRO work being done in that country—especially in maintenance and repairs, the largest and most labor-intensive category of MRO activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2014 DOD initiative that named Australia and Japan as F-35 heavy maintenance hubs for the Asia-Pacific region corresponds with the upticks in maintenance and repair contracts in 2014, 2018, and 2020. The F-35 maintenance facilities were expected to be operational by 2018, with Australia initially chosen to provide heavy maintenance to the F135 engine and Japan providing additional capability three to five years later. In Japan, MHI’s Final Assembly and Check Out facility in Nagoya was selected as the regional MRO provider; the facility unveiled the first Japanese-assembled F-35A in 2017. As part of the 2014 initiative, MHI began conducting inspections and repairs of F-35 airframes at its Aichi facility in 2020, after which there was an uptick in contract awards in maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF is not the main spender of DOD MRO funds related to Japan. Figure 2 shows all DOD prime contracts on aircraft MRO performed in Japan, divided by service. The majority of DOD funds spent on MRO with a Japanese aspect are paid by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), an agency that administers contracts, provides oversight, and ensures effective contract management. The DCMA typically focuses on high-value and high-risk contracts that directly support increased warfighter readiness, avoiding any contract below $300,000 and non-mission service work. In Figure 2, the “Air Force” and “Navy” sections represent the actual value of MRO contracts being performed in Japan, while DCMA contracts can concern products or services that are destined for the USAF, Navy, or any other military service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in Figure 2 illustrates that U.S-Japan defense industrial cooperation on MRO is not only relevant for the USAF but also for the U.S. Navy, whose partnership with Japanese industry dates in 1953, when NIPPI, a Japanese corporation, began servicing Navy assets. NIPPI currently provides maintenance support for the Marine Corps’ V-22 Osprey helicopters. Japanese companies also service U.S. Navy ships, with MHI conducting maintenance on the USS Millus in 2019 and recently signaling its openness to additional contracts with the U.S. Navy. Expanded MRO cooperation could benefit the U.S. military broadly, not just the USAF, and has already begun to accelerate in some other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: DOD Prime Contracts for Aircraft MRO with a Japanese Aspect by Type of MRO Activity Across Aircraft Product Categories.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows all DOD prime contracts with a Japanese aspect, segmented by the activities being performed on different aircraft parts and the type of MRO activity involved. The data shows that technical representatives are mostly performing work on components and accessories and that aircraft/airframes are receiving only general maintenance work. The topline of $30 million also shows a very limited amount of MRO with a Japanese aspect, meaning there is significant room for growth. The trend points upward on maintenance of aircraft and airframes, as more USAF aircraft are deployed to Japan and as the USAF seeks in-country sustainment solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engines and sub-suppliers are not included in this data, which means that Figure 3 does not capture some of the important MRO work being performed by Japanese companies, such as IHI’s supply of parts for and repairs of the F135 engine in Japan. As mentioned above, in 2023, IHI opened the first regional depot outside of those run directly by F-35 partner nations to provide services for the F135 engine for both the USAF and JASDF; in 2024, the company began shipping F135 Stage 1 Integrally Bladed Rotors to Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney in the United States, becoming the only external vendor with this capability. This activity is likely not represented in the data because IHI is not the prime contractor for the engine, but rather a subcontractor to Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney. Significantly more Japanese industry participation in MRO is likely happening at the sub-supplier level and therefore will not be included in DOD prime contract data. Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney have expanded their MRO presence in Japan through partnerships with MHI and IHI, with two facilities operational as of 2023. This expansion demonstrates an expectation of a continued uptick in MRO contracts with a Japanese aspect, mirroring the increases seen in aircraft and airframe MRO from 2018 through 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japanese-industry-and-government-challenges&quot;&gt;Japanese Industry and Government Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry and government face a variety of barriers in facilitating MRO support for USAF aircraft. To categorize barriers to cooperation, this section draws on insights from project team research, roundtables, and interviews with key stakeholders. The chapter focuses on barriers that directly impact Japan’s government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To categorize these barriers, this report draws on a 2023 RAND report that offers a typology of barriers to U.S. security cooperation with highly capable allies in a variety of domains. CSIS previously modified this typology in a March 2025 report on U.S.-Australia defense industrial integration to include a new classification of the economic barriers experienced by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Moroney et al., Overcoming Barriers to Working with Highly Capable Allies and Partners in the Air, Space, and Cyber Domains: An Exploratory Analysis (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, July 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has highly advanced technological expertise and a robust manufacturing base, the domestic demand for defense industrial capacity is limited due to the size of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) and its aviation arm, the JASDF. The JASDF operates approximately 700 aircraft, while the USAF operates over 5,100. The USAF has over 350 planes stationed in Japan, with dozens of new fighter jets scheduled to deploy to Japan as a part of a $10 billion investment aimed at bolstering fighter jet operations across multiple military bases in the country. Adding aircraft MRO demand from USAF to that of JASDF would encourage Japanese industry to expand its capacity to meet this new market opportunity in the long run. In the short term, however, Japanese industry may struggle to “right-size” or scale up its MRO operations to match demand, especially if USAF demand is not seen as guaranteed (discussed below). Additionally, the number of airframes per system that would undergo MRO in Japan matters. Building Japanese MRO capacity for a U.S. system with only two aircraft in Japan, for example, would incur a high per-unit cost, which could be unjustifiable if there is existing MRO capacity for these aircraft in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons and ammunition depots store military equipment and parts and maintain their readiness, making in-theater storage depots essential for deterrence and the conduct of military operations. A central question regarding Japan’s defense capacity is the availability of storage depots that can ensure Japanese manufacturers have access to critical parts for MRO and other necessary materiel if a conflict breaks out. There are approximately 1,400 active weapons depots in Japan, but many are located in the north of the country, and larger depots are needed to house the long-range missiles that Japan moved to acquire in 2023. These depots are both a strategic necessity and expensive to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio eased the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, or Japanese arms export regulations, in 2023. The revision has opened the door to the export of lethal weapons to the United States and other partner countries by allowing the transfer of finished products and components to the licensing country. The stated purpose of these revisions is to strengthen regional deterrence, reinforcing the impression that Japan is committed to mobilizing defense transfers for national security. In interviews and surveys conducted by CSIS in January and February 2025, U.S. and Japanese industry representatives acknowledged the benefit of revised Japanese export control laws but have also noted that process change takes time. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) is working to comply with updated export regulations, which will take training and cultural change. Both Japanese and U.S. industry are hoping for METI to become more efficient, as delays in the export process are reported to be hampering work and increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-and-political-barriers&quot;&gt;Cultural and Political Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically limited in scope, JSDF operations have evolved over time in response to changes in the security environment around Japan. Japan issued its first national security strategy in 2013, reflecting the security challenges posed by China and North Korea. The defense policy reforms of 2015 marked a substantial turning point in Japan’s defense policy, reflecting the country’s willingness to participate in collective security efforts with allies and partners in specific circumstances. In 2022, Japan released its second national security strategy, identifying China as its greatest strategic challenge, and issued a new defense strategy and procurement plan in tandem, outlining plans to increase military expenditures from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the legacy of World War II and the pacifism enshrined in Japan’s postwar constitution still impact Japanese defense industrial capacity and regulations, as well as the workforce that Japanese defense industry attracts. For example, in recruiting ads, the JSDF depicts its activities as providing medical assistance and engaging in rescue missions, both at home and overseas—unlike U.S. military recruiting, which highlights warfighting. Although the Japanese government has reinterpreted Article 9 of its constitution, which renounces war and the threat or use of force to resolve international disputes, a culture of pacifism still prevails, complicating efforts to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative public opinion of the defense industry makes it difficult for defense companies to hire skilled talent, especially as Japan contends with a demographic challenge (research projects a 12 percent reduction in the working population from 2022 to 2040). Japan’s worker shortage comes at a time when defense companies need more skilled labor than ever to expand capacity, and are competing for talent with other high-growth and specialized industries such as automotive engineering, manufacturing, sustainability, and other innovative technology areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military’s forward presence in Japan—per Article 6 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty—may be excellent for strategic positioning, but it also proves politically sensitive in some local communities. Okinawa is a hub for the U.S. military, hosting 70 percent of all U.S. bases in Japan, including Kadena Air Base, and housing 80,000 Americans. The large U.S. military presence has strained relations with Okinawans since the 1970s, and there have been periodic incidents of violence. Though this is not a challenge unique to Japan, it poses a barrier to the expansion of MRO facilities for U.S. military aircraft, as local populations could protest new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-barriers&quot;&gt;Regulatory Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States uses export controls like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations to ensure advanced U.S. technology is not transferred to unfriendly actors. Although limiting access to critical technologies and military capabilities is essential to maintaining a technological advantage, ITAR delays and in some cases obstructs the United States’ ability to export critical parts to foreign allied partners, like those needed by Japanese industry to perform MRO services on U.S. aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge mentioned in CSIS’s conversations with Japanese industry stakeholders is obtaining certifications from OEMs and securing the technical disclosures that they provide to MRO partners. Each U.S. company that originally manufactures an aircraft has its own quality and process standards that Japanese industry must follow to perform MRO on its planes. Overclassification of information can greatly complicate the sharing of critical enabling details like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, Japan adopted proprietary standards for its self-defense forces, creating a barrier to cooperation on MRO and FMS with foreign militaries. As the United States’ alliance structure in Asia revolves around bilateral relationships, the Indo-Pacific lacks a multilateral security organization like NATO in Europe to set standards for interoperability. Japan’s ban—due to cultural challenges mentioned above—on the export of lethal weapons also resulted in a lack of emphasis on aligning standards, as common standards are often profitable only if tied to enhancing success in foreign military sales (or alliance interoperability). Without the benefits of foreign sales, adopting foreign standards would have been costly for the small Japanese aircraft fleet. These strategic and cultural dynamics have created a legacy that is complicating modern MRO cooperation with the United States and other partners, as many of the parts used in Japan are not compatible with U.S. systems and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of shared standards between the United States and Japan not only means that parts may not fit together, but also that the technology within subsystems may not interface easily. Standards apply beyond just physical characteristics: Test and Evaluation requirements, for instance, can apply to parts in Japan that may be functionally identical to U.S. parts but that can still be manufactured or evaluated using processes that the USAF or U.S. primes do not view as aligning with their standards, and thus cannot be incorporated into MRO practices currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While aligning Japan’s military standards with those of its allies would help lower MRO costs in the long run, the process of alignment will require the investment of time, money, and effort to see these long-term rewards come to fruition. Achieving more aligned process standards for cross-national certification will require investment and close collaboration with the OEMs for all aircraft on which MRO is needed. These costs require careful navigation, as Japan has been successfully manufacturing for its domestic needs for decades. Scaling up to become a global service provider will necessitate collaboration and communication from all involved, which can be complicated by the necessity of navigating the differing interests of many stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technical barrier is the misalignment of industrial practices between firms in Japan and the United States. In conversations held by CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives noted the occasional mismatch in manufacturing and quality control processes between their companies and their Japanese partners. They explained that although many Japanese facilities were highly advanced, other facilities used significant amounts of manual labor and craftsmanship when finishing products, in contrast to the machinery and automation used in the United States to ensure quality standards. One U.S. industry partner recognized the legacy of the Japanese industrial base as a potential cause of this lack of automation, noting that the Japanese defense aviation industry has less incentive to invest in machinery because it has historically serviced a limited fleet and solely focused on meeting the needs of the JASDF, its only customer. U.S. industry representatives said investments in machinery and automation are needed for Japanese facilities to receive quality certifications from them, as well as to increase efficiency and lower costs as Japanese industry looks to scale production to meet external demand. Many U.S. and Japanese industry representatives stressed that the overall level of performance and automation of Japanese industry is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s investment of $10 billion toward bolstering fighter jet operations in Japan, as outlined in the strategic barriers section above, has led to increased demand for Japanese MRO capabilities. However, in surveys conducted by CSIS, Japanese manufacturing industry leaders highlighted capacity constraints as a principal challenge to scaling MRO operations to meet demand surrounding foreign military aircraft, citing the presence of shortages in both facility space and human capital. In addition to the lack of hangar space in which MRO could be performed, limited defense industrial capacity also means that Japan has fewer weapons and parts depots, shallower existing pools of spare parts, reduced ability to quickly manufacture parts, and fewer additional skilled workers who could be mobilized to work on aircraft MRO should demand surge in the event of a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the Japanese defense industry also means that Japan does not have a government-owned and operated defense industrial base; and private capacity can only expand through MOD contracts. Japanese companies will remain stagnant without demand signals or contract guarantees to invest in the expansion of their industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contraction of Japan’s domestic defense industry has contributed to strains on capacity. The fact that the JSDF has historically been the only customer for the defense industry has created low profit margins compared to those of U.S. and EU defense companies and has led to hesitancy to invest in new equipment and facilities. More than 100 companies have exited the defense market in the last 20 years due to this challenging landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4, generated from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) data, shows that Japanese companies that participate in the defense industry received a smaller share of their overall revenue from their defense units than most defense-involved firms in the United States. This diversifies their revenue streams but also means that some economies of scale and specialization returns are missed by Japanese conglomerates, which may make it hard for these firms to compete as they enter the global marketplace. However, as elaborated upon later in the section on enablers, these companies’ commercial divisions offer opportunities to expand their capacity to meet military needs by leveraging nonmilitary practices and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-industry-and-government-challenges&quot;&gt;U.S. Industry and Government Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government faces a range of challenges in conducting MRO in the Indo-Pacific, including regulatory discrepancies and insufficient demand signals to industry partners. Many of these challenges stem from inefficient bureaucratic processes that were established under a different threat landscape and do not match today’s geopolitical environment. U.S. government and industry challenges can be sorted according to the Moroney Framework OF barriers to cooperation, outlined in Table 1 in the previous section, with slight variations to reflect the different challenges on the U.S. side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a clear demand signal, neither U.S. nor Japanese industry will have a strong business case to allocate resources to the expansion of MRO capacity and capability on U.S. platforms in Japan, and much-needed capital improvements will not occur. William A. LaPlante, former U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, stated in 2023 that steady demand signals from government to industry is a requirement for ensuring resiliency. In an interview with CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives called for more funded demand in the form of requests for information (RFIs) and other contracts with dollar amounts attached. One representative said that although real demand in the region is growing due to increasing challenges, business plans are only based on funded demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary cost challenge is the allocation of responsibility for the investment needed to build up Japanese defense industrial capabilities, with clarity needed on whether industry or government will take the lead—and shoulder the financial burden. If the United States wants to use Japan for engine parts, for example, thousands of parts will need to be certified, requiring time and money. Both U.S. and Japanese industry have expressed concern over who is to bear the responsibility of investment and whether the U.S. government would help; both have also raised questions about what guarantees of future demand and contracts the U.S. government would be able to give Japanese industry if the private sector assumes responsibility for making investments in capability. Without assurances of future returns, it is difficult for industry to justify taking on the risk of expensive capacity improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workforce issues are also a challenge for the United States. In 2023, the USAF was short 1,800 maintainers, though the shortage had shrunk to 500 by May 2024. Despite this improvement, the shortage has already begun taking a toll on the workforce and was possibly a contributing factor to the number of maintenance mishaps hitting a peak of 21 in FY 2023, almost double the amount in FY 2022. Among the most consequential of these was an incorrect installation of pins that had the potential to cause vertical stabilizers to fall off of aircraft; this mistake resulted in hundreds of air refueling and recon jets being grounded in early 2023. According to Senior Master Sergeant Joshua Morales, a USAF crew chief with over 15 years of aircraft maintenance experience, “The implications [of such mishaps] extend beyond flight delays to the possibility of compromised missions and military defeat—especially in a prolonged conflict where keeping aircraft flying will be a constant challenge.” While an overstretched workforce is not necessarily the root cause of the FY 2023 maintenance issues (which remains debated), providing a new pool of labor to supplement maintenance efforts could reduce the burden on the existing workforce. Although incorporating new workflows takes time and investment in the short term, supplementing the U.S. MRO workforce with Japanese personnel could alleviate some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique environmental challenges in the Indo-Pacific region make in-theater maintenance of military equipment critical to effective deterrence and readiness. Humidity and exposure to salt water from the Pacific Ocean increases the rate of corrosion on aircraft and ground equipment, which could compromise flight safety if left undetected. Over time, these factors can have a compounding effect on DOD operations in the region and will require an approach that leverages multiple agencies to remedy challenges to U.S. basing initiatives and security efforts. In an interview conducted by CSIS on March 18, 2025, a U.S. industry representative said that material corrosion is a key problem faced during modifications. In many cases, customers who perform MRO on their own planes are unable to address severe corrosion, causing them to stop work until OEM engineers are deployed to work on the aircraft. In-theater corrosion maintenance capabilities are an essential part of deterrence in the Indo-Pacific that can be best achieved through partnerships with allies. A step in the right direction is the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which includes a $132 million request for a Kadena Air Base Theater Aircraft Corrosion Control Center, which would enable critical corrosion control maintenance of large-body aircraft in an environmentally challenging theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States may benefit from assessing how to modify existing sustainment training and equipment for the Indo-Pacific environment. Training exercises in the Indo-Pacific have revealed that personnel challenges are a particularly difficult aspect of sustainment operations in the region. Exercises in the Philippines have identified that coordinating and integrating sustainment assets, assessing how environmental factors affect the resupply of resources, and determining how weather impacts water consumption are important considerations. Additionally, exercises in the region conducted alongside U.S. allies have revealed shortcomings in communication and coordination between forces and commanders, movement and tracking of equipment, and the availability of vehicle mechanics in the field. These challenges often occur simultaneously, triggering a chain reaction of disharmony in sustainment operations as, for example, a broken vehicle leads to delays that affect coordination and communication. Conducting similar exercises in Japan may provide further insights into sustainment challenges on the island and in the conduct of joint operations with Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-barriers-1&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of sustainment analysis by the USAF has made it more challenging to assess the health and readiness of aircraft fleets. Sustainment reviews help military departments estimate the cost of platform life cycles, identify budget shortfalls, and analyze the most cost-effective sources of repairs and maintenance. Despite the U.S. government’s description of sustainment as “a critical tool to assess performance and help increase readiness throughout an aircraft’s lifecycle,” neither the USAF nor Navy have yet completed their required reviews. Similar to the F-35, the F-22 program has high sustainment costs—around $13.6 billion a year. For this reason, the services’ lack of sustainment analyses hinders the DOD’s ability to clearly identify its sustainment needs, which in turn hampers efforts to predict and communicate future demand for MRO operations in the Indo-Pacific. The lack of reviews also limits the degree to which the USAF can assess how to conduct sustainment practices effectively, which impacts conversations on how to leverage Japanese capability and capacity for U.S. sustainment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-and-political-barriers-1&quot;&gt;Cultural and Political Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural and political challenges were not reported by interviewees as major barriers to cooperation between U.S. and Japanese industry on joint MRO work. One cultural challenge that affects U.S. security cooperation with many allies and partners is U.S. contracting officers’ preference for U.S.-owned firms. This bias is reinforced by the additional bureaucratic difficulties of signing a contract with a foreign firm. These effects combine to discourage the security cooperation workforce from engaging with allied industry, even when superior officers and policy directives favor cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural and political problems can also reduce the efficacy of potential enablers like Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandums of Understanding (RDP MOUs). These are agreements between the United States and foreign countries to waive “Buy American” requirements and facilitate defense trade. In a survey conducted by CSIS in 2024, allies and partners who have RDP MOUs (a group that includes Japan) noted that the existence of this exemption is not well recognized in some U.S. program offices. Additionally, respondents generally agreed that Congress and the executive branch seemed to oppose the exemptions, focusing on protecting domestic industry and making RDP MOUs less effective than originally perceived. These factors complicate the use of RDP MOUs and generate frustration among allies and partners, demonstrating that just because there are certain exemptions in place, these are not necessarily effective in bypassing bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-and-technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Regulatory and Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulations that restrict the export and sharing of technical information and advanced technology hinder the competitiveness of U.S. industry while simultaneously placing a significant burden on allies who try to cooperate with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these costs have been attributed particularly to ITAR and the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. As highlighted in multiple surveys and events, Japanese industry has noted that reliance on imports of ITAR-restricted parts is time sensitive and costly. The United States uses ITAR to ensure that U.S. military technology is not transferred to unfriendly actors; although limiting access to critical technologies and military capabilities is essential to maintaining a technological advantage, ITAR delays and sometimes obstructs the sharing of technical data with allies and partners. Participants in U.S. and foreign industry often point to ITAR as a barrier to cooperation, and one Japanese firm noted that relying on imports of ITAR-restricted components for MRO activities sometimes hinders their operations. However, during a roundtable discussion hosted by CSIS in January 2025, a State Department official claimed that ITAR works quickly in processing licenses and is not a barrier to exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another obstacle that the United States will have to overcome is information disclosure. One form is overclassification, which presents a barrier for integration with U.S. allies. As stated by the DOD’s Defense Innovation Board, the department “continue[s] to overclassify information, defaulting to ‘no foreign dissemination (NOFORN)’ protocols, and even fail[s] to develop suitable processes for communicating ‘controlled unclassified information (CUI)’ in today’s shared threat environment.” Consequently, U.S. government agencies are hindered in their ability to communicate with partner organizations in Japan to better collaborate on efforts like MRO cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information disclosure not only presents a challenge for intergovernmental sharing efforts but also harms industry capability. Japanese industry representatives communicated to CSIS that a firm’s ability to perform heavy or depot-level MRO on U.S. aircraft is contingent on information disclosure from the U.S. government and its industry. The Japanese firms particularly emphasized the need to ease or simplify procedures for the provision of technical information (including manuals and drawings) on defense equipment from OEMs. In a CSIS survey conducted in January 2025, Japanese companies noted barriers to receiving technical information from U.S. industry, pointing to hindrances associated with security clearances, visas (for work outside of Japan), and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges often arise from differences in how the United States and Japan set requirements, as even minor variances can cause issues. For example, license agreements for the use of U.S. components can require extensive levels of certification, which can be a challenge for Japanese industry actors, who have expressed interest in receiving waivers to streamline MRO cooperation. Required certifications for the repair or fabrication of specific parts and for the use of Japanese maintenance facilities can also be barriers, as U.S. standards for these certifications are not always in alignment with Japanese requirements. Complying with a new set of requirements imposes costs on Japanese firms and leads to delays. These challenges can hinder the United States’ ability to conduct MRO operations in Japan and restricts both nations’ use of otherwise compatible parts and processes. In addition to licensing issues, a U.S. prime contractor told CSIS that navigating IP protections is also a difficulty that can be overcome with enough time, highlighting the importance of preparing IP export pathways prior to a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance with cybersecurity requirements such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program and the Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure process are other common challenges for U.S.-Japan industry collaboration. As a U.S. industry official highlighted in an interview with CSIS, “CMMC is an issue across the board. Cyber and security concerns come up every time we talk about Japan, more than in business case issues.” The Defense Security and Cooperation Agency has tried to address these challenges by implementing “changes to improve the DOD’s understanding of international military requirements, provide allies and partners with more relevant priority capabilities, and incorporate these requirements into DOD plans to expand defense industrial base production capacity.” However, interviewees noted that these issues continue to persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, certain U.S. maintenance and sustainment requirements make it difficult for U.S. agencies to embrace defense industrial integration and collaborate on MRO efforts with Japan. One example is U.S. Code 2466, which mandates that not more than 50 percent of the funding for depot maintenance in a fiscal year may be used to contract for performance of depot maintenance and that 50 percent or more of the workload must be performed in a DOD organic depot maintenance facility by U.S. government employees. This rule limits the amount of MRO work the government can allocate to commercial or foreign entities and increases competition for work by those companies. The “50/50” statute also incentivizes the use of internal resources for platforms with higher security and technological sensitivity, posing potential challenges for MRO cooperation with U.S. allies and the expansion of joint MRO efforts overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enablers-of-japanese-industry-participation-in-mro&quot;&gt;Enablers of Japanese Industry Participation in MRO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating on MRO for USAF aircraft is mutually beneficial for Japan, the United States, and their respective defense industries. For the DOD and USAF, an integrated sustainment approach can enhance readiness, resilience, and capability for the U.S. Joint Force and its partners, as well as contribute to other strategic goals. On the economic front, the U.S. government can also leverage this partnership to mitigate workforce shortages, decrease cost of transit for parts and aircraft, and strengthen supply chain resilience. Integrated sustainment presents Japanese industry with the opportunity to enhance its industrial capabilities and capacity. MRO cooperation may also bolster the resiliency of U.S. industry supply chains by certifying and integrating Japanese firms. Beyond providing significant opportunities for economic growth and strengthening Japan’s defense industrial base, collaboration on MRO can also provide the Japanese government with a unique opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-enablers-existing-infrastructure-and-relationships&quot;&gt;Economic Enablers: Existing Infrastructure and Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main enablers of Japanese industry participation in MRO processes are the current infrastructure present in Japan and the existing relationships between U.S. and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF and its partners in Japanese industry can build on existing infrastructure, such as Support Center Pacific (SCP), to enable them to leverage MRO capability that is already in place. The SCP has been an “integral support unit for Department of Defense services and allied forces in the Indo-Pacific,” with operations encompassing more than 125 different aircraft components, providing a foundation for expansion of capacity and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the SCP’s high degree of capability, its limited capacity means that 95 percent of systems still require transportation back to the United States for maintenance. By expanding and improving facilities like the SCP and Kadena Air Base, along with their working relationships with the JSDF and Japanese industry, both the U.S. and Japanese governments can capitalize on existing expertise and effective MRO operations without added costs for training and relocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s MOD has recently taken steps to expand existing weapons storage facilities, requesting $148 million in FY 2024 to build 130 new ammunition depots by 2035. Many of these depots will store long-range missiles, which require larger facilities than are currently available in most cases. Building new storage facilities for these weapons aligns with former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s pivotal 2022 decision to acquire long-range strike capabilities; the initiative will include the construction of four long-range missile depots at JSDF bases in the Oita and Aomori prefectures. These depots support the storage of conflict-ready equipment and increase Japanese industry access to parts necessary for MRO, especially long lead-time parts—addressing a challenge highlighted by Japanese industry in surveys conducted by CSIS in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Japanese governments can make the most of existing relationships with Japanese subcontractors involved in joint projects by encouraging them to play a role in MRO operations. Platforms like the F-2 Fighter, Glide Phase Interceptor, and SM-3 Block IIA Missile Defense System are prime examples of existing defense industrial collaborations where additional energy could be directed toward identifying mutual areas for cooperation and joint sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though building these existing relationships into MRO cooperation will require time and effort—as U.S. companies help certify and integrate Japanese companies into their supply chains—the benefits to U.S. industry are clear. Cooperation could lead to new possible areas of business in Japan through new cooperative agreements with Japanese companies, either for commercial MRO or military MRO, covering both USAF planes and, possibly, JSDF aircraft. Furthermore, the USAF is the most important customer for many of the United States’ aviation-focused primes; given the USAF’s emphasis on regional sustainment, many U.S. industry firms may be motivated to join the initiative in the interest of customer relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. primes can also benefit from collaborating with Japan if Japanese firms are hired to be the low-cost subcontractors of key components—given Japan’s superior production technology in certain niche areas (especially castings)—or as second sources for stressed supply chains in U.S. primes’ other markets. As one U.S. prime noted to CSIS, “We want more capacity. Raw material and some schedule items are not as quick as we would like now. The real unlock with Japan is their raw material sources and their machining sources.” Another source of advanced capability in Japan exists in Japanese industry expertise. Japan is well known for its technological advances in fields like robotics, automation, precision engineering, aerospace manufacturing, cybersecurity, electronics, and sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese commercial infrastructure includes significant production technology in advanced manufacturing and aerospace. In an interview conducted by CSIS on March 18, 2025, a U.S. industry representative noted that Japanese industry, in its commercial business, uses the same standards as the United States—standards that were, in many cases, pioneered by Japanese companies. The spokesperson said that Japanese quality for major commercial components is extremely high and that companies such as MHI and KHI have been ahead of the United States on automation for decades. In another interview conducted by CSIS on February 19, a U.S. industry representative described Japan’s commercial business as a great model for the Japanese defense sector to follow, noting that Japanese companies have been successfully and competitively exporting commercial engine parts for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the commercial branches of Japanese defense companies, nontraditional companies also present an avenue for Japanese industry participation in MRO processes, as more commercial entities enter the defense market and industrial ecosystem. This grants novel opportunities to develop relationships with new companies and stakeholders. In a public event hosted by CSIS on March 13, 2025, Lt. Gen. Leo Kosinski (who retired in 2024) encouraged the involvement of nondefense companies with advanced manufacturing and innovation advantages, such as Nikon, which recently opened an advanced manufacturing plant in Long Beach, California. Aside from large companies, “startups and VCs interested in the defense sector are steadily increasing” in Japan, according to CSIS research, since the Japanese government has continued to increase its defense spending and agencies like ATLA and METI have established initiatives to connect the JSDF with startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-and-political-enablers-institutions&quot;&gt;Strategic and Political Enablers: Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral frameworks and institutions are currently the primary enablers of U.S.-Japanese defense industrial cooperation. Initiatives like Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment and the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience constitute formal commitments by the United States to invest in activities in Japan and signal a commitment and desire to increase collaboration in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DICAS seeks to pinpoint avenues for advanced defense industrial cooperation. Although DICAS has a broad scope, a primary focus is the joint maintenance of U.S. ships and aircraft that are forward deployed to the Pacific using Japanese commercial facilities. The four DICAS Working Groups, comprised of representatives from the United States and Japan, will focus on ship repairs, aircraft repairs, supply chain resilience, and missile coproduction. In initial talks, DICAS working groups will identify what types of weapons to focus on and coproduce, while also determining maintenance and production timeline goals. DICAS provides an official forum for defense industrial cooperation that has already enabled effective discussions and alignment of standards between the United States and Japan—serving as a technical enabler and an essential mechanism for collaboration as the two countries seek to further integrate their MRO networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview conducted by CSIS in February 2025, a U.S. prime contractor said they might explore working with Japanese industry on future programs, and in some places codevelopment, under DICAS. The company representative said that partnering with Japan is an increasing priority and that there is an effort across the whole company to focus on such opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF has plans to expand the Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment in the Pacific region, with proposals for further services on the C-130, F-35, and F-15EX and the addition of rapid manufacturing, composite, and mobile support. Japanese industry is well positioned to benefit from this proposed expansion, as the JASDF flies the F-35A and Japanese companies have experience supporting MRO and engine component production for F-35s. During interviews conducted by CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives emphasized the significance of procuring parts in a timely and cost-effective manner, as depot capacity becomes irrelevant without the parts necessary for MRO. Procuring and storing parts is one of the primary goals of GENUS, and expanding GENUS operations in Japan and other countries will enable MRO to be performed effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has an RDP MOU with the United States, a binding agreement that enables Japanese companies to be considered domestic sources, allowing them to pass through some bureaucratic processes that other security partners cannot. From a procurement standpoint, the principal goal of an RDP MOU is to establish a mutual commitment to not discriminate against suppliers from another country, waiving Buy American laws and removing access barriers to defense marketplaces. Historically, RDP MOUs have mostly increased the purchases of component parts from foreign suppliers for larger systems that are built by U.S. companies. This aligns with existing MRO practices on U.S. equipment in Japan, as Japanese companies are focused on supplying parts and performing maintenance on existing U.S. aircraft, not on constructing and selling whole systems to the United States. Japan’s RDP MOU enables easier transfer of components and parts between the United States and Japan that are necessary for MRO. The United States and Japan also entered into a nonbinding Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) in 2023—an agreement to exchange reciprocal priority support for goods and services that promote national defense. This creates a mechanism for the DOD and MOD to request expedited handling of industrial resources to resolve unanticipated supply chain disruptions in order to maintain national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional framework that enables MRO cooperation is the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), which establishes a framework for settlement procedures for the reciprocal procurement of supplies and services between two countries’ military forces. ACSA transactions are primarily used during wartime, combined exercises, training, deployments, humanitarian or disaster relief operations, or in unforeseen circumstances. Although ACSA can be an effective tool to build capacity, proper use requires strong knowledge of the tool by U.S. forces and partner nations. Additionally, the United States cannot use ACSA transactions when an item can be obtained from U.S. commercial services, and ACSA cannot be used for routine and continual supplies of goods and services. Although these stipulations put limits on the usefulness of ACSA for joint MRO, the agreements can provide valuable logistics resources in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-enablers-aligning-perceptions-of-strategic-landscape&quot;&gt;Cultural Enablers: Aligning Perceptions of Strategic Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major enabler of cooperation between the United States and Japan is the two countries’ increasingly aligned threat perception, which is driving mutual interest in national security work and helping to resolve defense industry labor shortages. Escalating tensions between Japan and its neighbors—China, North Korea, and Russia—have generated more public support for strengthening defensive capabilities. A survey conducted in 2023 by the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, noted that 64 percent of Japanese voters believe their country should bolster its defense capabilities, with only 10 percent in opposition. Moreover, Japanese polls indicate that 84 percent of respondents feel that Japan’s national security is under threat and 91 percent consider China a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger populations are especially aware of Japan’s geopolitical situation and increasingly alert to the threat posed by China, which may expand their willingness to work on defense products. Greater popular understanding of the strategic landscape may enable both countries to better attract interest by professionals of all ages in working in the defense and national security sectors, which would help to solve current labor challenges and surge capacity labor requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-regulatory-enablers-cost-savings-predictable&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Regulatory Enablers: Cost Savings, Predictable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand, and Willingness to Invest in Defense Sending a broken platform back to the United States is expensive, and MRO closer to the point of need is a significant cost-saving opportunity. This has become increasingly important as more advanced platforms incur ever-higher sustainment costs: The F-35 program, for instance, has an estimated life-cycle cost exceeding $1.7 trillion, of which $1.3 trillion is associated with operating and sustaining the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Japan, MRO cooperation represents an opportunity to expand the country’s defense industrial base, which can provide economies of scale beyond what the JASDF could provide. Cooperation could therefore help bring down MRO costs for the JASDF in the long run. Japan’s MRO costs reached $14 billion in FY 2023, accounting for around 30 percent of the nation’s defense spending (compared to 1990, when MRO accounted for only 10 percent of defense spending). This increase in costs is due partly to aging equipment that requires more inspections and parts replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another budgetary enabler is the ability of cross-national MRO work to increase reliable demand for Japanese industry. Weak demand signals from the country’s own government and limited business opportunities have proven to be a barrier for Japanese investment in the defense market, as discussed in Chapter 4. The fact that there is a larger demand signal from the DOD than from Japan’s MOD may make Japanese industry eager for the chance to work on MRO for the USAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the Regional Sustainment Framework (RSF), industrial base integration with allies and partners contributes to “predictable demand,” which can help defense contractors make decisions about which capabilities to invest in, and at what capacity. A former U.S. official told CSIS in 2024 that Japan’s flying of U.S. aircraft is a “good enough” demand signal to jumpstart co-sustainment efforts. Because of this, a greater degree of industrial integration between the United States and Japan can act as a key enabler for Japanese industry participation in MRO processes. Notably, a U.S. prime representative also emphasized to CSIS that the scale of the conflict that the United States is preparing for in the Indo-Pacific will also fuel the demand signal, as it will inform how much investment industry will be willing to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear and consistent messaging from the United States is key to turning predictable demand into an enabler. Without contracts, promises of work, or economic guarantees, uncertainty over long-term demand signals from the United States will prevent Japanese industry from feeling confident in investing in capacity upgrades or workforce expansion and development. Dr. Troy Meink stated during his nomination process for secretary of the Air Force that he would request continued support from Congress to provide stable funding for clear and consistent demand signals to incentivize capital investment in the U.S. defense industrial base, which may carry over to any Japanese MRO policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third budgetary enabler is increased Japanese government spending on defense. Japan is trying spur its defense sector to become a high-growth industry through new government assistance to contractors of all sizes and by encouraging exports. Former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio led the passage of the 2023 “Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases” to create a pool of funds to bolster defense capabilities. The law was the result of three strategic documents released in December 2022 and is a major part of the Defense Buildup Program, which aims to spend $305 billion through FY 2027 to support Japan’s defense industrial base and ensure the country’s security. The act recognizes the major challenges facing Japan’s defense industry and provides numerous initiatives aimed at ensuring stable manufacturing of defense equipment. To address supply chain resiliency, the law requires Japanese defense manufacturers to shift import sources of raw materials to lower risk countries, maintain stockpiles of raw materials, and increase production of domestic raw materials and substitute products, among other efforts. To improve manufacturing efficiency, the law requires defense manufacturers to introduce advanced technologies in their processes, such as automation, AI, and digital transformation. The law also includes new requirements for cybersecurity enhancement of defense companies, citing the importance of trust in the relationship between ally countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the law provides for grants to be awarded to defense companies who export or transfer their equipment to foreign governments. These grants are not limited to just prime contractors but also cover suppliers that play partial roles in the finished products. To enable these transfers, the government will award grants to cover the costs of changing designs and modifying specifications required for export. These grants also feature an important safety net: Even if the equipment transfer in an international competitive bid is not realized, the company that receives the grant will not be expected to return any funds they have already spent. The law also aims to promote new entrants into the defense industry, improve predictability for companies in defense, and reduce the risks of investment for defense companies. The Japanese government’s commitment to increasing international defense exports and cooperation through joint public and private efforts has been signaled through diplomacy and legal change, and is now backed up by real investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-enablers-compatibility-of-existing-parts--embrace-of-common-standards&quot;&gt;Technical Enablers: Compatibility of Existing Parts &amp;amp; Embrace of Common Standards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary enabler of joint MRO in Japan is the compatibility of parts and components between some U.S. and Japanese aircraft, along with the ongoing embrace of shared standards by the Japanese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout CSIS’s research, roundtable events, and interviews, government and industry representatives from both the United States and Japan encouraged the idea that collaboration should begin with parts and aircraft that the two countries have in common. Similar systems and components enable joint MRO because the machinery, technology, and expertise needed to perform such maintenance is shared regardless of the ownership of the equipment. During an interview conducted by CSIS on February 28, 2025, a U.S. industry spokesperson stated that the United States and Japan should identify common parts in foreign and domestic versions of the same aircraft and build a capability to repair or fabricate those parts that can be certified to U.S. standards and then applied to both platforms. The spokesperson said that Japan has the capability to service the aircraft in its fleet that have been purchased from U.S. defense contractors, and those capabilities need to be identified and certified for use on USAF planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, differing quality and production standards can inhibit joint maintenance and export efforts. The difficulty of non-common manufacturing processes can be seen by comparing MRO on F100 and F135 engines, as explained by a U.S. prime contractor representative during an interview conducted by CSIS in February 2025. The F100 engine, which powers the F-15 and F-16, is made by Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney (P&amp;amp;W) for the USAF and manufactured by IHI for the JASDF, each following different processes and requirements. Eighty percent of the materials used by IHI to build their engines are sourced from Japan, and the engine is built following IHI quality standards and JASDF requirements, potentially complicating the use of existing Japanese MRO for JASDF planes on USAF aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the F135 engine production system that powers F-35s around the world has commonality built in from the outset. IHI has built 29 F135 engines to date in a P&amp;amp;W facility that IHI owns and operates, requiring adherence to P&amp;amp;W methods, tooling, and quality standards. This standardized quality and production system allows F135 engines produced by IHI to be interchangeable with other F-35s, regardless of the country of ownership. In CSIS’s interview, the U.S. industry spokesperson mentioned that IHI has now converted its F135 manufacturing facility into a regional depot as part of P&amp;amp;W’s regional network of maintenance facilities. P&amp;amp;W personnel staff the facility, although IHI remains the owner and operator; this could enable the facility to play a key role in sustaining USAF F-35s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aircraft programs such as the F-2 and F-16 offer potential areas of cooperation, despite the many differences between parts and processes used to manufacture the aircraft. The F-2 was a joint project between U.S. manufacturers and Mitsubishi, with around 60 percent of production taken on by Japan and 40 percent by the United States. Japanese companies made parts like the F-2’s radar, heads-up display, and inertial navigation system. The F-2 is used exclusively by the JASDF and was modeled on the General Dynamics F-16, with an engine derived from licensed production of the General Electric F110, also used in the F-16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government still must determine the demand rate for these parts before proceeding with a request for work from Japanese industry. U.S. industry is also waiting for resources from the U.S. government to analyze their investments and potential relationships with Japanese industry. The U.S. government has flexible contracting options that could fit this need, delivering funding to industry to accelerate the evaluation of cooperation avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government’s commitment to aligning its domestic equipment standards to those of the United States and Europe is one of the strongest enablers of enhanced MRO cooperation. As mentioned earlier, the JSDF has historically adhered to its own unique standards, complicating the exchange of parts and components. In 2023, the Japanese government issued draft guidelines outlining plans to sync its standards for domestically produced defense equipment with those of the United States and Europe to reduce maintenance costs and increase business opportunities for Japanese industry. The new guidelines state that defense supply chains should complement those of allies and partners, encouraging lower prices, increasing domestic production opportunities, and ensuring continuous operability of all equipment. These new requirements also include subsidies for small- and medium-sized manufacturers that supply parts to larger contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2024 Defense of Japan report, the Japanese government outlined a focus on “improvement in mutual interchangeability” of defense equipment to ensure interoperability with the United States. Modular defense equipment can be interfaced across major systems from independent vendors, designed with an architecture in which systems use common standards to ensure interoperability. One strategy for building this adaptable system is called the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), the DOD’s preferred method of implementation for open systems that is required for most major defense acquisition programs. MOSA is particularly useful for integrating technology within systems so that subsystems made by different companies can “talk” to each other. Standardization would allow the United States and Japan, along with other allies and partners, to include subsystems produced by different vendors in standard interfaces that integrate and operate together, enabling joint operations. For Japanese industry, building MOSA-compliant systems or components would increase foreign demand for products and allow companies to take full advantage of Japan’s recently loosened export laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan alliance stands at a critical turning point amid growing threats in the Indo-Pacific. By focusing on collaborative aircraft MRO, both nations could enhance their credible deterrence capabilities by addressing strategic challenges of distance and signaling a long-term commitment to regional security. This report has underscored the difficulties both countries face in maintaining a defense industrial ecosystem that will be resilient in the face of contested logistics, as well as highlighted the strong foundations for a possible expansion of Japan’s role in the maintenance of USAF assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress is being made in solving the sustainment challenge faced by the USAF in the Indo-Pacific, but barriers to collaboration still exist. Stringent U.S. export regulations and IP laws prevent the sharing of some technical information essential to MRO, complicating the ability of Japanese industry to perform maintenance on U.S. aircraft. The United States and Japan, along with U.S. and Japanese companies, are unsure of who will bear the cost burden of investing in new capabilities and expanded capacity. Without clarity, further progress is difficult. Though the Japanese government is building a more modern approach to defense production, remaining cultural and bureaucratic challenges continue to slow down the transfer of knowledge, labor, and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the United States and Japan have taken steps, both separately and together, to advance defense industrial cooperation and overcome barriers. Japanese companies already perform MRO on numerous U.S. military platforms and have experience partnering with U.S. OEMs on maintenance and joint development. The Japanese government has prioritized investments in its defense industrial base and has arranged its export laws to enhance defense collaboration, demonstrating its commitment to expanding defense posture and industry. The United States, for its part, has established multiple dialogues and frameworks dedicated to partnering with Japan and exploring sustainment solutions in the Indo-Pacific, providing new avenues for official communication and cooperation. Success hinges not only on strategic alignment but also on practical measures to streamline cooperation and overcome hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following recommendations identify how the United States and Japan could further accelerate cooperation to meet the urgent strategic imperative of overcoming challenges regarding MRO capacity and contested logistics in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan should consider expanding on, not replacing, the physical and diplomatic infrastructure that is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Establishments like the SCP, Kadena Air Base, and Japanese facilities in surrounding areas provide significant capability for MRO work, and further investments could be made to grow this capacity. Expanding on existing locations would make it easier to engage with local communities who have adapted to U.S. military presence and have experience working alongside U.S. service members and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. If both nations seek continuity and an expansion of current cooperation efforts, dialogue frameworks such as DICAS should be maintained and supported. The DICAS framework has been agreed upon by both the United States and Japan, and officials from both sides have already begun working within the framework. Additionally, U.S. and Japanese industry have begun taking DICAS into account in their business plans and have said that DICAS offers a positive demand signal for future MRO business in Japan. The United States should consider continuing to devote resources to strengthening these facilities and relationships, accelerating progress toward overcoming MRO cooperation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To increase MRO capacity for USAF aircraft in Japan, the two countries will likely need to either pay—fully or in part—for the expansion of facilities, certification, and alignment of standards, or offer contract guarantees to companies who make their own investments. Both nations’ governments and industries will need to determine who will pay for investments in infrastructure. U.S. and Japanese companies have emphasized that they will not invest in expansions of facilities, certifications, or standard alignments without some guarantee of a return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should provide clearer and more consistent demand signals to U.S. and Japanese industry by estimating how much Japan-based MRO support it will need. While estimating future demand is difficult, industry cannot right-size any investment in the capabilities necessary to meet future USAF demand in Japan without knowing roughly what the demand level will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should consider making use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to quickly support U.S. companies, encouraging them to explore areas of collaboration and develop relationships with Japanese companies. The U.S. government could also identify business opportunities for U.S. industry in Japan based on existing domestic capabilities and capacity in MRO—especially opportunities to catalyze partnerships between U.S. and Japanese industry. Timeliness is essential in joint MRO due to the strategic urgency of maintaining and strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, and OTA agreements provide a faster method of providing funding to U.S. industry than traditional contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Japanese governments should identify common aircraft, components, and parts and build strategies for MRO collaboration. Though U.S. and Japanese models differ at times in specific materials and manufacturing processes, their shared elements can be built upon to create the capability to service both models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both nations’ governments and industries should consider increasing alignment of manufacturing and quality control standards to enhance the ability of Japanese companies to plug into U.S. supply chains. The Japanese government should continue to fund or increase funding to its Basic Policy on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases, which provides support for defense companies looking to enhance their manufacturing processes and cybersecurity, among other things. U.S. companies should work with Japanese industry toward mutual acceptance of standards and should be flexible in accepting some processes that are common practice in Japan, without sacrificing airworthiness or quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan could benefit from embracing modular designs and common standards in their future acquisition programs, especially for any joint acquisitions. Coproduction in future programs should ensure that quality standards and processes are aligned from the beginning to enable closer collaboration. MOSA is the gold standard for modularity, and if both the USAF and JASDF make use of modular concepts in procurements, joint MRO of future shared systems would be much easier to realize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japanese companies could benefit from leveraging their commercial assets and practices for military MRO. U.S. aerospace firms have praised Japan’s commercial aerospace industry, saying the country has pioneered quality standards and is aligned with the United States on advanced production methods and certifications, while still lagging on the military side of the aviation sector. Inter-business managerial transfers or sharing within companies that have successful commercial aviation business units could help transfer knowledge and best practices to defense aerospace business units. Automation and quality standards, as well as commercial best-in-class facilities, should be applied to the defense side of production, potentially including any investment in dedicated defense facilities needed to reach the same level of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan could conduct a wargame, exercise, or other simulation with Japanese forces to evaluate current sustainment capabilities and gaps. Performing a tabletop exercise of a realistic contested logistics scenario would help identify bottlenecks and other factors that could complicate the maintenance of an operable aircraft fleet in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Yet it lacks tools to predict the accuracy and robustness of the algorithms powering such capabilities, risking both military effectiveness and law-of-war compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology of artificial intelligence (AI) is remarkable, while sometimes being remarkably fragile. AI principally has been applied in a small number of substantive domains, and its implications for other domains—particularly war—remain poorly understood despite being incredibly consequential. The Department of Defense (DOD) does not appear to be developing the analytical tools needed to assess systematically, much less predict, the accuracy of AI-enabled military capabilities; neither is it methodically developing the operational concepts needed to effectively incorporate AI into war. This need, however, is urgent: The United States is confronting the rise of a peer competitor, as well as a host of other military dangers and problems. China fields precision guided munitions, hypersonic missiles, and fighter aircraft increasingly able to pierce U.S. air superiority, capabilities that pose risks to classic U.S. power projection forces. There is a reasonable basis to believe that AI-enabled military capabilities could help rectify many deficiencies in U.S. combat power. This outcome assumes, however, that the effects of the AI algorithms in sensitive uses could be confidently anticipated, an assumption that the DOD cannot currently make. This paper demonstrates the importance of the DOD developing analytical tools to inform decisions about the use of algorithms, particularly in the context of sensitive applications like sensor and firing networks. It then provides recommendations on how the DOD should proceed to develop such analytical tools and the operational concepts to effectively employ and defend against AI-enabled military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“With the correctness of their science, history had no right to meddle, since their science now lay in a plane where scarcely one or two hundred minds in the world could follow its mathematical processes; but bombs educate vigorously…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-henry-adams-1918&quot;&gt;— Henry Adams, 1918&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is a remarkable technology, but it is vulnerable to errors, even in domains where it has long been used. The prospect of the use of AI in war raises acute concerns about the occurrence of errors and their consequences. Absent the ability to predict the effects of AI-enabled military capabilities, the United States could neither confidently nor responsibly rely on the deterrence or warfighting benefits of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these benefits are urgently needed. The U.S. ability to deter war in regions of critical interest is fading. Adversaries—particularly China—have improved their own capabilities and could now threaten classic U.S. power projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should develop analytical tools to measure, manage, and predict the accuracy of algorithms. Many individuals—from both inside and outside of the DOD—have called in general terms for such techniques to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly sensor and firing networks, combined with other force and program improvements, would be among the most promising strategies for shoring up deterrence and defense capabilities in the near- and mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, the DOD does not appear to be developing a systematic set of analytical tools for this purpose. There is no indication that there are department-wide metrics that could inform important decisions at any of the necessary analytical levels—in the field, in the command center and the Situation Room, or in wargames. Individual programs sometimes have excellent program-specific metrics, but this isolated data cannot solve broader problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has thus far framed its guidance for the development and use of AI-enabled military capabilities in a general fashion, calling for capabilities that are “responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable.” These general qualities, while worthy, are far from enough. Predictions about the effects of AI-enabled capabilities, particularly for sensitive uses, would need a high degree of confidence to inform decisions in the command center or the Situation Room regarding military effectiveness and law of war compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence could power meaningful improvements in warfighting capabilities, assuming its effects could be accurately predicted. The DOD, though, cannot make this assumption today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catalyzing military innovation in peacetime is very difficult. The vigorous education provided by war swiftly provides lessons about effective ways to incorporate emerging technologies. But these lessons are too often provided by the adversary, and war is invariably a harsh teacher—meting out insights with a clarity that yields an education, but one tinged with regret and loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful peacetime innovation would need to resolve interlocking puzzles confronting the United States at this strategic and technological moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI has thus far been vulnerable to errors in the domains where it is used. These errors are likely to appear—perhaps more often and with more consequence—when it is transplanted into a new substantive domain such as war. DOD needs analytical tools to assure accuracy of uses in the field. There has been limited work, both generally and within the DOD specifically, to systematically identify, understand, and mitigate these errors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI is to be used in war, decisions in the command center or the Situation Room would need to rely on predictions about the effects of the use of algorithms, particularly in sensitive applications. Absent such predictive tools, AI-enabled military capabilities could not be responsibly authorized in uses such as a sensor and firing network (discussed further below). DOD efforts are not on a trajectory to develop the analytical tools required to predict the effects of sensitive combat decisions made by AI, either in terms of military effectiveness or compliance with the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes in the threats confronting the United States—including the emergence of China as a peer competitor—mean that classic U.S. defense capabilities including power projection are at risk. The fielding of AI-enabled capabilities, including in sensor and firing networks, could be a significant contribution to efforts to manage and reduce emerging threats. Adversaries have incorporated new technologies and could complicate, if not defeat, U.S. efforts in some key theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, new technologies only win wars if they are incorporated into new operational concepts. The DOD does not have a methodical effort underway to develop, vet, and implement new operational concepts using emerging technologies. Identifying and developing effective operational concepts is conceptually difficult, relying as it does on an accurate idea about the nature of future war. Implementing promising new operational concepts is bureaucratically difficult, given their inevitable effect of reducing the importance of some existing weapons systems and their associated professional communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD needs to make significant reforms to strengthen its ability to effectively incorporate emerging technologies. Making such reforms would be difficult in the best of times, and these are not the best of times. It is, however, urgent to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities, including through responsibly incorporating AI-enabled technologies and building defenses against an adversary’s use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians are the traditional parties in the argument about the cause and effect of war. Realists want the warfighting advantages of precision and speed putatively offered by AI. Liberals and humanitarians are skeptical about the claims of precision and troubled by the prospect of speed. Liberals fear that speed increases the risk of unwanted escalation; humanitarians fear that autonomous firing decisions will have speed but lack precision—much less common decency—and hence oppose such firing decisions. The speed celebrated by realists, though, is largely acquired through the autonomous targeting and firing decisions. Analytical tools for accuracy and robustness are necessary to responsibly reconcile the key insights of these views, even if they cannot fully resolve their differences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focuses on AI incorporated into conventional warfighting capabilities. It does not engage directly with the implications of artificial intelligence incorporated into any element of the use of nuclear weapons. It is a reasonable assumption, though, that the report’s many concerns about the risk of mistakes for AI-enabled conventional weapons would apply with even greater consequence in AI-enabled decision processes about nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Growing Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. conventional forces in the post–Cold War era were configured on the idea that the United States could surge power projection forces swiftly enough to supplement forward presence forces. Working with allies and friends, these combined forces would be able to deter and, if necessary, defeat conventional military threats in regions of critical interest abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War receded further into history, this basic idea of using forward presence and power projection to deter or defeat regional adversaries persisted in U.S. defense planning. The changes in the ensuing years constituted adjustments to the same basic strategy, through different combinations of adversary major and minor regional contingencies. But over time, this idea has reflected less and less the strategic realities the United States actually confronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ rivals today are vastly better than they were even a decade ago at attacking the type of forward presence and power projection forces that have been the hallmark of U.S. conventional capabilities. This is largely because adversaries—particularly China—have grown the size of their militaries, created a more favorable deployment pattern for these forces, and effectively incorporated advanced technologies. Adversaries have developed and fielded long-range precision guided missiles (PGMs) coupled with sensors that could direct these missiles effectively, as well as capable fleets of military aircraft, both fighters and bombers. China’s military in particular is much larger and more capable than it was 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any large aggregation of U.S. military assets would be at risk from these capabilities. Large force aggregations include aircraft carriers, ports of debarkation and embarkation, military camps and airfields, and large ground force units, all key components of forward presence and power projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is developing and deploying countermeasures to these precision attacks, and doubtless some of these countermeasures will be effective. While the details matter in each dyad between a weapon and its target, there is no compelling solution to the observation that these U.S. forces would be vastly more vulnerable in the future than they have been in the past. The months-long deployment to the Persian Gulf that the United States pursued in 1991, for example, would no longer be possible today if competitors wanted to threaten it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversaries also tend to be located closer than the United States to the contested theaters. This difference complicates for the United States the challenge presented by geography to power projection forces and their resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such situations, U.S. power projection forces would be vulnerable to attacks of various sorts en route to and upon arrival in theater; it is even increasingly likely that U.S. forces might arrive only after the conclusion of decisive battles, largely because of the harsh realities of distance and the improvements in adversary capabilities. U.S. forces could then only lament in person the changed strategic reality on the ground and the unhappy choices now confronting the United States and its friends and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple changes that need to be made to make the power projection element of this strategy plausible again. Those changes should incorporate a large sensor and firing network that could detect an adversary (“red”) attack on critical interests abroad and then allocate and fire U.S. or allied (“blue”) weapons against those attacking forces. Much larger stockpiles of precision guided munitions would be needed, along with other reforms to U.S. forces, both forward deployed and reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of broad strategy—destroying a red attack against blue allies through the rapid and integrated firing of precision-guided munitions to halt the initial invasion—is an important part of the most promising available strategy in the near- and mid-term. It would require the creation of an effective and very large—likely theater-wide—sensor and firing network. In at least some types of crises, this network would need to have a certain degree of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes could help manage the greater pressure on U.S power projection forces. A sensing and firing network seems necessary, along with other force adjustments and the efforts of friends and allies, to deter—or, if necessary, defend—Taiwan from an attack from China, the eastern border of NATO from an attack by Russia, or other missions in distant theaters. Absent these capabilities and other improvements, respected defense analysts warn that Chinese or Russian attacks could be successful. It is this growing vulnerability that provides the urgency to swiftly and effectively incorporate AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report acknowledges that there is a great debate within the United States today over whether there should be a fundamental redefinition of its strategic interests. The substantive resolution of this debate is difficult to predict. Whatever the outcome, the complicated issues of AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly sensitive uses like a sensor and firing network, are not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the United States decided that only the security of its territorial borders was critical, the risk of adversary precision guided munitions of various sorts attacking the homeland would remain. A defensive effort—whatever its precise characteristics or configuration—should involve AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly an AI-enabled sensor and firing network constructed to move swiftly to identify and destroy the incoming missiles and other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crucible-for-reform&quot;&gt;Crucible For Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report agrees with the assessment that broader reforms are needed in the Pentagon to strengthen its ability to incorporate emerging technology. There is not, however, time to wait until the DOD’s internal structure and processes are fixed. Comprehensive efforts to incorporate AI responsibly need to move forward more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable that more rapid progress, this report recommends that the secretary of defense empower select senior warfighters to develop operational concepts for the use of AI-enabled military capabilities, largely freed from many of the bureaucratic constraints hobbling current progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These senior warfighters would be a select group of the combatant commanders including at least those from Special Operations Command, Indo-Pacific Command, and European Command. They would get new authorities for funding, staffing, and reinterpreting regulations for these capabilities. They would have the funding and acquisition authority for AI, related communications, and small platforms, including drones. This funding authority would create a much more dynamic ability to select solutions from different suppliers, including the Defense Innovation Unit, tech startups, the military services, and traditional defense contractors. The new operational concepts and capabilities would be thoroughly tested in well-instrumented wargames. At the end of a two- to four-year period of experimentation, the secretary could decide whether to let the select combatant commanders retain their new funding and acquisition authority or to relocate that authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report also recommends that the secretary create a competitive dynamic for the first few years on the development of analytical tools, directing the select combatant commanders and a reorganized Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to each develop tools. After a few years of competitive effort, the secretary should select the suite of tools most useful for the purpose and consolidate the approaches used for analysis within the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDAO should be supplemented with expertise in warfighting and analysis or a new organization with analytical expertise in both warfighting and AI should be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the secretary should ensure that JASON, the advisory group consisting of top national scientific experts who advise the national security community on sensitive technical questions, has elite academic experts on artificial intelligence. This perspective is vitally important given the remarkable and unexpected advances that AI technology continues to make. The advice of these outside experts is often revelatory and influential, although it is rarely celebrated in its initial presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal is developed further in Appendix II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensing-and-firing-networks&quot;&gt;Sensing and Firing Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War has a small number of recurring objectives. One of these is locating a red target and destroying it with a blue weapon. A military archer sees an attacking enemy soldier and aims an arrow. A single drone uses an image recognition algorithm, identifies a red target with required accuracy, and then detonates the blue payload of explosives an optimal distance from the target. These are very different missions, but the fundamental tasks of locating and destroying remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “sensor and firing network” as discussed here would be an AI-enabled system to identify and characterize red targets, allocate blue weapons against those targets, and then launch those weapons. The scale envisioned is a battlefield or even a theater-wide engagement. There is no indication in the public literature that there is an existing network at anything approaching this scale and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network would integrate the findings of blue sensors and information streams evaluating and characterizing hundreds or perhaps thousands of red targets, allocating blue weapons from ground, sea, and air-based assets in theater as well as long-range assets outside of the theater. It would then execute an integrated blue launch decision, either made by a human operator or pre-authorized to occur autonomously under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are examples of such networks on a smaller, more limited scale. The Israeli Iron Dome system has had remarkable success against limited attacks by shorter-range ballistic missiles through tracking incoming missiles and autonomously launching interceptor missiles to destroy those assessed to be heading toward populated areas. The Iron Dome has been reported to have a success rate of stopping 90 percent of missiles launched against its covered areas. It reportedly has a launch-to-impact speed of 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the current war in the Middle East grows in duration and combatants, some of the vulnerabilities of the Iron Dome and its related systems may grow in significance. The related systems seek to stop longer-range missiles, ideally further and further away from the protected areas. The per unit cost of the interceptor missiles launched by the Iron Dome is high—with estimates ranging from $60,000 to $40,000 per missile. The cost of adversary missiles or drones being fired at Israel vary widely but often is significantly less. For example, in an exchange, Hezbollah missiles were largely stopped by Israel’s Iron Dome system—a seeming validation of sophisticated high-end defensive systems. But the cost of the Iron Dome defense was 10 times that of the Hezbollah attack. The struggle may become one of capacity: Israel’s access to more interceptor missiles against adversaries’ capacity to launch yet more missiles at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The territory covered by the Iron Dome is limited in size and so the adversary does have some incentive to find valuable targets beyond its effective range. Most importantly, at some number and rate of incoming missiles, any defensive system—including the Iron Dome—would become saturated and ineffective. Even with autonomous targeting and firing decisions, the total number of items to manage could overwhelm the capacity of a particular system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues do not invalidate the remarkable contribution that the Iron Dome has made to the security of Israel, nor the theoretical usefulness of sensor and firing networks for defensive and even warfighting purposes. They do, however, underscore again that while specification of the mission is often clear-cut—find the red target and destroy it with a blue weapon—the details matter when planning for sustained, durable success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such details would be much more demanding should the attempt be made to build a theater-wide sensing and firing network. Yet such a network could contribute in essential ways to the challenge of strengthening U.S. power projection capabilities. There is both the strategic need for such a network, and plausibly, although not yet demonstrably, the technical ability to perform these functions through the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the strategic need, recall the Fulda Gap, that piece of territory in Germany that divided NATO from the Warsaw Pact during the coldest days of the Cold War. On each side of the gap, large numbers of tanks, troops, air power, and assorted support capabilities looked at each other across the border. If the Warsaw Pact had decided to launch a conventional attack, any advance would have been slowed, if not stopped, by the substantial NATO forces in being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider a situation in which the Warsaw Pact had forces on the Fulda Gap, or perhaps a discrete distance back, and the West no longer had forces on the other side of the gap. West Germany had some military forces, but these were vastly outnumbered by the Warsaw Pact forces in being. NATO remained a stalwart ally, but each countries’ forces were largely stationed on their own territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, to stop the Warsaw Pact forces if they decided to drive toward the West through the Fulda Gap? It would be vastly preferable to stop the Warsaw Pact forces before they cross into West Germany, to prevent the civilian deaths and the destruction of property that would result from an invasion and occupation. In addition, while pushing forces out of occupied territory is certainly possible, the prospect of doing so against a nuclear-armed adversary should certainly give pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Warsaw Pact forces started moving toward the border there would not be much time to react. Say there were about 100 miles from the Warsaw Pact barracks to the border of West Germany—roughly the distance across the strait from mainland China to Taiwan. It is not plausible to move NATO heavy forces to the Fulda Gap in the amount of time it would take the Warsaw Pact forces to move that 100 miles into West Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a sensor and firing network such as described above exists in this thought experiment, the way to stop the Warsaw Pact invasion would be to quickly identify all the Warsaw Pact tanks moving toward the border, allocate blue weapons against each tank, and launch the blue precision guided munitions. Time would be short, though, and if the invasion force is large, an AI network, possibly set on an autonomous mode, might well be the only way to perform the process quickly enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network as envisioned here would have three stages. In the first phase, the network would identify, vet, and characterize red military targets. In the second phase, blue weapons would be allocated against each red target so as to maximize military effectiveness and ensure compliance with the law of war. The third phase would be the firing of the blue weapons, either by a human operator or by an algorithm consistent with rules previously programmed into it by a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts posit that an AI-driven network would have precision and speed. Integrated networks at the size of an Israeli Iron Dome have been effective. Larger networks seem plausible, but the details matter when identifying and destroying a target and ultimately could prove intractable at scale. Whether a responsible battle-wide or theater-wide network could be constructed remains undemonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is focused on the AI elements of such a network. It is worth noting briefly that many other gaps would remain. For example, the United States would need to vastly increase its stockpile of precision guided munitions to successfully execute such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call to develop analytical tools does not assume that the targeting and firing decisions in these networks would be autonomous. Careful analysis must be done in advance, to either support the human decisionmaker or to enable responsible prior authorization of autonomous firing in certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the wargames and other activities called for here, the DOD should develop new operational concepts that identify additional ideas about how to use AI to the United States’ advantage in war. Powerful use cases are emerging that involve tactical deployment of small platforms—particularly drones—in concert with other coordinated platforms operating with at least some autonomy. These uses seem very promising. The DOD should explore these uses, either to use them against an adversary or to defend against their use by an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-analytical-tools&quot;&gt;The Need for Analytical Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD makes decisions in the field, in the command center and the Situation Room, and in wargames. Each of these contexts requires different analytical pathways and would need to have different tools created to enable the responsible use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions in the field turn on straightforward questions. Soldiers need to be able to confirm that an AI algorithm would be accurate when performing a specific function in a particular context—for instance, that an image recognition algorithm would correctly identify an adversary tank and only an adversary tank in a particular battle on a specific day. A shot needs to hit its intended target: Even the most brave and aggressive warfighters have no desire to die from fratricide if a weapon is launched at them by their own military because of fatal errors in target identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions in the command center or the Situation Room require a more robust understanding of the expected effects of a military measure. This requirement is necessary to assess both military effectiveness and compliance with the law of war. For AI, these questions would need to focus on whether an algorithm that has been effective in the past would be accurate in a prospective, not yet fully specified, use on a future battlefield. The current lack of understanding of the robustness of algorithms, particularly algorithms for sensitive uses, means that neither calculation can currently be made responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and robustness in decisionmaking are needed regardless of whether these sensor and firing networks are autonomous or not. Human-authorized autonomous firing would require vastly better data than is currently available. Similarly, a human with active oversight of a sensor and firing network, sometimes called being “in the loop” or “on the loop,” would confront great complexity and extraordinary time pressure. Such oversight might not seem particularly meaningful without significantly better analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report urges that any deployment of algorithms for sensitive uses, including in sensing and firing networks, should be authorized in the rules of engagement approved by the secretary of defense before a particular operation to ensure that these issues receive an appropriate degree of oversight. This would require a definition of “sensitive” use cases for algorithms, and recognition of the different requirements for accuracy and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all algorithms used in military capabilities would need these high levels of accuracy and robustness. Algorithms that identify candidate items for further review could have less stringent requirements for accuracy because of the prospect of human oversight without severe time pressure. For example, there are algorithms that scan millions of hours of video imagery for items that look like improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The candidate items would then be further reviewed, including by intelligence analysts, before a definitive decision that it was an IED and thus an appropriate candidate target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that generative AI should not be used for sensitive uses, including a sensor and firing network, at this stage of its development. This is because of generative AI’s vulnerability to random errors. Generative AI could be used as an aid to intelligence analysts, as long as the analysts were aware of the risks of error currently inherent in a generative AI algorithm (see the section on generative AI below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third set of decisions arises in the context of wargames. Wargames are one of the most promising techniques to develop and vet new operational concepts. Analytical tools for wargames require properly anticipating and modeling the effects of red equipment, tactics, and strategies. These interactions would be difficult to model particularly for a technology whose effects are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI raises strategic questions that fall outside of these three contexts as well. For example, how to manage unwanted escalation—a legitimate concern, given that much of AI’s military advantage is in the posited speed of its integrated networks. There also are ethical questions surrounding any decision to permit AI algorithms to make targeting and launch decisions, particularly those that could injure an active enemy combatant or, more perilously, a noncombatant. These questions have emerged in the ongoing debate among the different perspectives on war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;realists-liberals-and-humanitarians&quot;&gt;Realists, Liberals, and Humanitarians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians are the traditional protagonists in the effort to explain cause and effect in international relations. These three groups rarely agree, but artificial intelligence—at its broadest level—has achieved a rare consensus: that incorporating AI into war will be transformative. The protagonists disagree, though, on the nature of that transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists emphasize the promise of AI in effective deterrence, decisive warfighting capabilities, and even defense dominance, which would vastly reduce the risk of war against status-quo powers. There is tantalizing evidence from Ukraine and Russia that these predictions are likely to be accurate. Realists concede that AI algorithms could make mistakes, but they judge that, on balance, these problems could be managed and reduced to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals warn of algorithmic mistakes and unintended escalation leading to unwanted wars. Unwanted escalation occurs when neither nation-state really wants war, but both fear losing the war if the other side attacks first. Not wanting war, a nation-state may nevertheless choose to start one because it wants defeat even less. It fears that the other nation-state is likely to attack and judges that with extant military technologies at play, an attack is likely to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians underscore the centrality of human life above all. Humanitarians fear that whatever the sophistication of the algorithms, unacceptable mistakes are inevitable because of the importance of understanding context in use of force decisions. Algorithms may learn to accurately judge what criteria make an actor a legitimate military target, but might be unable to grapple with complexity, for example, if the actor is a child. This group remains troubled by the prospect of any autonomous firing decisions but especially when the target is a human being, and urge constraints on the use of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of war, part of a broader body of international humanitarian law, seeks to assure that war is conducted with distinction, proportionality, and humanity. The United States military is required to maintain consistency with the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians have been seeking the adoption of additional components of the law of war to prohibit the use of AWS to target humans. These components would require “meaningful” or “effective” human control, generally defined as human involvement in the selection of the specific target (as opposed to a target being selected by an algorithm) and in the making of a firing decision (as opposed to preapproval by a commander based on some prespecified criteria).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an alternative perspective that the classic requirements for distinction, proportionality, and humanity under the law of war could lead to responsible use of AI-enabled military capabilities. Liberals and humanitarians doubt, not unreasonably, that such responsible application would in fact occur, and there is too much recent evidence in favor of their position to reject these doubts out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report concedes the vulnerability to mistakes and thus urges the development of analytical tools to minimize and manage these risks. AI-enabled military capabilities, to include algorithms to identify targets in a firing network, should not be used until such tools are developed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report joins many voices in the debate, including that of the U.S government, to argue that the additional prohibitions on lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) proposed by humanitarians should not be adopted. The “meaningful” or “effective” human control requirement would eliminate much of the warfighting benefit from a posited responsible autonomous sensor and firing network, since it would slow the process considerably and perhaps enable adversary efforts to move key assets out of the effective reach of U.S. capabilities or even use them first against U.S. forces. The problematic aspects of AI-enabled weapons should be governed by the classic law of war—distinction, proportionality, and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as with any discussion between the realists and humanitarians, there is the great difficulty of reconciling the perspective on human life at home with the perspective on the battlefield. Wars occur, and realists remind the nation-state that wars need to be deterred and, when necessary, won. Humanitarians draw attention to the enduring perplexity of conducting wars to protect a people, through the device of killing another people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AI-enabled sensing and firing network, be it large or small, would crystallize the differences among realists, liberals, and humanitarians. The risk of technical mistakes is real in every stage of a sensor and firing network but is particularly acute in the first phase, in which the algorithm is supposed to identify legitimate military targets and only legitimate military targets consistent with military requirements and distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage two is when the blue weapons are allocated against each red target as determined in the first stage. That allocation should minimize collateral damage to ensure that proportionality and humanity requirements are met. Stage three is the firing decision made either by a human operator or by an algorithm. The challenge in each stage increases proportionally as the scale of the enterprise—the number of red targets and blue weapons—increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stages two and three will be vulnerable to escalation risk because there will be military advantage to acting quickly. If war is inevitable, acting quickly to secure the resulting benefits makes sense. If there is still diplomatic hope that war could be avoided, though, acting quickly because of escalation pressures could turn a diplomatic crisis into a war wanted by neither side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage three is where the decisions about autonomous firing decisions would play out in one of three ways: as the result of (1) real-time human control, (2) earlier considered human control, or (3) carelessness, the absence of any type of meaningful control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, technical issues of accuracy and robustness are most likely to plague efforts in the first phase, while escalation issues are most likely to plague those in the second and third, and the decisionmaking issues around appropriate firing authority are most likely to plague the third phase. (See Appendix I for further consideration of these issues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians all agree that AI in war will be transformative. Yet the policy recommendations of these groups are irreconcilable, with their calls, respectively, for more and swifter incorporation, limits on incorporation, and a prohibition on all LAWs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytical tools for accuracy and robustness must be developed and incorporated into decisionmaking. These tools and their responsible use would demonstrate respect for these different perspectives, if not their categorical observance. Otherwise, the ongoing responsibilities of the United States in war seem impossible to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remarkable-yet-fragile-ai-algorithms&quot;&gt;Remarkable Yet Fragile: AI Algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of advance in artificial intelligence leaves only one key observation stable: The technology is advancing more rapidly than the policy frameworks to manage its implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many recent technical advances and policy debates have focused on large language models (LLMs), which burst into public notice in November 2022. The current boom in AI really started a decade earlier, in the 2012 ImageNet competition when the winning algorithm had half the errors of the second-place winner, achieving the greater accuracy through the technique of using neural networks, a supplement to an algorithm that significantly increases its accuracy but is voracious in terms of data and power consumption. The theories that power AI stretch back much further than 2012; the formal start of the modern era is generally dated to an AI conference held at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956. Despite the earlier articulation of many of the critical theoretical insights, the field took off in the early twenty-first century largely because two additional, essential innovations became widely available: massive datasets, thanks to the internet, and large amounts of computing power, thanks to the ongoing advances of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, it was true that a larger training database yielded a more accurate algorithm as long as there was no constraint on available computing power. The amount of data needed for an accurate algorithm was usually large but varied significantly depending on the type of algorithm and the complexity of the problem. AI image recognition algorithms, for instance, often used millions of images, while LLMs used billions of pieces of data acquired from millions of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first cracks in this verity showed up at the outset of 2025. Advances by the Chinese company DeepSeek seem to have demonstrated a technical strategy to program an LLM with significantly less computing power that nevertheless yielded an algorithm as good as the best U.S. LLM algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the need for ever-larger data sets was undercut by recent indications that in certain contexts, small language models could yield accurate algorithms. These most recent advances demonstrate principally that technical progress in AI remains rapid and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is remarkable but can be fragile. Artificial intelligence closely studies a training database and derives an algorithm from it; the algorithm then goes out into the real world to evaluate previously unseen examples of the same phenomena as contained in the database. Depending on the type of AI, the algorithm performs various tasks with remarkable accuracy, including making predictions, identifying correlations, optimizing strategies, or generating text or other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI’s fragility lies in its vulnerability to mistakes, some of which lie hidden in its stores of data or in the interworking of complex algorithms. Most technical mistakes in the use of AI algorithms arise from one of three broad categories: (1) the training database (this report looks particularly at drift and poisoned data), (2) the algorithm type (particularly generative AI, reinforcement learning, or a hybrid), or (3) the interpretation of the algorithm’s findings by the user (specifically automation and user bias). This set of mistakes should not be expected to be static; it is likely to change over time as technical advances eliminate some sources of mistakes and create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical mistakes can occur regardless of the domain within which the algorithm is being used. The frequency with which the mistakes occur can vary among domains, as can their effects. Mistakes in the domain of war, of course, can have grave consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training-database-errors&quot;&gt;Training Database Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training database problems—the first category of errors common to AI—occur when there are differences between the database and the phenomena in the real world that the algorithm is evaluating. Information from the real world is called an input, and the process of evaluating that input with the algorithm is called inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue of the relationship between the entries in the training database and the inputs in the real world can be seen in an example using a powerful type of machine learning called supervised learning. Supervised learning uses a labeled database. For example, an image recognition algorithm might be trained on a large database with many images of military tanks, military trucks, and civilian school buses. Each image is labeled. The algorithm would study the images and distill for itself rules to correctly label previously unseen images of each of these types of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm could then be used in the real world to exam inputs of images of previously unseen vehicles. The expectation is that the algorithm would correctly identify each new input as either a military tank, a military truck, or a school bus. (The algorithm also should have an “other” category since it is likely to encounter other types of vehicles.) The entries of the training database are ideally selected to be as similar as possible to the expected inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, though, the input data may be different or become different from the training database over time, in ways large or small. These differences can cause errors in AI algorithms used for inference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, the accuracy of the algorithm’s findings could be undercut if, for example, the adversary military started to use civilian trucks or school buses to transport military equipment or personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drift&quot;&gt;Drift&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging differences between the training database and the input data is known as drift. Drift occurs when the phenomena in the real-world change over time. Eventually, the algorithm will become inaccurate because of the differences between the database and the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a simple example, consider efforts to train an image recognition algorithm to identify where adversary troops are making camp during an invasion into a contested region. Intelligence services are confident that the adversary uses the same units and equipment in invasions that it does in exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training database therefore uses pictures of the region during adversary exercises, where the adversary—say, the Russian army—moves its equipment into the contested region for all to see. The pictures in the training database capture the visual appearance of the equipment and the environment where the equipment is parked. The region is forested, containing many deciduous trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feared invasion occurs. Theoretically, the algorithm should help identify where the invasion forces are located to facilitate accurate blue targeting. New photographs are taken after the invasion to be used as inputs to the algorithm that was trained on earlier adversary exercises in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images in the database that trained the algorithm, however, differ significantly from the images in the inputs. First, the Russians are using high-quality camouflage to conceal the tanks during the invasion. Second, the pictures for the training database were all taken during the winter, when the trees were without leaves—and the invasion occurs in the spring. These differences between the inputs and the training data will reduce the accuracy of the image recognition algorithm, possibly enough to render it unhelpful to targeting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it remains the case that some types of patterns could reasonably be expected to repeat themselves: A vehicle that looks like a Russian tank, contains the same percentage of different metals as a Russian tank, and generates the same heat signature as a Russian tank probably is a Russian tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training database for an algorithm to identify Russian tanks could contain copious entries with each of these pieces of data. Algorithms to identify the same type of adversary equipment based on a training database that contained many different types of sensor data about each entry probably would be both accurate and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how useful is such an algorithm on a battlefield where both friendly and adversary forces use Russian tanks? This potential complication demonstrates the importance of the analytical tools having qualitative in addition to quantitative elements. The qualitative components should aim to make certain characteristics of the algorithm accessible to the military personnel using it, helping them use their judgment to understand whether the intangibles of war render the algorithm unhelpful, even if its math is exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AI algorithms are remarkable, there are aspects of the use case and the training database that can be sources of errors. Identifying these aspects will require both technical and military expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIES TO MANAGE DRIFT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, generalizations about robustness—the effectiveness of the algorithm for a similar but not identical use in the future—could be distilled. Training databases that contain multimodal sensor readings for the same piece of equipment—heat, visual, metal content, generated effluents—are likely, on balance, to be accurate and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it remains to be demonstrated systematically that there will be sufficient alignment to make AI algorithms accurate for a particular use on a particular day, much less that the algorithm will be robust enough to provide confidence that it will be accurate in some future set of related but different, perhaps even unanticipated, use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial sector is one of the domains with the longest track record of using AI. Drift has proven to be consistent problem, and the commercial sector has developed a variety of strategies to manage it. Many businesses, for example, have developed techniques to measure the substantive difference between the training data and the input data. There also are techniques to measure the impact of drift, thereby facilitating an understanding of when retraining is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some businesses have standards that specify the rate at which they need to remove the oldest data and supplement the training database with new data to maintain the desired level of accuracy in the algorithm. This gradual replacement of the training data is called adaptive learning. The military should adopt some of these techniques and perhaps develop new ones to identify, measure, and responsibly manage the problems associated with drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATTERNS IN TACTICS OR IN STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question about war is how much of it is based on patterns. This is AI’s original gift: seeing patterns unrecognizable to humans because of their extraordinary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, war is filled with unknowns, what Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz described as, “a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty.” He goes on to say, “A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.” AI, certainly a skilled intelligence of a sort, may well be able to lift some of the fog, but whether it can entirely eliminate it remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clausewitz also refers to war as “the realm of chance.” It is unclear whether what appears to be chance—unseasonable weather, an unexpected technical failing, a line of infantry that held when it was expected to fail—can in the future be predicted by a sufficiently robust AI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of a thinking, reacting adversary trying to exploit any overreliance on patterns seems likely to further complicate AI’s ability to understand war. Clausewitz pointed particularly to the challenges of rules predicting the course of “a continuous interaction of opposites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are routine tasks at the tactical level such as aiming and firing an artillery piece, there also are more singular tasks such as a commander’s decision on when, where, how, and indeed whether to attack. Strategic decisions seem difficult to predict, particularly because the training database seems unlikely to be large enough or representative enough of the personality and experience of the relevant commander. Generals who share formal training often pursue very different strategies in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many wars, or at least battles, have been won by the unexpected decision of a strategic commander: leaving a large wooden horse just outside the adversary’s well-secured city, or exploiting unsecured cockpits of large commercial jet liners traversing major urban areas. Could an algorithm anticipate the first uses of these stratagems, or move beyond pattern recognition to the type of creativity that wins wars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report recognizes that the technology is advancing rapidly and that its abilities and their limitations in the future will be different than any interim assessment issued now. It is reasonable, though, to question what type of military decisions could be managed by artificial intelligence in the near- and mid-term. AI, with its persistent reliance on databases of previously acquired data, may be well suited to some types of military decisions (e.g., a firing decision) and poorly suited to others (e.g., high-level military tactics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;poisoned-data&quot;&gt;Poisoned Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further type of problem with training databases or inputs is the use of poisoned data by an adversary. Poisoned data is manipulated to exploit aspects of the algorithm to cause it to yield inaccurate results. This can arise either in the training data or in the input data. Militaries should expect and be prepared to defend against poisoned data attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example might be that an adversary has a missile that it programs to always follow a certain evasive maneuver: At a particular distance from the target, it always feints to the right before homing in on its mark. The data from these observed flights would be analyzed by the United States, who would almost certainly identify the consistent feinting to the right before impact. A resulting blue targeting algorithm for the red missiles would likely predict the feint to the right and incorporate that maneuver into its steps to locate the red missile in flight for targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately prior to the start of the invasion, however, red programmers could alter the pattern of the missiles to feint to the left instead. The blue AI algorithm would presumably aim the defensive missiles with the expectation that the red missiles would follow a feint to the right, as had been observed over the previous years of training and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example relies on a sudden discontinuity in behavior to confuse the algorithm, but poison data attacks often directly alter the physical information encoded into the algorithm. An adversary could alter just a few pixels in an image to cause the algorithm to incorrectly identify it. One study found that a photo of an academic building could be altered so that an image recognition algorithm identifies it instead as a dinosaur. To the naked eye, there is no difference between the two images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poisoned data attacks seem like the type of risks that would be both persistent and constantly evolving—an adversary would be launching these attacks ceaselessly, while switching up the method. The better an adversary understands how the blue algorithm is distilling its behavior or characteristics, the more effectively the adversary could trick the algorithm. This would be a particularly likely place to see the effects of Clausewitz’s “continuous interaction of opposites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;algorithm-errors&quot;&gt;Algorithm Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second source of errors in AI is in the mechanisms of the algorithm itself. There are two main types of algorithms discussed here: (1) generative AI and (2) reinforcement learning. Each has a different combination of strengths and weaknesses. Generative AI is known to produce random answers or “hallucinations,” and reinforcement learning is vulnerable to poor or incomplete goals. This section also discusses the challenges of assessing hybrid algorithms, which can combine several different types of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;generative-ai&quot;&gt;Generative AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all its triumphs, generative AI—the type of AI that has fueled ChatGPT and other types of interactive models—is known to be vulnerable to mistakes, generating answers that are random or stochastic, meaning that some answers are not correct and the rate at which the algorithm will produce incorrect answers cannot be predicted with precision. This problem is more commonly known as hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, there are likely to be clever technical or mathematical strategies to manage this vulnerability. Technical strategies to assess the confidence associated with generative AI answers are emerging but are still in the research stage. Among the disquieting realities about generative AI is the observation that there is a rather poor understanding around how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report recommends that the DOD not incorporate generative AI into algorithms that are used in sensing and firing networks or other sensitive uses until there are significant advances in this type of algorithm to manage, mitigate, or eliminate its vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI may be useful for other DOD functions, however, including screening materials for more fine-grained analysis by intelligence analysts. The department, though, needs to ensure that the use of generative AI is stated explicitly in the qualitative tools provided to military personnel and that its role is carefully evaluated in each use case because of its risk of erroneous outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI, like all types of AI, is also vulnerable to reproducing errors or gaps in its training database. If the database is biased or out of date, answers generated by the algorithm also will be biased or out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least some of the recent efforts to improve the performance of generative AI algorithms have had unexpected and disquieting results, increasing the number of wrong answers given by the model and sometimes behaving in a way that a human would characterize as cheating to win in a competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these oddities arise from the way the algorithms are trained. Generative AI algorithms are trained on huge databases of information. In the case of a large language model, the database could be millions of websites totaling billions of words, images, videos, or sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model that emerges from this training is sometimes called a foundation model. Foundation models are often optimized for a particular use through the addition of a user interface. Most famous, perhaps, are the user interfaces that function as chatbots that interact with user questions. The user interface often involves additional training, which can both enhance the effectiveness of the interface for the user and introduce additional problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, chatbot interfaces often receive further training through reinforcement learning human feedback (RLHF), where a human reviewer is given two candidate answers to the same question and asked to identify the answer they prefer. This additional information about human preferences is used by the chatbot to refine the subsequent answers it generates for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study demonstrated—perhaps counterintuitively—that RLHF can increase the number of wrong answers an LLM provides. This is because prior to human training, the chatbot provided both correct and incorrect answers, as well as saying it did not know the answer to some questions. During RLHF training, it learned that humans did not like when it said it did not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to the model answering a larger percentage of the questions overall—some right and some wrong—and saying it did not know the answer on a lower percentage of questions. By offering answers to a greater proportion of questions it was ignorant about, the chatbot had a higher rate of incorrect answers overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, recent studies indicate that even more sophisticated models called frontier LLM agents “can strategically circumvent the intended rules of their environment to achieve objectives, with more capable models showing this behavior more frequently.” When playing a chess game against another model, the more sophisticated models would “often observe that the chess engine is too strong for them to win against and then hack the game environment to win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is work underway within the DOD to understand how generative AI could be safely integrated into the warfighting enterprise. However, the department should wait until the commercial technology sector makes significant progress in terms of accuracy before incorporating it into military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD, despite its many strengths, is unlikely to be the place that makes the technical breakthrough to render generative AI consistently accurate enough to be appropriate to perform safety-critical functions. It is reasonable to expect that at some point, generative AI could be incorporated into sensitive military capabilities. Based on current information, though, that point has not yet arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should also be careful with the use of reinforcement learning algorithms, which devise the optimal strategy to achieve a specific goal within the constraints of a set of rules. Superbly suited to chess or other board games where the goal and rules are well specified, these algorithms are powerful but face more of a challenge in the real world, where a thorough-going characterization of the “rules” and the “goal” is much more difficult. Already used in autonomous cars, this is the type of algorithm most likely to be incorporated into military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some artificial intelligence experts warn that as algorithms become more powerful, creative, and interconnected through the internet, there is a growing risk of a dangerous “alignment problem.” An alignment problem would emerge if the human programmer failed to fully specify the goal, and the algorithm misinterpreted the human’s intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A famous thought experiment about this problem is that of an AI-driven robot in a paperclip factory being told to produce paperclips. When the unexpectedly efficient robot has used up all the designated raw materials for the purpose, the robot goes to the parking lot and tears bumpers off cars to make more paperclips, consistent with its understanding of the direction it received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example highlights the risk that humans will fail to caveat the specified goal in ways that they thought were implicit—either because the goal has changed over time, or the goal needed to be refined as preferences shifted. One leading thinker on reinforcement learning has urged computer scientists to increasingly move to program computers in a way that creates uncertainty about the goal on the part of the computer, so that it seeks regular updating and clarification from the human programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should incorporate this insight for its reinforcement learning algorithms. In other words, it should adopt strategies to avoid alignment problems through one of two broad strategies: by (1) building deference into the goal definition to assure that the algorithm checks back in for further direction at significant and regular junctures, or (2) limiting the specific geographic area where the targeting should take place, the duration of the engagement during which the algorithm would be allowed to operate, and other characteristics of the engagement. Overly general guidance like “kill members of the opposing military” should always be avoided on principle and to avoid grievous misunderstandings by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modification in goal definition is important, as alignment problems emerging in targeting algorithms due to reinforcement learning could lead to the most dystopian of scenarios. The prospect of cars, houses, or—worst of all—people with certain characteristics being designated as targets by a roving uncontrolled robot should drive DOD programmers to incorporate the strategies in goal definition urged by thought leaders in the field of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-algorithms&quot;&gt;Hybrid Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of multiple algorithms into a single hybrid algorithm would represent an additional level of complexity. Many real-world applications already use collaborating algorithms: For instance, an autonomous car driven by a reinforcement learning algorithm receives as input the findings of a separate image recognition algorithm which identifies items along the prospective route and assesses whether they are likely to stay still (e.g., lampposts) or to move, possibly into the route of the car (e.g., a cyclist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called hybrid models bind the inner workings of algorithms even more closely together than existing collaborative models. Every algorithm, like every measurement, is likely to have an error margin, even if it is an accurate algorithm. The error range for different algorithms would in general be expected to vary independently, i.e., one error is a little high, and the other error is a little low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this blending of different errors generally will not harm the final answer much, since the two errors often cancel each other out. There could be a situation, however, where all the errors trend in the same direction, and in that case, what were acceptably small errors in the supporting algorithms create an error of unacceptable size in the final, dominant algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example a reinforcement learning algorithm that identifies an optimal search path for blue forces to move through a red village. There are no strictly military items in this village, but certain dual-use items have been used by a guerilla force in other villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal search path is determined by several subordinate algorithms. These supervised learning algorithms evaluate images of dual-use items in the village to identify whether they are suspect or not suspect. Suspect items need to be approached cautiously by blue forces and carefully searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For accuracy, it would be best if the underlying incidence of guerilla infiltration in the current village was the same as the underlying infiltration of the villages searched by the experienced soldiers who labeled each of the images in the supervised learning training database. Statistics and guerrilla infiltration, though, are not always in perfect alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say the experienced soldiers were sent first to the villages with the most evident problems with guerillas. Seeing many dual-use items in use by guerillas, the experienced soldiers would accurately reflect their experience by labeling many images in the training database as being suspect. The algorithm would then reflect the expectation that all villages had significant infiltration by the guerilla forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now trained, the algorithm is heading out to be used in the real world. The new village where the algorithm is being used, however, is not as intertwined with the guerrilla group as the first village. Very few of the dual-use items in fact are being used for military purposes. The dynamics created during the search by the difference between algorithmic expectation and reality could be lethal, particularly if other factors make the search tense, such as the blue force being weary or inexperienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates how an error in one algorithm could result in an even larger error in the overall hybrid algorithm. It should be noted that the original source of the error is another training database problem, namely that the original training database failed to reflect the underlying population from which the data was drawn. Qualitative tools that enable the leaders of small tactical units to thoughtfully evaluate warfare algorithms to assess whether they align with the actual conditions confronting the unit are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hypothetical scenarios show why the accuracy of the algorithms—including hybrid algorithms—need to be closely analyzed in some technical detail, particularly at the outset, before responsible generalizations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-interaction-errors&quot;&gt;User Interaction Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third source of errors in AI algorithms arises from how the human being provided with the algorithm’s result interprets that result. These challenges are an issue in any domain where AI algorithms are used. The challenges of human-algorithm interaction in warfighting are likely to be particularly daunting because of the high stakes and the time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also likely to be challenging because of the unusually broad range of types of interaction. These may include heads-up displays in aircraft and other vehicles, controls for robotic arms, or robotic exoskeletons. This extensive range evokes the complicated topic of human-machine interface. The DOD has a long and often successful background in managing these types of human-machine interface issues. This study acknowledges these complicated problems but does not seek to uniquely advance this important debate. The issues identified here are not from the unique human-machine interface context but rather arise from AI use in all types of domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automation-bias&quot;&gt;Automation Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation bias is likely to be a significant vulnerability for military uses. The source of this error is in the readiness of a human operator to passively accept rather than rigorously reevaluate the finding of a complicated, quantitative process such as an AI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is substantial evidence to support the presence of this risk. One study, for example, details an experiment where individuals were putatively being given a tour of a new building by a robot. As part of the study, the fire alarm suddenly goes off without explanation and smoke starts emerging from the hallways in front of the tour group. To the left of the group are clearly marked, smoke-free emergency exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robot urges the tour group to follow it into the smoky hallways, stating that these hallways offer the safest route out of the building. The overwhelming number of individuals who participated in this study followed the robot into the smoky rooms, as opposed to exiting through the visible and well-marked emergency exits immediately on their left. Similar automation bias has been documented in commercial flights, car navigation systems, AI for self-driving cars, and the business sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “overtrust” risks appear to be heightened in time-sensitive, pressure filled contexts. The terrible rhythm of war has been discussed by several authors, and close study of these works indicates that once the battle begins there are a host of very human factors—including fear and revenge—that can compromise decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-bias&quot;&gt;User Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While automation bias leads a user to passively accept the recommendation of an algorithm, user bias leads a user to accept the recommendation of an algorithm when it aligns with their expectation of the right answer, and to reject it when it does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant literature that demonstrates that quantitative findings consistent with a user’s preexisting views are more likely to be accepted as opposed to a finding that goes against previously held beliefs. Studies in the United States have demonstrated these effects in law enforcement, particularly in an algorithm that generated a score that purportedly reflected a defendant’s risk of recidivism: “Judges were more likely to accept low scores for white defendants, while overriding similar scores for black defendants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are indications in the literature that some techniques for presenting the findings of algorithms, particularly when they are set in a larger context of the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic decision aids, could mitigate the ill effects of both automation bias and user bias. Efforts within the DOD should seek to investigate such strategies and implement those that show promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feedback-loop-bias&quot;&gt;Feedback Loop Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback loop bias is a vulnerability of algorithms that use interactions with the algorithm as entries in an updated training database to further refine and update the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of such algorithms include Google search. Often, individuals who share a particular perspective on an issue are most likely to ask certain questions. When the algorithm offers nominated web sites, the bias of the individual may lead them to select a website congruent with that perspective. The next time the same question is asked, the algorithm will present the selected website as a higher nominee in the list of candidate responses to the search query. This is because the algorithm notes which nominated website was selected after a particular query was made. Selected webpages are then presented higher in the list of suggested websites in response to the same query the next time it is posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a feedback loop bias where the biased website is more and more likely to be selected and hence to rise to higher levels in the list of websites suggested in response to the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google search engine is an example of a mechanistically connected feedback loop bias. As has already been discussed, a hybrid algorithm can be vulnerable to the same problem at a slightly greater remove. The report previously described how soldiers who had cleared villages with wide-spread guerilla infiltration had been asked to label the images of dual-use items that are commonly found in villages as being either suspect (and hence needing a thorough search) or not suspect (and thus not needing a search). The images and their labeling were then used as the training database for a supervised learning algorithm which contributed to a reinforcement learning algorithm that mapped the best path for a blue tactical unit clearing a red village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general principal it is useful to use interactions with an algorithm to further refine and update it, but unanticipated effects in a military context should be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense experts need to move beyond wanting to add AI in general toward a more particular understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. AI algorithms have demonstrated a host of generic errors. These generally arise from errors in the training database, the mechanism of the algorithm itself, or from the user’s interpretation of the algorithm result. Tragedy beckons if the DOD uses AI for warfighting but fails to recognize these many sources of potential errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;characteristics-of-needed-analytical-tools&quot;&gt;Characteristics of Needed Analytical Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report urges the creation of quantitative and qualitative tools to enable effective and responsible use of AI algorithms in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative tools are needed for three purposes: accuracy, robustness, and wargame instrumentation. Accuracy is assessed in the field (e.g., would a missile launched from behind this bush destroy that enemy tank and only that tank?) while robustness is more of a prediction to inform decisions in the command center and Situation Room (e.g., would prospective uses in a specific operation yield the expected military effects with acceptable collateral damage?) Wargame instrumentation is more complex because it requires modeling interaction effects— in other words, both what the effects of the blue weapons would be and the tactics and outcomes of the red forces. Well-instrumented wargames consistently have been an element of a successful peacetime military innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critically important that these algorithms are not treated as black boxes by the military personnel using them. Military personnel do not need to be experts in AI, but they should be able to identify and evaluate whether the conditions of the real-world operation are sufficiently aligned with the design specifications of the algorithm to ensure that it can be responsibly used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualitative tools should help military personnel make this assessment. Training materials and simulations should strive to highlight possible characteristics of a future operation that would render a standard algorithm too inaccurate to use in that operation. Alternative techniques to rectify problems with algorithms should be practiced in training exercises. Examples of these problems would include an operation where a friendly military is using Russian tanks, and the algorithm was trained to identify targets using the physical characteristics of Russian tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualitative tools should also help military personnel assess whether the algorithm’s confidence about distinction (i.e., accurately distinguishing noncombatants from combatants) needs to be adjusted given the characteristics of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, say such an algorithm is being used on an isolated military base. If new information about the context became available—for example, students from a civilian school are visiting the base—the blue military commander may need to increase the required confidence level for the algorithm to identify an input as a legitimate military target. The qualitative description of the algorithm should include the standard confidence level required for a positive identification and allow, in specified circumstances, on-scene commanders to adjust that confidence level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has discussed various training database problems, including drift and poisoned data. In a particularly dynamic battlefield environment, it may be necessary to enable a tactical commander to identify when the accuracy of the pretrained algorithm becomes too low. These units would ideally be equipped with the ability to build a new database in real time and train an algorithm to be much more accurate. Creating such a capability at the unit level will require new analytics and equipment, but may be the only strategy to deal with fast-changing battlefield situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of qualitative information would also be valuable in more complicated uses of AI. A plausible use case would be rapidly integrating information from different streams of sensor data. The most complex type of integration might well happen for the fastest-moving adversary systems (e.g., a hypersonic missile). In such a situation, there would be extreme time pressure to evaluate and ratify the assessment of the algorithm integrating each of the separate modalities of sensor data. However, the time pressure involved could severely limit the amount of real-time decisionmaking available to military commanders faced with an incoming attack. Trusting the AI might be the best—and indeed, only—course in this situation. Where then, do qualitative tools come in, in circumstances like these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision support systems should always contain explicit markings that a particular AI algorithm is being used, and the assumptions embedded in the algorithm should be available for study. But as in the example above, there should be no expectation that this qualitative data will always be studied during actual use. Rather, it would be available for review, and military personnel could be expected to review it during initial familiarization with sensors and before and after training sessions. Training—both classroom and exercise—should present scenarios where the assumptions in commonly used decision support algorithms are invalidated by some peculiarity of the scenario. Lessons learned sessions after the exercise should highlight the characteristics of the peculiarity that undercut the utility of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to build some expertise within the user base about the embedded assumptions, so that military personnel could assess whether a characteristic of a particular use invalidated some of the assumptions. This is a far from a perfect solution, but it seems like the best method to both benefit from algorithms’ speed of integrating disparate sensor data and ensure that key system operators understand the assumptions embedded in these algorithms, so that they can identify those rare occasions when the assumptions might not hold and alter provisions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the qualitative tools for any algorithm to be used in a mission should be part of the regular operating responsibilities of the fighting unit itself, not only a review conducted outside of the unit by the DOD Test and Evaluation community as has instead been widely recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ais-debut-on-the-battlefield&quot;&gt;AI’s Debut on the Battlefield&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sustained campaigns of artificial intelligence in war have been observed in recent months on the battlefields in Ukraine and the border regions of Russia. These instances provide ample evidence for the realist argument that AI-enabled military capabilities could be decisive in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine first used small inexpensive commercial drones for surveillance and reconnaissance. A drone was likely the source of the location data that enabled a Ukrainian solider to target the shoulder-fired missile shots outside of Kyiv that disabled the first and last Russian tanks in the convoy that was headed toward Kyiv—but never arrived—in the early days of the Russian attack on Ukraine in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ukraine and Russia have since become even more skilled at using drones. The Ukrainians have largely used commercial drones developed for racing and have made parts using 3D printers to optimize for different missions, yielding a remarkable capability with a low per-unit cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ukrainian soldiers began placing small explosive charges on the drones. These jerry-rigged drones were maneuvered by a Ukrainian operator over a valuable Russian target, at which time the operator would detonate the explosive. In response, the Russians jammed the communications between the operator and the drone, preventing the detonation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any conflict with a calculating adversary, the measure and countermeasure competition between defense and offense quickly got underway. Cost, technology, and tactics help determine who gains the upper hand in any given scenario. In this case, the Ukrainians responded to the jamming (at least in part) by having the drone use an image recognition algorithm to identify the target and detonate at a specified distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have been the first use of an AI sensor and firing network in warfare. It is a small network indeed but was often successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant exploration underway in Ukraine and in most militaries about the next phase of operational and tactical uses for AI and small platforms, particularly drones. There has been exploration of ideas for drone “swarms” operating together to advance a common objective. These plans sometimes seek to use these swarms of drones to overwhelm defenses and pursue attacks. There is speculation that these swarms might be able to penetrate even sophisticated defenses, possibly at significantly lower cost than the cost of the defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been meaningful progress in individual programs within the DOD, there should be a more systematic effort to understand, benefit from, and defend against these technologies. Peacetime innovation is difficult but vastly preferable to waiting for the lessons meted out in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War can demonstrate how new technologies can be most effectively incorporated into military capabilities. Those lessons, though, are dearly bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Adams, who was quoted at the outset of this report, observed that there are limits to history’s right to meddle because of the complexity of emerging technologies. Meddling seems fraught indeed when one confronts the pace and complexity of advances in artificial intelligence. AI is enabling capabilities that are transforming most substantive domains more rapidly than the domain experts or the body politic at large can sort through the implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bombs educate vigorously, but algorithms used for quieter purposes are more likely to creep in unnoticed, reproducing and reinforcing historical bias, or eliminating privacy, the companion to civil liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD could play a useful role if it catalyzes the development of tools that lower the tremendous difficulty of assessing, managing, and controlling algorithms. These tools could move into nondefense applications as well, enhancing the ability of experts in other domains to manage AI use responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps citizens are prepared to passively accept the decisions of algorithms powering their news feeds or the weapons of the military fighting in their name. Perhaps they are even prepared to passively accept the decisions of their government, forgetting the rights they secured when it was first created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History may have no right to meddle. But citizens do and can strive to build the future they want. History will tell the story, but the people, by omission or commission, will write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-i&quot;&gt;Appendix I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Meaningful Sensor and Firing Network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has discussed how a theater-wide sensor and firing network, with other reforms, could shore up the effectiveness of the U.S. power projection strategy. This appendix examines the details of a sensor and firing network and evaluates its challenges in the context of the concerns expressed by the three schools of thinkers about the cause and effect of war: the realists, the liberals, and the humanitarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, meaningful decisions must be made about the use of force. On this point, at least, there should be broad agreement among the realists, liberals, and humanitarians. The decision should be meaningful in the sense that it aligns with well-considered assessments of military effectiveness and law of war compliance. How to secure such meaningful decisions, of course, is highly contested in AI-enabled war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists tend to judge that war is generally either being deterred or fought. Given this contested environment, realists feel urgency to improve warfighting capabilities. Realists tend to be optimistic that mistakes in algorithms could be managed if not eliminated and hence are inclined to develop such algorithms and enjoy the expected warfighting benefits of speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals tend to judge that it is possible to move beyond always having to deter or fight a war: Areas of cooperation between nation-states can be found, nourished, and sometimes sustained. Hence, efforts to build responsible algorithms can proceed at a measured and deliberate pace. Liberals also are concerned that AI-enabled military capabilities are significantly vulnerable to unwanted escalation. Unwanted escalation occurs when neither nation-state desired war but both fear losing if the other side attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians center their attention on human life and strive to build, nourish, and sustain norms to reduce suffering, including suffering caused by war. These norms tend to focus on the basic humanity of all people, but they acknowledge differences between combatants and non-combatants during war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians argue that the only way to assure meaningful decisions is to assure that a human is “in the loop” of a decision to target a particular item or to make and execute a firing decision. Under this view, relying on an algorithm, whatever its provenance, is inherently not meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locus of concern for these different perspectives can be shown by looking closely at the different stages of a sensing and firing network. The challenge for accuracy—a blue algorithm properly identifying and characterizing a red target—principally emerges in the first stage of the firing network. The second and third stage both raise the risk of unintended escalation, and the third stage is where the conundrum about what truly constitutes “meaningful” control emerges, whether it is a human in the loop or an automated decision based on prior human approval under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-first-stage&quot;&gt;The First Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage of a sensor and firing network would be identification of a red target. The second stage would be the allocation of blue weapons against that red target. The third stage would be the decision to fire the blue weapons against the red targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of targets increases, the complexity of each of the stages also increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as the number of targets increases, the information that needs to be acquired about each red target in the first stage also increases. The additional information is needed so that the blue weapons could be allocated against the red targets optimally, maximizing military effectiveness and minimizing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A red target could be in an isolated area on a military base with a strictly controlled perimeter and no civilians. Or, at the other end of a theoretical continuum, it could be in densely populated civilian area. Most targets, of course, are likely to be in a blended context, with some civilian assets in the general area of a red military target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some red targets will have various physical characteristics that need to be considered when assessing from a military point of view how to destroy them. Some of these characteristics require special munitions, such as deeply buried or heavily protected red targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red biological or chemical weapons stockpiles require special techniques to avoid lofting or otherwise dispersing the material in a manner that could contaminate surrounding populations or embedding it in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some red targets will be considered “perishable” in the sense that their location could change quickly, and they might be very difficult to locate again. This category often includes items like mobile missile launchers and sometimes includes command posts. It also might include a military unit that is still located at a base but is expected to move into a civilian area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some heavily defended red military targets might pose significant risks to blue piloted aircraft and so should be preferentially attacked by drones or other unmanned techniques. These are examples of the type of information about a red target that would be needed to inform the allocation of blue weapons against those targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has emphasized, these sensitive algorithms would require high standards for accuracy and robustness. Some algorithms—such as generative AI algorithms at their present state of technical development—are too vulnerable to errors to be used in such a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Required confidence for a targeting algorithm should be “dialable,” with policymakers and commanders able to require a higher level of confidence for some missions in some contexts. The greater the risk that civilian and military personnel or equipment could be comingled should result in a higher level of confidence from a targeting algorithm. A lower (but still robust) level might be acceptable in a context that is confidently occupied by exclusively military equipment and personnel. This would be consistent with the requirements for distinction under the laws of armed conflict. Many argue that the precise effects of AI-enabled capabilities could, on balance, reduce collateral effects overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proportionality would require an assessment of the military benefit of a particular attack and its associated effects on civilian personnel or infrastructure. Certain munitions could cause more limited collateral damage than other types of munitions consistent with achieving the military objective. For example, a precision munition should be used in situations where the target is in a dense city environment and the overall calculation of military effect and collateral damage is assessed to be proportional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an illustrative list of the characteristics of a red target that should be acquired in stage one to inform the allocation process in stage two. The target needs to be identified, validated, and then characterized so that this information could be used in the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These requirements for stage one reinforce the challenges for a sensing and firing network. This report argues that algorithms should be used for military purposes only after they have been thoroughly vetted for their accuracy and robustness in their intended military use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that all three of the classic protagonists between realists, liberals, and humanitarians agree that algorithms would be challenged in war. Realists seem more prepared to judge that these challenges could be responsibly overcome. Liberals and humanitarians warn that these challenges would be very difficult. Humanitarians judge them to be sufficiently difficult that it should not be attempted—that humans need to be in charge of authorizing individual targets and not relying only on algorithms to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of this report, the realists make a compelling argument that there are many war-fighting benefits if these tasks could be performed at the speed of an algorithm. But only if the realists can demonstrate that the task is being done with proper care. Both military effectiveness and the law of war demand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-second-stage&quot;&gt;The Second Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage, allocating blue weapons against validated red targets, is well-suited to automation assuming that high-quality data would be available. As discussed, that is a big assumption for all but the smallest allocation of weapons against targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which the network would get accurate information is worth assessing, as well as its sensitivity to different levels of inaccuracy. It is currently difficult to maintain a common operating picture of blue weapons available in theater across all possible sources of those weapons. Putting together an integrated picture of red targets in theater, particularly with some of the fine-grained information this report argues for, is similarly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation risks emerge because of the cost of delay. A decision to execute the firing plan would be expected to destroy all the red targets. A decision to wait—to conduct additional negotiations, for example, so as to reconcile the point of contention at the heart of the conflict—could turn the prospect of victory for blue into the reality of defeat. Red could use the time to launch its own force package, destroying many blue assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the delay did not enable red to launch an effective attack, it would enable mobile red targets to hide, making it unlikely in many cases that their position could be found again; this might enable red to use some of their weapons against blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be the risk of new errors being introduced if the targets are not monitored after their validation in the first phase. For example, if significant time passes, a group of noncombatants traveling through the area might now surround a military target that was in an isolated area when initially identified and vetted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that unintended escalation is a danger only in those situations where neither state really wants a war. Uncertain about what the other side wants, and reticent to risk losing a war, they act first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perception that military technology makes it likely that the attacker will emerge from the war victorious is called a period of offense dominance, while defense dominance means that the defender is expected, all other elements held constant, to win the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periods where the military technology is offense dominant are judged to be very vulnerable to unwanted escalation. In contrast, a period where the military technology is considered defense dominant is generally considered to be much more stable. Most analysts predict that AI will be offense-dominant technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about AI’s escalation risk seem warranted. If both sides had the comprehensive ability to launch a well-targeted, broad-based attack against the adversary’s forces through large firing networks, victory likely would go to the attacker. There would be pressure to move swiftly to launch before the other side launched. This is the type of reasoning behind the focus on secure second-strike capabilities in the strategic nuclear domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytically, offense-defense theory is powerful. It is worth noting that what seems clear to historians and political scientists, however, appears to be significantly less clear to at least some practitioners operating with the more blurred perspective of the moment. Henry Kissinger, for one, argued that while intellectually attractive, the theory was essentially impossible to implement because of the ambiguity about whether forces were in fact offense or defense dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General strategies for managing escalation seem particularly worthwhile in AI because of the poor understanding of the technology in general and by military experts in particular. More fine-grained strategies seem difficult to develop now given the limited understanding of how they would be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic tool for managing escalation risks is unclassified technical discussions between experienced defense experts, a subset of a category known as transparency- and confidence-building measures. Technical discussions could help each side understand the regular maintenance schedules of particularly sensitive weapons or create relationships that allow consultations when there are specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such discussions are relatively low-cost and low-risk if the participants are experienced professionals, they are worth pursuing for their benefits should an escalation risk emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of such discussions seems particularly powerful at this stage in the development of AI-enabled military capabilities. There is such poor understanding of how the algorithms would work that building a better picture of how allies, then friends, and then adversaries are thinking about this issue would be valuable. Ideally, this would help manage crises between two states if neither of them wanted war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine technical characteristics of AI-enabled military capabilities that would facilitate it being perceived as defense dominant to a potential adversary. The policy literature has not identified any plausible strategy for defense dominance or for transparency, both of which are helpful for managing escalation risks. Technical experts should consider whether there are any techniques to configure AI capabilities to help with these strategic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing AI-related escalation risks should remain at the center of the policy agenda. As a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AI-enabled military capabilities develops, there will be more opportunities to design better strategies to manage escalation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-third-stage&quot;&gt;The Third Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third stage, making or executing a decision to fire, would have both escalation risks and automation concerns. Most pertinent to this stage are the compunctions of humanitarians, who, in the context of the United Nations, have urged the adoption of additional prohibitions in international law that would apply to AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal element of this position has been the requirement for “meaningful” human control of the weapons systems. This requirement has been defined as prohibiting an algorithm from selecting a particular target and from authorizing the firing decision. A human would need to have a meaningful opportunity to evaluate and approve or disapprove the targeting and firing decision (being in the loop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional regulations sought specifically by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would have the effect of building additional space—in time and clarity—around nonmilitary targets to further reduce the risk of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in the context of these negotiations, has opposed these prohibitions, calling instead for “appropriate” human control which could occur prior to an algorithmic target selection or firing decision and would be based instead upon thorough human vetting of an algorithm prior to its deployment and use. Such use of AWS would need to be, like all use of military force, consistent with the existing requirements under the law of war—distinction, proportionality, and humanity. These laws would require accurate and robust algorithms to power AWS. The United States military is required to operate under the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists have tended to argue, when they have engaged with the humanitarian perspective, that both targeting and firing algorithms could be constructed and used in a well-considered manner that reflected the highest standards of military effectiveness and observance of the law of war. Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter described himself as “optimistic this can be solved, like every other hard problem, with diligent technology-informed effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realist might argue that such careful work could yield human control that was well-considered, indeed even meaningful in the common usage of the term. Much more meaningful, perhaps, than having an exclusive focus on having a human in the loop in a time-pressured, highly stressful situation, vulnerable to automation bias. Careful, meaningful human control, then, is needed, and one could argue is most likely to be better rendered in quiet analysis and considered decisionmaking well before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of analytical tools called for in this report would be needed regardless of a final decision about autonomous target selection and firing. A human in the loop would have no easy time of it. While such individuals would doubtless do their best, they would confront the confusion and stress of warfare, combined with automation bias that tends to lead to the acceptance of the finding from an automated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of perspectives in the humanitarian community. This discussion will examine more closely the position of the ICRC, which calls for two types of AWS to be entirely prohibited: those that are too unpredictable, and those that target human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ICRC urges the adoption of four legal regulations on the use of any remaining AWS. The most significant of these is the requirement for effective human supervision of target selection and firing decisions. The other three regulations seek to build more space around targets to assure that there is a high threshold around them in terms of distance, decision time, and clarity, even with the requirement for effective human supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these regulations, even autonomous weapons with effective human control could not be used in areas where there are civilians—there could only be military personnel or equipment. No blended areas would be allowed. The regulations also would require designating a specific area and delimited time period where the supervised AWS could be used. Outside of that space, even the supervised weapon system could not go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These additional regulations would build protective space around civilian personnel and assets. From the realist point of view, this additional space would not be needed because of the accuracy of the algorithms and would cost too much in terms of military effectiveness. The assumption about military effectiveness, though, requires that the type of analytical tools called for in this report have been developed, deployed, and used to assure compliance with the existing laws of war. Absent the development and use of such tools, it is not clear how either claims of military effectiveness or compliance with the law of armed conflict could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ban-unpredictable-automated-weapons-systems&quot;&gt;Ban “Unpredictable Automated Weapons Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC recommends that there be a ban on “unpredictable automated weapons systems.” As with so many proposed legal prohibitions, the critical issue would be what precisely the words mean, in this case what constitutes an unpredictable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpredictable could refer to what has been the principal concern expressed in this paper: that military commanders and senior officials need to have a sufficient understanding of the accuracy and robustness of AI-enabled military capabilities before they authorize their use in war. This understanding is essential to inform a judgment about proportionality and distinction as required under the laws of war, as well as the military utility of a planned operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC recommendations explain that unpredictable AWS “that are designed or used in a manner such that their effects cannot be sufficiently understood, predicted or explained” should be prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement that the effects be predictable seems reasonable, and indeed it is necessary to meet the already existing requirements of distinction and proportionality. However, this language could be interpreted as requiring that the functioning of the algorithm should be “explainable”—a trait that neural networks is acknowledged to lack at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;neural-networks&quot;&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most artificial intelligence benefits from the base algorithm being supplemented by something called a neural network, which gives it additional precision as demonstrated in analyses that use a test database. Neural networks generally are described as being a “black box” or having an “explainability” problem, and thus some analysts argue they meet the criteria to not be “sufficiently understood or explained.” This provision then could be interpreted to proscribe the use of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their greater degree of accuracy is achieved by identifying the distinguishing characteristics of the inputs and assessing the relative influence of each of these characteristics on the output. In other words, the algorithm identifies the characteristics of a cat that are most useful to distinguishing it from a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more formal language of AI, the distinguishing characteristics are called “layers,” and their relative influence is called “weights.” The human programmer can specify the number of layers that should be used and is able to discern the weight assigned to each layer after the algorithm has been optimized by the computer. The human programmer generally cannot, though, figure out which distinguishing characteristic of the inputs each layer signifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm selects the layers after closely examining the inputs and identifying their important characteristics. The algorithm then tunes or adjusts the relative weighting of the layers until their relative weighting optimizes the accuracy of the algorithm. This unpacking of the characteristics of the inputs and then their relative weighting provides the additional precision available from neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly skilled technical experts with significant computing power can unpack the substantive characteristics of some of the layers using post-hoc analysis. In other words, after the algorithm has optimized the weighting and completed its work, these high-end technical experts can go back and through a highly structured trial and error process generally sort out the substantive characteristic represented by the particularly high-impact layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always problematic when new provisions of international law are adopted which seem to mean different things to different people. Mandating an understanding of effects is reasonable but already required; being able to explain how neural networks work is currently impossible although they can be demonstrated to add precision. Based on the information available, neural networks appear to provide many benefits in terms of accuracy and few unique risks. Prohibiting them does not seem warranted on the available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This additional prohibition could leave military capabilities developed in good faith to be prohibited from use because of a different or contested interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ban-targeting-of-humans&quot;&gt;Ban Targeting of Humans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC also recommends a prohibition on algorithms that target humans. This is for two reasons: first, the ethical concerns that “center on the interrelated loss of human agency, moral responsibility and human dignity in life and-death decisions,” and second, the difficulty of distinguishing between active military combatants, inactive military combatants, and noncombatants. Military combatants are considered inactive if they have been wounded, surrendered, or are sick. Inactive military combatants are considered out of combat and thus not a legitimate military target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposed prohibition may be redundant, as it is difficult to come up with ideas for algorithms that targeted active human combatants that would be accurate and robust without the use of extensive context clues like the individual standing behind an artillery piece and pulling the trigger. Most other ways of identifying this population would be too easy to alter, such as the military combatants changing out of uniforms and into civilian clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the U.S. military already has the responsibility to have significant capabilities for distinction under the current law of armed conflict. There should be a high threshold for the use of any algorithm that targets a human being and extremely thorough vetting before the use of any such algorithm was authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulations&quot;&gt;Regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prohibitions called for above, the ICRC recommends four regulations to limit the use of any remaining autonomous weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISTINCTION BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN TARGETS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first proposed regulation states that algorithms could only be used to target (with effective human supervision) “objects that are military objectives by nature,” while the third regulation would impose “limits on situations of use, such as constraining them to situations where civilians or civilian objects are not present.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regulations would significantly supplement and reinforce the requirement under the law of war for distinction. They supplement the requirement for effective human control and not targeting a human. The language about constraining AWS to situations where neither civilians nor civilian objects are present would greatly expand the safety zone around items and personnel, appearing to rule out the use of AWS in areas where there are both civilian and military targets blended together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DURATION, SCOPE AND SCALE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second regulation would require “limits on the duration, geographical scope and scale of use, including to enable human judgement and control in relation to a specific attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be a useful best practice for this to be a technique by which some AI-enabled military capabilities operate. This approach has significant promise to avoid some of the risks of reinforcement learning algorithms, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, however, the United States should not agree with this regulation as a legal prohibition, because there exists a small number of use cases that would not be compatible with it but still legal under the law of war and broadly useful to both the military and civilian population in an area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be a drone that followed a container with biological weapons. Maintaining positive surveillance of the container could be mission critical and would be complicated by the recommended strict limits on duration and geographical scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS could be programmed to follow the container until it could identify a suitable method and location to destroy the container without lofting. Destruction should not occur where there would be effects from the lofting of the weapons into the environment and the surrounding populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFFECTIVE HUMAN SUPERVISION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth regulation would require “human–machine interaction, notably to ensure effective human supervision, and timely intervention and deactivation.” This raises one of the most persistent issues—whether a human needs to be in the loop of algorithm-directed targeting and firing decisions. Recall that under the ICRC prohibition, this would apply only to algorithms targeting equipment or buildings, as the targeting of humans has already been prohibited under another aspect of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not algorithms could responsibly target and make a firing decision remains to be demonstrated through the type of analysis called for in this report. Certainly, the responsibilities under the current law of war should be taken seriously. Humanitarians certainly have some evidence on their side that this has not invariably been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that appropriate tools to assess and predict the effects of a military strike need to be developed. Once developed, these tools could assist human commanders to carefully assess targeting and firing decisions much earlier, when there is still time to do careful analysis of the algorithms. This assessment could enable the responsible human preauthorization of targeting and firing by algorithms, under carefully proscribed rules. The midst of warfare very rarely provides time for the careful deliberation properly desired amidst so much violence, whatever the hopes that it could be “meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists are correct to argue that AI-enabled military capabilities—assuming they are accurate and responsible—could make the difference between victory and defeat in the wars the United States most needs to deter or, if necessary, fight effectively. Battlefields including in Afghanistan and Ukraine provide tantalizing evidence that these can be transformed into war-winning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the cautions brought to bear by liberals and humanitarians about escalation risks and basic humanity also are powerful. There should certainly be a presumption against the targeting of humans. If such targeting algorithms are ever adopted, they should have a particularly thorough vetting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core message of this report is that vastly better tools must be developed to assess the accuracy and robustness of AI-enabled military capabilities. Significant confidence in these systems would need to be built before autonomous firing of any targets, much less of human beings, could be authorized. Once they could be responsibly authorized, however, it is difficult to deny that their speed and precision could confer significant warfighting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this technological and strategic moment, AI-enabled military capabilities could help to deter war and, if necessary, fight it effectively. On this point, the realists seem to be right. But they forget too often that they are right only if the effects of these capabilities could be accurately predicted. Without such tools, neither wartime effectiveness nor observance of the law of war could be assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-ii&quot;&gt;Appendix II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Crucible for Reform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-enabled military capabilities of various sorts seem a promising technique to strengthen U.S. military forces in the near- and mid-term. Such capabilities also need to be defended against: AI-enabled military forces could be used by an adversary to further erode the force balance and weaken deterrence in key regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD is not moving quickly enough to incorporate these emerging technologies or to embed them in operational concepts. Making thoroughgoing reforms to the DOD’s processes will be complicated and time consuming. This report urges the secretary to instead launch a focused effort to incorporate AI-enabled military capabilities more swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretary of defense should direct select combatant commanders to develop new operational concepts using AI, empowering them through the grant of special authorities for AI, related communications, and small platforms, particularly drones. The select combatant commanders should include at least the combatant commanders of the Special Operations Command, the Indo- Pacific Command, and the European Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These authorities would allow the commanders to navigate around some of the most serious problems within the DOD’s current processes and structures. They would align responsibility for planning for wartime missions with budget authority, acquisition authority, civilian and military personnel assignment and hiring, and freedom from many regulations on encryption and classification, among other topics. This context should create a promising environment for identifying operational concepts for the use of AI-enabled military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also specifies that developing analytical techniques to understand and predict the effect of using algorithms in war and to instrument wargames would be among the responsibilities of the select combatant commanders, as well as of a reorganized organization in the OSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grant of authorities to the combatant commanders should be reviewed by the secretary of defense after two to four years. The secretary could decide to keep these authorities with the combatant commanders or reallocate them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this review point, there should the selection of an appropriate set of DOD-wide analytical tools and their consistent use thereafter should be overseen by the new OSD office. Directing multiple organizations to develop the same tools during the experimentation period may yield some duplication. However, developing the tools will be difficult analytically and the alternative approaches should help assure that many different perspectives inform the final metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the authorities proposed would empower the select commanders to develop new operational concepts and AI capabilities through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;giving them funding and decision authority for the development and acquisition of AI, related communications, and small platforms, including drones;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;giving them authority and empty billets to build military and civilian teams with needed expertise through by-name requests and special hiring authorities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;empowering them to waive regulations (e.g., classification, encryption);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allowing them to identify the tactical problems for analysis;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;directing them to develop defenses against attacks on algorithms; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;directing them to develop analytical tools and wargame instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-structured competitive process as recommended here could align the disputatious nature of the Pentagon with the objective of the United States for its military forces: developing the best-possible military capabilities in this era of profound strategic and technological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis alone, of course, would not enable a good idea to triumph in the bureaucratic battles within the Pentagon. New war-winning operational concepts rarely emerge by acclimation in large bureaucratic militaries; there are too many established skills, capabilities, and weapons systems that new concepts would render unnecessary. For important findings to be persuasive, they often need to emerge from well-run, well-instrumented war games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a properly structured competition undergirding the wargames can create incentives to unearth good ideas and give them visibility. Visibility through the wargames may buy good ideas enough time to demonstrate their promise to observers, at least some of whom may help the ideas survive to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vesting senior military officers with the principal responsibility to devise innovative operational concepts does not ignore the historical reality that senior military officers do not in fact invariably come up with war-winning innovations—sometimes they come from senior civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both history and common-sense caution that whatever the source of the good idea, it will need to be embedded in military tactics and units and so will ultimately have to be accepted by at least some senior warfighters. The wargames recommended here should provide the opportunity for a good idea—whatever its parentage—to be seen and evaluated. This would provide enough of an opening for an effective civilian leadership team to build support among at least some military allies to secure the adoption of their best ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;empower-senior-warfighters&quot;&gt;Empower Senior Warfighters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting select combatant commanders in charge makes sense. The combatant commanders are the best proxy in the DOD for a senior official in charge of planning for and prosecuting a specific war. Combatant commanders are four-star generals or admirals assigned to one of eleven broad sets of responsibilities, such as protecting and advancing U.S. defense interests in Europe or the Pacific region. They tend to focus on specific, concrete military challenges and integrate the contributions of each of the military services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the separate military services—the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force—each bring a valuable long-term perspective that focuses on the general challenges presented by their domain (land, sea, air, or space). Each has a proud tradition and particular expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military services and their associated departments have the responsibility to train and equip the force. In practice, this means that the services hire young people and manage their careers as they grow into more senior officers and enlisted personnel. These careers generally are shaped around training and assignments in domain specific equipment, challenges, and units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The services also research, develop, and acquire most weapons systems. The OSD or the Joint Staff have a variety of ways to influence service decisions—some direct, some indirect, and some negligible. The vast amount of people and dollars in the DOD are controlled directly by the services, whose decisions are shaped in part by the preferences expressed by the secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretary of defense has vast formal authority but confronts extraordinary constraints from the sheer complexity of the enterprise. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates observed, “The very size and structure of the department assured ponderousness, if not paralysis, because so many different organizations had to be involved in even the smallest decisions. The idea of speed and agility to support current combat operations was totally foreign to the building.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders’ focus on specific military problems is ideal for the task of developing algorithms because AI will do best if they focus—at least at the outset—on specific use cases in a particular geographic context. The combatant commanders might, for example, be thinking in a detailed manner about how to contribute appropriately to stopping or slowing a Chinese attempt to secure military control of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As specific algorithms are validated in these more limited contexts, both the algorithms and the methods to measure their accuracy could be expanded to assess more general applications. This work could yield general insights about the sensitivity or durability of algorithms for related but different uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also make sense because they generally are experienced strategic and military leaders, comfortable specifying objectives and holding large organizations to account for meeting those objectives on a specified timeline. Most are comfortable making difficult decisions to replace ideas or subordinates who consistently fail to deliver. They want to win, particularly in high-visibility competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigning the task of developing AI-enabled operational concepts to select combatant commanders also avoids the turmoil of creating, staffing, and provisioning a new organization for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also make sense because the chain of command for military operations runs to them through the secretary of defense from the president. This would make the combatant commanders responsible for any future decisions recommending or ordering the use of sensitive AI-enabled military capabilities. Aligning responsibility for the use of AI capabilities with the development and assessment of those capabilities seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has recommended that the use of sensitive AI algorithms should require authorization in the rules of engagement for a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering whether to keep the funding and acquisition authority at the combatant commanders, the secretary will want to consider the longer history of Special Operations Command (SOCOM). SOCOM uniquely among the combatant commanders has its own budget and acquisition authority, in its case for “[Special Operation Forces] peculiar” equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOCOM has been pointed to as being more amenable to incorporating artificial intelligence because of their more streamlined acquisition process and innovative ethos. AI, though, should not be restricted to SOF; it would be important to include at least the commands in the Pacific and Europe in this effort. The swift acquisition track record and ethos of SOCOM is widely acknowledged but it has also sometimes raised classic concerns about the proper balance between innovation and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-high-tech-startups&quot;&gt;The DOD and High-Tech Startups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A persistent problem for the DOD is that it is not an attractive customer for the tech startups that have the greatest expertise in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. The DOD’s processes are too bureaucratic and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new authorities would be given to combatant commanders under this proposal. These would include moving money and decision authority for the development and acquisition of AI, related communications, and small platforms to the select combatant commanders. The commanders could contract with many sources including the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), the services, commercial startups, or more traditional DOD contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel authorities would enable the combatant commanders to hire respected DOD acquisition experts with a demonstrated track record of responsibly using faster acquisition tools like Other Transaction Authorities. These tools enable the DOD to execute contracts on a time frame appropriate to the commercial technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of the hiring authorities would contribute across the board. Innovators in any field are difficult to find, and once found, are difficult to protect and allow to flourish. The authority to make by-name requests for military personnel should facilitate building the needed teams. As the term “by-name request” suggests, the combatant commander could request a specific military officer; generally, the position has to be posted in more generic terms (a 0–6 with the following military operational specialty…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also should be able to attract top technical and engineering experts. There should be funding and authorities to hire a variety of external civilians to enable excellent technical advisors to come on board to advise the commanders and their teams, in addition to the civilians working as part of an external team of contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing the development of these AI and AI-related capabilities in the combatant commands should help avoid persistent problems like the limited interoperability among the service systems. The combatant commands are joint—meaning that they integrate the contributions of the services—and thus emphasize the type of interoperability that will be needed for the integrated networks generally envisioned for AI systems such as an integrated sensor and firing network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-creative-destruction&quot;&gt;The DOD and Creative Destruction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a single prescription for creativity in war. Military innovation, particularly in peacetime, benefits from an idea about the nature of the future of war, an understanding of specific military problems, and an iconoclastic readiness to cause a little creative destruction. It often includes a good understanding of new technologies, and is informed by rigorous analysis, including tough lessons-learned reports and well-instrumented wargames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for wargames and the development of metrics, both quantitative and qualitative, seeks to ensure the wide availability of quality analysis often correlated with successful peacetime innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel authorities should enable the combatant commanders to put together an ideal team: By-name requests for military officers and access to civilian hiring authorities would enable them to find military officers with a demonstrated interest and ability in innovation and technical experts interested in working with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive element between the different combatant commands and the commands and OSD seeks to overcome the inertia of any bureaucracy in favor of the existing approaches. The prospect of at least two years and not more than four years creates time pressure to demonstrate progress to make the case for keeping the authorities at the combatant command level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authority to waive regulations should enable investigation of interesting trade space, of at least two types. The first is how, within a fixed cost, to best trade between large numbers of platforms with low capabilities and small numbers of platforms each with high capabilities. The DOD has started some efforts to explore these issues. Giving the combatant commanders the ability to waive many regulations on encryption or robustness of communication allows real experimentation with low-cost options—requirements for high-end encryption or robust communication drive up the per unit cost, while obviously providing often valuable capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second interesting trade space is how to classify algorithms trained on large databases containing only a small amount of classified data. The benefit of unclassified algorithms would be the elimination of expensive infrastructure surrounding all classified items and the limited availability of the resulting algorithm for some uses, allies, and friends. The risk is that the algorithm could be reverse engineered and so an adversary could acquire the classified information and learn about sensitive sources or methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating this trade space is important because the default decision could be to classify any algorithm at the level of the most sensitive piece of information in its training database. The benefits and risks of different classification norms should be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders are directed to conduct their work to the maximum extent possible in safe “sand boxes,” or controlled environments within which AI and related capabilities can be tested without having immediate real-world consequences. There is an acceptance of some risk when investigating new, promising operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-oversight&quot;&gt;The DOD and Oversight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurring innovation while preserving appropriate oversight is difficult. This report has made a distinction between sensitive uses of algorithms and other uses. It proposes that sensitive uses of algorithms require explicit approval by the secretary of defense in the rules of engagement for an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules of engagement are the rules governing the use of force by U.S. military members. The secretary of defense approves standard rules of engagement and operation-specific rules of engagement for high-profile or risky operations. Subordinate commanders also may issue supplementary rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a category of sensitive algorithms that require approval at the secretary’s level would be a valuable method for assuring that these algorithms get the oversight appropriate to their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive uses would include time-sensitive targeting or firing algorithms, regardless of whether there was a human in the loop. Algorithms embedded in processes that are not time sensitive and include multiple levels of review, including by human experts, would not be considered sensitive. Other algorithms should be evaluated for whether they should properly be considered sensitive and thus receive this high-level of scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiring approval in the rules of engagement for the use of sensitive algorithms would assure oversight. The department’s top officials would review materials going to the secretary of defense for decision from many perspectives, including professional military judgment, strengths and weaknesses of AI, and law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These officials would bring their expertise and that of their staff to consider important questions, including: How well do these algorithms work in general? How well are they likely to work in this specific operation? What could go wrong with the algorithms? Could their use violate the law of war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, the process and lessons learned could identify systematic problems that should be more closely examined in the context of the DOD’s regular budget review or other processes. Because of the size and complexity of the DOD budget, the budget review process can identify only a small number of issues for closer review and scrutiny by the most senior officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DoD’s review processes generally are highly structured and organize decisions for review and ultimately approval by the secretary of defense. The most prominent of these processes is called the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process, which formally reviews selected topics from the various parts of the DoD budget as they move up the chain of command for approval before appearing in the government’s budget request to the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also are processes for major acquisition programs and for the validation of future military needs or requirements. These processes generally are characterized by meetings of increasingly senior groups of officials in the DOD, typically including representatives from the military services or departments, the combatant commanders, the Joint Staff, and the OSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has called for a reorganized OSD office to confront the unique complexities of using AI in war. It should include experts in two difficult technical areas: (1) artificial intelligence and its management, and (2) warfare and its conduct and analysis. Experts should be drawn from several existing offices and positions in the Pentagon, including the CDAO, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for plans and posture, the director of cost assessment and program evaluation; and the director of test and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating the technologists from the warfighters, as current efforts largely do, would maintain distance despite the desperate need for greater communication across these substantive domains. Communication and some shared understanding between experts in these two domains will be essential to highlight where AI could be vulnerable to errors in wartime contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the report recommends ensuring that leading academic thinkers on artificial intelligence—ideally as a part of the JASON group of technical advisors—review how the DOD intends to use these technologies. The JASON group is a small, self-selected group of Nobel Prize winners and other leading technologists in the United States who advise the national security community on some of its most vexing strategic and technological issues. This expertise is essential given the rapid pace of AI technologies and the unique risks of using AI for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal would create the context most likely to produce new operational concepts to effectively employ AI in war and to defend against its use by an adversary. It moves the money and authority to senior warfighters with responsibility for planning and fighting the nation’s wars for at least an initial period of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should facilitate tapping into the companies at the forefront of global, commercial cutting-edge technologies and assembling teams of creative, iconoclastic military officers and civilian experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is hard. Creative destruction in any large bureaucracy is difficult, and it is particularly difficult for a military service that can only select its leaders from individuals who have had successful careers in the organization that needs fundamental reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence seems a beguiling solution to complexity. Realist have expressed confidence that its risks can be responsibly managed. Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter declared that “good engineering design can accommodate both high performance and good ethics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let the realists get their “diligent technology-informed effort” underway. Require careful assessment of their claims of accuracy and robustness and oversee closely the use of the most sensitive algorithms in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence may prove, like war, to be less understandable and compliant than had been expected. But this too is surely better understood sooner rather than later. Education of various sorts lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

This report analyzes 37 port projects and provides a new method for assessing their relative risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly expanding its influence over maritime ports across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). By building, financing, and buying up key ports, Chinese firms have become deeply embedded in the physical infrastructure connecting the region’s dynamic maritime economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these investments bring commercial opportunity, they also open the door for Beijing to gain strategic leverage, collect sensitive data, and expand its geopolitical influence closer to U.S. shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HYVq7la.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern over China’s growing role in the region has centered on several ports located along the strategic Panama Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears that China could control the vital chokepoint have even triggered President Donald Trump to talk of “reclaiming the Panama Canal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fxUydt4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s presence in LAC ports extends far beyond the Panama Canal. Yet, the true scope of China’s reach—and the resulting risk to the United States—is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a new database, CSIS identified 37 port projects tied to Chinese companies in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BxFL3ic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database offers a novel methodology to assess the relative risk that each project poses to the security of the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reveals that China’s interest in LAC ports is more widespread, and the risk more varied, than previously known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redefining-risk&quot;&gt;Redefining Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the alarm around China’s growing influence over global port infrastructure has focused on the Chinese navy’s push to establish overseas naval bases. In places like Djibouti and Cambodia, China first poured billions of dollars into civilian infrastructure projects before establishing military facilities—a playbook it could seek to emulate elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the risk is far more nuanced with LAC ports. In the near term, Beijing is unlikely to overtly establish naval facilities so close to the continental United States, given the risk of blowback from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, gaining influence over strategic ports could provide China with critical advantages short of a formal military presence. Control or deep involvement in port operations can enable intelligence collection on U.S. and allied naval movements, privileged access to maritime logistics data, and the ability to deny or delay access during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent conflicts have shown how dual-use civilian infrastructure can be repurposed for covert military operations in concerning ways. The Ukrainian military’s Operation Spider’s Web involved drones launched from shipping containers to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Israel has reportedly used similar tactics, smuggling explosive drones into Iran via commercial freight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/y2QVkP8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Containerized weapon systems, like those used in Operation Spider’s Web, could be positioned within foreign-controlled port infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign-controlled port infrastructure could serve as a platform to enable similar attacks. China has already developed a shipping container–based cruise missile launch system that could enable it to conceal strike capabilities within ordinary commercial cargo. Influence at ports could help ensure systems like these arrive where they need to be and evade inspection until they are ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military risk, control over ports also gives Chinese firms leverage over key nodes in regional supply chains, enhancing Beijing’s economic and diplomatic sway across LAC. Over time, ports can help to rewire trade relationships and solidify economic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;China-Host Ties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relative Weight: 20%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of the host country favoring or aligning with China. This is a composite indicator based on the average of five equally weighted sub-indicators: net favorability score, trade with China as % of the total trade, the number of high-level PLA official visits, arms sales, and Freedom House score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk, in this context, is best understood not as the likelihood of the establishment of a formal Chinese military base, but as the strategic vulnerability created when critical maritime infrastructure is both important to U.S. operations and subject to Chinese influence. Specifically, risk is defined as a combination of two factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extent to which the United States relies on a particular port in the LAC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The degree to which China can accrue an advantage by influencing the operation of the port, particularly during a time of crisis on the verge of armed conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this framework, CSIS assessed China’s involvement in LAC ports across 37 distinct projects. These projects vary significantly in nature—ranging from cofinanced infrastructure loans to full ownership and operational control by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each port was scored based on 11 indicators that measure both U.S. reliance and China’s potential influence. These indicators include factors such as the host country’s diplomatic alignment, proximity to major maritime chokepoints, and whether the port is physically capable of hosting military vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicators were also weighted by their relative importance to overall risk. Because China’s ability to exploit a port hinges most on the nature and depth of its involvement, the China influence score was weighted more heavily than U.S. exposure in the final risk calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-port-projects-in-lac&quot;&gt;Chinese Port Projects in LAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the risk evaluation in this study does not attempt to predict China’s intentions. Beijing may never seek to use its influence over port infrastructure for any malign purposes. Rather, this analysis measures the potential capability China could gain through its role in port infrastructure, whether to disrupt U.S. trade, monitor naval activity, or enable coercive or covert operations in a future crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many ports pose little threat, several stand out as high risk due to their strategic location and the extent of Chinese influence. Chief among these are the Port of Kingston in Jamaica and the Mexican ports of Manzanillo and Veracruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 70.7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port of Kingston, Jamaica, received a score of 70.7 out of 100, making it the riskiest port in the database. The ninth-largest port in LAC by throughput, Kingston sits at the crossroads of vital Caribbean shipping routes, including U.S. commerce passing through the Panama Canal and the Mona Passage, the strait between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. It is also the highest-ranking port operated by a Chinese SOE, granting Beijing a higher degree of control over its operations compared to privately managed facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks associated with this port go beyond economic disruption. Jamaica plays a strategic role in the western Caribbean and is a long-standing regional security partner for the United States. China’s leverage over the largest port in a country so vital to U.S. interests in the Caribbean represents a major vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 170 miles away, the presence of U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in southern Cuba means that any large-scale military activity in the Caribbean would likely involve ship movements in and around Jamaica and potentially the Port of Kingston. China’s ability to combine intelligence from this port with potential access to signals intelligence facilities in Cuba could generate valuable insights into U.S. naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Port of Kingston is just one facet of China’s broader influence in Jamaica. China has been heavily involved in infrastructure projects across the island. In 2017, the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) was awarded a $458 million contract—financed by the China Development Bank—to build the country a new highway system in exchange for exclusive rights to collect toll revenue for the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manzanillo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 70.0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive port of Manzanillo on Mexico’s Pacific coast ranked second-highest in the risk index, at 70.0 out of 100. Manzanillo scores especially high in terms of U.S. exposure due to its outsized role as a hub for cargo heading to and from the United States. The spillover effects for U.S. trade from a disruption at this port could cost the U.S. economy more than $130 million a day, the most significant impact of any port in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port also serves double duty as headquarters for Mexico’s Pacific Naval Force, meaning China’s influence could also enable it to collect intelligence on Mexican military operations, including joint exercises with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China exercises influence over the port through multiple channels. First, the TIMSA port terminal is one of seven facilities operated by the Hong Kong–based holdings company CK Hutchison in LAC (including four in Mexico). Second, the People’s Bank of China, together with the Inter-American Development Bank, cofinanced a major expansion of the port in 2015. As part of the project, CHEC built a new container and logistics facility, and Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC) supplied and installed several new cranes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Manzanillo sits at the heart of U.S.-Mexico tensions concerning China’s growing influence in the country. The China-Mexico sea route is one of the fastest-growing shipping lanes in the world. Intending to capitalize on this, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has announced a new $2.7 billion investment in Manzanillo, seeking to double the size of the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of note, Manzanillo’s location in Colima state—a territory hotly contested between the Jalisco Cartel New Generation and local rivals—makes it an appealing target for organized crime. In December 2024, 25 tons of fentanyl precursors were seized at the port, the majority of them arriving from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veracruz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 64.7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an overall score of 64.7 out of 100, the Mexican port of Veracruz scored the third-highest in the dataset. Like Manzanillo, it hosts a Hutchison-operated terminal, and both CHEC and the U.S.-blacklisted China Communications Construction Company have helped expand the port in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Manzanillo, however, the port’s location on Mexico’s Caribbean coast orients it more toward trade with the United States than Asia. While the port is much smaller in terms of overall volume of trade, disruption at Veracruz could still cost the U.S. economy $63 million a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Gravely docked at Veracruz following over a month patrolling the Gulf of Mexico, underscoring the port’s value to the U.S. Navy as a regional resupply hub. As U.S. naval activity in the region ramps up with the White House’s increasing attention on southwest border security missions, China may benefit from new intelligence-gathering opportunities when these ships come to port for resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-build-or-to-buy&quot;&gt;To Build or To Buy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread perceptions that China has full operational control over its port investments in LAC, the reality is far more complex. Just 10 of the 37 Chinese-linked port projects identified in this study involve active facilities owned or operated by Chinese firms. The rest reflect a mix of financing, construction, or equipment supply—each with different risk implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction projects, for example, appear aligned with China’s broader economic strategy in LAC, which revolves around securing preferential access to key commodities. To this end, Chinese firms have invested in expanding Peruvian ports near key mines, Brazilian bulk grain terminals, and Venezuelan oil export sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects generally pose less direct risk than those operated by Chinese companies, but they still create long-term dependencies and relationships with host-country elites, port authorities, and customs agencies. They also create an opportunity to introduce Chinese technology at a port that could provide an intelligence back door even without a daily Chinese presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bez7eAu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KE8QP82.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment from Nuctech and ZPMC, for instance, has been installed in at least five ports in the database not under Chinese operational control. Similarly, in Panama’s Colón Container Terminal, Chinese state-linked telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE—both blacklisted in the United States for their ties with China’s military—provided 300 security cameras. While the contract between Panama and Shandong’s Landbridge group was ultimately cancelled, these cameras remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 currently active ports operated by a Chinese company, seven are managed by a single company, CK Hutchison. These include major terminals at Manzanillo, Veracruz, Balboa, and Cristóbal. Historically viewed as commercially driven and somewhat insulated from the Chinese state, Hutchison’s posture has shifted under new geopolitical pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hutchison-blackrock-deal-may-reduce-risk-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The Hutchison-BlackRock Deal May Reduce Risk for the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xmEoftG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, which compels even private firms to cooperate with state intelligence efforts, have eroded assumptions about Hutchison’s independence. In several ports, Hutchison has also contracted with state-owned Chinese construction giants such as CHEC, suggesting Hutchison’s presence may pave the way for Beijing to deepen its foothold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, Hutchison announced plans to sell 43 of its overseas ports—including all seven LAC terminals—to a consortium led by U.S.-based BlackRock for $23 billion. In response, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation launched an antitrust review that could block or delay the deal. The agreement remains on uncertain footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If completed, the sale could meaningfully reduce Beijing’s foothold in the region’s port infrastructure. However, there are signs that China may be using the spotlight on the Panama Canal ports to expand its broader footprint in the region. Recent reports indicate that the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company is seeking to acquire a stake in the 43 ports currently up for sale, including key terminals in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vcXeJOc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s influence in LAC maritime infrastructure is more widespread than previously reported, the United States, alongside regional partners, can take substantive steps to minimize risk at these ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support port buybacks and buyouts.&lt;/strong&gt; Recent developments suggest there is space for market-driven efforts to dilute China’s port footprint. Policymakers should explore ways to quietly support such efforts—particularly where they align with commercial interest and strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess and reduce strategic exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should continue evaluating where its logistical and military interests most intersect with foreign-controlled ports in the Western Hemisphere. A more comprehensive understanding of exposure can help guide both policy planning and future risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen oversight and resilience at key ports.&lt;/strong&gt; Improving inspection protocols and increasing visibility into port operations can help reduce vulnerabilities. Quiet support to partner nations’ port authorities may offer a low-cost way to guard against surveillance, deter illicit activity, and mitigate China’s efforts to gain deeper strategic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

Complex regulations and persistent cultural challenges limit the partnerships and complicate U.S. defense sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and its allies and partners face a more dangerous and uncertain world, the strategic imperative for cooperation has intensified. One of the greatest strengths of the United States has always been the nation’s connections with allies and partners. This is underpinned by robust defense industrial cooperation that strengthens partnerships, increases interoperability, and fills gaps in U.S. industrial capacity and capability. Working with allies offers an opportunity to surge production and contributes to deterrence. Yet despite the benefits, there are challenges that limit cooperation. Allies and partners can run into a wide range of regulatory hurdles and other barriers when buying from the United States and working with U.S. industry on codevelopment and coproduction. While certain military capabilities such as intelligence sharing may be achieved with a relatively narrow set of nations, defense industrial cooperation offers a way of building connections to a broader range of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report takes a fresh look at the challenges of defense industrial cooperation through a direct survey of some of the United States’ closest industrial partners—those with a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP MOU). These agreements relax provisions in the Buy American Act and allow foreign vendors to be considered domestic sources, granting the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) greater and easier access to ally and partner technologies and supply chains. The survey presented a range of questions on the reasons for and challenges to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents confirmed that building domestic capacity, deterring threats, ensuring interoperability, and building regional capacity were all important goals, with building domestic capacity being their main interest. The Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) were noted as particularly challenging processes when doing business with the United States, whether importing arms, codeveloping or coproducing defense goods, or transferring technologies. However, respondents also recognized that their home country processes added friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document markings like Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) were highlighted as challenges, with additional discussions revealing that the lack of clarity about how to dispute these markings was a source of frustration. RDP MOUs are widely acknowledged as being key facilitators for doing business with the United States, yet the exemptions they grant to participating countries are often not recognized by—or are even opposed by—U.S. program offices, U.S. congressional members, and the executive branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these findings are particularly surprising, the survey’s sampling of respondents beyond just the United States’ largest and closest industrial partners confirmed that challenges are pervasive. It also offers an initial baseline against which the impact of future changes in policy can be measured. As the United States navigates a more precarious global order in which near-peer competitors are investing in and expanding the capacity of their own industrial bases, working with allies offers an effective way to strengthen partnerships and enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation offers participating nations many benefits. As a subset of broader security cooperation efforts, defense industrial cooperation strengthens alliances and partnerships by building the relationships integral to working together on research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and production; it also enhances military interoperability by encouraging the use of common platforms. A recent Defense Innovation Board report indicated that cooperation is increasingly important due to technological shifts: “The United States is no longer the leading source of progress across critical areas of defense-related technology innovation, such as 5G, hypersonics, and electronic warfare, while our allies and partners increasingly lead in other areas, including semiconductors, directed energy, and quantum science.” Cooperation is urgently required to ensure access to advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can improve supply chain resilience through the development of additional suppliers and can also grow domestic defense industries as they participate in joint efforts that may have the potential for additional customers. In a 2023 report, Jerry McGinn and Michael T. Roche connect a “build allied” approach to the realization of National Defense Strategy objectives, linking industrial cooperation with the strengthening of industrial base capacity and resilience. Working with the United States also offers opportunities to strengthen ties and benefit from advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any cooperation between nations with different priorities, political systems, funding cycles, and laws and regulations can be challenging to successfully accomplish. The desirability of working with the United States has led many nations to highlight the challenges of doing so. Some contractors have successfully solved the puzzle of U.S. bureaucracy, but red tape continues to create high barriers to entry for domestic as well as foreign industry. A few notable barriers include ITAR, TSFD, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). These and other structural barriers are highlighted in this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ TABLE 2: U.S. Regulations and Processes for Defense Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the breadth of the subject, it is useful to start by defining frameworks for cooperation as well as regulations that create challenges. Table 1 summarizes the frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frameworks and supporting processes facilitate cooperation, but there are also a number of regulations and controls that make working together challenging. Table 2 lists the U.S. export and arms sales regulations used to manage technology transfer and safeguard U.S. technology. Table 2 also includes the processes that cover the delivery of defense products to partner nations, along with the markings that delineate limitations on allowing partners to access information relevant to cooperation. Several other processes are also described in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;value-of-improving-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Value of Improving Arms Sales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining the arms sales process is critical to advancing the goals of defense industrial cooperation. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and accelerating delivery timelines ensures that partners receive the capabilities they need at the earliest opportunity. This strengthens alliances by reinforcing the United States’ standing as a reliable and responsible security partner. Efficient arms sales processes not only facilitate the fielding of U.S. platforms, weapons systems, and technologies to partner nations, but also ensure that the United States is reaping the benefits of technologies developed by partner states. This improves interoperability and reduces friction during multinational operations, enhancing coordination and force effectiveness in complex operating environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation through arms sales also bolsters supply chain resilience by integrating additional suppliers and production lines across allied and partner nations. Supply chain diversification reduces dependency on single-source suppliers, decreases risks associated with domestic supply chain bottlenecks, and ensures continuity during crises. Overcoming barriers to cooperation and improving the structure and execution of arms sales will enhance collective security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notable-us-regulations&quot;&gt;Notable U.S. Regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Traffic and Arms Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; ITAR governs defense items and services to ensure that sophisticated military technology—such as items on the U.S. Munitions List (USML)—do not fall into the hands of U.S. adversaries or hostile actors. ITAR serves as the implementing framework for the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.SC. 2778), which is overseen by the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. ITAR is fundamental to safeguarding U.S. technologies and weapons systems, but may also create risks to U.S. and coalition military readiness. ITAR regulations have contributed to a risk-averse culture, engendering hesitancy in technology sharing even with close allies and partners. It prevents the United States from quickly proliferating advanced technologies to its friends and can impede U.S. warfighters from gaining access to advanced allied capabilities, as foreign companies sometimes desire to avoid ITAR processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; TSFD, similar in purpose to ITAR, manages the trade-offs between building allied capabilities and safeguarding national security. TSFD policies aim to balance the risks associated with sharing sensitive and highly classified U.S. technology and information with the benefits of international cooperation. Navigating TSFD processes, or “pipes,” is challenging yet necessary for engagement with friendly nations. U.S. industry is typically required to acquire TSFD approval prior to requesting export approval—a hurdle that strains program management offices and U.S. industry actors as they pursue international cooperation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Military Sales:&lt;/strong&gt; FMS is a process through which eligible foreign governments may purchase defense equipment and services from the U.S. government. FMS is a government-to-government process, whereas Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) is a commercial-to-government process. FMS is the largest U.S. security assistance program, aimed to help protect the economic health and security of allies and partners. The Department of State determines which countries are eligible for FMS, while DOD executes the programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an FMS program, the foreign government is responsible for all costs associated with the sale. Purchased items can either come from DOD stockpiles or from new procurement, wherein DOD enters a contract with a U.S. defense contractor to produce the items purchased. A single FMS case can contain hundreds of individual line items, span multiple commands and military departments, and take years or decades to fully deliver. FMS utilizes both Title 22 and Title 10 funds, each with its own set of rules. Some complex FMS programs require congressional review and approval, which can significantly delay the process. The threshold amount for a sale to require congressional oversight has not been adjusted in the last two decades, resulting in more cases undergoing congressional review than originally intended by the Arms Control Export Act (ACEA) established in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools to Overcome Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has a variety of specific agreements with allies and partners to enhance defense industrial cooperation. The National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) framework is aimed at enhancing collaboration in defense production, innovation, and supply chains with Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Security of Supply Arrangements (SOSA) are bilateral agreements allowing the United States and partner ministries of defense to request prioritized performance of contracts from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDP MOUs are designed to promote rationalization, standardization, and interoperability with ally and partner nations. They relax provisions from the Buy American Act of 1933 that direct the U.S. government to purchase supplies and finished goods domestically, requiring a waiver to buy internationally. RDP MOUs permit foreign industry to be considered domestic sources. They grant the United States and allied countries reciprocal access to their respective defense markets and streamline procurement processes to enhance effective defense cooperation and establish transparency and openness to competition. RDP MOUs generally contain similar provisions, such as increasing access to the other nation’s defense procurement system, “removing barriers to trade, providing reciprocal treatment to industrial enterprises of the other country, or waiving ‘buy national’ laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-challenges-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Assessing the Challenges of Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on defense cooperation very often focuses on a narrow set of allies involved in substantial defense trade with the United States. To get a broader perspective, CSIS drew on RDP MOU-holding nations using a survey that sought to identify the challenges and enablers countries experience when doing business with the United States. Topics included selling arms to and receiving arms from the United States, U.S. export control policies, country-specific security and defense industrial goals, processes enabling technology transfer and weapons sales, and the utility of defense cooperation agreements and programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey was completed by representatives from member states of the Defense Memoranda of Understanding Military Attachés Group (DMAG), with the support of DMAG leadership. The DMAG is a group comprised of defense officials and attachés from countries who have RDP MOUs or equivalent agreements with the United States. As of 2025, 28 countries have RDP MOUs with the United States: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Of these, 23 are members of NATO. Brazil, India, and South Korea are in ongoing RDP MOU negotiations with the United States. Given its DMAG “observer” status, South Korea was part of CSIS’s sample population. Brazil and India were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen nations provided responses to the questions, and many offered additional optional comments. While survey responses were limited to one per country, that does not mean that each response was answered by only one country representative. In many cases, entire acquisition teams contributed to ensure the response reflected their country’s broader approach rather than individual perspectives. However, variability inevitably exists due to differences in participants’ experiences, expertise, and roles. As a result, while responses may represent national viewpoints, they should not be interpreted as official country positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been calls from experts in recent years to increase available data on the realized benefits and challenges that procurement agreements bring to U.S. allies and partners. This survey seeks to help fill this gap in quantitative information by offering a dataset on U.S. bureaucratic processes that facilitate—or hinder—defense industrial cooperation. The results also offer a baseline against which future policy changes can be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allied-country-defense-industrial-priorities&quot;&gt;Allied Country Defense Industrial Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey recipients were asked to rate four key defense industrial cooperation goals on a scale of one to five—one being not important and five being extremely important. The goals listed were building domestic industry capacity, deterring the threat, ensuring interoperability, and developing regional capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four goals were rated as at least important by all respondents; no participant rated any of the goals as either not important or somewhat important. Building domestic industry capacity, deterring the threat, and ensuring interoperability were rated as extremely important by most respondents, with nearly half rating developing regional capabilities as extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation priorities are directly linked to operational requirements, meaning that countries must ensure they can produce and sustain critical defense systems to meet their strategic needs. In some cases, this necessity leads countries to indigenize sovereign defense capabilities, even if this comes at the expense of international collaboration. As a result, respondents noted that investments may pivot away from cooperative efforts and toward developing domestic industries and capacity that can independently support long-term defense readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents from countries whose neighbors pose a direct threat to national security noted defense collaboration with allies as essential to extended deterrence. A strong and integrated defense industrial base strengthens deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oobOXSR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 1: Goals for Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A country’s size, natural resources, geographic location, and topography influence defense needs. Certain weapons systems or defense services are better suited to specific terrains—a landlocked country has less need to heavily invest in naval capabilities, for instance, and smaller countries with long coastlines may invest in advanced undersea capabilities and specialty systems. This creates a strong yet niche defense industrial base in specific domains, leading to strong dependencies on larger allies like the United States for key military platforms (such as fighter jets). Despite continued investment in domestic capabilities, allies with limited resources and specific geographies view regional and U.S. cooperation as a key supplement to defense industrial areas of national strategic importance. These allies may thus view the development of regional capabilities as more important than others that have more independent defense industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislative offsets were also noted as a priority among discussions with the DMAG and other defense acquisition stakeholders. Legislative offsets refer to the benefits—economic, industrial, or technological—that purchasing countries obtain by acquiring defense systems from the United States. These conditions of purchase pertain to both government-to-government sales and commercial sales of defense articles or services. There are multiple forms of potential compensation including “mandatory co-production, licensed production, subcontractor production, technology transfer, and foreign investment.” Certain U.S. allies and partners legally mandate offsets to ensure economic and industrial benefits when purchasing defense systems from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-export-control-challenges-and-enablers&quot;&gt;U.S. Export Control Challenges and Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. export control processes have long been cited by allies and partners as complex, slow-moving, and opaque. These challenges can create uncertainty for foreign buyers, complicate defense cooperation procedures, and, in some extreme cases, incentivize partners to seek alternative suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents were asked to rate seven key U.S. export control processes on a scale of one to five—one being not challenging and five being very challenging. The seven processes listed were ITAR, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), Excess Defense Articles (EDA), Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD), and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vI1MV1S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 2: Persepectives on the Difficulty of U.S. Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 2, respondents deemed TSFD and ITAR to be among the most challenging hurdles to international procurement from the United States. No respondent rated any of these processes as not challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITAR is a complex export control system marked by bureaucratic red tape, over which U.S. allies and partners continuously express frustration. ITAR processes are often perceived as too stringent and out of step with the current era of geopolitical competition, where delays in sharing equipment will limit the capabilities of allies. DMAG respondents recognized the purpose and importance behind ITAR but simultaneously critiqued its rigidity and prolonged lead times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ITAR is such an expansive bureaucratic process, respondents noted that guidance from various U.S. authorities may be different or even conflicting. These barriers impede defense industrial cooperation and ultimately jeopardize U.S. and allied defense posture and readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ITAR does pose a significant challenge to international defense cooperation, it is part of a broader framework for partnerships. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), responsible for administering ITAR, plays a role in facilitating collaboration by reviewing, and then subsequently approving, export licenses. Through this process, the DDTC ensures that defense technologies are transferred in a controlled and responsible manner while simultaneously supporting codevelopment and coproduction efforts with international partners. ITAR helps balance national security concerns with opportunities for technological innovation and collaboration with partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some respondents offered additional nuance to their answers on TSFD and ITAR. TSFD can be relatively opaque—with a lack of clarity around which authorities do what and the pipeline of approval—but it is not always a very challenging process. The survey respondents felt that ITAR, by contrast, suffers from the opposite problem: It is a challenging process despite there being a considerable amount of information available on the steps required for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wQcio00.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 3: Knowledge of ITAR Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents noted that even though key U.S. export control and technology transfer processes are viewed as at least somewhat challenging, that does not mean that they are wrong or misguided. There is an understanding among ally and partner nations that these regulations, though complex, exist for a reason. Allied nations have their own complex export control regimes that share the same objective as U.S. protection policies: to prevent sensitive technology and information from falling into the hands of unfriendly nations. There was no call by survey respondents to eliminate U.S. processes, but rather for a more transparent, streamlined system that, with predictable lead times, could enhance cooperation and benefits for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the difficulty of ITAR procedures and the various stakeholders involved, CSIS asked the DMAG how well they understand ITAR processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most—but not all—respondents understand ITAR processes moderately well. The DMAG respondents—defense cooperation attachés and defense officials—are familiar and relatively well versed in export control procedures by nature of their profession, so it may be of strategic concern for the United States that only four respondents reported a confident understanding of its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States often is reluctant to let allies gain some of the benefits from arms cooperation. Specifically, foreign companies will set up production and development hubs in the United States both to manage output and not appear foreign to contracting officers who are partial to selecting domestic firms. As one of the survey respondents noted, “every product will be improved over time and new functions might be added. In this scenario the knowledge created in the U.S. subsidiary will not flow back to the mother company due to ITAR. This is not a problem for the company. But [it] reduces interoperability and interchangeability.” In these scenarios, ITAR restrictions prevent the knowledge, including technological upgrades or new capabilities at the U.S. subsidiary, from flowing back to the parent foreign company. While some companies prefer this practice to avoid “ITAR contamination,” it nevertheless can harm interoperability and interchangeability, as well as stifle the flow of innovation to allies’ defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6IngOSr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 4: Knowledge of FMS Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All respondents reported understanding FMS processes, in contrast to ITAR. Although FMS is not directly linked to international cooperation, as it primarily involves one nation’s government purchasing defense systems from the U.S. government, it serves an important role in helping nations achieve their domestic defense industrial goals. FMS enhances interoperability by allowing partner forces to operate using the same systems, and it can improve regional capabilities by equipping partner nations with advanced technologies that bolster their defense readiness. This serves to enhance deterrence posture, as partner nations are better equipped to defend against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FMS process can be complex and cumbersome, which is why the Defense Security Cooperation University offers foundational FMS courses that explore the essential components of military sales and transfers between the United States and partner nations. Students learn how to “plan, execute, and sustain the many complex and interrelated aspects of sales and transfers under the FMS program.”21 One survey respondent noted that certain FMS courses are no longer available for individuals in their office, meaning a growing number of foreign FMS officers lack a basic understanding of FMS processes in defense cooperation offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When foreign defense attachés lack an adequate understanding of the FMS acquisition process, this knowledge gap not only impedes their home country’s ability to acquire U.S. defense systems efficiently but also negatively impacts the United States. Delays in the acquisition process, or even reduced purchases of U.S. defense systems, result in the United States exporting fewer defense products and providing fewer services, which reduces industry sales and hampers the ability of the United States to interoperate with its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS is a complex process, and the literature on the topic indicates a variety of specific challenges. The survey included a question asking respondents to rate the challenges of a variety of FMS processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most respondents rated the lack of clarity and transparency as the most challenging aspect of the FMS system, closely followed by lengthy approval times and the multitude of U.S. stakeholders involved. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul delays are predominately viewed as moderately and extremely challenging. Most respondents rated equipment delays, regulatory compliance, and costs as moderately challenging. The costs associated with FMS were identified as the least challenging factor overall, despite the majority of respondents rating it as moderately challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yPaoJB7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 5: FMS Process Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the optional written section, respondents noted a few other challenges that were not listed. First, long periods of time are required for case closure despite service completion. FMS case closure occurs when “all material has been delivered, services have been performed, other requirements of the [Letter of Offer and Acceptance] have been satisfied, known financial transactions (including collections) have been completed, and the purchaser receives a final statement of account.” Prompt case closure minimizes the amount of administrative effort required for an unnecessary open case, which diverts resources from other priorities. Prolonged case closure, a common frustration among primary FMS customers, delays the release of excess purchaser funds. This practice may erode the long-term willingness of partner nations to engage in the U.S. arms sales process, especially if certain materiel or systems can be purchased elsewhere. Secondly, survey respondents noted that a lack of workforce capacity within the defense industry can lead to increased costs for the production and delivery of defense systems. A workforce that does not meet demand may force partner nations to face higher prices and acquisition delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges with coordination were also noted, particularly a fragmented approach to working with allies. While the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) helps deliver integrated capabilities for the alliance, coordinating procurements between NATO members remains a perennial challenge. An acquisition approach that prioritizes national industry over greater NATO strategic priorities—coupled with the fact that the United States reviews FMS requests on a case-by-case basis—limits opportunities to optimize FMS outcomes for the broader defense goals of the alliance. Exploring whether there are groups of countries for which FMS cases can be reviewed together could streamline the process for the United States and speed acquisition by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One respondent noted that borderline cases on occasion tended to linger as they were being reviewed, which the respondents felt was because of U.S. government hesitation to rapidly decline case requests, opting instead for extensive deliberations to provide alternatives. They suggested that sometimes a faster decision—even if it was negative—would be preferred because it would reduce uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zwke1i.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 6: The Challenege of NOFORN and CUI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback from participants also raised the consideration that current thresholds for congressional notifications often hinder the efficiency of the export process. When the U.S. government plans to sell defense equipment, services, or technology to a foreign country, it must submit a notification to Congress if the sale exceeds a certain value, allowing lawmakers a designated period to review the proposed sale. However, a recent FMS task force discovered congressional notification thresholds have not been updated since FY 2003 despite a DOD inflation rate of 69 percent since then. This means routine and standardized exports to friendly nations—often NATO partners—are often stuck waiting for Congressional approval, creating unnecessary delays and administrative burdens. Had thresholds been adjusted for inflation, 14 out of 123 sales, or 11 percent, in 2023 alone would not have required a waiting period. The task force recommended Congressional notification thresholds be updated to reflect inflation to avoid more sales being subject to congressional review than originally intended. Otherwise, sales that are neither sophisticated nor strategically sensitive can become backlogged, slowing down the acquisition process without significantly enhancing oversight or national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of U.S. categorization of information as Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) or controlled unclassified information (CUI) was consistently mentioned as a barrier throughout the duration of the study in both discussions and survey responses. These categorizations can create barriers to foreign partners’ access to information and can hinder procurement and coproduction processes. These restrictions can lead to delays in equipment delivery and licensing processes and may negatively impact interoperability between allied forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents noted that NOFORN and CUI limit the ability of foreign contractors to compete for opportunities. In some cases, information marked CUI or NOFORN is not made available to foreign bidders in time for them to properly develop a bid. While this may increase U.S.-made technology, it may also result in the DOD not accessing best-in-class technical solutions. Reforming protectionist policies demands not only regulatory change, but cultural change to support systematic alteration in the way the DOD approaches classification markings. While the use of NOFORN to obstruct competition is illegal, respondents felt that the classification remained overused and thus impeded cooperative defense industrial efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents also noted that Master Information Exchange Agreements (MIEAs) and subordinate Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) are extremely useful. MIEAs establish a reciprocal, balanced exchange of R&amp;amp;D between participating parties and authorize specified IEAs. IEAs enables the exchange of R&amp;amp;D data pertaining to specific technology or weapons development areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ally-and-partner-nation-export-control-challenges-and-enablers&quot;&gt;Ally and Partner Nation Export Control Challenges and Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge that regulations represent is not unique to the United States. Every nation has its own individual export control and technology transfer difficulties. Figure 7 reports that most respondents believe working with the United States is no different or harder than working with other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also the sole supplier of a number of advanced capabilities. This makes cooperation with the United States—and an understanding of its export control processes—mandatory for those who wish to acquire certain U.S.-designed and -produced weapons systems. And it means that U.S. regulations have an outsized impact on partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and partners have their own set of export control and technology transfer processes that can hinder—but also enable—information sharing and arms sales. Survey respondents had varying perceptions of their home countries’ export control processes, but they provided useful feedback on what mechanisms could help their own international procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 provides an illustration of respondents’ view of their own countries’ export control regimes. Most respondents were neutral or in agreement with the statement that their home country export control and technology transfer policies enable procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/49so1sM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 8: Assessment of Home Country Export Control Enablers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 9 shows respondents were reasonably mixed on whether their own export controls pose a significant challenge to doing business with the United States, but only three agreed that the challenge was also on their side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain further insight into respondents’ perspectives on their home countries’ export controls, CSIS also asked whether their domestic export controls generate “friction”—something less than a “significant challenge”—for their procurement and cooperation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10 shows that most respondents were likely to agree that their export control and technology transfer policies add friction to procurement and cooperation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kMOWDyN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURES 9 &amp;amp; 10: Assessment of Home Country Export Control Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS asked respondents to rate certain processes and agreements based on how beneficial they would be to facilitating defense trade with the United States, with the results reported in Figure 11. The survey asked about the Defense Production Act (DPA), the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS), reclassifying items from the USML to the Commerce Control List (CCL), and the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB). There was agreement among respondents that most of these initiatives would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Nw2ECDk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 11: What Could Make Trade Easier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Production Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being considered a domestic source under the DPA was rated among the most beneficial options by respondents. The DPA, passed in 1950, grants the president the authority to influence domestic industry and expand and expedite certain materiel required for national defense during emergency mobilizations. Domestic industry may be called upon to expand the production and supply of materiel critical to national security or emergencies. In 2020, President Trump utilized the DPA to order General Motors to produce more ventilators during the Covid-19 pandemic, and during his second term, he is using it to ramp up domestic critical minerals production to reduce foreign dependencies on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title III of the DPA, the Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, authorizes “incentives to include loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities.” Canada has been considered a domestic source since 1992, and the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act designated the United Kingdom and Australia also as domestic sources eligible for DPA funds. This means Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom enjoy U.S. government benefits when they are able to provide essential defense materials and goods under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the DPA includes Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom as domestic sources, the degree to which the U.S. government can direct a foreign firm to produce under the DPA is more nuanced than it is with a purely domestic firm. Title I of the DPA authorizes the government to prioritize federal contracts that support certain national defense and energy programs. The Department of Commerce administers this authority through the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation. DPAS applies to all entities physically in the United States, regardless of foreign or domestic ownership. However, foreign companies and foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that are not physically located in the United States fall outside DPAS jurisdiction. Thus, while foreign firms considered domestic sources are eligible to receive financial incentives from the U.S. government to surge production, the United States also needs to work through diplomatic channels to encourage a reliable supply of critical goods during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a distinction between being considered a domestic source under the DPA and having an RDP MOU with the United States. The latter ensures allied and partner industries are considered domestic sources, waiving obstacles associated with the Buy American Act and facilitating smoother access to U.S. defense contracts. Domestic sources under the DPA, by contrast, are utilized during times of national crisis, as firms are incentivized—and ordered—to produce a certain amount of goods or materiel necessary for national security or during emergencies. This serves as a mechanism to rapidly mobilize the defense industrial base to ensure the United States has access to vital resources when traditional free-market forces are not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Agreement Similar to AUKUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is a trilateral security partnership initiated in 2021 between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is designed to promote information sharing and technology transfer, as well as to better integrate and diversify security-related supply chains and industrial bases. AUKUS has two pillars, the first supporting the Royal Australian Navy’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. The second pillar is focused on cooperation in advanced technologies, including cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum, and undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement these two pillars, harmonized procurement strategies between AUKUS member nations were required. Once Australia’s and the United Kingdom’s defense information protection systems were aligned with that of the United States—a process that involved strengthening cybersecurity measures and harmonizing classification standards—information sharing and technology transfer were simplified. This was reflected in the revisions made in the EAR and ITAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amended the EAR to facilitate license-free trade with Australia and the United Kingdom in furtherance of AUKUS objectives. It removed certain “license requirements, expanded the availability of license exemptions, and reduced the scope of end-use and end-user-based license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to or within Australia and the United Kingdom.” The BIS estimates that $7.5 billion annually in trade with Australia and the United Kingdom will no longer be subject to these previous license regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) made similar changes to ITAR that enable the license-free transfer of commercial defense trade for Australia and the United Kingdom. With certain limitations, authorized users within AUKUS member states require no license or other approval for “export, reexport, retransfer, or temporary import of defense articles, the performance of defense services, or engaging in brokering activities.” This rule also allows for an expedited export licensing process for defense articles or services to Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One DMAG participant likened AUKUS membership to having a “fast pass” or “carpool lane” through ITAR that streamlines defense cooperation with the United States. However, for other nations seeking privileges comparable to those enjoyed by Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, reform is necessary not only within the U.S. system but also within those countries’ domestic frameworks. Certain nations expressed a desire to be a part of AUKUS’s second pillar, even with only specific technologies like hypersonic, missile, or undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Items from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITAR governs the USML, which details defense-related articles, services, and technologies designated as critical to U.S. national security. The DDTC, within the U.S. Department of State, is responsible for administering ITAR. The DDTC must approve export licenses for items on the USML to prevent U.S. adversaries from obtaining advanced technologies critical to U.S. military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCL is a list of dual-use items that have military but also commercial applications. The EAR, enforced by the BIS within the U.S. Department of Commerce, governs the CCL. Items on the CCL are typically less restricted than their counterparts on the USML and only sometimes require a license (unlike items on the USML list, which always do). CCL items requiring licenses include sensitive technologies such as semiconductors and aerospace components. Moving items from the USML to the CCL was offered as an underrated solution to the complexity of U.S. procurement procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Technology Industrial Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NTIB is an agreement between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States that establishes joint national security and dual-use R&amp;amp;D initiatives as well as production- and maintenance-related activities. While some survey respondents offered that the NTIB has the potential to be extremely beneficial, they noted that it has done little more than enable limited information exchange. The NTIB lacks funding and does not change standing policy, which limits the ability to improve defense industrial cooperation processes. It does not address the regulatory complexities baked into various export control regimes—such as ITAR, EAR, FMS, the Canadian ITAR waiver for unclassified goods control, and the Australia-UK Defense Trade Treaties—to which foreign companies are subject. Ensuring compliance with these various regulations requires “an army of lawyers and clerks, burning up a significant amount of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Benefits of Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason nations seek to engage in defense industrial cooperation with the United States is to “uplift” their domestic industries. Selling to the United States was viewed as extremely important to home country industry by all but one of CSIS’s survey respondents, as shown in Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings are unsurprising given that the United States has the largest arms market in the world, making it a critical enabler of partner nation industrial development strategy. Beyond the sheer size of the U.S. market, there are other advantages as well. Selling to the United States serves as a forcing function for nations to align their modular standards to those of the United States, making the latter more likely to be a steady customer for domestically produced defense products and services. If partner nations build using operating systems that are compatible with those of the United States, the option to export these products to the United States will always be available. This allows partner nations to deploy systems that are interoperable with U.S. ones, strengthening coalition and joint operation efforts. Additionally, the United States acts in good faith to honor agreements and reciprocally provides high-quality, dependable, and compatible defense products and services to partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors, however, make the United States a less valued customer. Survey respondents noted that they could feel compelled to purchase from elsewhere if newly developed capabilities were made available by European Union member states or other allied nations, especially if those countries’ export and technology transfer policies were easier to navigate. During the discussion roundtable, participants mentioned that a drastic shift in U.S. trade policy with punitive tariff measures could lead them to consider other sources when acquiring defense capabilities. Countries also face pressure to spend domestically, as investing in internal capabilities and capacity leads to a more independent and indigenized industrial base. These incentives may include the desire to foster local innovation, reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, decrease unemployment rates by boosting job opportunities, and develop and maintain technologies critical for safeguarding national security. Other respondents noted the importance of speed—an oft-cited shortcoming of allied procurement of U.S. systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-cooperation-agreements-and-programs&quot;&gt;Defense Cooperation Agreements and Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of defense cooperation agreements and programs that serve to enhance defense industrial cooperation and more easily facilitate arms sales and technology transfer. These include RDP MOUs, NATO membership, SOSAs, Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), Reciprocal Government Quality Assurance (QA) Agreements, Major Non-NATO Ally Status, and Defense Exportability Features (DEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FvznCYi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 13: Value of Different Kinds of Agreements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked to rate defense cooperation agreements and programs by the degree to which each benefits their home country’s ability to do business with the United States. RDP MOUs were most favored, with nine respondents rating them as extremely beneficial and the other four rating them as moderately beneficial. It should be noted that this may be a case of selection bias, since potential respondents were identified because they are part of an organization comprised of countries that hold RDP MOUs, and thus the sample that chose to respond to the survey may be more invested in such agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second to RDP MOUs, the defense cooperation aspects of NATO were positively viewed by all survey respondents. NATO has a set of programs enabling nations to work together on acquisition. Several joint acquisition programs exist, including NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance, NATO Sea Sparrow Consortium, and NATO Multinational Multi Role Tanker and Transport Fleet. In 2021, NATO established the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) to integrate and deliver new technologies to NATO forces. DIANA primarily focuses on “big data, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, quantum, biotechnologies and human enhancement, energy and propulsion, novel materials and advanced manufacturing and aerospace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) allows allies to harmonize their force and capability planning activities. The NDPP facilitates the interoperability of allied forces and ensures that they are properly equipped and supported to undertake missions without compromising the readiness of national militaries. Additionally, the NDPP is responsible for identifying requirements for NATO forces and supports capability development and acquisition. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) delivers capabilities, logistics support, and procurement frameworks to member nations and supports weapons system life-cycle management. Despite the cited benefits that accompany NATO membership, survey participants still widely cited joint procurement challenges. One respondent noted that internationally acquiring weapons independently is not so difficult, but rather “the challenge is to coordinate procurements between allies to make NATO as strong as possible in our region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOSAs, which allow the United States and participating nations to request priority supply of defense goods and services, were viewed by the survey respondents as generally beneficial. For instance, the United States can request foreign industry to prioritize delivery under DOD contracts, subcontracts, or orders. And vice versa: They ensure partner nations are prioritized when supply shortages or geopolitical tensions arise. SOSAs allow for streamlined procurement processes, and foreign vendors located in countries with an established SOSA may be viewed more favorably by U.S. program offices. However, SOSAs are voluntary or “best effort” frameworks, and their main purpose is confidence building. They are not binding international agreements that obligate signatories to invoke the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCT program allows the United States to satisfy its defense needs more quickly and cost efficiently by testing the technologies developed by allies and partners with high technology readiness levels, thus better equipping U.S. forces and satisfying U.S. defense needs. This accelerates U.S. government acquisition from foreign industry, circumventing traditional acquisition pathways that typically include domestic capability development and lengthy and costly R&amp;amp;D investments. Through FCT, the United States can test partner nation technologies, capabilities, and weapon systems prior to procuring their systems, following a “try before you buy” model. This approach allows roughly a third of foreign vendors to either directly partner with U.S. industry or, at the very least, establish a U.S. presence. As of January 2024, 1,297 technologies from partner nations were assessed, and U.S. forces acquired 307 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has QA agreements with six countries: the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and South Korea. QA agreements ensure defense products and services meet U.S. military specifications through a set of standardized procedures for testing, inspection, and certification. This reduces the risk of defective parts in critical defense systems; it also streamlines defense procurement processes, as products certified under nations who have a QA are more readily accepted by the United States and its partners who share interoperability standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEF is the practice of encouraging DOD program management to design and develop exportability features early in a program’s life cycle. This can facilitate exports by incorporating technology protection earlier in the design process to avoid expensive retrofits as well as costly and time-consuming redesigns to meet export control and partner-specific requirements. DEF facilitates business with the United States by making U.S. defense systems more export-friendly, reducing costs for foreign buyers, and improving interoperability with allies and partners. DEF also simplifies FMS processes by pre-engineering exportable versions of systems, reducing delays caused by technology transfer restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-of-rdp-mous&quot;&gt;Challenges of RDP MOUs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intent of RDP MOUs may be to facilitate defense trade, many of the survey respondents expressed that U.S. government stakeholders were less supportive of RDP MOUs’ function. Most respondents did not find the “Buy American” exemptions to be well recognized within program offices, as shown in Figure 14. Furthermore, Figure 15 shows that about half of the respondents found acquisition program offices to be leery of the Buy American exemptions they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 14 shows that the overwhelming majority of respondents agree or strongly agree that the exemption of Buy American provisions is not well recognized in some U.S. program offices. Two are neutral, while none reported disagreement or strong disagreement. Figure 15 shows that survey respondents are either neutral, agree, or strongly agree that U.S. program offices are cautious regarding exemptions granted in RDP MOUs. Once again, no one disagreed or strongly disagreed. There are a variety of potential reasons for this. There may be misconceptions among acquisition contracting officers as to what exactly RDP MOUs are. Respondents suspected that program offices find it easier to default to purchasing U.S. goods and services. As one interviewee noted, “no one gets fired for buying American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 National Defense Industrial Strategy fails to mention RDP MOUs, demonstrating a lack of awareness and understanding of the benefits RDP MOUs provide to the United States. However, there have been welcome changes made in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which is responsible for implementing RDP MOU exemptions. In recent years, DFARS has become more inclusive of RDP MOU provisions and has more systematically integrated these agreements into the broader defense acquisition framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n1JukbF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 16: How Partners Think Congress and the Executive Branch View RDP MOUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Figure 16, participants generally were neutral or in agreement that Congress and the executive branch are opposed to the exemptions granted in RDP MOUs. Congressional debates are frequently centered on protecting U.S. industry, without recognizing that these international agreements consider signatory country defense industrial bases as complementary to, rather than competitive with, U.S. defense manufacturing. This may lead legislators to undermine the cooperative defense industrial relationships that enhance mutual security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Insights and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the survey demonstrates, there is room for improvement in defense industrial cooperation and communication between the United States and RDP MOU nations. Arms sales and technology transfer play a large role in ensuring the United States and its allies are properly equipped to build competitive advantage. Easing restraints on both sides, that is, both U.S. and allied processes, will serve to bolster deterrence in the face of a growing alliance between adversarial nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a compelling business case to be made for deeper U.S. defense industrial base integration with allies and partners. Integration extends beyond traditional arms sales and technology transfers to include codevelopment and coproduction. While these collaborative ventures can be complex and often require higher up-front investment, they offer long-term financial benefits by creating economies of scale and ultimately reducing per-unit costs. Additionally, deeper defense industrial collaboration positions the United States to profit from arms sales to partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s survey found that countries with an RDP MOU with the United States are hopeful that the agreement will help uplift their own industrial bases through increased cooperation and sales. However, a lack of consistency across administrations was identified as a limit; one survey respondent noted that “As the government changes every four years, new policies such as the National Defense Industrial Strategy . . . often momentum. Therefore, a defense industry cooperation policy that can be sustainably kept is needed.” There is a persistent tension in the United States between Buy American regulations and industrial cooperation. This tension has only grown with the Trump administration’s focus on tariffs as an instrument of economic policy. Every U.S. administration should remember the benefits of cooperation—which can include increased sales, closer ties, and enhanced interoperability—in the face of pressure to onshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following set of recommendations will serve to ease arms sales and technology transfer between the United States and partner nations, help allies achieve their domestic defense industrial priorities, enhance interoperability to strengthen coalition operations, and bolster production diplomacy to counteract the defense industrial capabilities of U.S. adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine review of weapons requests from allies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Export controls should not be eliminated, but rather reengineered. President Trump’s April 9, 2025, Executive Order on Foreign Military Sales highlights the goal of the reduction of barriers to export weapons to allies, and there are a number of alternatives. For instance, every bilateral arrangement requires a separate review, even if two close allies are buying the same equipment. Throughout the Congressional Notification process, past approvals don’t seem to hold merit when reviewing FMS requests. While Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine receive preferential treatment in various aspects of U.S. defense sales, there is no further FMS distinction between a NATO ally or a country with a minimal defense relationship with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Allies working as a group to procure U.S. systems, or the United States combining reviews, could be structural solutions to speed the process. Creating a joint structure for FMS reviews is another option. While extensive deliberation between Congress and the executive branch would be required to create “bins” for allies, countries that hold an RDP MOU would be a good place to start. A smaller trial subset could be Canada and AUKUS participants. Note that addressing export control friction would not only enhance arms exports, but also enable the codevelopment and coproduction that would underpin the expansion of partner industrial bases, helping strengthen forward deterrence and opportunities for surge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Periodically review export controls and classification markings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Periodic reviews of export control and classification marking policies would be useful to ensure that they are appropriately limiting technology proliferation without causing undue delays and complications. Export controls, while critical to safeguard U.S. technologies, are not prepared to meet the challenges of the current geopolitical moment. Institutionalized, systematic reviews of export control regimes, such as ITAR, TSFD, and EAR, along with sales mechanisms, like FMS and DCS, can help ensure the United States can get weapons and technologies to its friends at speed and scale. These reviews should include a close review of technologies on the USML to see if any are eligible to be placed on the CCL, which is governed by a less restrictive process. Similarly, document markings, such as CUI and NOFORN, should be carefully managed to ensure that they do not needlessly limit cooperation, along with allied industry insight into DOD tenders. Reviews should also take care to ensure CUI and NOFORN labels are intentional and justified, rather than automatic, default practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the ally and partner knowledge gap of U.S. processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Allies and partners have an incomplete understanding of U.S. government regulations—including DMAG participants. Given these individuals play an important role in enhancing bilateral defense cooperation, this knowledge gap may lead to unnecessary delays in international arms acquisitions. Formal training offered by the United States is a low-cost solution to help facilitate arms sales, technology transfer, and defense industrial cooperation. Additionally, a coherent understanding of U.S. processes in foreign program offices does not singularly benefit U.S. allies, but engaging with a well-informed partner workforce helps speed acquisitions and lower bureaucratic inefficiencies. This means the United States can sell systems, components, and services faster, and thus provide a more stable demand signal to U.S. industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer RDP MOU training to U.S. program offices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Survey respondents were consistent in their feedback that RDP MOUs are not particularly well understood in U.S. program offices. This limits the DOD’s ability to draw on the expertise of allies. A recent Defense Innovation Board report addressed this directly, suggesting that “all DOD program managers should be trained on the RDP MOU and additional Buy American waivers and exemptions. In addition, the office that negotiates these waivers must be empowered to inform and educate the DOD contracting and acquisition workforce on the proper use of these existing authorities.” Continual education for relevant parties and government organizations as part of required acquisition certifications would address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design for exportability to facilitate defense trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Defense Exportability Features (DEF) is the practice of encouraging DOD program management to design and develop exportability features early in a program’s life cycle. A key facilitator of DEF is Modular Open Systems Approaches (MOSA). MOSA is a strategy for designing an adaptable system that employs interfaces that any authorized vendor, including a foreign vendor, can use to integrate and operate together. This standardization enables U.S. allies and partners to “plug-and-play” by incorporating technology from a variety of sources into one loosely coupled but standardized system. MOSA allows for the easy removal of modules that contain classified technology or the replacement of U.S.-specific modules with those that directly address allied needs. This eases the export control process by circumventing expensive retrofits and time-consuming redesigns to safeguard sensitive technology. Additionally, MOSA serves to enforce standards setting, which facilitates interoperability and alleviates challenges inherent to coalition operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and support institutional frameworks to enhance exports and encourage cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To enhance defense industrial cooperation, the United States should develop and expand institutional mechanisms that facilitate export exemptions and industrial collaboration. Expanding these types of arrangements benefits not only allies but also the United States given the reduced pressure on domestic manufacturing during crises and improved access to foreign-produced defense goods in peacetime and when urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom highlight that ITAR and EAR waivers remain limited in scope and difficult to obtain, they still serve as a valuable benchmark for other allies to work toward. The United States should pursue efforts to review whether allied nations qualify for ITAR exemptions and domestic source designation under the DPA. Moreover, while RDP MOUs carry certain risks for signatory nations, like potential market saturation by U.S. firms, the benefits—such as reciprocal access to each other’s defense markets—can outweigh the drawbacks. The United States should continue to engage allies and partners to increase the number of RDP MOUs and SOSAs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more precarious global order in which near-peer competitors are investing in and expanding the capacity of their own industrial bases will necessitate working with allies to effectively strengthen partnerships and increase deterrence. To enhance defense industrial cooperation, allies and partners—including the United States—should increase information sharing about their domestic defense industrial priorities. Allies and partners must take a close inventory of their own defense industrial bases and evaluate what they seek to buy off-the-shelf from the United States and/or coproduce and codevelop with the United States. Without this information, the United States will be less able to conduct long-term defense industrial planning and be less responsive to ally and partner needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited defense industrial cooperation between the United States and its allies contributes to vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to wield their influence across the global strategic landscape. The United States alone is not prepared to ramp up production to meet current demand in the near term, and some capabilities may take a decade or longer to build. Without an integrated defense industrial base, the United States and its allies will be less effective in the development, production, and sustainment of critical military capabilities—and will ultimately struggle to fight together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been an eventful few weeks for Russia. An unprecedented and innovative Ukrainian drone attack targeting airfields deep inside Russia; more negotiations with the Americans in Istanbul; the detonation of the annexed Crimea Bridge; its involvement in the Israel-Iran war, and the publication of the UK’s Strategic Defence Review (SDR), calling Russia an “immediate and pressing threat” to British national security. Although some of these are more important than others in Moscow’s eyes, they raise questions about Russia’s perceptions of security matters, and in particular how they interpret the threat from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia indeed poses one of the most significant threats to British national security, then it is worth trying to get under the skin of how the Russians see us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-reactions&quot;&gt;Immediate Reactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the SDR’s publication was met with a mixture of derision and caution in Russia. Several members of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, maintained dismissively that the UK is not capable of being part of the “geopolitical troika” – referring to the US, Russia and China, countries that are considered to have greater international and military clout – commentators were variously suggesting that Russia has been made an outsize enemy as a ruse to justify UK military spending or to detract from domestic concerns, and that without the US’s support, the UK’s military footprint is small. The State Duma (lower house of parliament) was similarly dismissive and played down the prospect of preparation for future war with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was not uniform. Other commentators in Kremlin-affiliated media went further, maintaining that the UK has expansionist designs on the Black Sea, aiming to expand its own sphere of influence – something that Russia itself does. Indeed, some dissenting voices in Russia suggested Moscow take seriously the UK’s announcement, as it takes a position that other countries such as France and Germany are increasingly adopting against Russia. Perhaps most concerningly, the headline takeaway in Moscow appears to be that the UK is “secretly” planning for a future direct military conflict with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More so than words, Russia’s actions towards the UK following the SDR were revealing. First, Russia swiftly designated the British Council as an “undesirable organisation”, effectively halting all their educational activities in Russia. Although the Council has largely been barred from operating since the war began, the symbolic designation carried with it the claim that the Council has been a foil for British intelligence in Russia. Indeed, it gave significant airtime to the Council’s widespread intelligence activities, including allegations of attempting to foment unrest among the Baltic states against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a few days later, the SVR (foreign service) on 5 June published a lengthy treatise on its website on the UK’s policy towards Georgia – mostly on the UK’s involvement with the opposition, NGOs and activism – and its alleged subversive activities. The SVR’s media page is not especially /span&amp;gt;prolific and tends to reprint speeches, occasional war updates or criticisms of notable western officials. It is therefore less than coincidental that the SVR has chosen to publish its criticism of the UK at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of these various reactions to the SDR highlight in some way the paradoxical and highly contradictory nature of Moscow’s relationship with London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-they-see-us&quot;&gt;How Do They See Us?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long and varied history with the UK, marred most obviously in recent years by Russia’s various wars and intelligence operations on British soil. Prior to Trump’s resumption of office, Russia’s narratives of the UK could be divided into three broad and sometimes contradictory strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russia’s rather dismissive branding of “perfidious Albion” as an outmoded puppet of the US, and a country with limited international heft. Russia’s understanding of the way it sees the world is most clearly expressed in its Foreign Policy Concept, published in 2023 amid the war. There, it refers to the UK as part of the “Anglo-Saxon” world – a purposeful reference to an extinct civilisation which tallies with Russian ideas of the decline of the West (and the concomitant rising of Russia’s own star).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is mentioned in a somewhat throwaway paragraph entitled “the US and other Anglo-Saxon states”, drawing a power distinction between Washington, and those who are seen as in its pockets. Indeed, there is an entire section dedicated to Russia’s rumination of its relationship with the US, despite it’s so called “anti-Russian policy” and a mere sentence referring to other “Anglo Saxon” countries. This definition is unclear – it seems to be rather liberally used to refer to some European countries as well – but the sentiment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia sees the world in terms of who has power and who does not, it was evident that Russia does not consider the UK to be on a par with itself, China or the US – the “geopolitical troika” referred to above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This narrative runs alongside but not necessarily counter to Russia’s second narrative, of the UK as a provider of occasionally desirable assets. Russia’s practical interests in the UK’s real estate sector, capitalisation on illicit flows through the UK’s banking system; admiration of the British schooling system, and access to gold standard institutions such as British contract law are well established. The UK’s perceived international relevance does not negate Russia’s patronage of certain institutions that can further some of Russia’s interests abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the third and similarly contradictory strategy, which is that while maintaining the UK’s supreme irrelevance, Russia appears to invest some resources in its intelligence penetration of the UK, as well as showcasing Russia’s aerial and naval capabilities close to British waters and airspace with relative frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corollary of this is that Russia appears to expend a fair amount of media resources into criticising the UK’s “Russophobic” stance and framing it as a country focused on undermining Russia and its development. According to this narrative, the UK occupies a space in an international system designed to keep Russia out of what Moscow perceives to be its rightful domain in international affairs. This perception likely increases the UK’s attractiveness as an intelligence target, as well as our relationship with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-russian-narratives&quot;&gt;Testing Russian Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the above narrative strings were the basis of Russia’s understanding of the UK, since the war and Trump and Starmer’s respective terms of office, they have become harder for Russia to sustain, and so they have perceptibly shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, President Trump’s perceived pullback from NATO, admonishment of the European states over their spending, and apparent echoing of some of Russia’s security concerns, as well as his willingness to entertain the Russian position, have all forced Moscow to draw much more of a distinction between US and UK foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this vein, much of the media reaction to the SDR has focused on Moscow’s perception of the UK as luring the US into an open war with Russia. This is not just confined to the media. Political heavyweights such as Nikolai Patrushev, formerly head of the Security Council and now a presidential aide and head of the Maritime Board, which is involved with maritime security and Arctic development, have in recent months made public distinctions between the US and what they refer to as the “European wing of NATO”, led by London. A growing narrative is instead that London is seeking to subvert the nascent dialogue between Moscow and Washington, and it is Trump who is walking back from an outright war with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the head of the SVR in March 2025 issued an unusually focused and charged statement about the UK, accusing London of undermining Trump’s negotiating stance with Russia; highlighting the UK’s weakness without the US, and going as far as to refer to the UK as the main instigator of global conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK’s spearheading of the Coalition of the Willing appears to have somewhat wrongfooted the Russians. Consecutive Conservative governments and their stance on Russia were a known entity for Moscow, but Starmer’s continuation of military aid to Ukraine, boosting of UK defence spending and careful rhetoric around Trump (that does not go as far as criticising US negotiations with the Russians), are all surprising elements for Russia’s understanding of how a Labour government operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer’s role in bringing together European countries against Russia prompted some Russian officials to describe the UK as the “locomotive that pulls the rest of the [countries] with it”. All of this is a stark departure from the UK’s perceived international irrelevance and runs directly counter to Russia’s view that the UK does not have an independent foreign policy from the US. This has unseated Russia’s narrative of a UK that has little international clout, with deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko maintaining the UK, France and Germany are responsible for the slowing down of peace negotiations on the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia’s domestic security scene has changed, and with it, Russia’s perception of what constitutes an “enemy”. Throughout 2024, a series of IS-affiliated terrorist attacks have occurred within Russia since the war began, either due to a lack of preventative resources, or because the security services have prioritising targeting Russia’s political opposition, instead of addressing the terrorist threat. The most unusual element is not the domestic intelligence failures, but the Russian branding of enemies such as the UK as behind some of its most serious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack in March 2024, where almost 150 people were killed by gunmen professing allegiance to IS, Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB, publicly maintained that while the perpetrators may have been linked to IS, the true masterminds behind the attack were the UK, the US and Ukraine. In reality, this did not have any material impact on the FSB’s investigation of the true perpetrators, and resources were not expunged on identifying any serious link to the UK. But the narrative of an outsize threat to Russia, posed by an apparently irrelevant and powerless political entity, that nevertheless had the resources and interests in destabilising the country, is difficult to square with official understandings of where the UK sits in Russia’s power ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SVR has a journal called Razvedchik (intelligence officer) and while its readership might be small, the articles they choose to run with are revealing. In one of its most recent publications, Razvedchik released “declassified” intelligence documents alleging the British foreign service had attempted in 2024, in conjunction with the US, to attack Russian bases in Syria, with the aim of destabilising the region more broadly. While this is unlikely to be credible, it is further evidence of a contradictory framing of the UK as both an international irrelevance, but also the driving force behind the destabilisation of countries in which Russia has interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information purposes, these mutually exclusive narratives can all be folded into a broader picture of what constitutes Russia’s understanding of the UK, which can be multifaceted and inconsistent. But they also point to a more concerning lack of insight on Moscow’s part, and perhaps a lack of clarity on the UK’s part – about what the UK’s intentions are towards countries Russia has a particular focus on; about how foreign policymaking works in the West, and why the UK has become a euphemistic bogeyman, along with the rest of the “collective West”, to account for Russia’s own failings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pressingly, this collection of views suggests changes of leadership will not be sufficient to move the dial on Moscow’s relations with London.&lt;/p&gt;

The Iranian General Staff announced a shift from “deterrent” strikes to “punitive” operations — an escalation prompted by Israel’s ongoing offensive, launched on June 13, which officially targets Iran’s nuclear program but has eliminated key military commanders and destroyed air defense systems.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Israel appears to be aiming for the collapse of the Iranian state, though it’s unclear how long it can sustain such an effort on its own. Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — the backbone of the clerical regime — has been weakened and discredited. Israeli intelligence networks have reportedly penetrated deep inside Iran’s state and military institutions, and Khamenei himself may no longer be receiving accurate reports on the situation. Still, the regime could seek to regain public support by deploying nationalist rhetoric and making political concessions. According to Antonio Giustozzi of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the future of the Islamic Republic hinges on Tehran’s ability to adapt to this new phase of war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the stated aim of Israel’s attack on Iran is to destroy Tehran’s nuclear programme, its main initial success on June 12-13 was the decapitation of Iran’s military: both the Commander of the IRGC and the chief of staff of the Iranian army were killed, together with several other senior military commanders. The damage to Iran’s air defences was also so extensive that they might now be completely unserviceable, but this makes little actual difference, as those defences had already proven to be no match for the Israelis in Syria and during previous raids inside Iran. The big display of Israeli special forces’ skills and capabilities in neutralising Iran’s air defence batteries appears in fact more a piece of psychological warfare than a real military need. The Israeli special forces also played a key role in targeting the military elite of Iran. The rather decrepit Iranian air force was also largely wiped out — but again nobody expected it could put up any resistance against the Israelis in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, it is in targeting his stated main objective — the nuclear programme — that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen shortest. Given that the key enrichment facilities of Fordow are beyond the reach of Israeli weapons, this is not surprising. But it does beg the question of what Israel’s strategy really is. Although Israel claims to have inflicted major damage on the strategic missile arsenal of Iran, the Iranians were nevertheless able on 14-15 June to launch several waves of long-range strikes against Israeli cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Netanyahu bet that he could convince U.S. president Donald Trump to join the war after Iran — as expected — retaliated with strikes against Israel’s civilian population. If so, he might have miscalculated, as Trump rejected the invitation to join the operation. It has also gradually become known that Netanyahu hopes to eliminate the risk represented by Iran’s nuclear programme and nuclear capabilities by causing the Islamic Republic to collapse altogether. Netanyahu first hinted on 15 June that “regime change” was a possibility, and he has since repeated this multiple times. At this point, Netanyahu’s best chance at achieving victory involves creating conditions that lead to the ayatollahs being replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-iran-missed-the-june-13-attack&quot;&gt;Why Iran missed the June 13 attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How vulnerable is the Iranian regime to Israeli efforts to bring it down? It is clear that the Islamic Republic had a very bad start to the campaign, with the Israelis succeeding in repeating the decapitation strategy that they inflicted on Hezbollah last year. This is remarkable and the effort of the Iranian government to make excuses, claiming that Trump misled them into thinking an Israeli strike would not happen while the talks were ongoing, does not really hold water. According to sources within the regime, the evening before the attack many Iranian officials were nervous due to the fact that a “friendly country” — likely Russia — had warned them of the imminent Israeli strike. It is possible that the Netanyahu government might have tipped the Russians off in order to safeguard its relations with Moscow. But then why didn’t the Iranians take precautions? Given previous Israeli strikes against Iran and Hezbollah, it defies belief that Tehran might have expected the strike to focus exclusively on nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that the top leadership of the country, probably Supreme Leader Khamenei himself, might have decided to disregard that warning, but there were other signs of an incoming attack. These include the evacuation of U.S. embassies in the region, along with Trump’s own rhetoric. The IAEA’s statement on 11 June that Iran had refused the international watchdog access to the country’s nuclear sites and that Tehran was continuing to enrich uranium to 60% should also have advised caution to the Iranians. Instead, senior military leaders of Iran and some of its nuclear scientists were tracked and killed — some of them in their bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Khamenei might not have the pulse of the situation is not surprising. Alone at the top of the regime for 36 years, he has effectively been living in a bunker since 28 September 2024. He has mostly been relying on his advisers for information — including about the state of the armed forces, and the majority of his most trusted advisers are officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). These are unlikely to have frankly acknowledged to the Supreme Leader that their air defence was not up to scratch and highly likely to have portrayed Iran’s readiness in optimistic terms. After all, had they provided a more realistic assessment, the ever-increasing commitment of resources to the IRGC would perhaps have been questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-weak-spots&quot;&gt;Iran’s weak spots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis have clearly been astonishingly successful at infiltrating Iran with their special forces, despite the Iranians knowing that the Israelis were present on Iran’s territory since at least 2007. Such Israeli infiltration operations have been intensifying in 2024, most notably with the killing of Hamas figure Ismail Haniyeh. It is obvious that the Israelis have considerable human intelligence resources in Iran and very likely also enjoy significant cooperation from elements of the Iranian armed forces. After the previous strikes on Iranian territory, waves of arrests of alleged Israeli spies and collaborators took place, mainly targeting the Iranian army. The army (artesh) competes with the IRGC for resources and has suffered in recent years from a re-allocation that has favoured the IRGC. The army’s political loyalty is also in question: during the wave of anti-regime demonstrations of 2022-2023, many desertions took place within its ranks, and according to sources within the army itself, recruitment has collapsed. The status of the army has been weakened and it now plays second fiddle to the IRGC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis, on the other hand, were emboldened by their successful strikes against Hezbollah last year, and also by their feeling that the Iranian regime was in a state of decay — as highlighted by their growing success at infiltrating it. And there was indeed a sense of disillusionment inside the regime that affected even the IRGC. It should be assumed that the Israelis also sought contact with Iranian opposition groups, probably initially to recruit informers. If indeed Netanyahu has the collapse of the Islamic Republic in mind, trying to mobilise the internal opposition would be a necessary component of any such plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-violent opposition is not really organised nationally, it is fragmented into many small groups, and it completely lacks a leadership, making mobilising it quite hard. Sources within the regime report that monarchist elements have become active, trying to organise demonstrations, but with little success. The internal security apparatus of the regime is still fully functional for now, but one should not discount the strength of Iranian nationalism, nor the size of whatever remains of the social base of the regime. Eyewitnesses reported attempts by opponents of the regime to call for demonstrations from the windows of their houses, only to be rebutted and reported to the police by pro-regime neighbours. Along Iran’s borders there are also armed opposition groups, chief among them Kurds in the west and Baluchis in the east. Indeed, from Iran’s eastern border, sources within the main Baluchi opposition group, Jaysh ul Adl, have been reporting for months that Israeli funds are flowing towards their organisation and that they are being told to get ready for a big offensive in the wake of an Israeli/American attack on the regime. Black market arms dealers in Pakistan confirm that purchases by Jaysh ul Adl increased dramatically earlier this year. Among the Baluchi minority as a whole the reactions have been more mixed, with leading religious figure Mawlavi Abdul Hamid, known for his criticism of the regime, coming out in public in support of the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeted Israeli military action could increase the relative strength of groups seeking to opposed the Iranian regime on the ground. After Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, Israeli counter-retaliation strikes have hit economic targets, in particular the oil industry. If the Israelis could inflict extensive damage on the economic and transport infrastructure, they could conceivably hope to undermine the regime’s ability to respond effectively to insurgents’ offensives and any outbreaks of mass protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Republic nonetheless appears to be on somewhat stronger ground after it was able to hit Israeli territory. It is not clear what Iran’s reserves of ballistic missiles are (it claims to have 2,000 of them). After the initial massive waves of retaliation, the Iranians reduced the numbers fired, but this could just be meant to ensure they have means of retaliation lasting for the coming several weeks. It is also not clear for how long Israel can keep striking Iran at such a pace. With the initial surprise gone, targeting the Iranian armed forces is not going to be as easy as it was at the start of the campaign, and presumably the Iranians have made contingency plans for dealing with an extensive air campaign against them. It will take a very extensive campaign to cripple the ability of the armed forces to contain any form of active opposition, and it is not clear whether Israel can sustain the necessary pressure alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threats-to-israel&quot;&gt;Threats to Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains the possibility of the Iranians developing a nuclear weapon, which Netanyahu alleges they were doing anyway — and that they were two months away from completion at the start of his attack. While a long air campaign against Iran would in all likelihood see Israel outrun Iran’s reserve of ballistic missiles, it should also see the Iranians enrich enough uranium for a few atomic bombs (provided that Netanyahu is right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other risk for Israel is that its decapitation strategy and the devastating air campaign might prompt the leadership of the Islamic Republic to mobilize popular support using a set of new policies, relying on Iranian nationalism for regaining legitimacy. The IRGC — the main supporter of the regime’s militarist approach — was clearly weakened and discredited by the first few days of the Israeli attack. Their reputation was already in question after the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, and their idea that the best form of deterrence for Iran involved supporting the Axis of Resistance has visibly failed. The IRGC is also seen as being the main beneficiary of the regime’s proactive power projection policy as well as of the sanctions regime that was implemented at least in part as a response to Tehran’s aggressive IRGC-driven foreign policy. Meanwhile, the rest of the country suffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC specialises in sanctions busting and smuggling, activities that allegedly have allowed them to accumulate considerable wealth. Supreme Leader Khamenei might appear unlikely to go against the IRGC, and he may even take such a bold move as advocating for a return to the roots of the revolution. However, Khamenei already tested such a path in 2024, when he encouraged reformist Massud Pezeshkian to run for president — and even let him win — after having for years done his best to marginalise and undermine reformist politicians. Sources within the regime suggested at that time that Khamenei was aware of the leadership’s growing isolation from Iranian society. This suggests that such bold options are not to be ruled entirely out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Maritime Sanctions Taskforce convened again in May 2025 to examine the evolving threat posed by Russia’s shadow fleet and identify policy initiatives to counter its oil-exporting operations aimed at funding Russia’s military–industrial complex. The Taskforce brings together 60 representatives from government and industry, including major insurers, banks, law firms and maritime data providers. In the latest meeting, the Taskforce addressed three interrelated themes that form the structure of this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of the insurance sector in maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying strategies for enhancing flag state accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing the targeting of the network of enablers supporting maritime sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with policy recommendations identified by the Taskforce intended to enhance the implementation and enforcement of maritime sanctions, as well as to improve compliance with international maritime standards. Contributions from Taskforce members are made on an unattributable basis and this report does not necessarily represent the views of all Taskforce members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-insurance-sector-in-maritime-sanctions&quot;&gt;The Role of the Insurance Sector in Maritime Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce began by examining how insurance – particularly protection and indemnity (P&amp;amp;I), cargo, and hull coverage – interacts with sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While P&amp;amp;I insurers have received most regulatory attention, participants stressed the need to consider how all categories of insurance relate to shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;I insurance is especially visible in relation to sanctions compliance due to its role in liability coverage and its requirement for vessels to obtain entry into ports. All P&amp;amp;I clubs that are members of the International Group (IG) publicise the vessels they insure, making the clubs identifiable when potential breaches occur. Hull and cargo insurers carry the same sanctions compliance obligations but do not publicise the names of their assureds. Similarly, non-IG P&amp;amp;I insurers do not routinely publish lists of vessels insured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hull and machinery and cargo insurers may monitor bills of lading and track vessel activities, but others may have less granular insight into shipping behaviour. Cargo insurance was flagged by participants as particularly opaque, and the “open cover” policies offered by many cargo insurers were discussed. These policies provide coverage across multiple shipments during the policy period and often do not allow for systematic disclosure of shipment-specific risk, especially when certain goods are prohibited in some destinations but not in others. Brokers and insurers are often unable to detect whether sanctioned goods – often subject to misrepresentation – are being traded unless counterparties voluntarily disclose such information or regulators provide specific warnings. Insurers may seek representations from clients but often lack the tools to enforce sanctions compliance at the cargo level. Some Taskforce members argued that mandatory voyage-by-voyage reporting mechanisms could improve compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hull insurance, though less prominent, becomes critical when the vessel itself is sanctioned, according to industry representatives at the Taskforce. A sanctioned ship without hull coverage represents a significant risk to cargo owners and financial institutions involved in the trade. Yet hull coverage is often overlooked in enforcement discussions, despite playing an important role when sanctioned vessels are transferred, damaged, or abandoned and left adrift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted the limited ability of insurers to verify downstream actors in complex transactions. Direct insurers typically contract with the commodity trader or shipowner, but they cannot easily identify or verify charterers, ship managers or port agents involved in the insured voyage. Many Taskforce members agreed that Know Your Customer’s Customer (KYCC) expectations are unrealistic unless insurers receive legal support and intelligence-sharing from authorities. But without access to data from customs, financial intelligence units or vessel inspection reports, insurers cannot effectively flag high-risk activity. Even when asked to avoid sanctionable transactions, brokers and carriers often rely on client declarations and lack the ability to conduct independent verification. This points to the limits of voluntary attestation-based compliance in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of accessing compliance documentation, particularly when new requirements such as the oil price cap (OPC) or restrictions on Russian diamonds are introduced mid-contract, the Lloyd’s Market Association (LMA) has issued a clause welcomed by many Taskforce members that imposes two key obligations on the (re)insured: to maintain records demonstrating compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding the insured subject matter; and to provide, upon reasonable request, evidence needed by the (re)insurer or broker to satisfy themselves or any regulator of such compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns also arose regarding unintended consequences. Overregulation might encourage insurers to withdraw from high-risk sectors entirely, creating a vacuum filled by less reputable insurers. Some Taskforce members noted that advisory notices issued by governments are useful documents but frequently extend beyond the scope of formal legal measures, creating uncertainty. Insurers often act with caution, denying coverage to avoid regulatory exposure even in the absence of a formal prohibition. This decreases transparency and increases the likelihood that shadow fleet operations will continue undetected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce advised regulators to engage more consistently with marine insurance associations to develop workable compliance expectations. Insurers requested that expectations around risk screening and reporting should reflect commercial realities, as pushing for perfect compliance may result in market exits and rising dependence on insurers without adequate governance. This will lead to further growing gaps in global coverage and make room for poorly regulated alternative operators to gain ground, allowing the shadow fleet’s parallel operating infrastructure to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion also highlighted the emergence of non-IG P&amp;amp;I insurers operating outside traditional jurisdictions. The growth of Russian and regionally based insurance backed by the Russian Central Bank enables sanctioned vessels to demonstrate insurance coverage despite failing to meet international transparency and solvency standards. Even where such coverage is adequately capitalised, it may be unable to function properly because of the impact of Western sanctions. Although flag states are responsible for verifying the validity of liability insurance under International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines, many registries lack the technical capacity or willingness to evaluate the adequacy of insurance providers. The result is a gap in oversight whereby sanctioned vessels obtain questionable coverage and continue operations. Participants also noted a growing number of insurers based in Asia and the Middle East, specifically China and the UAE, entering the market with minimal transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also discussed the introduction by the Nordic-Baltic 8++ countries of the voluntary insurance reporting mechanism (VIRM), which requests vessels transiting their territorial waters to disclose their insurance details. Governments use this system to collect data on insurance coverage, verify compliance and request additional information where red flags appear. Representatives from the UK government at the meeting stated that the VIRM has prompted high levels of voluntary cooperation and has helped identify over 270 individual vessels of concern. While the reporting mechanism is voluntary, a lack of response from vessels might increase scrutiny and can prompt further investigations. Taskforce members welcomed the VIRM’s deterrence effect and recognised the value of sharing this approach with European partners. The Taskforce highlighted the significant step taken by the EU with the amendment to the Vessel Monitoring Directive, which requires all vessels, including those merely passing through EU waters without entering an EU port, to provide insurance information. However, questions persisted around the actions to be taken against vessels that decline to disclose their insurance under the EU’s mandatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-flag-state-accountability&quot;&gt;Enhancing Flag State Accountability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce turned next to the issue of flag state compliance with international maritime obligations, with a focus on how weak oversight and opaque registries have allowed the shadow fleet to operate unchecked. Flag states provide vessels with their legal nationality and are responsible for ensuring compliance with safety, environmental and insurance standards, under Article 94 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Thus, flag states must exercise jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag, but the Taskforce stressed that these obligations remain largely unenforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNCLOS contains no practical enforcement mechanism beyond interstate litigation, and there is no tribunal or international process for revoking the registry privileges of non-compliant states. As a result, countries that offer so-called “flags of convenience” face little consequence for failing to uphold international standards. Participants noted that flag registries often function with minimal state oversight – especially in countries that outsource their registry management to private operators – and that shadow fleet vessels can exploit these gaps by hopping rapidly through multiple flag registries. Participants identified countries such as Gambia, Honduras, Mongolia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone and Tanzania as jurisdictions where registries have become popular with the shadow fleet because they impose few entry requirements, lack rigorous inspection regimes and rarely scrutinise the insurance coverage or ownership structures of the vessels they flag. In one recent example raised by a participant, a vessel reflagged four times in a matter of weeks, passing through several of these permissive jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This frequent switching makes it difficult for flag states to maintain oversight and accountability. Participants observed that even when port state control authorities identify deficiencies during inspections, the corresponding flag state is rarely held to account. In many cases, such deficiencies only come to light after port authorities intervene. However, Taskforce members also observed that sustained diplomatic engagement can achieve results in countering illicit operations and raise the costs for shadow fleet operators. As explored in past Taskforce reports, countries like Panama and Liberia, which operate some of the world’s largest registries, have responded positively to UK and EU outreach. Persistent diplomatic efforts have led additional countries like Gabon and Barbados to deregister sanctioned vessels and take steps to distance themselves from shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While private companies may operate a registry, the Taskforce argued that the government of the country/flag state where the registry is located should retain ultimate responsibility and must be held accountable under international law. Registry activity reflects on the sovereign state, and failure to exercise proper control not only violates UNCLOS but also contributes to broader systemic risks. The Taskforce emphasised that countries must be mindful of how their national symbols are used. As one participant framed it, a country’s flag is not just a business tool; it is a signal of the country’s regulatory integrity and global reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce considered the role of the IMO in strengthening compliance. Under current IMO rules, flag states are responsible for verifying that insurers issuing Blue Cards meet adequate solvency and transparency standards. However, as explained above, this requirement is inconsistently applied. Some Taskforce members cited instances where flag state personnel lacked basic awareness of financial solvency indicators or how to evaluate insurance documents. Several flag registries were said to accept Blue Cards issued by insurers with no public records, no credit rating, no audited financials and no track record of claims payouts. These lapses illustrate a profound gap between legal obligations and actual regulatory practice. An example of these risks can be found in the case of the now sanctioned Norway-based insurer Ro Marine, which provided forged documentation to fraudulently insure dozens of shadow fleet vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Taskforce participants recommended that IMO guidance be strengthened to require public disclosure of insurer information, including capital adequacy, credit ratings and financial audit data. While acknowledging that the IMO is not – and must not become – a sanctions enforcement body, participants argued that enhancing insurance transparency aligns with the IMO’s mandate to protect the marine environment and improve safety standards. The information disclosure would help flag state and port state control authorities assess the legitimacy of insurance coverage, and would improve the transparency of vessels operating under flags that continue to facilitate shadow fleet activity under the guise of formal compliance. It would also reduce the risk of environmental damage caused by poorly insured vessels and enhance the ability of regulators to detect problematic registry practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also explored the viability of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including flag registry oversight in its mutual evaluation process. FATF already assesses the implementation of UN-related counter-proliferation financing (CPF) sanctions (primarily in relation to North Korea). Some Taskforce members argued that this framework should include the assessment of whether countries hosting flag registries are enabling sanctions evasion, including through deficient flag state oversight of vessel insurance and compliance standards. Despite FATF’s scope being limited to UN sanctions, raising flag state standards would impact all shadow fleets, not only North Korea’s. Evaluating flag state performance as part of a country’s broader financial integrity could elevate the issue politically and incentivise better registry governance. This would move accountability from the private operators of the registry to the government that authorises and benefits from its operations. A FATF finding of deficiency could be labelled as a technical compliance failure and potentially lead to greylisting, which would increase international scrutiny and trigger reputational and economic consequences for the country concerned. As one Taskforce member put it, “if a country wants the economic benefits of hosting a major registry, it must also accept the regulatory responsibilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising that enhancing the roles of the IMO and FATF might take time, the Taskforce recommended in the meantime that a list of high-risk flag registries based on internationally recognised criteria be developed to help regulators and industry identify problematic jurisdictions. This list could draw from existing frameworks such as the “white-grey-black” lists of the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and the International Chamber of Shipping’s Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table, which evaluates flags based on specific criteria such as port state control inspection records, average age of the fleet, and ratification of international conventions. While some participants questioned the practicality of “naming and shaming” registries, others argued that such a list would help guide industry risk assessments and encourage registries to improve performance. One participant noted that the UK and most EU member states, as members of the Paris MoU, already participate in the creation of such lists to prioritise port state control actions, and should consider incorporating similar metrics to produce a list of all high-risk flag registries. The EU and UK also maintain FATF-based lists of anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism high-risk countries, and that approach could serve as a model for developing a maritime equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-risk flags could be subjected to increased inspections, detentions or even port entry restrictions. Some Taskforce members recommended compiling and maintaining a high-risk registry list based on port state control records, FATF assessments and insurance validation failures. Such a list could guide due diligence for insurers, financiers and port authorities, increasing the operational burden on shadow fleet vessels and making registries more cautious in accepting questionable applicants. A shared understanding among international governments and industry would have a significant impact in raising standards globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a ship is removed from a registry that seeks to raise its standards, it will probably seek to continue its operations under a different, more permissive flag. Taskforce members recommended that enforcement authorities should therefore extend flag state outreach to develop deeper coordination between flag states and enforcement agencies to track vessels across registry changes and share information in real time. One participant suggested the creation of an international flag state information-sharing mechanism, similar to the Registry Information Sharing Compact (RISC) but expanded to more jurisdictions – though others noted the legal and institutional barriers to implementing such a mechanism. Several Taskforce members also advocated for harsher measures to target the enabling infrastructures that allow shadow fleet vessels to operate globally. This is further explored in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-maritime-sanctions-evasion-networks&quot;&gt;Addressing Maritime Sanctions Evasion Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce then focused on the ecosystem of actors, tactics and structural enablers that allow the shadow fleet to continue operating despite increasing enforcement pressure. Taskforce members highlighted that sanctions evasion in the maritime domain does not occur in isolation. Instead, it relies on a broad infrastructure of third-party service providers – including brokers, shipowners, vessel management companies and financial intermediaries – which knowingly or negligently enables continued trade with sanctioned entities. Participants highlighted the central role of certain London-based ship brokers in assembling clusters of vessels to supply to the shadow fleet, by structuring opaque ownership arrangements, matching buyers and sellers, and identifying permissive registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members noted that the sale of tankers often involves a standard practice whereby sellers request a declaration from buyers confirming that the vessel will not be used in violation of the OPC or to trade with sanctioned jurisdictions. However, these declarations are largely performative. A recent case highlighted by Taskforce members involved the UK’s decision to sanction British ship finance veteran John Ormerod for facilitating the supply of 25 second-hand tankers into Russia’s shadow fleet. The case illustrates how experienced actors in the shipping and finance sectors have supported sanctions evasion through structuring complex ownership arrangements and networks of offshore companies. Despite the scale and sophistication of the operation, intermediaries and brokers involved in similar deals have largely avoided enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants questioned why intermediaries involved in high-value tanker transactions with clear links to sanctioned entities had not faced any enforcement action, and they considered this gap in the sanctions strategy a priority. In the case of Ormerod, the seller was sanctioned, but the broker and the financier involved in structuring the transaction were not. The absence of consequences risks creating incentives for intermediaries to ignore red flags and facilitate ongoing violations of sanctions measures. This undermines the deterrent effect of sanctions and allows enablers to adapt quickly to designation actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also addressed the role of non-aligned jurisdictions and their permissive ports and logistics hubs in enabling shadow fleet operations. Ports and refineries in China and India continue to accept Russian crude carried by designated or high-risk vessels, often without any apparent concern for the origin of the cargo or the insurance status of the ship. Participants noted that while some jurisdictions, such as India, have started to reject high-risk vessels out of a desire to remain integrated in global markets, others have emerged as safe havens for shadow fleet operations. Taskforce members highlighted that bunkering services, crew changes and maintenance are frequently provided in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, allowing the fleet to maintain operational continuity. These jurisdictions are also used to store oil offshore or conduct ship-to-ship transfers in remote anchorages, evading G7 regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One member described Malaysia as “the epicentre of lawlessness”, with dozens of shadow fleet tankers regularly engaging in ship-to-ship transfers and manipulating their automatic identification systems. Taskforce members warned that these practices risked catastrophic maritime incidents and urged states to apply existing maritime safety conventions more rigorously, especially in high-risk zones, as a means of curbing the operational viability of the shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members thus stressed the need for a policy shift that mirrors the recent US actions against Iran, where the entire supply chain, including refineries, ports, shipping agents and other stakeholders in third countries, has been designated to increase pressure on the broader network. The US uses secondary sanctions aggressively, heightening the risks for third parties to engage with designated entities. Vessels involved in Iranian trade, for example, are therefore often treated as untouchable under US sanctions. The Taskforce acknowledged that UK and EU sanctions lack the secondary reach of US measures and are primarily limited to direct jurisdictional reach, offering less deterrence. Without the ability to impose sanctions on third-country entities, the UK and EU have limited options for curbing this activity. Several members argued that the UK and EU must adopt similar approaches to the US if they are to have an impact on not only the vessels but also the surrounding infrastructure that sustains them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taskforce-recommendations&quot;&gt;Taskforce Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that while diplomatic engagement and reputational pressure have yielded some success, systemic reform remains difficult. UNCLOS lacks the enforcement tools to compel compliance, and many flag states have little incentive to tighten their oversight over the insurance coverage of the vessels under their registration. An effective response must include revising IMO guidelines, incorporating registry oversight into FATF evaluations, deepening diplomatic engagement and coordinating with the insurance community. Only by aligning these levers can regulators close the governance loopholes that allow the shadow fleet to continue operating under the cover of legal registration. The Taskforce reiterated that strengthening flag state accountability is essential not only to enforcing maritime sanctions but also to preserving the integrity of the international maritime system. Yet the Taskforce also acknowledged that securing revisions to IMO guidelines or the FATF standards is unlikely in the near term, necessitating the development of a high-risk list that can be used to “name and shame” those registries that fail to meet international standards and act as a warning mechanism for private sector actors conducting due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also reaffirmed that disrupting sanctions evasion requires attention to not only the vessels but also the full network of actors that sustain them. Brokers, registries, ports and refineries all play critical roles in enabling illicit maritime activity. Regulatory strategies must therefore target these enablers collectively, rather than focusing on vessels in isolation. Strengthening enforcement against enablers and increasing international pressure on jurisdictions hosting them will be essential to reduce the economic viability of shadow fleet operations and restore the effectiveness of global sanctions frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these policy goals, the following recommendations emerged from the Taskforce discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance public sector cooperation with the insurance industry&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Governments and regulators should enhance their collaboration with the insurance industry through structured information-sharing mechanisms. The complexity of the insurance sector demands greater understanding by the public sector, and regulatory expectations should be fine-tuned to the capabilities of industry. The insurance sector is a key player in compliance with maritime sanctions and a valuable source of information. Public–private collaboration should be deepened to leverage industry expertise and access to operational intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale up the VIRM&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The VIRM should be scaled up into a reliable dataset on vessel insurance and ownership, with non-compliance triggering heightened scrutiny. The UK should explore making it mandatory in line with the EU’s recent amendment to the Vessel Monitoring Directive. Additionally, an action plan should be developed in case of non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen the IMO guidelines on insurance disclosures&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The IMO should revise its guidelines to enhance the public disclosures of insurer solvency data, credit ratings and audited financial statements, and improve compliance by flag states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include flag registries in FATF evaluations&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The key role played by flag registries in achieving compliance with CPF standards should lead FATF to ensure that its mutual evaluation procedure includes an assessment of their effective oversight. FATF has proved to be an effective body in raising transparency and government performance globally, and could help ensure the enforcement of flag state obligations to observe CPF standards, which would hinder the operations of all shadow fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a public list of high-risk flag registries&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This list should guide insurer, shipper and financier risk assessments and deter engagement with systematically non-compliant jurisdictions. This initiative could be built on tools like the Paris and Tokyo MoUs and the International Chamber of Shipping’s Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a cross-jurisdictional flag registry coordination mechanism&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The UK and G7+ should support efforts to develop an intergovernmental platform to track deregistered vessels and prevent their rapid reflagging in permissive states. RISC should serve as an inspirational model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designate the entire sanctions evasion supply chain&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement agencies should target brokers, escrow agents, financiers and intermediaries, as well as ports, port authorities and refineries, which knowingly support and contribute to shadow fleet operations. The EU and UK should enhance their designations of third-country entities in order to reduce the effectiveness gap between their sanctions and those of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been heightened activity on maritime sanctions in the UK and EU in recent weeks, significant gaps persist in the ability of G7 allies to disrupt Russia’s funding from the sale of oil. As the Taskforce discussion highlighted, scrutiny of the infrastructure that supports Russia’s shadow fleet must be heightened in order to close loopholes and vulnerabilities that the Kremlin continues to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

If the UK wants to use and protect truly sovereign capabilities it will need sustained and probably increased investment to succeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) of a section on space alongside the land, sea, maritime, and cyber &amp;amp; electromagnetic domains represents the latest step of a journey kicked off by the Integrated Review of 2021 to make space a fully-fledged “operational domain”. It was the Integrated Review that committed the funds for the creation of a UK Space Command, endorsed by the subsequent Defence Command Paper with a plan to establish a National Space Operations Centre, and to improve both the UK’s understanding of space as an environment and its access to and use of space-based capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refresh of the Integrated Review and Command Paper in 2023, following the publication of a National Space Strategy and the Space Defence Strategy, all reaffirmed the significance of space and the direction of travel. But what the new SDR demands in terms of the transformation of the Armed Forces may require additional prioritisation of resources allocated to space if it is to succeed in its aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-critical-to-the-sdrs-approach&quot;&gt;Space is Critical to the SDR’s Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the UK is still developing as a space power in its own right, but the SDR sets out an approach that will depend heavily on space-based capabilities as well as asking Defence to do more to protect the UK’s space interests. While the SDR is not purely about technology, at the heart of the technology component is better use of a greater volume of information, backed up by faster processing and decision-making, allied to improved weapons. The ability to act more rapidly and concentrate force is intended to improve the combat power of the Armed Forces, and the best example of this is in the new “Digital Targeting Web” allocated £1 billion to bring it into service in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network can only succeed if supported with space-based capabilities. First, it will require a variety of overhead collection capabilities, able to gather information under all weather conditions, and thus involving a range of electro-optical, passive infra-red, signals interception and synthetic aperture radar sensors. These capabilities can all be provided by terrestrial sensors, but none with the kind of global coverage or time over the target that space-based sensors can provide given their varying altitudes and orbits, which also protect them from direct attack by most conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, moving this data around will require links that are difficult to intercept and can provide connections well beyond line of sight, to any point of the globe at a moment’s notice. Access to internet-based communications is the most straightforward way of achieving this, but for obvious reasons of connectivity and security, militaries generally desire their own assured communications satellites, even though much can be done over commercial providers like Starlink, which has been popular in the Russo-Ukrainian War for command and control. The UK’s satellite communication system is the unfortunately-named SKYNET, but the SDR seems to have concerns over the resilience of the network and its forthcoming upgrades and recommends it is periodically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the SDR recommends more UK effort on Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) both in support of NATO more broadly and in direct defence of the UK. As the SDR specifically identifies, this will require investment in space-based capabilities in the form of a “next-generation, overhead, persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability”, particularly if the threat is from ballistic missiles which require early identification before or when they are launched. Terrestrial, but space-related capabilities, such as the early-warning radar at RAF Fylingdales would also be important to such a system, as well as meeting the ambition to improve the UK’s understanding of what is happening in space (Space Domain Awareness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a section that has been little-commented on, the SDR suggests the UK should prioritise investment in counter-space systems, given the need for greater freedom of action in space (Space Control) and to understand adversary capabilities better. This reflects a recognition that the threats to space-based capabilities have been growing, as seen in the Russian anti-satellite test of 2021 (which generated a significant volume of space debris), and the Russian disruption of satellite services, which started early on in its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but has continued since. There is further recent reporting on the suspicion that Russia has placed a nuclear-based anti-satellite weapon in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither has China been idle since its anti-satellite test in 2007, and the latest US Annual Threat Assessment judged that China has now surpassed Russia as a space leader, fielding a range of ground-based counter-space capabilities and conducting on-orbit inspections of other satellites. Not only does the MOD need to protect its own systems, but the SDR highlights the centrality of space to the UK more broadly with nearly 20% of national GDP reliant on satellite services. It estimates disruption to the Global Positioning System would cost the UK economy an estimated £1bn a day (and given these are figures from nearly seven years ago, more recent ones from 2022 and 2023 suggest both numbers will be at least as big now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-space-capabilities-lift-off-or-still-on-the-launchpad&quot;&gt;The UK’s Space Capabilities: Lift-Off or Still on the Launchpad?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no small set of demands. And although the establishment of UK Space Command and the publication of the UK Space Strategy set the UK on a positive trajectory, it is still early in its journey both in terms of capability and the understanding of space. It is often under-appreciated how limited the UK’s sovereign space capabilities have been, while the importance of space has grown. Critically, the UK has benefitted enormously from access to largely US systems, saving itself the enormous expense of developing, launching and maintaining its own satellites, but at the cost of having little of its own beyond the SKYNET communications system already mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the UK military had no space-based surveillance of any kind, and its foray in the 1980s into space-based signals intelligence ended in the cancellation of the disastrous Zircon project. What it has managed to do is gain access through the Five Eyes global intelligence partnership to largely US-derived imagery and intelligence. By providing processing and analytical capability, mostly through the National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence (NCGI) and its predecessor organisations, the UK has been able to “buy-in” to a vast geospatial intelligence network – where even just purchasing the imagery over a year would cost several billion pounds, possibly as much as the entirety of the UK’s intelligence budget on its own. Similarly, Fylingdales links the UK into a much broader early-warning network, including both ground-based systems and the Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) to detect missile launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-grey-to-white-the-development-of-istari&quot;&gt;From Grey to White: The Development of ISTARI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK programme to address the UK’s space shortfalls is ISTARI, a £968 billion programme intended to produce an sovereign operational UK surveillance constellation by 2031 (and, probably not coincidentally, sharing its name with the order of wizards from The Lord of the Rings). The demonstration phase of this, launching test satellites, has already started, and gives the UK its first sovereign space surveillance capability since the technology demonstrator Carbonite-2, launched in 2018 (and of which little has been seen since). It involves launching the first UK military-owned surveillance satellite, as well as building and developing the ground-based control and communications systems to operate a constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it gives us indications how far the UK has to go. The initial batch of satellites, as demonstrators, are more limited in their capabilities than the eventual operational constellation: the first imagery satellite, Tyche, was launched in 2024 but is only likely to have a lifespan of around 5 years and captures imagery at a resolution similar to medium-quality commercial satellites and far short of the alleged capabilities of high-end military satellites. The next pair, under the Oberon system, will be more advanced but are not due to be launched until 2027, and the same is true for Juno, the next electro-optical satellite to be launched. The UK therefore has an existing plan and funding to develop its sovereign space capabilities, but at a pace and level of resources matched to a global context several years out of date. The increased demand on space capabilities we can infer from the SDR’s enthusiasm for the “targeting web” and drastically-improved UK communications and data-sharing are unlikely to be met from UK sovereign capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-free-of-the-uss-gravitational-pull&quot;&gt;Breaking Free of the US’s Gravitational Pull?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because as described above the UK has until now had the security of being able to access US data and capabilities. Yet US reliability is now more doubtful, even if a complete rupture in relations (damaging to both) has been avoided. It is not hard to imagine that US prioritisation of collection (not a new challenge) would become more problematic if political priorities with the UK diverged. And it isn’t just imagery where the UK has a close relationship with the US and benefits from US space. The signal from the US Global Positioning System (GPS) is used for position, navigation and timing (vital for accurate targeting): geospatial information provided by the US underpins UK targeting and mapping systems, not least because that derived from GPS for the military is more precise than the civilian equivalent. When the UK was in discussion with Ukraine in 2024 over the use of UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles against targets in Russia, it had to seek US “approval”, even though the weapons were UK-French and not subject to US export controls. This was almost certainly because precise mission planning and targeting required US-originated geospatial and imagery information. In other words, in terms of space, what was until now an efficiency in the UK system is now obviously a dependence, verging on a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-infinity-and-beyond--or-at-least-low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;To Infinity and Beyond – Or at Least Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and scope of US space capabilities means that it is impossible for the UK to try and duplicate them over the next few years, and probably unrealistic even over the medium term. But if the UK wishes to be a sovereign space power and insulate itself from friction in the US relationship, additional investment over and above that which is planned will be desirable. It currently does not have access to many European programmes, such as the Galileo global-positioning system, as a consequence of Brexit, though it is still a member of the European Space Agency. Many European countries have drawn similar conclusions to the UK about the importance of sovereign capabilities, and have begun expanding their space programmes but full sharing of information is not straightforward. Another option is the Aquila constellation being developed as a NATO capability, as well as an EU PESCO initiative if the UK participated; none are sovereign options though and create other dependencies. The development of sovereign and ideally military-owned or operated systems is also required as insulation against wider commercial or political headwinds. While Starlink has, as mentioned, found popularity, it is still a commercial endeavour and does not provide an assured service even while it bests other commercial options. Similarly, commercial imagery can be subject to both commercial and political pressure, as recently seen in the case of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR makes clear the significance of space to the future security of the UK, and the recommendations it includes carry with them an increased demand for capabilities, as well as the ability to protect those capabilities and space’s support to the UK economy and society. But beyond the process and structural recommendations on working with NATO Allies, being a priority portfolio for the new National Armaments Director, and linking military space into a reinvigorated national approach, the SDR is vague on extra resources, and the last Budget did not provide anything new. Major space-based capabilities beyond small demonstrators can still take years to develop, and so if any additional capabilities will be required as part of making the UK “ready for war” there is a time imperative to make those decisions soon to be in place by the early 2030s. The same is true to start making strides in counter-space capabilities, and in protecting the UK network, given the head start adversaries have. Making a success of the SDR will require at the very least sustained investment in the current military space programme and continued reliance on partners, if not additional investment and the acceleration of the ISTARI programme. The alternative is a UK space programme stuck looking up to the stars in envy as others surpass it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria faces numerous security threats: from high rates of violent crime and enduring kidnap-for-ransom issues to long-running insurgencies in the northeast and a metastasising banditry problem in the northwest. Local assessments of these dynamics are often contested across demography and geography, at times feeding on a mix of context-specific tensions and historical inequalities. Given the influence such perspectives can have on the success and efficacy of interventions, it is essential to better understand grassroots experiences of insecurity and their associated pathways of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on fieldwork conducted across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna, this report takes bottom-up perceptions of violence as a starting point for analysing northern Nigeria’s threat landscape, exploring how organised crime, terrorism and other forms of insecurity are perceived at the subnational and local level. Much of the analysis is based on interview and focus group data, incorporating existing literature to caveat and contextualise respondent contributions (where possible) within a wider body of evidence. Such insights offer valuable entry points for interrogating the mechanisms that feed into and facilitate violence, and for identifying the implications they raise for domestic stakeholders and foreign donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants broadly identified four categories of violence – terrorism, banditry, petty crime and gangsterism, and corruption and extra-legal abuses – although the exact scope, mechanics and impact varied. Many highlighted how the fragmentation of violent extremism (VE) in the northeast has led to divergent forms of behaviour, with some groups seen as predatory and indiscriminate while others appeared more predictable and rational, despite the widespread conflation of terrorist activity under the generic label of “Boko Haram”. While VE was considered an increasingly ruralised problem due to the securitisation of urban spaces in the northeast, banditry seems ever-more pervasive, impacting remote villages, towns and cities, and diffusing from the northwest to other regions. The emergence of jihadist symbols and tactics – including mass kidnappings and complex attacks on military targets – has led to considerable international discussion over a prospective “crime–terror nexus”, notions of which were reflected in a small proportion of the interview data. However, respondents also highlighted the chaotic and opportunistic nature of conflict across the north and the insufficiency of existing national-legal categorisations for violence, which is often context-specific and highly localised (despite operational similarities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the scale of VE and banditry means they tend to become the focus of national and international interventions, participants acknowledged the additional impact of petty crime and gangsterism on regional communities. These were identified as both a cause and a consequence of insecurity and were linked by interviewees to long-term structural issues of unemployment and undereducation, as well as to trauma, displacement and disruption caused by ongoing conflict. Similarly, local fieldwork referenced the propensities of government actors to generate insecurity – from extra-legal violence to endemic corruption – leading to chronic levels of distrust and a perception that political and economic elites benefit from continued instability. While state authorities and portions of the wider public have empowered so-called “vigilante” groups – given their apparent role as an effective security provider – several participants expressed concern over their alleged involvement in criminal behaviour and the risk of further upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these discrete forms of insecurity have their own thematically and spatially defined drivers and dynamics, they coexist within a shared social ecology – a broader system conducive to violent mobilisation. In the case of northern Nigeria, the cumulative impact of colonial mismanagement and neo-patrimonial governance has arguably encouraged systemic corruption, impunity and the normalisation of coercion and criminality as tools of political competition. While the scope, intensity and resonance of these variables fluctuate over time, interviewee data implies they facilitate different modes of violence at a subnational level, as do the social responses to associated gaps in state reach, capacity and legitimacy. These problems can incentivise various experiments in local self-help, encouraging the emergence of alternative authority structures (whether bandit, criminal, extremist or vigilante), which are themselves liable to become vectors of instability. Bottom-up survival strategies and coping-mechanisms have, for instance, blurred the boundaries between licit and illicit behaviour, with communities reshaping social and economic norms in recognition of the constraints afflicting everyday life under the shadow of armed groups. In doing so, they have inadvertently shifted local perceptions and parameters of legitimate and illegitimate action further away from the national-legal definitions on which donors usually rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, the authors have identified a range of policy recommendations for the donor community to consider. The first two were drawn from suggestions put forward by interviewees themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaces for dialogue and collaboration between civilians, state actors and security personnel may help to improve local confidence,&lt;/strong&gt; reduce tensions, rebuild trust, increase transparency and help to instil a sense of ownership and responsibility among local people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community members should be engaged in anti-corruption efforts,&lt;/strong&gt; with bottom-up education and sensitisation campaigns accompanying top-down reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also flag a series of wider implications and prescriptions to inform donor approaches in the future, while acknowledging the complex and challenging reality of navigating both local and national scepticism of external interventions and barriers to programming in certain no-go policy areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porous boundaries between licit and illicit economies complicate programming.&lt;/strong&gt; Donors may find that focusing on behaviours rather than national-legal definitions of crime and terrorism is more sensitive (and relevant) to local understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust deficits must be overcome to facilitate meaningful community engagement with, and ownership of, donor programming.&lt;/strong&gt; Distrust and social fragmentation may limit the efficacy of external interventions, highlighting the need for donors to address this trust deficit through consistent engagement to better mobilise community buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disconnect between local and national/international understandings of insecurity in northern Nigeria needs to be addressed.&lt;/strong&gt; Poorly informed responses risk neglecting local realities, discounting community perspectives and overlooking informal structures of governance and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions should be integrated and cross-cutting,&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that different lines of effort are mutually reinforcing and commensurate with the system-level problems they are tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress is hampered by minimal political appetite for reform, which can limit donor agency to enact change.&lt;/strong&gt; Incremental reform along with support for political, institutional and civic islands of integrity may yield more success than the exogenous imposition of anti-corruption initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria faces several “security conundrums”, from petty graft and organised crime to recurrent resource competition, separatism, sectarianism and extremism. Although the full scope of local violence is often difficult to quantify, at least 350,000 deaths have stemmed from successive insurgencies across the north since 2009, while hostilities between herders and sedentary farmers have displaced over 300,000 people along the country’s “Middle Belt”. Amid “scorched earth” tactics, vigilante violence and the profusion of ethnic militias, studies suggest inter-communal tensions accounted for six times the number of civilians killed by the Islamist outfit Jama’tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS, popularly known as “Boko Haram”) and its various offshoots in 2017. In the northwest, banditry has reportedly surged by 731%, surpassing the fatality rates of more “conventional” conflicts afflicting the northeast between 2018 and 2023. Over the past year, escalating insecurity – including abductions and extra-judicial killings – shut down three local government areas (LGAs) in Zamfara alone, with 700,000 residents fleeing their homes. Against this backdrop, 33 million Nigerians (roughly 15% of the population) now face food shortages, while the army is having to assume a “policing” role across all 36 federal states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the scale and urgency of this crisis, policy is not always seen as reflecting or directly addressing local realities, needs or concerns. While insecurity tends to affect those on the social and geographic fringes most acutely, their perceptions and experiences are rarely captured in empirical datasets, which can leave decision-makers overly reliant on elite assumptions. Drawing on fieldwork across multiple states, this report attempts to alleviate these gaps, examining bottom-up perspectives of Nigeria’s threat landscape – including organised crime and terrorism – to better inform national and international responses. This primarily involves unpacking sources of insecurity as determined by local stakeholders themselves, examining their mechanics, resonance and impact on host communities, and how, in some cases, they may be seen to diverge from state and national government priorities or from donor interests. Such insights offer valuable entry points for interrogating the broader mechanisms that feed into, and facilitate, violence. While discrete forms of insecurity have their own thematically and spatially defined drivers and dynamics, they coexist within a shared social ecology, a wider system conducive to violent mobilisation. Simply put, they are different symptoms of the same wicked problem, the scope and complexity of which needs to be acknowledged and factored into programme design and policy formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how this environment diminishes trust in formal governance, diffuses and normalises violence, and propels social fragmentation is therefore essential for assessing local experiences of insecurity, identifying plausible pathways of change, and developing intervention strategies. Accordingly, this report examines the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are organised crime, terrorism and other forms of insecurity perceived and experienced at the local level in Nigeria?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the mechanisms conditioning local insecurity?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the implications for interventions by national stakeholders and foreign donors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis primarily draws on participant insights, while integrating existing literature where possible, to caveat and contextualise claims and situate grassroots experiences within the wider evidence base. This is followed by recommendations for policymakers and practitioners focusing on how they can adapt their approaches to better address insecurity at the subnational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is part of a broader three-year project, “Organised Crime, Terror, and Insecurity in Africa” (OCTA), exploring local perceptions of these issues across several case study countries, including Nigeria and Mozambique. These states all face significant problems with organised crime, terrorism and related security concerns, share challenges in responding to such threats (for example, limited resources and corruption vulnerabilities), and have been large recipients of foreign assistance and advice. The project’s contribution is to complement conventional, top-down notions of insecurity – which generally privilege government and donor perspectives – with bottom-up efforts that harness local knowledge, provide a holistic appraisal of the security landscape and contribute to more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Methodology, Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is based on research managed between February 2022 and January 2024, which included an in-depth review of open-source literature and country-based fieldwork to gauge different aspects of the security context in northern Nigeria. Three partner organisations – Conciliation Resources (CR), Hope Interactive and Unified Members for Women Advancement – conducted key informant interviews (see Table 1) from August to November 2023, gathering grassroots perceptions of insecurity across three states – Borno, Yobe and Kaduna – alongside supplementary input from stakeholders in Abuja. Although planned research in Zamfara was suspended due to safety concerns, the team was able to draw on existing analysis supplied by a local academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were selected using the partners’ existing networks and familiarity with the field sites, drawing from various communities based on their knowledge of local security issues. This included Nigerian civil society organisations (CSO) and NGO representatives, delegates from different social and youth groups, traditional and religious leaders, local officials, security personnel (including military and police), academics, journalists, businesspeople, vendors, union workers, and other actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NahQm93.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Overview of Interviews Conducted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outset, efforts were made to avoid imposing reductive, externally constructed understandings of insecurity, with researchers providing a series of open-ended questions to flesh out a picture of local perceptions. Participants were asked to describe the main forms of insecurity in their locality, the type of actors they identified as responsible for insecurity, those actors they considered to be the main providers of security and the characteristics of these different individuals or groups. Researchers focused on how respondents viewed organised crime, terrorism and other expressions of insecurity, but particular care was taken to ensure initial questions did not lead with these terms. The findings were refined via a verification workshop hosted by RUSI and CR in Abuja in January 2024, integrating a mix of local practitioners, government representatives, civil society delegates and regional experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By collecting data across three case study contexts, and drawing on supplementary data for a fourth locality, the project sought to prioritise depth over breadth. Its analysis does not cover every form of insecurity across a state as large and diverse as Nigeria, concentrating instead on specific hotspots in the northeast and northwest. However, by combining interview-based research in areas afflicted by chronic instability with wider political-economy analysis, the project identifies trends and patterns that may also be relevant across other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most discussions with officials and civil society organisations were conducted in English, many other stakeholder engagements featured a mix of local languages and dialects (Hausa, Kanuri, Fulbe and Karekare). Extensive notes were taken, but data collectors did not produce full transcripts (based on audio recordings) due to security concerns. As a result, participant input may be paraphrased in places, but the authors have attempted to cross-check and corroborate the meaning where relevant. In light of the sensitivity of the topic and the potential risks involved, all participants have also been anonymised. Finally, references made to donor perceptions, narratives and interests help to supplement and contextualise local perspectives and experiences, but should not be seen as an exhaustive appraisal of external or national interventions, which would go beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the data is organised into three chapters. Chapter I disaggregates key sources of insecurity as viewed by community-level participants, examining their mechanics, resonance and impact; the factors potentially shaping these experiences; and, where relevant, perceived discrepancies between the priorities of local, national and international stakeholders. This is contextualised within secondary literature to help to interpret respondent feedback in relation to the existing evidence base. Chapter II explores the mechanisms conditioning these examples of lived insecurity, assessing how they fit within a wider system of violence and instability. The report concludes with a series of policy implications and recommendations for government and donor approaches, suggesting improvements for how they collectively respond to violence in northern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-local-perceptions-of-insecurity&quot;&gt;I. Local Perceptions of Insecurity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines local perceptions of Nigeria’s threat landscape, drawing on interview data from community networks across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna to gauge the mechanics and impact – whether real or imagined – of different forms of violence, while also considering any juxtaposition with established donor and governmental narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the modalities outlined below offer a snapshot of sentiments across three specific states and should not be treated as a comprehensive or entirely representative reflection of national realities. These findings are subject to environmental sensitivities, personal proclivities, imperfect knowledge and political interests, resulting in an authentic, but inherently reductive, interpretation of lived insecurity across particular moments and spaces. At the same time, Nigerian social discourse and its attendant assumptions are often conditioned by what Andrew Walker calls a “continual crisis of epistemology”, with information refracted (or filtered) through informal associations and ethnic affiliation rather than “reliable institutions of record”. According to Walker, “how one knows something … [consequently becomes] as much to do with who you are, as what it is”, leaving the veracity of local claims sometimes hard to discern. Given the importance from a programmatic and policy perspective of appreciating how rumour and supposition can have a material effect on Nigeria’s social relations and the viability of external engagement, efforts have been made to corroborate, caveat and contextualise these (sometimes competing) narratives within the wider literature where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;violent-extremism&quot;&gt;Violent Extremism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite almost two decades of counterinsurgency across Nigeria’s northeast, and claims that Boko Haram had been “technically defeated” in 2015, extremism – in its various guises – remains a widespread concern among respondents, especially for those in Borno and Yobe. While their modality, distribution and intensity may fluctuate, rampant levels of violence – such as suicide bombings, sexual abuse, kidnappings, arson, looting and assassinations – persist, with descriptions of sundry attacks against military instillations and civilian targets, from “mosques, markets and motor-parks” to clinics, schools and telecommunication infrastructure. Abductions, “mass-casualty” events, and the burning of villages appear routine, perpetrated by “swarms” of young men traversing Borno’s scrubland on cheap Chinese motorcycles. Media reports substantiate these accounts, cataloguing “almost-daily” incidents as militants “roam the countryside with impunity”: deploying drones and makeshift roadblocks, raiding hospitals, and employing hit-and-run tactics. At the same time, local interviewees maintain that “tax-tortion” – whether in the form of cash (naira and/or CFA francs), cattle, crops or fish – continues unabated, occasionally elicited under the rubric of “Zakat” or “Jizya” (protection levies on non-Muslims), but more often coaxed via blackmail or intimidation. As one resident summarised: “most people in the northeast have had to contribute something to [Boko Haram] … just to be able to keep on their way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there have been important shifts in the insurgency’s scope, tactics and disposition over time, with several respondents distinguishing between metropolitan and rural experiences. Originally drawn from a cluster of youth gangs and dissident sects in the provincial capital of Maiduguri, Boko Haram’s complexion and capabilities have continually fluctuated in response to internal politics and exogenous pressures. Mohammed Yusuf’s “imaginary state within a state” – a network of Sharia courts, religious police, businesses and rudimentary social services – differed from the hijrah (migration) characterising offshoots like the “Kanamma Commune” (later dubbed the “Nigerian Taliban”), and its rustic enclave in Yobe. This early (and legal) incarnation of Boko Haram – the Yusufiyya – was effectively a “counter-elite” enmeshed in the city suburbs, able to “swim with Maiduguri’s social currents” and exploit highly localised grievances. Its cosmic tropes and radical ideology – an aberration of mainstream Salafism – were similarly considered an “urban phenomenon”, diverging from syncretic forms of Islam popular in the “bush”. Additionally, despite widespread notions of almajirai (Quranic students with an apparent “lack of marketable skills”) – forming much of its initial membership, the group’s profile was fairly diverse (if oppidan), attracting a small minority of secondary school graduates and university dropouts alongside the occupants of satellite shantytowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a violent security crackdown in 2009, the extrajudicial killing of Yusuf himself, and destruction of the Ibn Taymiyyah Centre (Boko Haram’s first nucleus), the movement – reassembled under the leadership of Abubaker Shekau – conducted a spate of assassinations across northeastern municipalities, targeting military officials, religious authorities, and politicians affiliated with the ruling All Nigeria Peoples Party. Often concentrated in impoverished, ethnically mixed and “poorly serviced” neighbourhoods – such as Bulumkutu, Bulabulin and Gomari – these patterns indicated both a “well-developed” web of informers and a focus on “settling local scores”. Gradually, however, reports referenced a surge in robberies, prison breaks and attacks on so-called “immoral spaces” – churches, bars and schools – across Maiduguri, Potiskum and Damaturu. Violence seemingly increased in proportion to “military repression” and assumed a “less discerning and [ever-] more brutal” methodology marked by bombings in Jos, Kano, Kaduna and Abuja (including strikes on the Federal Police headquarters and UN building in 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of emergency measures accelerated this diffusion, exporting instability to the countryside. Establishing safe havens across the Sambisa Forest, Gwoza Hills, Kirenowa and Guijba, the group raided “garrison towns” and local outposts, opting to coerce compliance from a “wary peasantry” and exercise “semi-territorial control” in areas vacated by Nigerian security forces. The transition from street thuggery to rural insurgency probably accounts for a concurrent “surge in civilian fatalities” – the Global Terrorism Database catalogued 1,153 incidents between 2012 and 2014, the majority featuring soft targets and private property – as well as “Boko Haram’s … growing reliance on conscription and monetary compensation to replenish its ranks”. In many cases, jihadist governance became synonymous with “wanton destruction and plunder” – abductions, sexual violence, cattle rustling, extortion, vandalism and the persecution of village elders (bulamas and lawans) – although studies identify at least some variation. Across northern Cameroon, for instance, militants supposedly “spent large sums buying the support of traditional chiefs”, while Hilary Matfess describes disparate experiments in local administration, from the roll-out of Quranic schools to marriage ceremonies, food distribution, and eclectic forms of pseudo-civic largesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic and scale of coverage shifted again, peaking between 2013 and 2015 with complex attacks on military bases and the capture of several urban centres including Madagali, Bara, Banki, Mubi, Gwoza and outlying districts of Maiduguri. Spanning a region roughly the size of Belgium (encompassing 70% of Borno and tracts of Yobe and Adamawa), this new polity – “Boko Haram Land” – reflected both a concerted attempt at “state-building” – imitating the language, aesthetic and iconography of the Islamic State – and a fragmentation of the group’s internal structure. Beneath a general increase in violence – responsible for approximately 20,000 deaths in 2014 alone – experts cite territorial expansion as driving the proliferation of different cells led by “emirs” with “very little relationship to one another”. Those along the Lake Chad shoreline, for instance, appeared far more “commercially oriented” than franchises further south, offering a precursor to later splits between Islamic State West Africa (ISWAP) and a rump outfit – using the JAS moniker – under Shekau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Multi-National Joint Task Force’s intervention in early 2015, accompanied by the further mobilisation of local militiamen, Boko Haram’s statelet quickly contracted. The corollary seemed to be a precipitous (if temporary) decline in fatalities – 2,000 people per year were killed between 2016 and 2018, a fifth of casualties in 2015 – with operations largely confined to Sambisa, Gwoza and marshlands around Lake Chad. These assessments chime with feedback from interviewees, which drew a sharp contrast between the comparative stability of downtown Maiduguri – “the situation … is now probably as good as it has … been in the last 10 years” – and the ongoing vulnerability of “hard-to-reach” LGAs such as Damboa, and tumbuns (islets) across Lake Chad itself. Although residents can “move … freely” and no longer experience “bomb blasts [or] open killings” in the city centre, the security context remains “dynamic”, with insurgents intermittently cutting off road access and necessitating “military escorts” for commuters. Others referred to kidnappings, car thefts and ambushes along major highways, particularly the Maiduguri–Nganzai–Monguno axis, with spikes evident during the rainy season. The introduction of so-called “super-camps” – fortified urban strongholds – exacerbated these issues, reducing much of the northeastern interior to a “no-go” subsidiary of Boko Haram’s “protection economy”. As Jean-Herve Jezequel and Vincent Foucher corroborate: “African armies and their allies were often unable to restore security in the countryside … civil servants could or would not follow the military into insecure zones, leaving vast areas run by skeleton administrations and few, if any, public services”. Against this backdrop, interviewees described widespread taxation via “fake” or improvised checkpoints, with accounts from northern Yobe, including Yunusari and Yusufari, citing specific demands for “new naira” (so fighters could replace outdated notes and foreign currency). Reporting from Zabarmari offers a similar vignette, with subsistence farmers reliant on “peace-deals” (and accompanying payment schemes) to work their rice fields, which left them susceptible to extreme, often unpredictable violence. Ironically, reductions in aggregate levels of conflict have compounded the problem, enticing rural internally displaced persons (IDPs) – loggers, herders and fishermen – to return home, and thereby expose themselves to renewed forms of harassment and intimidation. Others have allegedly been compelled by state authorities and local “big men” who are keen to project a sense of normality, precipitating massacres in far-flung villages like Mafa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Boko Haram – as a messy constellation of sub- and splinter groups – continues to be seen as a dexterous, highly resilient insurgency, despite the impact of military attrition, internecine fighting, and defections via Operation Safe Corridor (a government-run demobilisation programme). At the same time, respondents acknowledged rural “hardships” and “dwindling food supplies” stemming from the conflict, with many communities “too scared” to cultivate outside the perimeters of nearby military bases. Disrupted harvests, poor yields, seed shortages, shock pricing, the lack of mechanisation and adaptive practices, and limited access to provincial markets or water-points have in turn accelerated a collapse in agricultural output, leaving 3.8 million people across the northeast facing starvation. Accentuated by longstanding ecological stressors, several interviewees tied this malnutrition to a concerted rise in local crime rates, reflecting a vicious cycle of vulnerability shaped, but not defined, by violent extremism (VE). As one resident summarised: “food insecurity, increases in poverty, population growth, … lack of jobs and unemployment. These were … issues [that] drove the insurgency in the first place, but the insurgency has only made … these things worse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-understandings-of-culpability&quot;&gt;Contested Understandings of Culpability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fixation on terrorism in Borno and Yobe, many participants were vague about notions of agency and culpability, conflating rival outfits – JAS, ISWAP, Lakurawa and Ansaru – under a generic “Boko Haram” label or lumping them together as those “in the bush”. While not universal, these ambiguities are analogous with past studies, which preface that “[national and international stakeholders] had opinions [on the nature of VE] … often at variance from one another”. As Walker acknowledges, “the experiences of Boko Haram are so [diverse] that it has led to general confusion over what they actually are”. Inherent methodological issues offer a partial explanation (for example, security restrictions, limited trust, self-censorship or insufficient sampling). The realities of a congested, highly unstable social ecosystem may also be to blame, as appellations are adopted, imposed or shed when expedient, and the membership of different groups remains fairly fluid. Stig Jarle Hansen similarly cites an early propensity for “inflating attacks supposedly conducted by Boko Haram but [really] committed by local strongmen and conflict entrepreneurs”, leaving the insurgency a convenient branding exercise for eclectic actors and interests. Crucially, many of these narrative “genres” are partisan and identity-based; a form of mythmaking “repeated in … echo chambers … until eventually so many people believe it that it becomes – functionally … true”. The result is a contentious, heavily politicised information environment, one criticised for being “big on speculation, short on evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, several respondents nevertheless identified important discrepancies in the behaviour and approach of different conflict parties, which seemingly conditioned how communities navigate, and interact with, competing conceptions of militant authority. Some, for instance, described JAS as comparatively “aggressive”, killing “indiscriminately” and relying on kidnappings to compensate for the lack of new recruits (and closure of rural banks). Such accounts align with the wider literature, suggesting the group “rarely prioritised the provision of [local] services” under (or after) Shekau and made “no [real] effort to [offer] a vision of a future society or concrete benefits … [to secure] public support”. With little investment in administrative structures or attempts to “win over hearts and minds”, JAS lacked the institutional capacity (and inclination) to rule beyond intimidation, “control, and compliance”. At the same time, Shekau’s hyper-extreme interpretations of al-wala wa-l-bara, takfir, and ghanima left a narrow “constituency” incapable of sustaining populist strategies common among other Salafi-Jihadist organisations. As Michael Nwankpa and Abdulbasit Kassim argue, JAS is more akin to the socially insulated “personality cult” of Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army, relying on forced conscription, coercion and spoils to offset the immaturity (or absence) of its state-building project. Following the collapse of hideouts in Sambisa, and Shekau’s death in 2021, these dynamics have persisted, with loosely coordinated cells acting like “roving bandits”. As one interviewee summarised: “they are ignorant, many of them don’t even know what the caliphate is, they don’t understand politics or governance systems”. Another respondent elaborated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think it is about jihad anymore. A lot of the fighters … were drawn into it not because of ideology but opportunity. That opportunity has [reduced] as the group weakened … the remnants don’t have any … aim, they are just … looting … for survival … This is criminality under the label of a terrorist group, [but] it doesn’t make them any less dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a third stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;constant attacks by ISWAP and the security forces … have left [JAS] with no options other than to resort to basic criminality like theft, kidnap-for-ransom, and armed robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, ISWAP was considered more “predictable”, prioritising operations against the Nigerian army over the persecution of local Muslim populations. Multiple respondents claimed “[Islamic State]-controlled areas are better … [they] are still trying to recruit people through indoctrination, … trying to get people to join them”. Drawing on statistics from the Global Terrorism Database, Edward Stoddard shows clear disparities in coverage and casualty rates, with 61.4% of attacks up to mid-2021 focusing on military and police targets and only 27.4% launched against civilians, an almost perfect inversion of those perpetrated by JAS. Studies indicate the “trappings of an IS-Central like aspirant pseudo-state”, with the group mimicking a manhaj approach to “provisionary governance” and “eudaemonic legitimation”. Having centralised much of its decision-making, ISWAP’s day-to-day activities appear comparatively “rational” and bureaucratic, allowing greater consistency in the supply of education, healthcare, judicial mediation, price-capped goods, and protection from bandits and “corrupt officials”. This is not to imply a benign form of civic management or cohabitation – numerous reports recount massacres of communities blamed for contravening the group’s strictures – but a concerted effort to co-opt and consolidate, wielding taxation as a “technology of rule”. In contrast to the “sectarianism and predatory violence” of “parent and parallel organisations”, ISWAP has purposefully enmeshed itself into the mainstays of Lake Chad’s economy, from farming and fishing to pepper cultivation. Digging wells, disseminating fertiliser, creating provincial “councils”, preventing cattle rustling, resolving disputes and reviving lapsed policies – like distributing micro-loans – all enable insurgents to maximise (and exploit) regional trade as a sustainable basis for their financial model. This comes with collateral benefits – such as basic services, security, mobility and land access – which are attractive to residents starved of any real alternatives, meaning conformity should arguably be understood as a coping mechanism rather than a signal of wholesale support. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests ISWAP has developed a far more symbiotic relationship with its host population than JAS, extracting rent from households that in turn profit from a relatively stable commercial environment, while avoiding the “excesses” of Nigerian security forces. As a result, locals may have (incidentally or deliberately) acquired a stake in the group’s success, leaving it increasingly difficult to “dislodge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where “virtually all violence” has become homogenised under the “Boko Haram umbrella”, these are nuances with profound implications for how extremism is perceived, navigated, and sustained among the grassroots. Making the case that terrorist organisations are not monolithic, Alex Thurston, among others, emphasises the importance of disaggregating between local experiences of militancy to ensure that interventions respond to the motivations, strategies and social dynamics conditioning jihadism across different areas. This is easier said than done – especially given the discrepancies in language used between policymakers and local stakeholders, and within communities themselves – but remains essential for the relevance, resonance and performance of national and international approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banditry&quot;&gt;Banditry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VE (largely) relegated to peripheral townships or the “bush”, public and governmental attention has gradually shifted on to other forms of insecurity, most notably “banditry”, a “composite crime” (encompassing cattle rustling, kidnap-for-ransom, blood minerals, extortion rackets, pillaging, and sexual and gender-based violence) proliferating across the northwest and stretches of north-central. Incidents have risen from 124 in 2018 to 1,031 in 2022, conducted by itinerant, heavily armed gangs strung along the margins of Kaduna, Sokoto, Katsina and Zamfara. Echoing accounts from other interviewees, a youth leader explained: “[they] invade communities openly and kill people recklessly, they forcefully take their victims … into the thick forest … They can attack you on the road, in the community, on farms, or at school”. Mounted on motorbikes (okadas), the mobility, weaponry and (amorphic) pathology of these groups have induced widespread fear across communities, with claims gunmen “can reach anywhere … whenever they want” and “kidnap at their own discretion”. Acknowledging the scale of hostilities, one vigilante admitted “there is no day that you don’t hear of a bandit attack … we are doing our best, but it is out of control”, while another respondent suggested up to “80% of [their neighbourhood] had been destroyed”. Even politicians are reportedly “lobbying airlines to add flights … from Abuja” so they can avoid taking federal highways. Crucially, the coverage seems to have diffused across rural and urban areas alike, adapting to (and creating) new forms of social upheaval. One security stakeholder said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People moved to the villages to escape [banditry], [but] then it followed them there, so people moved to towns, only for attacks to them reach there. Now it is … possible in the big cities – Kaduna and Zaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They threaten the whole of the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its intensity, the actual dynamics of this “epidemic” remain contentious, due in part to donor fixations on jihadism (and a related lack of empirical data for other iterations of violent behaviour) and the ephemerality of “banditry” itself. Regional instability is not new – armed robbery has afflicted trans-Saharan caravan routes since the early 1900s – but the breadth and commercialisation of recent violence does appear distinctive. In the past decade, disputes over wetlands, grazing rights, ecological pressures, and the ready availability of firearms (particularly after Libya’s collapse in 2011) have seemingly led to increasing resource competition between Hausa farmers and Fulani herders in localities like Igabi. Crucially, these tensions coincide with long-held views of pastoralists as social “outsiders” and “settlers” in the northwest (colloquially dubbed the “Wild Wild West”), where nomadic communities are often among the “poorest inhabitants” of the most deprived areas, with limited access to schooling or employment. They also have little clout over policymaking, with land reforms in favour of sedentary practices and infrastructure projects coming at the expense of Fulani hamlets and cattle tracks. Accentuated by bureaucratic mismanagement and the institutionalisation of “autochthonic” policies, herdsmen have arguably been forced into “pursuing alternative means” to survive, with some taking up arms to protest their “conjugated oppression”, occasionally through brigandage. Importantly, while this is one symptom of a far wider crisis involving inter-communal violence across Nigeria’s Middle Belt (much of which lies outside the bounds of this research), interviewees from the three focal states generally interpreted such issues through the specific prism of banditry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marked by a profusion of “self-defence” militias (such as Yan Banga, Yan Sa Kai and Kato da Gora) and so-called “jungle justice”, these cycles of conflict have gradually assumed an ethnic flavour, with popular anxieties around “indigenes’ rights” – spurred on by elite demagoguery – leaving many residents preconditioned to blame Fulanis for latent social problems. Several interviewees from Kaduna, for instance, used “bandit” and “Fulani” synonymously, reflecting a wider conflation of pastoralism and criminality in Nigeria’s civic discourse. However, the threat also seems to “defy neat categorisation”, with a patchwork of 80 to 120 different gangs, mostly based in Zamfara, displaying their own tactics, behaviours, and motivations. As James Barnett and Murtala Rufai argue: “[they] do not constitute … a coherent insurgency of any sort”. In some cases, chauvinism, kinship and social solidarities were salient in attracting young nomads and co-ethnic “outsiders” from Mali, Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Cameroon. Elsewhere, clans neither spoke Fulfulde (a common dialect among Fulani communities) nor had any compunction in attacking one another, with polyglot support drawn from Berbers, Tuaregs, Kanuri, Kanembu and Yedina. Despite genealogical ties to the pastoral economy, banditry is not exclusive to, nor necessarily a symptom of, pastoralism itself, but involves an assortment of occupational and ethnic groups, many of which deliberately target local herders given their liquidity and geographic vulnerability. In reality, the operative logic of these militants often seems pecuniary, incentivised more by “profit, personal enrichment, and money-making” than any clear or consistent sense of identity and/or ideology. As a security official summarised: “[they] are not religiously inclined and don’t have a political programme or ambition as a collective”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their modes of accumulation similarly vary, depending on circumstance, context and the idiosyncrasies of specific Kachalla (leaders). While livestock raiding was previously considered a seasonal (and sustainable) staple of pastoral culture and rural masculinity, its scope rapidly expanded after 2011, emerging as an organised, highly industrial enterprise. For example, reports reference a surge in “black cattle markets” (selling illicit stock at cut-rate costs) across Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara, tied to complex supply chains that reached outlets in Ibadan and Lagos, middlemen along the border, and dealers in Benin and Niger. Falling beef prices, depleted herds and widespread displacement have, however, diminished these margins since 2019, with Kingsley L Madueke and others noting that the largest cattle owners across the northwest are now bandits themselves. This likely explains interviewees’ (almost exclusive) preoccupation with abductions, as militants have sought to diversify their revenue streams. Official figures claim 16,016 people were kidnapped in Zamfara between 2015 and 2022, with incidents rising by 1,498% over a seven-year period, although the actual numbers are likely higher given chronic levels of under-reporting. Originally focused on specific individuals, mass attacks have become increasingly common due to their greater leverage and pay-outs, conditioned, in part, by gendered dynamics, as interviewees acknowledged. One stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once they attack, they will kidnap lots but also kill people. From my understanding, they will [usually] kidnap people they think are easy targets, who won’t pose much resistance, so it is often women or children … they are more likely to kill men, particularly active aged men they may think are a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second respondent indicated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their main targets [are] those that they can get money from … they target women and children because they are easier to take, but also because the men normally control the money and so can get the funds to [cover] the ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Men can be killed as they are viewed as a potential threat, but they can also be kidnapped. Women and children are kidnapped, raped and taken hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad trends may be discernible – high profile, targeted abductions appear to be more typical in metropolitan settings or transit hubs, whereas “opportunistic raids” characterise outlying roads, schools, communes and remote villages – but the modalities are flexible. Bandits collaborate with local informants in certain areas, and rely on overwhelming force – including “gun-trucks”, “large numbers” and indiscriminate seizures – in others, with participants recalling repeated “invasions” of the same villages across Kachia, Kajuru and Chikun. Elsewhere, they have reportedly ventured into goldmining, imposing “protection fees” on concession companies, setting up their own operations, or appropriating land and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although much of this activity was interpreted as predatory and extractive, past studies also present examples of rent-seeking behaviour that have almost become “proto-statal”, with “criminal sovereigns” assuming “responsibility for security, arbitration, and the means of production”. James Barnett, for instance, cites figures like Dogo Gide, a notorious Kaduna kingpin, “regulating farming through neo-feudal sharecropping arrangements”, while another, Kachalla Bello Turji, “builds mosques” and “dispenses harsh justice against petty criminals”. In Zamfara, so-called “coupeurs de routes” or “road-cutters” not only act as highwaymen but have launched their own shuttle services, exploiting (self-induced) instability to monopolise local trucking and transit markets. Of course, these anecdotes do not necessarily contradict respondent perceptions, as they depend on, and are regulated by, coercion. Additionally, any experiences of incipient “governance” are clearly disparate, parochial and small-scale – akin to the eccentricities of what Mancur Olson calls “stationary bandits”, where groups “stop roaming and start erecting tax infrastructure” in exchange for public goods, rather than a coherent political project. Crucially, however, they also allude to a heterogeneous landscape in which militants can, at times, be seen to either offer a more plausible and immediate form of security than the state itself or compel residents into agreeing bilateral “peace pacts” (that ignore the state entirely) as a means of mitigating local brigandage, as a police officer conceded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Villages outside town do make payments to bandits … it is not so much about providing security but … ensuring they are not attacked. [They] view it as necessary for their survival … during harvest season you will see that they pack away some of the crop in lieu of financial payment. I know that some families have also married their daughters to the families of people in the bandit groups in the expectation that connection will guarantee their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation, even as a coping mechanism, can reinforce the exclusion and persecution of suspect communities, particularly rural herdsmen who are assumed to be complicit in bandit activity given their need to traverse and occupy the same spaces – leaving vulnerable constituencies trapped in a cycle of intimidation and incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-banditterror-nexus&quot;&gt;A Bandit–Terror Nexus?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the plurality of “loose, opportunistic … and adaptive” bandit networks continuously splintering or subsuming one another, clear linkages with violent extremists are hard to determine. Government officials, donors and regional commentators often express concern over a possible “jihadisation of banditry” in the northwest, mimicking familiar methodologies used by Al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates across the Sahel, and creating a “land-bridge” between discrete VE insurgencies. At the same time, the scale of violence and insecurity has already precipitated legislative and policy changes, with federal authorities enhancing security coverage and proscribing gangs such as Yan Ta’adda and Yan Bindiga as terrorist organisations – meaning law enforcement does not have to “catch” members committing specific “acts”, as any association with these outfits is now an offence. But the realities of this relationship are murkier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extant evidence, and feedback from interviewees, suggest three (likely overlapping) possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disillusioned “Boko Haram” fighters are migrating northwest due to military pressures in the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a mutually beneficial connection between bandit and extremist circles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Committed elements of Boko Haram are proactively trying to establish a new cross-regional frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies describe the longstanding coexistence of brigands and VE sub-groups across northwest and north-central. Ansaru relocated its operations to Dansadau, Kwasa-Kwasa and Old Kuywello in 2014, for instance, while JAS cultivated offshoots around Kano a year later, and eventually shifted its “bomb fabricators” to Rijana, Igabi and Chikun in 2021. Interviewees have also recounted ad hoc episodes of cooperation – usually functional or mercenary in scope – related to “arms trafficking, intelligence sharing, smuggling and outsourcing … [along with] logistics, exchange of currencies, and guerilla training”. Facilitated in part by shared geography – daji ya hada su (“the forest connects them”) – much of this seemingly coalesced around specific personalities, exemplified by Adam Bitri, an acolyte of Yusuf, “teaming up” with local bandits to form a “crime–terror syndicate” across Zaria, Birnin and Gwari in 2019. That said, the “embryonic and intermittent activity of [such] … entities [often] made it difficult to [fully understand] their ideology [and] objectives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a renewed army offensive and internal feuding between ISWAP and JAS now shrinking the space available for extremists in the northeast, these dynamics may be evolving as fighters are pushed further westward. Military commanders have increasingly warned that: “jihadists and terrorists [are] infiltrateing the ranks of bandits”, and suggested “banditry is … heading towards terrorism”. Several respondents likewise outlined “creeping” signs of VE influence – “black flags”, religious tropes and cosmic imagery – transforming or acculturating criminal outfits across Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara, and leading to an apparent conflation of moral and discursive boundaries in various areas as rural thugs use “Islamic chants” to legitimise their activities or rally support. At the same time, stakeholders identified growing similarities in the tactics of different groups, with kidnap-for-ransom operations increasingly resembling Boko Haram’s methods in Chibok and Dapchi. Notably, interviewee and media testimony both repeatedly drew on the same incident – the mass abduction of 300 schoolboys in Kankara – to substantiate this point, although Al Chuckwuma Okoli and others also cite bandits downing a Nigerian fighter jet and launching complex assaults on military targets as being indicative of “audacious attacks that were hitherto restricted to insurgents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not necessarily imply convergence or capture at a corporate level, as referenced by several experts who attributed the appearance of extremist iconography to specific individuals (usually suspected migrants from the northeast) acting within, rather than on behalf of, wider groups. Elsewhere, Barnett, Rufa’I and Abdulaziz argue that the perpetrators of Kankara – a provincial gang led by Auwal Daudawa – invented a VE connection to “up the ante” in ransom negotiations, while their previous attempts to formalise a bond with JAS collapsed due to “stealing, rustling” and drug abuse. Additionally, evidence suggests bandits may recycle, imitate or appropriate Boko Haram’s rubric and symbology as a convenient way of threatening communities and raising their profile, but show limited appetite for actually “adopting a jihadist ideology or political economy”. As one study observed, the power of these cartels leaves them with “little to gain – and much to lose – by subordinating themselves to a [sectarian] organisation and its rules”, while their polycentric and volatile disposition undermines the durability of any alliance. In some cases, interviewees suggested the inverse is more apparent, with extremists displaying bandit-like tendencies. This shift is perhaps contingent on circumstance, rather than strategy, as displaced fighters become subsidiaries of local gangs or request permission to operate on their turf. As an NGO worker summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those in the northeast had the opportunity for terrorism, [and] the northwest now offers an opportunity to make money in the form of banditry. These people are used to living in the bush, know how to fight, and have a disregard for human life. So, they use it as an opportunity and flee [west].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, indications from Zamfara also allude to a parallel process of organisational outreach, with ISWAP (rather than JAS) attempting to “sell” their expertise as part of a wider effort to fundraise and facilitate access to regional smuggling routes. In contrast to arrangements in the northeast, where criminal networks are usually subservient to, or extorted by, Boko Haram’s offshoots, stakeholders also implied these “official representatives” may be explicitly instructed to abide by the rules of, and appease, their hosts, potentially reflecting a shared understanding over spheres of authority and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these evolving conflict systems, the data therefore exposes ongoing gaps in governmental and societal understandings of bandits’ organisational structure, operational strategy, and leadership, with numerous stakeholders describing their difficulty distinguishing between terrorism and organised crime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Nigeria has] myriads of violent conflicts ongoing … at the same time … it is so confusing, and many people lack the understanding to properly categorise these conflicts to identify the proper intervention to be given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this arguably reflects the fungibility of different forms of insecurities, with overlapping membership, tactics and discourse characterising VE and provincial banditry, these analogies are often context-specific and conditional. Given the heterogeneity of criminal networks across the northwest, and the jumble of cells and splinters operating under the Boko Haram umbrella, there is consequently a risk in over-extending the “terrorism” label without a sufficient appreciation for the discrete logics shaping violence across disparate areas, even if they share similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;petty-crime-and-gangsterism&quot;&gt;Petty Crime and Gangsterism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside high-profile threats such as VE and banditry, participants from Borno, Yobe and Kaduna all emphasised more quotidian concerns over the impact of gangsterism and juvenile delinquency on city life. Prosaic expressions of “urban banditry” – muggings, phone-snatching, burglary, harassment and rape – appeared common across subaltern neighbourhoods of Maiduguri, with groups of young (often vicenarian) men extorting residents and running prostitution rings. While the fear and “effects” of this insecurity were ubiquitous, respondents described particular “hotspots” of illicit activity, usually concentrated in dense, low-income districts – for example, Gwoidamgari, Bolori, Dala, Maisandari, Railway and Gwange – characterised by poor social amenities and a lack of basic infrastructure. Partially mapping on to old Boko Haram recruitment hubs, these areas were disparaged by respondents as “criminal enclaves”, with surrounding communities criticised for their apparent “complicity” in deviant behaviour. Although the specifics tended to be highly localised, interviewees offered a ready-made topography of social ills, ranging from alcoholism (in Old Maiduguri), cocaine and “Penta” injections (in Mafoni Green-House) to cheap marijuana (in Galadima), scammers and fraudsters (in Barka de Zuma), and turf wars (in the New Government Reserved Area). One security officer conceded that “it is now anathema to build or live in the outskirts as you become a target”, with other stakeholders citing “rampant” violence around the post-office, Monday Market and various bridges and bypasses. Analogous trends were supposedly evident in municipalities like Potiskum and Damaturu, with participants referencing pervasive crime rates across slumlands and outlying estates (such as Tashan Kurma, Pompomari and Nayinawa), commercial zones, water points and major roadways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be prefaced that anecdotal data may not always amount to objective reality. Like many other countries, Nigeria’s public discourse routinely frames young, impoverished and/or unemployed men as drivers of disorder and insecurity, suggesting respondents might be predisposed to blame youth culture for any infraction or social grievance. These sentiments are fed, in part, by the propensity of elites to induce “moral panic”, manufacturing so-called “folk devils” to criminalise or disenfranchise specific groups – from street children and almajirai to displaced populations, alleged drug addicts, and/or poor communities – as a means of projecting or preserving power. Although such (“gerontocratic and patriarchal”) methods of social control assume different forms and flavours, they often have a shared resonance, influencing media coverage which can in turn reshape the local imaginary. While this does not void the authenticity or legitimacy of participant input, their perceptions may therefore be conditioned by, and instrumentalised within, a wider discursive landscape that is not always substantiated by empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, many interviewees attributed neighbourhood criminality to the same structural problems: unemployment; rapid, unregulated urbanisation; deprivation; mounting living costs; and lags in education. Such dynamics pre-date Boko Haram, with officials estimating 30% to 35% of Borno’s population had already coalesced around Maiduguri by the 1990s, due (partially) to desertification and reductions in arable farmland. The demographic shifts and social tensions accompanying this “unplanned sprawl” not only undermined the ability of state institutions, or coterminous patronage networks, to satisfy local expectations but accelerated the decline of hereditary rule (in terms of moral authority and popular legitimacy) and its associated surveillance systems. The resulting lack of leadership, direction and opportunity has arguably pushed many inhabitants into the informal or (much smaller) illicit economy, with one study summarising: “[people] come to the city in search of a livelihood, the bubble burst and they realise there is nothing there. That’s when they become easy prey for militant organisations”. Successive decades of insurrection and counterinsurgency appeared to exacerbate these trends, contributing towards an (unmanaged) influx of IDPs (reportedly around 800,000 by 2014/15) and a concurrent collapse of provincial industries. As a consequence, affluent boroughs have “virtually merged with poor [given the] increasing rate of poverty even among government workers”, while numerous respondents cited the “desperation” motivating residents “to do bad jobs for a small token of money”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar conclusions were evident across Yobe, with young people considered “trapped”, or having to consort with criminal syndicates for “meaning, purpose, community and [access to cash]”. In describing the scale of urban blight, a vigilante conceded: “[households with] nothing to eat venture into criminality for survival. But [crime] also [grants] them status and meaning … it gives them a social [circle] and [a] form of power”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions shaping juvenile delinquency can subsequently be seen as a product of both change and continuity, with the cumulative effects of trauma, dislocation and violence associated with Boko Haram leading to a generation of “street children” reliant on “unconventional” coping strategies, from begging to petty crime (“stealing, shoplifting, snatching, and drug dealing”). Two law enforcement personnel summarised the problem, with the first noting that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The past ten years … have provided space for the proliferation of small arms, thereby resulting in … violent activities including … gangsterism among the youth in Maiduguri. The scourge of Boko Haram … [has] brought about near anarchy and lawlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Local] criminals are virtually an offshoot from the impact of [extremist] violence experienced over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees additionally referenced an apparent surge in substance misuse as a symptom and propellant of insecurity, framing the consumption of narcotics (or cheaper derivatives) as a convenient (and steadily normalised) way of “suppressing pain and hunger”. This remains a controversial claim, especially given chronic data deficits, the politicisation of Nigeria’s drug trade and ongoing contestation over the scope and ontology of “addiction” itself. Nevertheless, both respondents and past studies suggest the insurgency and counterinsurgency have not only supplied cover for illicit opioid sales (for example, of Tramodol, codeine and cough syrup), but continued to drive the use of cannabis, Rohypnol, Methamphetamine (colloquially dubbed “Ice”), marijuana and alcohol, alongside an assortment of crude knockoffs (manufactured from Tom-Tom sweets, soda “cocktails”, pawpaw leaves, and/or dried neem or Dogo Yaro). Initially confined to IDP camps and marginal wards like “Kaleri, London Ciki, and Shehuri North”, the problem is now seen as a “crisis within a crisis”, facilitated by militants, pharmacists, police officers and elements of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) allegedly either peddling drugs themselves or enabling their transit and distribution. The outcome is arguably a vicious circle, with Maiduguri emerging as a conduit for narco-trafficking (reportedly experiencing an increase in trade between 2012 and 2021), which has in turn fed surrounding markets and created widespread physical and financial dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, street thuggery was considered endemic, with decades of conflict lowering the practical and normative barriers to violent behaviour. While this mobilisation often takes the form of ad hoc peer-to-peer networks, coalescing or dissipating at particular moments based on need and expediency, other affiliations appear more organised. Razor gangs such as G44, G19, the Shilla Boys or the Marlians (named after the British-Nigerian singer, Naira Marley, who is not associated with the group) were described as hierarchical or cult-like, with different “clusters” or neighbourhood franchises sharing a similar aesthetic and coordinating their attacks. This raised questions over leadership: their composition may be local – drawing on a disillusioned under-class of orphans, school dropouts, road-side touters and scavengers – but several interviewees inferred a degree of top-down control, with one respondent describing “shadowy godfathers” “plying [youths] with drugs and money” in exchange for loyalty. How far such entities can therefore be understood as a proxy for elite competition, rather than an organic response to peri-urban insecurities, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these explanations allude to a permissive environment created in part by the effects of VE, local criminality cannot be solely attributed to Boko Haram or its legacies. References to despondency, social frustrations and financial pressures resemble tropes from the 1980s, as do claims of “parental negligence” and a lack of domestic supervision. Despite emphasising the moral failings of “Yaran Zamani ne” (“children today”) for example, respondent preoccupations with a break-down of the family unit reflect cultural anxieties evident in “Hausaland” for generations. Disorder has likewise been a recurrent feature of Nigeria’s prebendal politics since the late 1990s, with street gangs conjured up or rented out as accessories of electoral campaigns. Numerous studies reference the use of young men as disposable muscle, deployed to “smash … polling units and intimidate voters”, “browbeat people to attend rallies”, “fill ballot boxes”, and carry out the “errands and dirty deeds” of gubernatorial and/or federal candidates. Although disproportionately concentrated in the South-South, interviewees across Kaduna, Borno and Yobe cast this hooliganism as the latest iteration of a well-established “thug-for-hire” industry – managed, funded and occasionally armed (with rifles, machetes and makeshift clubs) by the country’s “political class” (the so-called “Ogas-at-the-top”). Governors, in particular, have a long history of “running their states like personal fiefs”, with some in the north allegedly re-hatting militiamen as “forest rangers” or recruiting muscle through government-backed “rehabilitation” schemes. Other respondents framed gangs as youth organisations or party cadres, with their leaders disguised as “chairmen” or “secretaries”. Whatever the packaging, these linkages often appear transactional and transient, with the likes of Ecomog, Yan-Kalare and Yan-Daba receiving stipends as a retainer during election seasons. However, such arrangements also have longer-term implications, with spates of impunity – and related surges in resourcing, equipment and manpower – helping to facilitate access to other illicit markets (including drug dealing, racketeering, kidnapping and, further south, oil-bunkering and piracy). The outcome of this political–criminal nexus – which Michael Bratton brands a “theatre of violence” – is not just incentivising local groups to offset (fleeting) largesse with additional income-streams, but licensing (or actively enabling) them to exercise new forms of predatory behaviour. As a CSO member summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Youths are given a lot of cash … during campaigns … this … comes easy to them and when it stops they look for avenues to continue getting easy money. This makes them organise themselves as like minds to commit crimes in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;graft-and-extra-legal-violence&quot;&gt;Graft and Extra-Legal Violence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian state has deployed a range of tactics to address these multifaceted, variable and localised forms of insecurity, yet interviews from across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna highlighted how government actors and their affiliates have both directly and indirectly served to generate instability, often through the very measures intended to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official responses to local insecurity have previously been criticised as heavy-handed and inconsiderate of the needs of recipient populations, thereby worsening conditions for many communities. For instance, the military’s ban on fishing along the Nigerian shoreline of Lake Chad due to the industry’s apparent financial ties to VE ignored the fact that “people have no alternative”. Shutting down cattle markets similarly contributed to the impoverishment of regional neighbourhoods, while motorcycle bans – intended to temper the mobility of bandit groups and insurgents – restricted residential livelihoods and pushed some into “criminal activity”. Interviewees also attributed the closure of brothels by police in Maiduguri to a concurrent increase in prostitution and crime. This failure to consider the second-order effects of blanket crackdowns highlights the state’s antagonistic response, which has shown little long-term benefit and simultaneously harmed the people such interventions were designed to serve. Violence continues in the northwest despite communication blackouts and prohibitions on livestock transportation or bike use. The consolidation of “garrison towns”, as outlined above, has likewise left rural areas unprotected and having to “contend with payment of taxes to … insurgents”, while an influx of IDPs – often as part of government relocation initiatives – has placed increasing strain on local services and resources, creating tension with host communities. Across Borno, several respondents blamed these displaced populations for surges in economic hardship, drug misuse, criminality and violence, suggesting a popular narrative that state responses have further contributed to cycles of insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed approaches, however, extend beyond poorly thought-through interventions to the active participation of government actors in insecurity- generating behaviour. The military has been accused of extrajudicial violence, including the targeted murder of male children, sexual violence, torture and the destruction of villages and crops throughout its activities against JAS and ISWAP. State-perpetrated abuses were particularly acknowledged in Borno, where respondents referenced “indiscriminate” security operations that allegedly included the “widespread” killing of “innocent people without proper investigation”. Violent crackdowns which “failed to distinguish between civilians and jihadists” in the early days of JAS were said to have propelled local radicalisation and recruitment, leaving a legacy of fear and mistrust that continues to constrain civic engagement with state security structures. This is despite improvements in community outreach and official networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic mistrust is further exacerbated by “endemic corruption” across the three focal states, which was seen as accentuating insecurity at all levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the underlying cause [of insecurity], to the politicisation of resources or lack thereof, to the allocation of resources, to the way that those resources are then even siphoned off, to turning a blind eye [to corruption] and the complete impunity in the justice system. The leadership of this state and country are culpable for the suffering of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the community level, bribes are commonly paid to receive security coverage (intensifying insecurity for deprived neighbourhoods), and at checkpoints (raising concerns that the security services are profiting from, rather than policing, criminality). This has resulted in a highly unequal provision of security, as “there [is] more … attention given to rich and official or political leaders who live in secured areas, some of who have police escorts as they move about”. Meanwhile, for those who are poor, “either you wait for escort time, if any that day, or be on your own and risk being killed, kidnapped or robbed”. Scholars note that these local modes of corruption, verging on privatisation, are partly incentivised by high-level graft – including the diversion and embezzlement of funds intended for the security services – a view shared by interviewees. Such dynamics have reportedly led to the underfunding and under-resourcing of Nigeria’s military, thereby disincentivising lawful behaviour and motivating low-level criminality to cover basic provisions and salaries. This grand corruption is embodied by the Dasukigate scandal, which saw the former Nigerian National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki accused of embezzling money intended for the procurement of arms to fight against Islamist insurgencies. Dasuki was first arrested and arraigned in 2015, with his trial most recently adjourned until July 2025. The exploitation that local people are exposed to from the security services has also resulted in the blurring of boundaries between different (in) security actors, as “people will pay at security checkpoints, at insurgent checkpoints, they will pay kidnappers, they will pay criminals to leave them alone”. This subeconomy of illicit payments means that communities are exploited on multiple fronts, compounding pre-existing issues of poverty and unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, rampant corruption appears to have entrenched Nigeria’s security services and political and economic elites in the northern war economy. Across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna, respondents alleged that politicians, government officials, businessmen and members of the police and military were collaborating with, benefiting from or actively backing armed and criminal groups, including those engaged in banditry and/or VE. This was seen as contributing to the persistence of violence and the escalation of insecurity. Interviewees warned that “lots of people have got very rich from the war” and therefore “it is now in their interest to sustain it in order to ensure the continued flow of money”. Research has echoed these claims, highlighting apparent links between various Nigerian elites, illegal mining and banditry; the military’s integration into and control over local economies; and the impact of godfatherism. Accordingly, Emeka Njoku describes the role of “shady practices by military elites in creating and sustaining an atmosphere of violence as a way of ensuring the continued rationale” for funding their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the weakness or absence of formal services has also driven the proliferation of non- or pseudo-state forces, from community militiamen to organised vigilante outfits like the CJTF. Displaying divergent levels of training, capabilities, and kit (including modern small-arms, spears, cutlasses, Dane guns and rudimentary muskets), these stakeholders were widely considered paramount in restoring neighbourhood security. Cast by many as “heroes, saviours, and champions”, interviewees emphasised the value of their “knowledge of the local landscape”, intelligence gathering capabilities, and community relationships in recapturing and holding territory (as further explained in Chapter 2). This attitude constituted a sharp contrast to local perceptions of police and army personnel. Law enforcement officers must serve in the state they are from, but were still observed to distance themselves from their local community as “they will pretend to not even know you”. In contrast, military units cannot serve in their home state and are therefore seen as outsiders that “don’t understand the community” and “discriminate against the community members”. As a result, they were generally viewed as extraneous, extractive, predatory and/or insulated from those they were ostensibly protecting. That said, such experiences remained highly localised, contingent in part on demography and geography. At the same time, the prominence of vigilante outfits has also allowed some to allegedly embed themselves in the war economy. Numerous commentators now warn that various groups are engaging in extortion and illegal taxation, sexual extortion, drug trafficking, cattle rustling and kidnapping, thereby exploiting the conflict as both security-providers and generators of insecurity. Some in northern Nigeria have also been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses including torture, rape, forced disappearances and public executions. In Borno, interviewees tentatively referenced these links, suggesting possible connections between the CJTF and JAS, and their involvement in “evil activities against community members”, and cases of vigilantes participating in “youth gangs”. As one participant summarised, CJTF members are “respected and appreciated … [but] they are also feared due to a history of impunity”. Their alleged involvement in, or collusion with, criminal networks raised concerns among respondents that elements of the CJTF may be a “potential threat to … peace and security … in the nearest future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-wider-systems-of-violence&quot;&gt;II. Wider Systems of Violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the forms of insecurity outlined in Chapter I are primarily based on community perceptions across three specific federal states. While efforts have been made to triangulate and contextualise claims where possible, they remain susceptible to the same biases and imperfections characterising all anecdotal data and do not necessarily reflect experiences across Nigeria as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these threats do not always share the same mechanics or basic logic. For instance, several experts have criticised the presumption that “criminality and jihadism naturally converge simply because both are ‘bad’”. Narratives alluding to a linear transition from one to the other – for example, that criminals are “graduating to terrorism” – similarly neglect the iterative processes defining radicalisation and recruitment, and the variation in “pathways” between discrete forms of violent behaviour. As Christopher Hockey and Michael Jones argue, the normalisation and use of violence is not always synonymous with “accepting an extremist moral system”. Conflating different illicit activities likewise assumes actors “[see] the risks associated [with joining a gang or VE fraternity] to be little different; and … equally viable logistically”. At the same time, Lauren Van Metre has described the impact of so-called “negative resilience” on whether these entities occupy the same spaces. Referencing specific neighbourhoods or “mafia-towns” in Kenya, she outlines how municipal bosses with a “monopoly on violence … viciously protect their turf”, boxing out competitors from an otherwise favourable operating environment. Barnett and others draw similar conclusions in relation to tracts of Nigeria’s northwest: “criminals can be a stubborn lot who do not necessarily turn to jihadism simply because they are Muslim and dislike their government”. Referring to rural militancy, Promise Ejiofor agrees: “there is … insufficient data to [suggest] … bandit groups intend to impose Islam on the local communities they attack. If anything, bandits [cohabit] – and sometimes collaborate – with [extremists] but both groups are, stricto sensu, not the same”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, cross-pollination is evident in certain contexts. Interviewees described youths leveraging Boko Haram as “cover” for their own activities: appropriating its branding to extort protection payments, fleece residents and facilitate cross-border smuggling. Speaking in Yobe, one elder noted: “during the [conflict], criminals started killing non-Muslim shopkeepers and stealing their goods … they would pose as [JAS or ISWAP] to exploit people because it made them more fearful”. Others reportedly arranged kidnappings to avoid satisfying debts or to resolve personal grudges by either denouncing their enemies as terrorists to the authorities, or as informants to the insurgents. Elsewhere, street outfits like Ecomog were allegedly folded into Boko Haram wholesale, including political thugs previously used to help Borno’s elite “strong-arm elections”. As Walker explains: “these men … had not been known for their Islamist dogma so much as their cultish beliefs … [but] the attraction of being able to loot and rob with impunity under the banner of Jihad … was obvious”. Alternatively, gangs in Maiduguri and smaller frontier towns have also partnered with extremists when expedient, regardless of “ideological conviction”, leaving the rank-and-file membership of such networks somewhat porous. This transactional logic cuts both ways, as militants sub-contracted violence to provincial proxies – providing “bicycles, money, computers, and weaponry” – as a means of projecting power or infiltrating government-held areas. Emphasising the nuance of local insecurity, a NGO worker summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Attacks happen under the name of Boko Haram but are actually [conducted] by criminal groups who essentially hire themselves out … for a particular [task]. It makes Boko Haram seem bigger … even if they’re miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the discursive and operational convergence, studies also identify analogies between the dynamics and demographics of crime and terrorism, especially in peripheral communities afflicted by hardship, a lack of security or basic services, a reliance on collective solidarity, and a proliferation of firearms. While recruits joining African jihadi movements are often described as uneducated and poor, this profile routinely characterises militancy of any kind. Theoretical assessments corroborate these conclusions, with Noémie Bouhana’s S5 framework suggesting the “crime–terror nexus” should really be considered a “crime–crime nexus”, given extremism and criminality are usually conditioned by similar social ecologies. The “public health model” advocated by Jonathan Challgren and others likewise finds parallels between meso-level variables (including economic deprivation and marginalisation), motivating VE alongside other social ills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining the background to the locally defined insecurities outlined in Chapter I therefore requires an understanding of the broader systems that may feed and facilitate them. Although qualitatively distinct, terrorism, criminality, banditry and extra-legal abuses can be seen as different (sometimes overlapping) symptoms of the same wicked problem. They coexist in an arena conducive to violent mobilisation, one shaped by what Bouhana calls “socialising affordances”, such as the normalisation of violence, societal fragmentation, and a lack of legitimate or effective law enforcement. These dynamics inform the “settings” where people socialise and act, framing the moral norms, rules of conduct and governing mechanisms that influence how ideas and discourse are received and internalised, such as whether polarisation and conflict are perceived as acceptable or deplorable. They are not deterministic in isolation – violent behaviour is also contingent on personal susceptibility and group selection, among many other factors – but they offer a permissive environment which is amenable to such responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Nigeria, the cumulative impact of colonial mismanagement and decades of neo-patrimonial governance have encouraged a diffusion of violence: with competing authority structures, an often exclusionary or inegalitarian social contract, and a widespread “culture of impunity” all contributing to cycles of instability. While the scope, intensity and resonance of these variables fluctuates over time, interviewee data implies that they continue to facilitate different forms of insecurity at a local level, as do the social responses to associated gaps in government reach, capacity and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is not an analysis of specific drivers, which goes far beyond the scope of this report. Instead, the following sections examine the key cross-cutting mechanisms and wider environment that enable the insecurities outlined by interviewees in Chapter I, given their important implications for practitioners and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;politicised-violence-and-institutionalised-criminality&quot;&gt;Politicised Violence and Institutionalised Criminality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The types of insecurity outlined above – gangsterism, banditry, terrorism and military brutality – are arguably products of a shared system-level problem, based in part on the formation and defining logic of Nigeria’s political economy. Colonial legacies and the agency of elites have both conflated identity politics with access, or perceived access, to public goods, as well as, at times of stress, reframed the state as a resource in itself. This has fed into an informalisation of governmental functions, a diffusion (and privatisation) of violence, horizontal inequalities and the prominence of criminality as a mode of political competition. The result is an environment conducive to various forms of illicit, often predatory, behaviour. Tracking the implications of these dynamics, and the normative conditions they foster, can therefore offer useful insights into how different insecurities are reproduced and instrumentalised at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, interviewees considered graft ubiquitous, “starting at the very top” and “eating deep into society, affecting every institution” and emerging as a symptom, propellant and inherent feature of “bad governance”. Reflecting a consensus among respondents, one union worker summarised: “[It] is not hidden; 90% of our leaders are [crooked] and that is why nothing seems to be working … poverty [is] everywhere because of corruption”. State authority, resources and access all appear commoditised, with participants casting employment, investment and police coverage as contingent on kickbacks and cronyism. Elsewhere, functionaries, NGO delegates and elders were repeatedly accused of siphoning off aid money, distributing goodies to “political affiliates” or prioritising poorly managed vanity projects. Crucially, these modalities were perceived as “systemic” – normalised to the point of almost becoming “legal” – while simultaneously hollowing out public services and local security provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In hospitals, there are no drugs or equipment; in schools there are no or few teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another also remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Diverted funds meant for provision of modern weapons [and] allowances for military personnel are embezzled by high- ranking officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a third opined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Corruption … erodes rule of law and creates [a] sense of impunity. It means money just disappears, the resources to respond aren’t there and security services aren’t effective. Security officials, the judiciary and politicians are profiteering for themselves and are complicit … [They will] share intelligence, ignore evidence, [and] let people go for a small fine. Corruption … means criminals aren’t prosecuted, so people are just released. There is little incentive to be honest, because you won’t achieve anything, and corruption creates the suffering and anger that makes people prone to violence or criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims of government malpractice and “structural rot” echo those made in the wider literature, which catalogue a surfeit of clientelism, incompetence and inefficiency. Walker, for instance, cites disparities between “apparent” and “real” education spending, with school budgets sapped by fraud, favouritism and bureaucratic opacity. Others describe how kleptocracy has fostered “billionaire judges” while leaving Nigerian officialdom “under-staffed, under-funded, and demoralised”, contributing in part towards the country’s fall from 149 to 154 (out of 180) in Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index. As Ebenezer Obadare argues, “rarely does anything get done without money changing hands. The greater the value of the service being sought, the higher the fee”. Although complaints about graft are often a “dominant discourse … in the post-colonial world” and remain a “national pastime” in Nigeria itself, it is telling how far these dynamics seemingly condition everyday “encounters, experiences, and [interpretations] of the state”, and have effectively become its very “fabric”. Crucially, every iteration of insecurity outlined above has exploited, or benefited from, analogous themes (to some degree). Boko Haram preachers regularly present their insurgency as a “radical alternative” to decadent elites in Maiduguri and Abuja; expectations of bribery are baked into the corporate culture of numerous security agencies; and bandit groups paint their activities as a form of “economic emancipation”, drawing on the frustrations of Fulani herders, or the despondency of subaltern youths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these issues enjoy a long history, with profligacy and patrimonialism having been ingrained (deliberately and incidentally) into Nigeria’s institutional anatomy from the beginning. With power understood in increasingly zero-sum terms, it is vital for policymakers and practitioners to appreciate how the country’s political economy frames, legitimises, reproduces and mainstreams such dynamics in persistent but destabilising ways. They are ultimately a product of structural arrangements working and malfunctioning at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems of corruption can be traced back to the hyper-extractive “estate states” characterising British colonialism since the early 1900s. By co-opting (or inventing) local political frameworks as a conduit for “Indirect Rule”, these modes of “imperialism on the cheap” depended on the personal tutelage of newly appointed “district heads”, which placed a “premium on … controlling sub-ordinate officials” through patronage. In the north, such mechanisms effectively became an “amalgam of continuity and change understood through the idiom of tradition”, whereby tax infrastructure from the Sokoto Caliphate was layered with various forms of Weberian bureaucracy. The imposition of a formal (and parsimonious) salary system, for instance, led to poorly paid functionaries unable to fulfil the social obligations of their role as babba mutum or “big men”, incentivising “embezzlement and extortion” as they sought to satisfy the expectations of their clients. As a result, Steven Pierce argues that this graft was not necessarily novel – the pre-colonial notion of zalunci or “oppression” drew clear connotations between prestation and “possessors of office”, meaning that emirships and their subsidiaries received goods as “tangible symbols of political position”. But the introduction of external reforms did alter the logic, scope, incentives and modalities for carrying it out, encouraging or openly facilitating the “appropriation of public platforms for private ends”. At the same time, British authorities exported, and deliberately politicised, the “charge” of corruption, selectively (and performatively) prosecuting those they “wanted to depose for other reasons”. A corollary was the creation of a “moral economy” in which “changing administrative structures both enabled material malpractices and determined the ways in which those malpractices were conceptualised and, to some extent, dealt with”. They were not a “pathological deformation” of colonialism so much as its “natural consequence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same regime also indelibly blended ideas of identity, power and property, reshaping the perceived boundaries of ethno-regional “homelands” and militarising intercommunal relations as a convenient, cost-effective method for preserving imperial authority. Some may consider Nigeria to be a paradox: a colonial confection explicitly created as a “business enterprise”, merging discrete polities (such as the Hausa, Yoruba, Delta City, and Jukun states, the Kanem-Borno empire, and Igboland) together while legislatively balkanising their demography. Policies like the “Land and Native Rights Ordinance” not only limited internal migration between (the majority Muslim) north and the (incrementally Christianising) south, but compounded educational and economic imbalances across different regions, most obviously in relation to the disproportionate investment funnelled to the port city of Lagos. Uneven, spatially determined processes of Westernisation; urban segregation via sabon gari (“stranger” or non-Muslim quarters); inflexible tenure systems; stacked police departments; tribal codification and the privileging of specific groups; and the later creation of a “tripartite federal structure” (divided between north, south and west) all fed into violent social competition. As Attahiru Jega attests, British occupiers encouraged polarisation along several lines as a means of curbing embryonic strains of nationalism, accentuating the “Muslim versus Christian, northerner versus southerner, and Hausa-Fulani versus Yoruba versus Igbo syndrome” evident today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of corruption (as “near mandatory for Nigerian officials”), local “bossism”, cultural (and institutional) pluralism, and sectional rivalries have all therefore contributed to what A H M Kirk-Greene calls a “burdensome inheritance”, with post-colonial governments recycling much the same political circuitry. In the absence of sustainable party structures or distinct ideological positions, for instance, stakeholders in Nigeria’s First Republic often resorted to ethnic sentiments and overlapping networks of clientelism as a way of building social capital and mobilising support. This does not imply such identities were innate so much as they offered an expedient vehicle for extracting largesse, effectively reducing public office to an “eatery” regulated by kinship and social affiliation. The conflation of individual and collective interests not only drove conflict between different regions, as ethno-elites allocated state contracts, jobs and development money to their “own”, but also internalised patterns of discrimination within regions, as minorities or “settlers” were either neglected or actively disenfranchised by dominant “indigene” populations. While different federal formulations (both military and civic) attempted to defuse these pressures by imposing greater consistency on the distribution of national resources (accounting for 80% of most state budgets), they also “played the unintentional role of reinforcing fundamental inequalities of citizenship”, given the majoritarian mechanics that routinely determined how goods and political power were shared at the local level. Rather than tempering inter-group friction, this reliance on state-creation and subdivision effectively merged “formal institutions … with the informal ethnic patronage networks that [many] Nigerians still trust to provide them with their best chance at upward mobility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although temporarily eclipsed by the pan-national rubric of the early 1970s, perceptions of government as an “arena of exploitation” have endured over time, ramping up with the oil boom, and later austerity measures tied to structural adjustment programming (SAP). Even the “hyper-presidentialism” of successive military regimes – featuring a top-heavy executive (nominally) able to suppress political competition – proved inflammatory, as exemplified by General Ibrahim Babangida’s coup-proofing efforts between 1985 and 1993. Offsetting the impact of SAP reforms (characterised by a hike in living costs and unemployment), and buying the loyalty of army officers, involved manufacturing new “states” (and majority groups) to dispense gubernatorial positions and petrodollars: “supercharging divisions of ethnicity, religion and regionalism” as different communities fought for their cut. By adopting consociational policies as a “short- and midterm survival strategy”, Nigeria’s “militaricians” not only “infected” federal and local governance with a predatory logic – turning institutions “to the business of [self] enrichment” – but underlined the existential value of “indigene rights” in the popular imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These legacies, and the accompanying reliance on cash and coercion they engender, continue to shape structural violence across northern Nigeria, exacerbated in part by the democratisation processes instigated since the late 1990s. With polling considered a “winner-takes-all” contest by elites and laypeople alike, profligacy and so-called “stomach infrastructure” – the satisfaction of immediate needs – have encouraged abuses and illicit behaviour (vote-rigging, intimidation, extrajudicial killings and the renting out of local gangs) to preserve (or overthrow) existing systems of “patrimonialism, prebendalism, and patronage”. Crucially, much of this electoral violence “occurs in parallel to major and long-standing armed conflicts and … large-scale communal [hostilities]”, not least because “collective memories of discrimination and grievance” enable politicians to stoke social tensions when the outcomes look unfavourable. Borno offers an instructive example. Following the accession of President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba from the southwest, in 1999, northern powerbrokers increasingly tapped into demagoguery and identity politics as a means of securing and retaining office. This included wedge issues like “full Sharia”, an expansion of religious penal codes that “many in the Muslim community [saw] … as a panacea for the complex and messy problems of social injustice, poverty [and] unemployment”. Introduced across 12 northern states in 2000 and 2001, these reforms were a partial response to greater demands for regional self-assertion, pressure from grassroots ideologues, and antipathy towards “secular” federalism. However, they also allowed a new crop of elites to exploit expressions of piety, populism, and sectional solidarity, with aspiring candidates outbidding incumbent governors by superficially maximising the remit of Islamic law. Violence and intimidation consequently assumed theological inflections, as studies document (controversial) allegations that politicians “cultivated a symbiotic relationship with Yusuf, in which Boko Haram would deliver votes through endorsement, persuasion, or force, in exchange for influencing the terms and implementation of sharia”. While these alleged linkages have been repeatedly denied by prominent officials, and, if true, quickly collapsed, the accusations allude to a wider reliance on social polarisation as a way of accessing and maintaining power, precipitating cycles of grievance and conflict that have gradually assumed a momentum of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, long-running processes of state formation continue to permit and facilitate local experiences of insecurity, in part because they produce government bodies prone to weakness and rapacity. Institutional pathologies, widespread impunity, and manipulation by political strongmen have not only sapped the army of munitions, food and equipment (as outlined in Chapter I) but have also consistently undermined the capacity of federal law enforcement (despite liberal injections of donor funding to help to improve the National Police Force’s accountability, efficiency and corporate culture). While day-to-day extortion may be as much about bureaucracy (offsetting the budget deficits of local stations and meeting quotas for promotions) as it is about individual profiteering, the end result – a normalisation of graft and subsequent loss of public trust – is the same, leaving many interviewees to criticise the state as ineffective or partisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the “rules of the game” conditioning Nigeria’s political economy rely on informal modes of patronage, exclusivity and social fragmentation that seem inherently destabilising. Competition over resource access, for instance, has arguably legitimised what Maggie Fick labels a “thug democracy”, where coercion, sleaze, bribery and “everyday” graft may not only be tolerated but actively demanded by constituents keen to preserve their slice of the “national cake”, reflecting a social morality that “trumps … notions of civic duty tied to the state or national polity”. As Daniel Jordan Smith explains, “obligations to kin … are rooted in a moral economy that privileges reciprocity, sharing, and interdependence”, effectively legitimising specific types of corruption or hankali (“good sense”) in government operations. In this context, change is not just contingent on buy-in from those “Big-Men” and “Godfathers” benefiting from the status-quo, but ordinary Nigerians reliant on “patron-client … and other identitarian relationships”, with many left “compelled, enticed, trapped and resigned to participate” in the country’s “corruption complex”. As one respondent conceded, “[we] are ourselves part of the bribery/extortion machine … making contributions and payments to survive … but also … for our [own] convenience”. When these informal distribution networks function, they are liable to become centrifugal over time, marginalising minority groups and those on the outside, and thereby driving resentment, polarisation and violence. When they fail – either due to greed, negligence or a lack of liquidity – the inability of both official and clientelistic arrangements to appease local needs cedes space for radical alternatives. In short, the cumulative systems now defining the Nigerian state appear increasingly entropic: incentivising, licensing and reproducing different forms of predatory practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-responses-and-self-reliance&quot;&gt;Social Responses and Self-Reliance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed these insecurities are not just enabled by high-level machinations or top-down prebendal politics. They also exist in an environment shaped by autonomous societal forces, particularly driven by those at the margins responding to deficiencies in government coverage and capacity. A longstanding reliance on alternative providers of protection, opportunity or empowerment – and on informal economies to sustain local livelihoods – has encouraged the proliferation of new authority structures. These eclectic methods of political organisation and self-help not only speak to an ecology marked by violence, but tend to operate outside of, or in contravention to, the state. As a result, they are liable to generate negative feedback loops that might quickly become self-reinforcing: heightening vulnerabilities, creating new grievances and opening further vectors of instability. An exposition of these factors can therefore help to better understand and contextualise the perceptions of insecurity outlined in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, chronic mismanagement and political fragmentation have exacerbated inequalities within and between regions (see Table 2), leading to disaffection and rural immiseration. Graft continues to undermine the quality of healthcare, infrastructure, and the efficacy of poverty reduction schemes. LGAs – the most proximate tier of government for many Nigerians – have “all but ceased to function”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mdeCv4w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Inequalities Between Regions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Kate Meagher summarises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Northern cities have been turned into tinderboxes where hordes of young men … face the daily indignities of economic desperation and police harassment in their struggle to get by. And every day, [they] are confronted by the lavish consumption styles of a stupendously wealthy and corrupt political elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Kaduna, interviewees acknowledged the role of these long-running grievances in the current banditry crisis, with criminal syndicates capitalising on herder “struggles for recognition” and youth “idleness and lack of ways to make money”. These conflicts are effectively a “symptom of … broader contradictions in … a postcolonial state that exploits the masses and appears incapable of protecting its citizens, of curtailing corruption and abuses, and of providing public goods to marginal mobile groups”. As a result, Ejiofor argues that “pastoralists” illiteracy, lack of education, and inability to graze [their livestock] not only contributed to their abjection but also predisposed them to armed violence in order to eke out an existence’. Brandon Kendhammer similarly suggests that other cases of sectarian strife are “steeped in the language of marginalisation and exclusion”, with studies casting Boko Haram as “the misguided cry of a disgruntled youth, crushed by the socio-economic system on the one hand and then repressed by the state on the other”. To this end, respondents referenced neglect and poor governance – amid a wider context of poverty, illiteracy and joblessness – as crucial in enabling JAS and ISWAP to gain traction by recycling a “makeshift religious [vocabulary] that [is] both anti-state and anti-elite”. Young people with no livelihoods or prospects were offered cash, status and a “way out”, while recruiters exploited heavy-handed security crackdowns as confirmation of discrimination against Nigeria’s Muslim population, weaponising local grievances and re-packaging the insurgency as a palatable alternative to authorities in Abuja. Crucially, this framing is not unique to Boko Haram but reflects the value of theology as a vernacular for resistance, protest and social change. Contemporary terrorism shares a long genealogy with past expressions of revolutionary activism across northern Nigeria, from “purifying movements” like Uthman dan Fodio’s jihad (1804–08), to post-colonial millenarianism, and the anti-Sufi firebrands of the 1960s and 1970s. Encompassing a wide spectrum of doctrine and praxis, this heterodoxy signals a “fragmentation of sacred authority”, with dissident sects drawing on popular frustrations to contest the legitimacy of societal conventions and power structures. Although JAS has gradually shifted from Salafi polemics to a more “stripped down, propagandistic style of jihadism”, and remains ideologically distinct from previous forms of religious militancy, it is arguably the latest iteration of a violent counterculture that has reshaped, acculturated and/or challenged local politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these grievances also tend to be cyclical and self-reinforcing, with chronic state failings driving insecurity, which can entrench underemployment and undereducation and thereby expose communities to additional instability and conflict. The kidnapping of schoolchildren, for example, has led to 600 school closures, and Boko Haram has reportedly killed over 2,000 teachers – further restricting service provision in the already disadvantaged north. Similarly, cattle rustling destroys livelihoods directly (through the theft of herds and violence towards those who confront the culprits), and indirectly (by co-opting licit markets and therefore undermining business for those legally living off cattle). The loss of livestock and farmers’ vulnerability to coercion, as recounted by several respondents, has also led to the abandonment of arable land, thereby “crippling food production capacities” and worsening food insecurity across northern Nigeria. Many of those displaced by the violence – around 3.3 million people across northeast, northwest and north-central – chose to relocate to urban areas, which has contributed to demographic changes that bring IDPs into conflict with host communities. This was highlighted by interviewees who felt that IDPs are worsening issues like food insecurity, rising prices and jobs shortages. As a consequence, economic pressure is concentrated on those who remain, intensified by mass displacements that put additional demand on limited resources. Across the three states, this has become a cycle of violence and deprivation, with vulnerability increasing the risk of recruitment to extremist or criminal groups, and, in turn, driving further conflict. The result is a self- sustaining ecosystem of instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other informal social responses and coping mechanisms are evident as residents have tried to mitigate local insecurities in the absence of effective government coverage. Interviews offered a glimpse into the forms this can take. One participant from Borno, for instance, highlighted how tricycle keke riders “contribute money weekly so that they can come to each other’s defence and support one another in times of need … which creates a sense of economic security and belonging”, while displaced youths “formed groups and organised … to protect themselves and obtain [the] means of survival”. In neither case was it clear if these strategies included criminality or violence. Meanwhile in Yobe, community leaders have tried to “interact with at-risk youths and provide services to them” as well as working to “promote stability through mediation and conflict resolution”. Local stakeholders have also attempted to negotiate with bandit and violent extremist groups, although such interactions often elicited a backlash, either due to their unpopularity “among the civilian population” or their condemnation by security personnel. That said, this appeared somewhat contingent on sequencing. While pre-emptive negotiations were considered illicit, post-hoc engagement (usually mediation efforts following an attack or kidnapping incident) could be implicitly encouraged by officials themselves in recognition of the government’s inability to intervene, leaving the acceptability of grassroots bargaining confused and highly circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prominence of vigilantism outlined in Chapter I provides another example, fitting into a long-running pattern of self-reliance and security management parallel to, and occasionally in conflict with, state authority. Community “defence forces” are not new – studies document numerous pre-colonial incarnations across Hausaland, including the Yan Banga (Community Protectors), Yan Baka (Hunters) and Dogarai (Palace Guards) – but the scale, capability and power of these groups have ramped up in reaction to both Boko Haram and the later profusion of banditry and organised crime. While interviewees emphasised the ability of militiamen to collaborate with official security services, many also warned that they had, in certain contexts, the propensity to usurp government bodies rendered “powerless” by “incompetence, [poor] resourceing, and rampant corruption”. Crucially, respondents claimed police and military coverage may actually be contracting as the state effectively outsourced day-to-day operations to the Kaduna State Vigilante Service, hunter groups, community police and several other outfits aggregated under the generic label “vigilante”. Nevertheless, the lack of clarity over their role and remit has raised concerns, with frustrations over the “voluntary” nature and sparse renumeration of these positions accentuating problems with accountability and discipline. Some, such as the Borno Youth Empowerment Scheme, continue to be equipped, paid and overseen by governing boards, and others like the “Neighbourhood Watch” receive monthly stipends, but most are not eligible for any support, training or wage. As a result, regulations are often “feeble” or only exist on paper, especially for those out in the rural periphery, compounding both a “sense of impunity” and a need for cash. Interviewees in each location described local contributions of money, food or other resources, casting these inputs as an expression of communal buy-in. Although originally organic and somewhat ad hoc, collection methods have become increasingly organised over time, as noted by participants in Kaduna and Yobe. The first claimed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have a committee that goes round to collect the cash and issues out receipts for the payment. The payment was a total of 3,000.00 Naira per person per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The head of every household contributes to this payment no matter their gender. This is collected by the community leader and paid to the local vigilante office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many stressed that such donations are made willingly – corroborating recent survey evidence of public support for vigilante activities – stakeholders also referenced the impact of peer pressure and social expectations. Numerous reports similarly cite shakedowns, tolling, intimidation and extortion of surrounding constituents, prompting several regions to ban voluntary mobilisation entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speaks to a broader set of tensions and contradictions characterising Nigeria’s ever-more congested security arena, where local militia groups not only tend to enjoy a privileged position among their host community but fill a gap in security provision left by federal agencies. At the same time, they exist in a liminal grey zone, simultaneously empowered and disenfranchised by the state, valued and feared by nearby residents, while collaborating with and replacing official security services. The details of these dynamics, and the dispositions of the vigilantes themselves, are highly localised, complicating top-down efforts to formalise, standardise and monitor their various functions. Nor does there appear to be a plausible framework (or political appetite) for their demobilisation. By 2016, the government had only absorbed about 500 CJTF members into the army, with another tranche “employed as firemen and vehicle inspectors” and a “sizable chunk … sent to farm with modern agricultural equipment”. Such programmes do not necessarily have the scope or financial clout to satisfy paramilitary demands for compensation and recognition, encouraging gunmen to compete with traditional powerbrokers and public institutions for “political capital and authority”, and further undermine the state’s legitimacy. As former Borno governor and current Vice President Kashim Shettmia warned: “we have created a Frankenstein’s monster”, one liable to produce new cycles of insecurity, violence and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities have also come to depend on survival economies that blur the cognitive and symbolic boundaries between licit and illicit activity, adopting fluid and sometimes incongruous ways of understanding the insecurity-generating behaviour of others (and themselves). While accounts of local complicity and cooperation with Boko Haram seemed cross-cutting in terms of scope and form – usually involving banal transactions and logistical support (from food deliveries and carpentry to vehicle repairs, transit and surveillance) – their motivation and legitimacy were more contested. For instance, interviewees highlighted that residents who offered material backing were generally not seen as terrorist sympathisers, if it was done in the course of the normal business and did not involve violence: as a respondent explained, “[complicity is] based on the damage to the community, but we usually differentiate between people who committed violence and those who provided support”. Some ascribed collaboration to improvised coping mechanisms, given the lack of formal (or effective) security provision: “people are forced [into making concessions]. They feel abandoned by the government; they have no opportunities … it is the only option for them”; “government [stakeholders are] trying their best, but they sometimes leave people at the mercy of the insurgents”. Accordingly, one participant claimed that “most people who did this were arrested as terrorist supporters … [but] we in the community didn’t necessarily view it that way”. Others suggested a more mercurial logic: “[ISWAP] has their networks … there is always someone willing to do what they need, so long as the money is right”; “they’d sell to anyone … they turn a blind eye to whom the customer is, if it might benefit them” – but often delineated between urban and rural settings. Those colluding in the “bush”, for instance, were branded “dangerous, hypocritical, or conniving”, in contrast to Maiduguri’s vendors who earned a “legitimate income” from the same activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discrepancies could, in certain cases, be part of a process of moral disengagement, enabling people to partake in illicit activities without acknowledging their own criminality. Experts described how stakeholders may only participate in specific stages of the kidnap for ransom supply chain, for instance, engaging solely in abduction, transportation, storage, negotiation, payment or “return” as a means of deconstructing their culpability. This reflects Albert Bandura’s argument that individuals can rationalise or justify harmful behaviours through the “cognitive restructuring of inhumane conduct into a benign or worthy one by moral justification … displacement of responsibility … [or] minimising the injurious effects one’s actions”. In doing so, local people can justify their behaviours in such a way that evades their collusion in the insecurity that impacts their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the parameters between licit and illicit could also be a product of wider social inequities conditioning the public imagination, which often display ethnic or gendered inflections. For example, suppliers associated with ISWAP or JAS were typically considered “normal people”, whereas the “cooks and cleaners” catering for them in the bush were “infected with the jihadist gene”, irrespective of whether they “joined voluntarily or had been coerced”. The nuances applied to one category – differentiating between local retailers cooperating out of necessity, and the profligacy of “big tradesmen” collaborating out of greed – lapsed into blanket coverage for others. This was a pattern later evident in the ostracisation of female returnees and their children. The predominantly “Kanuri” makeup of Boko Haram’s early membership – and anecdotal evidence of “non-Kanuris” being preferred for suicide missions – has likewise encouraged what Claude Mbowou calls “interpretative shortcuts”, with efforts to reframe the insurrection as a “tribal insurgency”. Much like the conflation between Fulanis and banditry, entire populations have become suspect, with Kanuri commuters routinely selected for military spot-checks and interrogation. In reality, the group’s social base has always been “trans-communal”, integrating fighters without a consistent “demographic profile”. Accordingly, Michael Baca (among others) argues that Boko Haram’s complexion should be understood as a symptom of geography – given the Kanuri are a majority in the area surrounding Maiduguri – rather than some sort of “mechanical solidarity”; the presumption of which masks a complex sociological process of recruitment that disrupts or “ruptures” established social hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these perceptions and popular understandings of legitimate and illegitimate behaviour are undoubtedly shaped, at least partially, by political, security, religious and media elites, as shown by the outcomes of Operation Safe Corridor. By imposing an overly broad inclusion criteria, the scheme tended to absorb “civilians who [had] fled areas controlled by Boko Haram” and “mistakenly categorise [them as] jihadists”, which transformed programme “graduates” from “normal people” (or those coexisting and interacting with extremists out of necessity), to “terrorists” and local outcasts. As one interviewee in Borno noted, once individuals had gone through Operation Safe Corridor, “society [had] a different perception of them, and it actually stigmatised them even more”. However, this shift also speaks to broader power dynamics, prejudices and societal polarisation, creating an audience that is not only receptive to discriminatory discourses, but in some cases is ready to externalise blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the formation and dispensation of Nigeria’s political economy has profound implications for the moral context and norms framing community perceptions and experiences. The cumulative impact of state informalisation, elite-induced identity conflict, patronage politics, and the profusion of pseudo-and non-state actors may have not only fostered a “culture of impunity” but also damaged public belief in government as a legitimate arbiter of moral authority. Evidently, this resonance is not consistent across time and place, and local conflicts are “unique” in terms of the specific “combination of forces that [fuel] them”. Nevertheless, they all manifest in environments conducive to predatory behaviour, partially facilitated by government failure and the various societal responses to those deficiencies, whether induced by survival, resistance or profit. As a result, terrorism, gangsterism, banditry and military brutality may arguably be symptomatic of the same systemic problem, even if they have their own drivers and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has highlighted, northern Nigeria faces a range of overlapping, multifaceted and cyclical crises, facilitated in part by systemic corruption, institutionalised criminality and a bottom-up dependence on various coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s responses were seen by many as slow, heavily militarised and marred by the involvement of security actors in graft and human rights abuses. State-level amnesty and disarmament initiatives seem to lack coordination and federal and local buy-in, while successive development efforts in the northeast are constrained by funding shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International approaches have similarly been criticised for their securitisation, claims echoed by a participant who warned: “the focus from the outside is on terrorism but that’s just one thing happening”. The importation of foreign templates, assumptions and norms was repeatedly cast as evidence of acute information deficits among national elites and external donors, with interviewees describing an “over-reliance” on theory, “arm-chair analysis” and generic reportage from Abuja. Perhaps tellingly, respondents rarely made any specific reference to interventions but stressed widespread cultural insensitivities and the peripherality of local CSOs in transnational humanitarian networks. While these narratives do not necessarily capture the full breadth of aid and security coverage, they imply exogenous projects may have limited reach, even across those regions receiving a relatively high proportion of resourcing (for example, the “BAY states” of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this report has sought to illuminate local understandings of these crises, and the wider mechanisms that sustain and facilitate violence. It also highlights the need for holistic programming that is sensitive to, and engaged with, the local community and which moves beyond the logic of militarised counterterrorism. Below, the report puts forward a range of policy implications and recommendations, informed by the practical suggestions from local interviewees and then by the analysis of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-recommendations&quot;&gt;Local Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions from respondents were not homogenous, and many were too broad to be immediately actionable for policymakers. For example, participants cited broad solutions such as “addressing corruption [should be] the number one priority” or “equal opportunities [should be extended to] all irrespective of tribe ethnicity and religion”. Nonetheless, the more practical of these measures highlights the willingness of local people to be involved in, and take responsibility for, catalysing change from grassroots (despite the scale and complexity of the insecurity threats that they face).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaces for dialogue and collaboration between civilians, state actors and security personnel may help to improve local confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees wanted community members to be empowered “for active participation in addressing issues and challenges facing the community” in order to “foster a sense of ownership and responsibility”. They suggested that avenues to improve “military–civilian relations”, or “peace and security committees in every community” would help to reduce tensions and keep residents informed about new policies and emerging risks, while increasing transparency. Respondents also advised that the inclusion of local stakeholders in decision-making may help to reduce vulnerability to bandit groups and other forms of insecurity by rebuilding a sense of community, eroding the distrust that has developed because of crime and violence, and strengthening neighbourhood resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community members should be engaged in anti-corruption efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees acknowledged that “corruption is for everybody to control and reduce, as it is becoming institutionalised across society”, arguing that the public tends to “provide an enabling environment”. They suggested education and sensitisation campaigns across communities, starting at a young age. Respondents also called for top-down reforms such as improved transparency, protection for whistleblowers and harsher punishment for graft among political elites and security personnel, but they wanted this to supplement bottom-up efforts to ensure a holistic, and potentially more effective, approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wider-recommendations&quot;&gt;Wider Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These more practical recommendations are often hindered by Nigeria’s broader context, with local-level insecurities existing within, and facilitated by, a wider permissive arena. The cumulative impact of neo-patrimonialism and societal responses to an unequal, predatory and inefficient political economy has diminished trust vertically (in formal governance and state actors), and horizontally (within and between communities), especially among those on Nigeria’s geographic and socioeconomic fringes. Across the focal states, these dynamics have enabled the diffusion and normalisation of violence, strengthened a culture of corruption and impunity, driven a dependency on alternative forms of security and self-preservation and eroded the social compact. The resultant insecurity ecosystem has important consequences for those seeking to identify plausible pathways for change and attendant intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such approaches must also consider two specific challenges facing foreign engagement in northern Nigeria. First, as outlined above, interviewees described how international donors have to contend with local and national scepticism of external interventions, which stems from historic and contemporary understandings of donor programming as exploitative, harmful and discriminatory. Second, they must navigate a precarious and at times antagonistic relationship with the federal state. This may manifest as the active obstruction of donor efforts, such as the Nigerian government’s 2018 suspension of the activities of UNICEF and various NGOs (amid accusations that they were failing to provide humanitarian services and supporting the insurgency). Additionally, donors are perhaps more likely to face tacit barriers, including various “no go policy areas”. Nevertheless, this report offers reflections to help to inform policy and programming. These overlapping takeaways and recommendations are indicative of the need for both the Nigerian government and relevant donors to avoid siloed programming in favour of an interconnected and mutually reinforcing approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porous boundaries between licit and illicit economies complicate programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The adoption and shedding of interchangeable identities to suit individual priorities creates an ecosystem of individuals willing to engage in insecurity-generating behaviour, complicating the landscape for donors looking to implement development and peacebuilding programmes. A focus on behaviours rather than national-legal, group-level definitions of terrorism and crime may help donors to avoid overlooking the key actors who are generating insecurity. However, the blurred lines between licit and illicit activities, and the ways in which people have navigated this for their own benefit in the context of violence and extreme economic hardship, should be considered. Doing so may help to avoid antagonising local communities, and assist donors in ensuring their programming is sensitive and responsive to local understandings and survival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust deficits must be overcome to facilitate meaningful community engagement with, and ownership of, donor programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given widespread corruption and insecurity, many local communities appear to have lost trust in the Nigerian government and its various affiliates and agencies – while also remaining suspicious of international donors – thereby disincentivising public engagement with top-down initiatives. Simultaneously, residents are wary of undertaking community-led peacebuilding initiatives, in case the government labels them as terrorist or bandit sympathisers. Meanwhile, conflict-driven fragmentation has resulted in distrust within communities. The social isolation and exclusion this engenders can limit the effectiveness of poverty- reduction efforts and can exacerbate instability – factors to which donor interventions should consider and respond. Community-led social activities have helped to erode distrust and fragmentation in other contexts of protracted conflict, and there are prior examples of programming focusing on social cohesion in Nigeria. Donors looking to replicate these will need to consider how they can be scaled, while remaining considerate of local nuance and sensitivities. Similarly, this challenge highlights the need for community engagement with, and ownership of, any donor programming focused on security sector reform. This is to ensure community buy-in and regain the trust of local people in state security services and external interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disconnect between local and national/international understandings of insecurity in northern Nigeria needs to be addressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees expressed concern that donors and the Nigerian state are often detached from realities on the ground in northern Nigeria. While some programming is built on extensive evidence, poorly informed responses risk neglecting local experiences, thereby reinforcing the disconnect between Abuja and Nigeria’s peripheries and overlooking the informal structures of governance and legitimacy on which people in many northern communities rely. This has ramifications in terms of programming, leading to the “othering of north-east Nigeria” and the propagation of Western-centric and imperialistic counterinsurgency narratives which justify a reductive preoccupation with, and acontextual application of, counterterrorism interventions and nationalised approaches to regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This exacerbates the frustrations of local people who continually see donors and the Nigerian state as failing “to look beyond terrorism” and as “addressing surface-level issues without addressing underlying causes” which “leads to temporary improvements but not long-term stability”. Moving beyond tokenistic attempts at localisation to ensure genuine community engagement with, and ownership of, security and peacebuilding initiatives is necessary. Donors and the Nigerian state must acknowledge that local people’s experiences and perspectives can meaningfully inform culturally sensitive programming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions should be integrated and cross-cutting, ensuring different lines of effort are mutually reinforcing and commensurate with the system-level problems they are tackling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The bounded typology of policymakers often results in piecemeal, parochial and short-lived efforts to address insecurity, as strategies and programmes fixate on specific issues without appreciating the wider ecology that enables, shapes and perpetuates them. To take one example, VE is typically the product of a broader conflict ecosystem, intersecting with and becoming transformed by other forms of insecurity and violent mobilisation. As Thurston argues, “organisations like Boko Haram – even if they are in dialogue with global trends – develop localised doctrines that evolve through interactions with their surroundings”. Simply put, jihadism conditions, and is conditioned by, the context it occupies. Any effective response must therefore be holistic and cross-cutting to account for this permissive environment. Strategic communication or deradicalisation programmes, for instance, may not necessarily be suitable “for a context in which most militants are not motivated by religious ideas”, while conventional disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration efforts risk overlooking differences between inter-communal drivers across the northwest and insurgent-state dialectics in the northeast. Of course, there are still practical and conceptual difficulties to actually integrating prevent and counter violent extremism (P/CVE) within wider intervention efforts, from development and governance to stabilisation and peacebuilding. Understanding how these competing logics can be reconciled at a programmatic and policy level is therefore essential if P/CVE (and counterterrorism) is to remain a relevant resource for delivering real security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress is hampered by minimal political appetite for reform.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The limited appetite for structural change among Nigeria’s political and economic elites has sometimes led to the imposition of anti-corruption laws, initiatives and technical “fixes” without a concerted effort to address the normalisation of graft across the private and public spheres. The nature of this corruption has also eroded the judiciary, thereby creating an “entrenched culture of impunity and [a] flagrant disregard for the rule of law”, which further limits Nigeria’s ability to tackle criminality and creates a vicious circle for donors to navigate. External stakeholders are unlikely to be able to instil a “big bang” reform to break this self-reinforcing cycle of corruption, given the lack of domestic buy-in. Continued support for “sustained, cumulative incremental reforms” may yield more long-term success, along with the identification and provision of support to political, institutional and civic islands of integrity both locally and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
