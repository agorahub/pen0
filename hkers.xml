However, there still remain impediments that prevent this cooperative relationship from morphing into a wholehearted alliance.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This report examines the writings of Chinese and Russian strategic thinkers to explore Sino-Russian cooperation across four main areas: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics. The core sources used for this report have never before been translated into English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic thinkers in both countries recognize that while Russia currently faces increasing diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation, China’s global position and strength continues to grow. This widening gulf between the economic and technological capabilities of each country will increase the inequality in their relationship and in turn impact its bilateral dynamic. While Russia used to be the more advanced partner in terms of arms sales and technology transfers, China’s rapid development in these areas has put the two partners on more of an equal footing. China and Russia have increased their engagement in the realm of joint military exercises, and this collaboration is expected to continue. Regarding their work together on issues connected to space and cyber, engagement is more limited and is focused more on technical cooperation and joint diplomatic efforts to oppose perceived moves by the United States to militarize space. While China and Russia each recognize the importance of hybrid warfare in contemporary geopolitics, for now they lack a shared strategy of how best to counter Western hybrid capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens the long-term ability of the Kremlin to carry its weight in its partnership with Beijing. On the other hand, Russian efforts to react to Western-led economic sanctions and support for Ukraine could provide the Chinese leadership with an important guide as to how their own country could resist Western pressure during a crisis in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early February 2022, Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China met in person for the first time in two years for bilateral talks in advance of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The summit concluded with a joint statement in which the leaders announced a partnership “with no forbidden areas of cooperation.” This was a pivotal moment in the Sino-Russian relationship. Coming amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West triggered by Russia’s buildup of military forces along the Ukrainian border, the detailed statement demonstrated a joint commitment to building a stronger bilateral partnership. The meeting affirmed that not only do Putin and Xi both perceive the prevailing global order as Western-dominated and designed to constrain their ability to pursue their strategic interests, they also have a shared desire to challenge the existing global order. It demonstrated their mutual understanding that each country had something to gain from the other in the effort to move the world toward multipolarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began only 20 days after the summit, immediately put to the test the proclamation that there were “no limits” to the Sino-Russian partnership. Yet, while Western officials may have hoped that the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty would drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, such expectations so far have proven overly optimistic. China has neither provided extensive military aid nor indicated a broad willingness to help Russia circumvent sanctions, but its leaders have refused to condemn Russia’s actions and instead blame the United States and the West for the war due to their enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance in disregard of Russia’s security concerns. Moreover, bilateral trade has intensified as Russia pivots away from European markets, and the countries continue to engage in joint military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders of both Russia and China have also made confident statements regarding the robustness of their countries’ partnership. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi remarked in July that bilateral relations were characterized by their “strong resilience and strategic determination” amid uncertain geopolitical conditions, while his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov indicated that cooperation with China would not be subject to “external interference.” In short, the overall framework of the relationship as an anti-Western partnership remains intact, and the two countries continue to find opportunities for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military sphere provides fertile ground for Russia and China to strengthen their relationship. Bilateral military ties have grown substantially since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its proxy war in eastern Ukraine set it on a trajectory of confrontation with — and isolation from — the West. Cooperation has occurred along several vectors; for example, arms sales between the countries involve increasingly sensitive and complex technologies, the tempo and scope of military exercises has increased, and the two countries are collaborating on satellite navigation, which has substantial military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Western analysts have closely examined Sino-Russian military cooperation in an effort to understand the factors that either perpetuate or limit the alignment of their strategic competitors. Yet, the perspectives of strategic thinkers from within Russia and China are often missing from the conversation, despite their obvious analytical value. To bridge this gap, CSIS has curated and translated strategically important primary-source materials from China and Russia to ascertain how strategic thinkers in each country expect bilateral military cooperation to develop in the coming years. These documents, which have been analyzed by leading defense and foreign policy specialists in the United States and Europe, contribute to a more complete understanding of China and Russia’s intentions, actions, and capabilities with regard to military cooperation. This knowledge is essential for defense officials and policymakers in Washington, Brussels, and other European capitals to develop realistic forecasts and create more effective plans to manage the implications of the alignment of these two geopolitical actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain a wide-ranging view of how Russian and Chinese thinkers expect the bilateral military relationship to develop, CSIS has selected four areas of cooperation for close examination: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics (such as influence operations). Translations of the Russian- and Chinese-language documents commenting upon cooperation in these areas are published on the website of the CSIS Interpret: China project, an online, interactive digital platform that uses previously untranslated primary source material to drive in-depth discussions and debates on strategic topics relating to U.S.-China relations and the broader topic of China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notable-findings&quot;&gt;Notable Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the four areas of cooperation, Russian and Chinese strategic thinkers recognize the importance of joint activities to advance the shared geopolitical goal of challenging Western hegemony in global affairs. The authors of the source documents cited in this project perceive that the “strategic triangle” their countries form with the United States is out of balance, and the significant advantage enjoyed by the United States and its allies in terms of force, technology, and the ability to set “the rules of the game” through international norms and legal frameworks is the main driver of global instability. Framing competition with the United States in zero-sum terms, the strategic communities in Russia and China suggest that eroding the West’s dominant position is necessary to create a more just and sustainable global order defined by the parity of major powers. In this context, bilateral cooperation is advantageous not only for its practical benefits (e.g., access to advanced technology, capacity development) but also for the signal that it sends to the West: each country is dissatisfied with the status quo and intends to change it. They apparently hope that the United States will eventually heed this message and demonstrate “respect” through self-deterrence (e.g., not responding to provocative messaging or actions by Russia or China in areas where they claim to have privileged interests, and thus gradually ceding their self-declared spheres of influence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the Russian and Chinese authors highlight the importance of using military cooperation to improve mutual trust and, by extension, strengthen the underpinnings of the Sino-Russian alignment. They also share an awareness of inequality within the relationship, with China continuing to develop its defense industrial capacity, advanced technological capabilities, and economic base to boost its major power status at a time when Russia is experiencing stagnation and seems headed for a prolonged period of decline. As China continues to develop, it will have less need for the expertise that Russia currently provides, but Russia will continue to require Chinese resources — especially if its diplomatic and economic isolation continues. To Russian and Chinese thinkers, the growing imbalance within the relationship does not necessarily mean cooperation will come to a halt; as long as Russian and Chinese leaders believe that the United States is trying to weaken or contain them as geopolitical competitors, there is something to be gained from further joint activities. Yet, the nature of the relationship is bound to change. Russia seems destined to play a supporting role to China should the “strategic triangle” transform into bipolar confrontation between China and the West — an outcome that some Russian authors struggle to accept. However, considering the key trends unique to each of the four aforementioned aspects of military cooperation, it would be premature to relegate Russia to “junior partner” status too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arms sales and technology transfers:&lt;/strong&gt; Both strategic communities recognize that the advancement of China’s defense industry has reduced the need to import military equipment from Russia, and accordingly, the commercial importance of arms sales has waned. As Chinese production capabilities catch up with Russia in certain areas and exceed it in others, what used to be a one-sided relationship is now on roughly equal footing. Although historical cases of Chinese reverse engineering and intellectual property theft — along with China’s potential to challenge Russia for primacy on the global arms market — have contributed to mistrust, each state desires greater access to technology to compete more effectively with the West. As such, strategic thinkers expect cooperation to continue and even deepen in the coming years as the two countries engage in the joint development of advanced systems (e.g., missile defense). The relatively equal standing of Russia and China in the field of arms sales and technology transfers — celebrated by Chinese thinkers in particular — may be fleeting, however, as both communities recognize that China is unlikely to share its most advanced technologies with Russia once it outpaces its former patron.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; The pace and complexity of joint exercises has increased steadily over the past decade, and both strategic communities expect Russia and China to maintain robust cooperation in this sphere. This is primarily driven by the need to send a message to the West about the growing military strength of their partnership. Strategic thinkers in both countries see military exercises as being particularly important for deterrence signaling in the Asia-Pacific region, where intensified strategic competition with Western powers appears inevitable. There is a shared recognition that military exercises are critical to trust building, as the two militaries become more familiar with the strengths, weaknesses, and capacities of the other’s equipment. Russian authors tend to be more sanguine about the practical military benefits of these exercises, claiming, for example, that they have resulted in the increased interoperability of forces but offering little evidence to back their claims. While their assessments may have shifted since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chinese writers recognize that they have much to learn from the Russian military, which has more recent experience conducting large-scale warfare, confronting adversaries trained by the West and equipped with Western arms, and competing with the United States in general.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and cyber:&lt;/strong&gt; Open-source materials analyzing Russian and Chinese space cooperation tend to concentrate on two areas of activity: technical cooperation and diplomacy. The recent growth of China’s domestic space industry and healthy levels of funding for research suggest that Beijing is rapidly heading toward self-sufficiency when it comes to conducting space missions. Meanwhile, Russia’s status as a space-faring nation, recognized by Russian and Chinese authors as central to its sense of national pride, appears tenuous due to shrinking budgets, restrictions on imports, and aging equipment and personnel. The ambition of some technical cooperation programs, including plans to build a lunar research station together, appear out of sync with Russia’s ability to deliver, and it may only be a matter of time before Russia’s fears of being left behind in the space race are realized. Nonetheless, according to the authors of the source materials, there are still areas where Russia and China stand to benefit from cooperation, including diplomatic efforts to counter what they perceive as U.S. attempts to militarize space. (The potential for jointly developing counter-space capabilities is largely unexplored, despite comments by some authors that the West was triggering an arms race in space.) Chinese and Russian authors also appreciate the importance of developing alternatives to the West’s attempts to set rules in international fora on activities in space, seeing this as an imperative to retain sovereignty. They apply similar logic to cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; In stark contrast to Western perceptions, strategic thinkers in both countries believe that the concept of hybrid warfare originated in the United States as a means to undermine U.S. competitors. As such, experts from both China and Russia believe they must learn from the West and develop appropriate countermeasures to defend themselves against this threat. This defensive framing portends growing cooperation between Russia and China, but it is unclear whether the strategic communities of these countries have developed a shared language that would guide their response to the perceived maliciousness of the West. Chinese thinkers surveyed in this report distinguish between hybrid warfare, which attempts to create controlled chaos on the periphery of great powers as a means to balance their influence, and gray zone competition, which establishes narratives to justify the pursuit of certain aims. Understanding how to apply these distinct but complementary approaches is critical to the survival of rising powers in competition with the West. Russian scholars, meanwhile, emphasize the need to prepare the country for “mental war” — a form of total war in which states aim to destroy the foundation of each other’s strategic cultures. In this respect, protecting one’s information space becomes paramount; otherwise, states risk the erosion of the “core idea” underpinning their civilization. With regard to cooperation, strategic thinkers in Russia and China see regional organizations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping as a possible way to coordinate mutual activities to defend against Western hybrid aggression. They also focus on developing stronger information security measures and piloting new frameworks for cyberspace governance in hopes of mitigating the West’s perceived advantage in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the source material for this report was gathered prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — a transformative and disruptive event that challenges many of the key assumptions laid out in the texts. In the following chapters, Western authors reviewing these source materials recognize the potential for the war to cause both positive and negative changes to the course to cooperation. Writing about military exercises, one expert noted that the Russian and Chinese strategic communities “made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory” and cautioned that continuity is not a given. This warning could well apply to cooperation in other spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine poses contradictory implications for the course of Sino-Russian alignment. Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield — particularly in the early days of the invasion — has raised questions about the quality of Russian military technology and the Kremlin’s ability to pursue its strategic aims effectively. Due to wide-ranging Western sanctions, Russia is cut off from critical supply chains and funding sources, and it is ostracized in certain international fora. These factors could lead Beijing to reassess the nature of its ties with Russia. On the other hand, Russia’s experience in attempting to counter and overcome these impacts could prove valuable to Beijing as it girds itself for increased confrontation with the West in the Asia-Pacific region. In this case, the war in Ukraine could contribute to deeper cooperation between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may sustain reputational damage from partnering with Moscow at a time when Russia has trampled upon international norms and principles, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in the affairs of foreign states. However, the overall contours of strategic competition with the West as part of a “strategic triangle” have not changed, and Beijing may find itself in a stronger position to set the terms of the relationship to a partner with few other friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, when relations with the West deteriorated significantly due to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its undeclared proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Russia accelerated its pivot to Asia. This pivot affected all areas of Sino-Russian bilateral cooperation, but it was particularly noticeable in the arms trade, where a softening of Russian export restrictions allowed for a revitalization of military-technological cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, only weeks before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian and Chinese presidents stated that their relationship had never been better and that it knew “no limits.” Despite this proclamation, members of the Russian security community are much more modest in their assessments of the partnership than their leaders, usually describing it as an “armed friendship” or a “partnership with limitations.” The dominant view among Russian military experts is that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation is mainly military-political in character, motivated by the countries’ common opposition to what they perceive as the United States’ global hegemony. Mutual distrust and diverging local and regional interests make it seem less likely that China and Russia’s military-technological cooperation will turn into an alliance any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sino-russian-military-cooperation-past-and-present&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian Military Cooperation: Past and Present&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts consider arms trade the cornerstone of modern Sino-Russian security cooperation. When China was banned from importing Western military equipment after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Russia became the country’s main source for advanced equipment. During the 1990s, China imported approximately 30 percent of all Russian arms exports, illustrated in Figure 1. At the same time, the Russian defense budget deteriorated in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, and the Russian defense industry became dependent upon export earnings for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ejVr2pI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in the mid-2000s, Chinese interest in Russian military technology fell as its own defense industrial capabilities rose. The rapid advancement of China’s domestic arms industry in recent years has narrowed bilateral cooperation on arms sales to the extent that China is now only interested in cooperating with Russia in the fields where Russia retains advantages and can offer world-leading technology. A countervailing influence on the relationship is that Russia has tended to refrain from exporting its most advanced military technology. For many years, security concerns led Russia to adopt a more restrictive export policy toward China than toward its other major military-technological partner, India. However, a shift in Russia’s policy was observed in 2015 when Russia agreed to sell China some of its most advanced military equipment, namely the Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 air defense systems. Since 2015, China has purchased more newly developed equipment than any other importer of Russian arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts attribute the change in policy partly to the increased technological capabilities of the Chinese defense industry — which has made Beijing disinclined to purchase Russia’s second-best equipment — and partly to Russia’s weakened trade position following the fallout with the West. They assess that refusing to share technology with China will protect the Russian defense industry’s market position only in the short run. As Figure 2 shows, China has spent more than Russia on defense for more than 20 years. China is already ahead of Russia when it comes to fourth-generation technologies, electronics, composites, advanced materials, and shipbuilding. It is likely only a matter of time before China also catches up with Russia in the fields of air defense and aviation engine technologies. One Russian military expert considers it possible that the Chinese defense industry may start serial production of fifth-generation fighters before Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nyvFWZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the shift in policy, China’s share of Russian exported capabilities has increased, as illustrated in Figure 1. It should be noted, however, that the “amount of capabilities” does not reflect financial value, and the delivery years may be imprecise. This can be discerned by comparing capability exports with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) financial value of arms transfers database, which shows that the value of Russian arms exports was stable in 2012–2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has once again become an important market for Russian arms exports, the arms trade with China is no longer important to Russia for economic reasons, as the structure of Sino-Russian trade has changed over the last decades. Machinery and equipment, which made up a third of Russia’s exports to China in the 1990s, has fallen to the low single digits, while the share of hydrocarbons has significantly increased. Nevertheless, exports may still be important for companies within the Russian defense industry, if it allows them to maintain a wide spectrum of production lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospects-for-future-cooperation&quot;&gt;Prospects for Future Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world. Since the relationship is based on mutualism, rather than ideology, future cooperation depends on the extent to which each of the parties can offer something that allows the other to achieve its objectives. The Chinese defense industry has not yet caught up with Russian producers of air defense systems, radar equipment, submarine technology, and aircraft engines. China is therefore likely to remain interested in cooperation with Russia in these fields. China has also shown interest in the new Russian Burak-M buoy for submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia is becoming increasingly interested in Chinese technology. Limitations on the import of Western components have led to delays in the development of many of the new generation Russian weapon systems, including the upgraded fourth-generation fighter MiG-35, the fifth-generation fighter Sukhoi Su-57, and the main battle tank T-14 Armata. In addition to establishing import substitution programs, Russia most likely will seek to replace some Western technological components with Chinese equivalents. The Russian strategic community sees prospects for further cooperation particularly in the field of automated control systems and robotics. Russia has also imported unpiloted aerial vehicles, Haval off-road vehicles, and naval diesel engines from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Russia and China have shown an interest in cooperating on the development of strategic armaments, including joint work on China’s new missile launch detection system. The system, which is based on Russian Tundra satellites and Voronezh ground-based radar stations, was reported to be close to completion in 2020. Since both Russian and Chinese strategic capabilities are intended mainly to deter the United States and its allies, the Russian strategic community sees cooperation in this field as financially and technologically beneficial, while posing minimal national security risks. As for now, Russian and Chinese missile defense capabilities are not integrated, but Vassily Kashin, a Russian expert on China’s military-industrial complex, believes integration is a possible next step. Integration would be mutually beneficial, he argues, since it gives both countries a longer warning time in the event of a ballistic missile launch by the United States. Other possible strategic cooperation projects include hypersonic technology and the construction of nuclear submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-trust-still-limits-technological-transfers&quot;&gt;Lack of Trust Still Limits Technological Transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite political assurances of a partnership that knows no limits, the Russian strategic community assesses that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation continues to suffer from a lack of trust. Although the Russian strategic community has generally been open to the possibility of exporting military hardware to China, budding cooperation on arms sales has introduced significant security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, conservative members of the security community have raised fears that China would seek to expand into Russian territory or its areas of interest and that access to Russian weapons would help it achieve this goal. Although the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Russia’s Far East is currently considered far less likely than it was 15 years ago, new concerns have emerged in recent years about China’s interests in the Arctic and its military presence in Central Asia. Some Russian military experts also worry that China could exploit bilateral military-technological cooperation to contain Russia in the case of a future clash of interests in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some experts and officials are concerned that China could outperform Russia in the global arms trade by exporting copied matériel at a lower cost to markets traditionally served by Russia. Within the Russian strategic community, China is perceived as highly competitive, using its economic advantage to gain access to Russia’s most advanced technology while protecting its own. In September 2020, editors of the industry’s leading newspaper, Military-Industrial Courier, warned that the arms trade with China was unlikely to result in Russia gaining new technological know-how, yet Russian arms producers would be pressured to give away their own expertise. They further cautioned that, by pursuing a policy of replacing Western components in its weapons with Chinese parts, Russia is merely transferring its dependency on one foreign power to another. In the editors’ view, Russia would be better served by developing its own defense industry than by seeking closer cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter assessments reflect the ambivalent attitude of Russian experts regarding the increased capability of the Chinese defense industry. On one hand, Russian experts are generally impressed with China’s achievements and frequently credit Russia for the quick modernization of the Chinese military. According to one assessment, it was due to Russian assistance that the Chinese military machine “made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas.” On the other hand, Russian experts claim that China’s modern fighter planes are the result of reverse engineering of Russia’s Su-27. The Sukhoi case and other perceived Chinese infringements of intellectual property rights have fostered a deep mistrust of China among members of the Russian strategic community and have led to predictions of new infringements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-operations-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO Operations and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s rationale for enhancing military-technological cooperation with China in the 1990s and 2000s was the need for income, it has now evolved to include access to technology. Collaboration gives the two partners access to technology that they would not get independently. China’s imports of the S-400 air defense system and Su-35S fighter could give it an advantage in controlling the airspace above Taiwan. A technologically advanced People’s Liberation Army could pose military challenges for the United States in the Pacific region, forcing Washington to turn its focus more firmly toward Asia while leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with the primary responsibility of protecting Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from 2015, bilateral cooperation was also expanded to include joint military exercises. In recent years, China has participated in Russia’s strategic exercises, and the countries have carried out joint naval maneuvers in the East and South China Seas, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Baltic Sea, as well as joint air patrols over the Sea of Japan. As a result, the two militaries have become more compatible and synchronized in weapon systems as well as in communications, tactics, and military doctrine. As pointed out above, the Russian strategic community nevertheless assesses that the military significance of Sino-Russian military cooperation should not be overestimated. Critical voices have argued that bilateral military ties are less deep and comprehensive than Sino-Pakistani cooperation, for instance, noting the limited scale of Sino-Russian joint exercises, the lack of joint programs for equipment repair, and the small number of joint technology development projects. While the possible integration of Russian and Chinese early warning systems could strengthen each country’s deterrence capabilities, Dmitri Trenin points out that the system itself poses a limited threat to transatlantic security and could actually improve global strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian cooperation also limits the impact of Western sanctions on the Russian arms industry and ensures Russia’s access to technologies that it is no longer able to obtain from the West. For example, imports of Chinese electronic components and engines make it possible for Russia to complete designs that it lacks the inputs or ability to produce itself. Few, if any, nations other than China have sufficient economic leverage to deter Western economic statecraft, which means that Beijing is unlikely to abandon its arms trade with Russia in the near term. However, the disruptive potential of Western sanctions on Russia’s arms industry should not be underestimated. In 2017, the United States imposed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which states that any country that has significant transactions with Iran, North Korea, or Russia could be sanctioned by the United States. This has hindered some countries’ willingness to trade arms with Russia. Since the law took effect, Egypt, Indonesia, and Algeria withdrew from plans to buy the Su-35S fighter jet. The tense political climate following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may further dampen the enthusiasm of potential buyers who are averse to testing the willingness of the United States to enforce secondary sanctions. In March 2022, for example, India canceled its orders of MiG-29 aircraft, helicopters, and anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Russia, while a partnership with China might extend a lifeline to its defense industry, it is unlikely to revitalize it, as Russian strategic thinkers doubt that China would find it beneficial to share its most advanced technology with Russia. It also remains unclear whether the relationship is strong enough to overcome the dramatic measures imposed on Russia since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. New sanctions imposed by the West are much more severe than the previous iterations, and large reductions of EU imports of Russian gas and oil will have consequences for Russian GDP and public income. Consequently, the Russian state and its defense industry may become even more dependent upon China for their future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community assesses that China is a prudent partner, pursuing its own foreign policy interests that only partly coincide with Russia’s. The limits to their partnership are evident in terms of the two countries’ relations with Ukraine. Russian experts on China acknowledge that China has interests on both sides of the war. As one scholar summarizes: “China supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine, calls on the parties to conclude peace as soon as possible, does not plan to sever economic and political ties with neither Western countries nor Ukraine, but is also sharing Russia’s concerns about NATO expansion and will not join the sanctions against Moscow.” While some Russian experts assume that China will support the Russian economy in practice if not in words, others assess that China will try to use the situation to strengthen its economic presence in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian experts generally approve of Russia’s “pivot to China,” they admit that China is economically stronger and that Russia falls under a certain dependence. As long as China has stronger economic muscles and continues to close the gap in military technology, it will be much more likely for Russia to have to adapt to Chinese foreign policy goals than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian relationship has grown increasingly close in recent years, though it still falls short of a formal alliance. In addition to military-political and military-operational cooperation, bilateral cooperation on military technology through arms sales and limited joint development projects has increased as China’s defense technological and industrial bases have modernized. The partnership, according to Chinese analysts, has moved from one in which China imported Russian weapons and platforms to one that is of greater equality between the two countries. While Chinese analysts point to like-minded geopolitical justifications for heightened cooperation in areas of military technology, they also acknowledge ongoing tensions and a lack of trust between the two countries that will prevent further deepening of the relationship. The bilateral military-technical cooperation between China and Russia should be of concern for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO). China’s policy of military-civil fusion gives it access to industrial secrets and technological innovation from national economies within the NATO alliance through illicit means — such as industrial espionage — as well as through legal means, such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, foreign direct investment, and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) collaboration. This information could potentially be shared with Russia, with Russia also reciprocating. However, persistent political distrust between Russia and China could mean that each country will continue to reserve its most strategic capabilities, as well as information gained from sensitive espionage efforts, for national use only. Further research should be directed at whether this may change depending on how the Russian economy fares following the sanctions imposed on it as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-of-the-deepening-sino-russian-political-and-military-relationship&quot;&gt;Context of the Deepening Sino-Russian Political and Military Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepening Sino-Russian ties in the area of arms sales and technology transfers fall within the wider context of an overall deepening bilateral relationship between the two countries. On February 4, 2022, Russia and China publicized a joint statement on their common positions with regards to the world order and their “limitless” bilateral strategic partnership. The statement seems to have marked the formalization of a new phase in their relationship, though many of the points covered in the document were already present in their existing bilateral relationship. Even following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated that “China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era.” According to some Chinese academics, the bilateral relationship has turned a corner; whereas China was once heavily dependent on the Soviet Union, it has gradually developed a partnership of relative equals with the Russian Federation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The relationship has moved from a period in which the two sides recognized each other as friendly countries in the early 1990s to a comprehensive strategic partnership in the second decade of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese views of the Sino-Russian partnership are often also framed within the larger context of common strategic interests and competition with the United States. Hou Aijun from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for example, states that since the 1990s, both China and Russia have acted as stabilizing forces and geopolitical balancing factors in a world order that is unjust and excludes the Global South, and which is “constantly eroded and destroyed” by a revisionist United States seeking to stave off its inevitable decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strong sentiment of deep partnership between Russia and China, such as that expressed by Hou, Chinese academics acknowledge that the bilateral relationship is not truly “limitless.” Hou, for example, explains that areas of mistrust include border security, differences in each other’s political systems, historical grievances, and China’s economic expansion into Central Asia. Some thinkers, like Zhang Deguang, former secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have highlighted areas of concern about Russia’s future trajectory in international relations, although Zhang was generally optimistic despite Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and technology diplomacy has been a significant part of the bilateral relationship since before the fall of the Soviet Union, and against the backdrop of U.S.-China technological competition, it serves China’s geopolitical goal of becoming a global technological leader. According to Luo Hui, former director of the Innovation Strategy Research Institute of the China Association for Science and Technology, science and technology diplomacy helps advance China’s overall innovation strategy while also fulfilling larger diplomatic goals. However, Chinese thinkers ascribe Russia’s pursuit of technological cooperation to public diplomacy efforts to “increase mutual understanding between people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-views-of-deepening-military-technological-relationship&quot;&gt;Chinese Views of Deepening Military-Technological Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military-technological cooperation between China and Russia also dates back to the Soviet era, starting in the 1950s with secondments of Soviet experts to job placements in China and the signing of cooperation agreements on issues such as nuclear energy and weapons technologies. Although China today no longer relies on Russia as its primary source of military weapons and platforms procurement following China’s advancement in science and technology and the modernization of its own defense technological and industrial base, Chinese academics still point to Russia’s “profound accumulation of basic scientific research” in areas such as materials science, mathematics, physics, aerospace, power efficiency, polar exploration, space science, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Li Shuyin, director and researcher with the European Military Research Office of the Department of Foreign Military Studies at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, Chinese and Russian military-technological cooperation forms part of their “three-in-one” relationship, which also encompasses military-political and military-operational aspects. The military-political relationship is based on regular meetings between heads of state, as well as mechanisms for regular meetings at the defense ministerial level and general staff strategic consultations. The military-operational relationship is founded on regular joint exercises, such as the “Peace Mission” series, which seek to build cooperation and mutual trust between each country’s armed forces. Lastly, arms sales, technology transfers, and (to a lesser extent) R&amp;amp;D collaboration form the “core of China-Russia military cooperation.” This aspect of the relationship has significant historical roots that have shaped modern bilateral ties. China was an important destination for Russian weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as during the Western arms embargo that followed China’s crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Despite the rapid modernization of China’s defense industry, in 2021, the country remained Russia’s second-largest destination for arms exports, following India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military-technological relationship is governed by the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technological Cooperation, which meets yearly and focuses on the procurement of various technologies from each country. In 2015, it was reported the Chinese side was focused on purchases of modern warplanes, ships, and new land equipment, while the Russian side was focused on air and missile defense systems. Chinese arms transfers from Russia also include, in some instances, production licenses, as was considered for the Su aircraft series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These imports have served the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in multiple ways. They are politically symbolic of support in Moscow and Beijing for the deepening bilateral relationship, while also providing opportunities for China’s defense industry to learn about specific aspects of Russian technology to integrate into its own capabilities, such as thrust vector control in Russian aircraft engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical benefit to the PLA from these types of imports should not be underestimated, nor should arms imports be conflated with trust within the relationship, for reasons outlined further below. Similar to the science and technology partnership, Chinese academics characterize the bilateral military-technological relationship as serving national interests and, ultimately, the country’s strategic goals. As Li Shuyin states: “From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially in naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shuyin argues that arms sales have been an important source of funding and foreign currency for the Russian military-industrial complex. Accordingly, as both sides perceive that they are benefiting from their partnership in the field of military-technological cooperation, analysts expect this relationship to continue into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of this cooperation, however, is transforming from one-sided procurement to equal learning. Just as the general science and technological cooperative relationship has moved on from being characterized primarily by China acquiring knowledge from the Soviet Union (and then Russia), so too has the military-technological relationship. Li Shuyin points to the links between Chinese national sentiment and the historical relationship between China and the Soviet Union, stating that the “Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power,” which allowed it to determine the nature and amount of military cooperation with China at any time. China’s economic and technological rise has allowed it to assert its equality within the relationship more confidently and to push back against this perceived Russian chauvinism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the relationship has also evolved as the innovative potential of each defense industrial complex has strengthened. Authors like Li Dapeng, from the Naval Engineering University, already argued in 2015 that “the context of Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation should shift from focusing on procurement of weapons systems, equipment and components to focusing on cooperative R&amp;amp;D and joint manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Chinese analysts also point to obstacles in the deepening of defense technological cooperation between Russia and China. Li Dapeng indirectly references concerns in Russia about Chinese reverse engineering of Russian weapons, stating that “some Chinese-made weapons have similarities with Russian-made weapons in technical genes.” In one relevant case, Moscow suspended the production of the second batch of J-11A/SU-27SK fighters following Beijing’s alleged violation of the coproduction agreement with Russia. Given that Russia is a major player in the global arms trade, China’s relative advantage in terms of manufacturing capacity and production costs could pose problems for Moscow if Beijing ramps up production of its variants of Russia-derived weapons for export. As Li Dapeng notes, Russia’s concern about losing market share as Chinese exports become more cost-effective is a “major obstacle to deepening and expanding Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation.” The modernization of China’s defense industrial base and economic power has afforded Beijing the capacity to manufacture weapons and platforms for export or transfer at subsidized prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, arms sales volumes are likely to decline in the future, as China’s defense industry becomes more capable, efficient, and competitive. China and Russia may continue to cooperate instead on the joint development of emerging and disruptive technologies, or on a missile early warning system — technologies that fit into China’s military modernization goals of catching up and overtaking the United States militarily. However, as a result of the war in Ukraine, Chinese military-technological cooperation with Russia becomes more complicated, as it puts Beijing at risk of being targeted with secondary sanctions. Furthermore, Russia’s tech industry is experiencing brain drain as a result of the invasion, which may complicate the two countries’ cooperation in the field of emerging and disruptive technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Sino-Russian military cooperation is based on mutual self-interest, which includes tilting regional and global balances of strategic power in favor of Moscow and Beijing. While geopolitics will play a major role in the propelling this relationship forward, they also generate certain disruptions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its actions in the early months of the war are exemplary of the potential drawbacks of a “relationship with no limits,” as Beijing has been forced to carefully craft a balanced position to not criticize Russia while also upholding its self-declared principles of non-interference and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the greater political-military relationship, Sino-Russian cooperation is guided primarily by mutual trust, which according to Li Shuyin remains insufficient. Li Shuyin notes that geopolitics contributes to the lack of trust between the two countries, as “some people in China . . . voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc. China and Russia have already moved to cooperate on R&amp;amp;D in areas of emerging technology with defense applications, such as artificial intelligence. The overall alignment of each side’s interests for geopolitical and financial reasons signals that there is little prospect to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow in their effort to deepen defense technological engagement. NATO thus potentially faces an adversary and systemic competitor who can combine significant resources in areas of technological R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of this changing relationship is also cause for concern regarding NATO’s own defense innovation strengths in the future. China’s efforts to integrate foreign innovation into its defense technological and industrial base go beyond the Sino-Russian relationship. Indeed, existing research has shown that Chinese military institutions continue to engage with foreign academic and research institutions to develop sensitive technologies with military applications and to improve the skills of Chinese military researchers in relevant techniques and processes. If Russia and China’s military-technological cooperation deepens in the area of R&amp;amp;D, then NATO ally-originating innovation could also transfer via China to Russia’s military industrial complex, thereby enhancing Russian defense capabilities and weakening the alliance’s technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Chinese analysts have also pointed out, military-technological cooperation within the bilateral Sino-Russian relationship is not without its obstacles. Lack of mutual trust still plagues the relationship; from a Chinese perspective, it prevents further deepening of the existing relationship. It is therefore unclear whether the reported collaboration on R&amp;amp;D for weapons and capabilities will continue to provide significant strategic value to either military in the long term. Lastly, the question of how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will impact Sino-Russian defense technological cooperation remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The View from Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;paul-schwartz&quot;&gt;Paul Schwartz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-Chinese joint military exercises have expanded dramatically since the two countries held their first Peace Mission exercise in 2004, and they are of growing concern in the Western analytical community. This article reviews four recent papers written by Russian military experts which offer fresh insights on these joint exercises from the Russian perspective. The experts agree that Russia-China joint exercises are expanding in scope, scale, and intensity, and they provide new details on just how they are expanding. They highlight recent trends such as the increase in holding larger strategic exercises on each other’s territory, the addition of joint air patrols, and the likelihood of future joint air and naval deployments. They also discuss Russia’s growing interest in using joint exercises to assess Chinese innovations, and (less persuasively) the growing emphasis on interoperability in joint exercises. In the process, the authors offer additional particulars on the expanding scope of joint exercises to include inter alia mountain and winter warfare and combined air-ground assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlight the importance of messaging in joint exercises, which are often designed expressly to demonstrate the two countries’ growing military power and the strength of their strategic partnership. In doing so, the authors seem intent on reinforcing the messaging effect by overstating the psychological impact of joint exercises on the West, thus departing to some extent from objective analysis. The authors also highlight that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence. While they agree that the two countries are not currently in an alliance, they emphasize that military relations have expanded and now exceed the bounds of a “normal” relationship. Collectively, the authors’ views are fairly representative of the Russian security community, although they also offer insights of their own on joint exercises. While the papers are not wholly objective — overstating the importance of interoperability, for example, as well as the potential for joint operations against the West — they offer valuable details on the nature and objectives of joint exercises and on the views (and hopes) of the Russian analytical community regarding their future direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nature-and-trajectory-of-russia-china-joint-military-exercises&quot;&gt;Nature and Trajectory of Russia-China Joint Military Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community has commented extensively on the continuing expansion of Russia-China joint military exercises, which have increased markedly in terms of their scope, scale, and frequency and through the addition of new exercise series. Russian experts tend to view these trends as further evidence of a growing military convergence between the two countries. The Russian authors covered in this paper are no exception, although they each highlight different dimensions to illustrate this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Vinokurov, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and vice president of the League of Military Diplomats, reports that Russia and China held two major joint exercises in just a three-month span in 2019: the first in July followed by the Tsentr strategic exercises in September. He notes that these were viewed as regular, routine events, indicating that joint exercises are growing in both scale and frequency. This is further evidence of what he sees as a general strengthening of connections in the military sphere. Alexander Yermakov, an independent military analyst and member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), likewise highlights the growing frequency of joint exercises, pointing to the recent Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic multi-country exercises held in August 2021 followed just one month later by Peace Mission counterterrorism exercises held in September. Coming in such close proximity, these exercises reflect a deepening of cooperation between the two sides in the sphere of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov notes that joint exercises are increasing not only in frequency but in scale: for instance, Zapad/Interaction-2021 involved 13,000 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops, 200 armored vehicles, 90 artillery pieces, a Russian motorized rifle unit, and more than 100 planes and helicopters. A recent RIA Novosti article on Russia-China military relations adds that joint exercises are now held at sea, on land, and in the air, having expanded to encompass all of the principal military domains. More ominously, this article also notes that recent joint exercises are placing greater emphasis on joint repulsion of enemy attacks, citing the West as the likely target of these efforts. The article then quotes Vasiliy Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, who argues that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech as well. As further evidence, the article points to the recent flurry of joint exercises such as the Vostok-2018 and Tsentr-2019 strategic exercises held in Russia and the Joint Sea naval exercises held in the Baltic and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov and Ruslan Polonchuk, a military expert at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA), both highlight the recent joint air patrols conducted over disputed waters in the East China Sea. They contend that joint air patrols represent an expansion of Russian-Chinese joint exercises to include joint deployments. By joint deployments, they are likely referring to a range of potential activities that the two sides could undertake, including combined air and naval patrols, port visits, search and rescue operations, and other joint peacetime activities. Vinokurov indicates that these are likely to become a routine part of the Russia-China joint exercise program, since they demonstrate the two countries’ readiness for further collaboration in this area. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that joint activities will expand even further to include joint naval “show-the-flag” deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk also highlights the recent expansion of Russia-China joint naval exercises to include new participants — most notably Iran — as another important development. He argues that joint naval maneuvers with Iran demonstrated a growing coordination on joint maritime activities between the three countries with a distinctly anti-American character, coming as they did amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of experts cited above indicate that joint exercises are becoming more important for both China and Russia. Polonchuk notes, for example, that joint exercises have increased in importance over the last several years, while arms sales between the two sides have declined, indicating that joint exercises may eventually become the main line of effort in Russia-China military affairs. The PLA’s willingness to continue joint exercises with Russia despite Covid-19 risks was cited separately as evidence of their growing importance to China. Yeramakov marks the recent trend to appoint high-ranking military commanders to lead joint exercises as further evidence of their increasing importance. As an example, he cites the appointment of Li Zuochen, a member of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Central Military Commission, to command Chinese forces during Zapad/Interaction-2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all agree that the recent expansion of Russia-China joint exercises is contributing to a growing strategic partnership between the two countries, a trend that is likely to continue. The RIA Novosti article views this as part of a larger trend toward increased defense cooperation, which has now reached a “level unprecedented over the past half-century.” It further claims that joint exercises are so ingrained that they have now become a “tradition” — a novel though not unreasonable way of characterizing joint exercises, given their growing scope, scale, and frequency. In any event, all of these factors imply that joint exercises are likely to continue on their current trajectory, with important implications for the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are correct that joint exercises are expanding as the two countries have continued to add new series of exercises. They are also correct in highlighting that joint exercises are increasing in scope, scale, and frequency. The authors go further, offering valuable insights on just how joint exercises are expanding, all of which warrants further attention. For example, Polonchuk could well be correct in projecting an increase in joint deployments, which offer yet another way for the two sides to engage in joint military activities at low cost and to achieve political and military effects, with important implications for Asia-Pacific and transatlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are also quite correct that joint exercises are a critical component of the Russia-China strategic partnership, complementing arms sales, key leader engagements, and defense research and development as the main forms of military cooperation. As joint exercises have developed, each country has become the other’s most important joint exercise partner. Joint exercises in turn reflect a growing convergence at the strategic level, with Moscow and Beijing now aligned on the most important issues facing them in the international arena. This includes a shared desire to limit U.S. power and to usher in a multipolar world order. In the military sphere, this convergence is reflected in their joint opposition to U.S. missile defense, prompt global strike, and the militarization of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this light, joint military exercises are part of a larger combined effort by Russia and China to improve their respective military capabilities and expand their influence, while simultaneously signaling their displeasure with U.S. and Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-objectives-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Military Objectives of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of these four papers also emphasize that military exercises are an effective means to build experience and to promote knowledge transfer. As an example, Vinokurov discusses the recent Tsentr 2019 exercises held in central Russia, where Russian and Chinese bombers practiced joint interdiction of opposing ground forces, exposing the two sides to their respective methods of attack. The RIA Novosti article highlights the use of joint exercises to develop certain specialized capabilities. As examples, it discusses two recent joint exercises in which Russian and Chinese forces practiced winter and alpine combat operations. It then quotes Kashin, who notes that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech, while focusing increasingly on operations of the kind needed to confront an advanced foreign adversary, which he says could only be the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk agrees, even though he asserts that China is benefiting militarily more than Russia from such exercises, a view shared by most Western analysts. He notes, for example, that the Joint Sea naval exercises have been especially important for the PLA Navy, since they are designed to focus more on tasks facing the PRC, while exposing the PLA Navy to the methods used by the more experienced Russian navy. Polonchuk likewise points out that China is using Peace Mission exercises to prepare the PLA for counterterrorist actions in Central Asia, which he notes could be used against the PRC’s indigenous Uighur population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Polonchuk argues that this trend is changing, and that combined military exercises are becoming more balanced, or more “multi-vectored” as he puts it. Whereas before, they were used mainly as a means for the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian military, joint exercises are increasingly benefiting both sides. He notes, for example, that Russian ground forces gained important insights from their exposure to Chinese motorized rifle units during recent joint exercises. Based on this, he advocates for the two to hold additional joint exercises involving motorized rifle units so they can hone their skills in urban combat. He also suggests that Russian forces hold additional joint exercises on Chinese ranges as they did during Zapad/Interaction-2021, both to gain more exposure to the PLA’s new theater command system and to weigh its pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov concurs, claiming that Zapad/Interaction-2021, held in China, “showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations of both nations,” with Russian units exercising for the first time using Chinese systems — especially the PLA’s new wheeled armored vehicle, a system for which there is no current analog in the Russian military. Yermakov notes that “the careful study and use of Chinese technology in maneuvers made up the innovative aspect of this drill.” Moreover, he notes that the study of Chinese experimental weapons by the army was extremely useful and should therefore be continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two papers commented on the growing emphasis on interoperability in recent joint military exercises, a subject that has attracted a good deal of Western attention as well. Kashin contends, for example, that joint exercises are focused increasingly on interoperability, which enhances the potential for joint operations against a major foreign adversary. He provides little support for this claim, however. Yermakov likewise highlights the new levels of military integration achieved during Zapad/Interaction-2021, which he cites as the main innovation of these exercises. Specifically, he notes that the two sides established a joint headquarters, with a unified command and control system to guide operations, which enabled them to carry out coordinated air strikes and joint helicopter-borne assaults. However, Yermakov seems to carry his argument a bit too far by implying that, as a result, Russian-Chinese joint exercises now exhibit a demonstrable level of mutual cooperation comparable to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), although he cites a Chinese source to convey this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts tend to give greater weight to the military benefits of joint PRC exercises than do many Western analysts, who are more prone to believe that such exercises are carried out primarily for their messaging effects, with less emphasis on their military benefits. Western analysts have pointed out, for example, that Russia-China joint exercises have in some cases been carefully scripted, and at times conducted in parallel in what were essentially separate side-by-side exercises. They also tend to believe that the Chinese military benefits more from joint exercises than its Russian counterpart, by allowing the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western analysts also tend to be more skeptical of claims of increased interoperability in Russia-China joint exercises, finding it hard to take them seriously in light of the extremely low likelihood that the two countries would actually engage in joint operations. Such views are reinforced by exaggerated claims such as the one cited by Yermakov, as there is virtually no evidence that Russia and China have anything close to the kind of joint command and control systems and interoperability standards employed by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-and-messaging-effects-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Political and Messaging Effects of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the views of the Russian security community, the authors of the four articles under discussion also recognize that Russia-China joint exercises have an important messaging component, one that benefits both countries by demonstrating the growing military strength of their strategic partnership, even though such messages are not always directed toward the West. The authors stress that achieving strategic and political effects remains an important driver for joint exercises. Polonchuk, for example, notes that the PLA uses joint exercises to demonstrate its growing ability to combat both traditional and nontraditional threats. He also indicates that Peace Mission exercises have had a stabilizing effect on the situation in Central Asia by reassuring the countries in the region of Russian and Chinese support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all tend to agree, however, that one of the primary purposes of joint exercises is to send a message to the West about the growing strength of Russian-Chinese military relations. Polonchuk argues, for example, that holding joint naval drills in locations outside of one or both sides’ traditional operating areas — such as the Baltic Sea, in the case of China — displays the growing military power of the two countries for Western audiences. Likewise, Vinokurov notes that the recent joint air patrols over the East China Sea “elicited an unpleasant reaction from U.S. allies” by demonstrating the growing military collaboration between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concurs, citing joint air patrols as an important tool for achieving long-term political goals in the Asia-Pacific region, although he does not specify what these goals are. The RIA Novosti articles goes even further, arguing that joint exercises are used to convey to potential adversaries the two countries’ growing ability to counter common enemies. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that Moscow and Beijing will continue to pursue one-time events (i.e., joint exercises and deployments) that have strong signaling effects but carry a low probability of causing unwanted escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that the authors often use their own papers as vehicles to reinforce the messaging effects of joint military exercises. To avoid attribution, however, they often use the rhetorical device of citing Western or Chinese sources when discussing the growing threat from Russia-China military relations. Thus, while these papers contain much useful information, they should not be considered wholly objective in their characterization of Sino-Russian joint exercises, which are used to some extent to amplify the signaling effects of the actual joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Vinokurov cites a recent New York Times article to claim indirectly that the “the West . . . is particularly disturbed by the military-technical cooperation (MTC) of Russia and China.” He takes pains to show that the West has good reason to be concerned by discussing the many recent measures taken by Russian and China to strengthen cooperation in the security sphere, including new joint agreements, summit meetings, and of course joint exercises. He concludes by citing U.S. Fleet Admiral Philip S. Davidson — then commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet — who said that Russia continues to be an existential threat to the United States and that by the middle of the next decade the United States could lose its leading edge to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the Russian security community tends to play up the implications of Russia-China joint exercises beyond their actual effects. Russian analysts often suggest by various means that Moscow and Beijing will increase their counterbalancing efforts toward the West should relations between Russia, China, and the West deteriorate further. They also imply that at some point joint exercises could expand to include serious preparations for joint military operations against the West. In the view of most Western analysts, however, such claims tend to lack credibility given the two countries’ demonstrated unwillingness to become entangled in each other’s principal security disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-joint-exercises-for-russia-china-relations&quot;&gt;Implications of Joint Exercises for Russia-China Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian security community tends to agree that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence between Russia and China, which is driven primarily by their increasing confrontation with the West. The authors of these articles likewise acknowledge that joint exercises are contributing to a growing strategic partnership between Russia and China, though none of the authors believe that an outright military alliance is imminent. The four authors differ, however, regarding the degree to which current military relations are already approaching an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concedes that Russian-Chinese military relations cannot be considered a military alliance either in theory or in practice, mainly because an alliance would be counterproductive. Today, for example, the Kremlin is in a position to mediate tensions between China and India, but this would no longer be possible if Russia and China were in a true alliance. Yet, he implies that recent joint naval exercises between Russia, China, and Iran should be considered a show of solidarity amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov asserts that the two countries are far from being involved in a true military alliance, and are not working toward one either, although he offers no explanation for why this is the case. At the same time, he notes correctly that the frequent and complex military drills held by both countries should put to rest recurring claims in the West that conflict between Russia and China is inevitable due to persistent mistrust. Kashin points out that joint exercises have helped to build trust between the two sides, noting for example that Russian and Chinese soldiers and officers have grown well acquainted with each other through recent joint exercises. He adds that this growing awareness of each other’s military capabilities “allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, [and] understand what capabilities they are actually developing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov appears more optimistic about the possibility of alliance. He notes that China and Russia have developed their connections to the level of mutual partnership and strategic cooperation, and that joint military activities now “exceed the bounds of normal military cooperation.”37 This he attributes to the two countries’ deteriorating relations with the United States. He argues, however, that talk of an alliance is premature, mainly because China is not yet ready for one — perhaps implying indirectly that Russia is more open to an alliance, although he falls short of stating this outright. Interestingly, he claims that President Xi himself recently ruled out an alliance with Russia during a speech before the PRC Central Committee. At the same time, Vinokurov claims that the national security of Moscow and Beijing are now understood as a common interest. As a consequence, they can be expected to “react effectively to [counter] new or well-established threats.” Thus, faced with the growing threat from the United States, at some point further military rapprochement if not an outright alliance would become inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RIA Novosti article carries this argument the furthest, implying that the two already have an alliance of sorts. According to this article, “although the countries do not intend in principle to enter into a formal military alliance, it is sometimes referred to as an ‘undeclared’ one.” While conceding that joint exercises are not directed against third countries, at the same time, it discusses Russia and China’s “growing ability to rebuff a common threat,” while contending that the recent increase in joint strategic exercises is intended to work out “the [repulsion] of potential aggression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ views on the potential for an outright military alliance are characteristic of Russian discourse in this area, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West. Thus, talk of an impending or outright military alliance with real mutual defense commitments should be considered mainly as a messaging exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding that these diverging views on the contribution of joint exercises to a growing military partnership between Russia and China are quite typical for both the Russian and Western analytical communities. They reflect ongoing debates within both communities about how best to characterize Russia-China relations and where they are ultimately heading. Despite the increasing levels of defense cooperation between the two countries, military relations still fall well short of an outright alliance. For example, Moscow and Beijing have not agreed to collective defense commitments, and there is little prospect that they will do so. There is likewise little prospect that the two would conduct joint military operations anytime soon, with the possible exception of Central Asia where they could conceivably act jointly to combat an armed terrorist threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, neither country has any desire to become embroiled in key disputes involving the other. Russia has no interest, for example, of becoming embroiled in a future conflict with the United States over Taiwan. China likewise has no desire of being drawn into an armed conflict with the West, for instance over Ukraine. Nor do the two countries rely on each other for extended deterrence, since both are quite capable of deterring attacks on their homelands. Based on this, the likelihood of an alliance remains low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as Vinokurov points out, military relations between Russia and China have grown beyond the “bounds of normal military cooperation,” indicating quite correctly that the two countries have grown much closer both strategically and militarily than is typical of a purely transactional relationship. Instead, military cooperation has broadened and deepened, and has become increasingly become institutionalized as both sides have continued to benefit from joint activities. Military relations are complementary, helping to strengthen the armed forces and defense industries of both countries if often in different ways. This continuing ambiguity has made it difficult for analysts in both Russia and the West to characterize Russia-China military relations and to say definitively where they are heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four articles reviewed in this paper, which are fairly representative of the Russian security community, offer fresh perspectives on Russia-China joint military exercises, even though much of what they say is already familiar to Western scholars. Most Western analysts would agree with the authors that joint exercises between the two countries are expanding. However, their papers offer deeper insights on just how they are expanding and what that portends for the future. Based on their findings, for example, they have argued persuasively that we should expect to see more joint deployments, including joint naval deployments and deployments in the transatlantic region, to highlight the growing reach of Russian and Chinese military power. They have also argued quite plausibly that we can expect joint exercises to become more balanced and more strategic in their focus, including an increase in joint exercises held on Russian and Chinese territory. They also argue quite reasonably that we can expect to see more exercises involving third parties, such as Iran. The recent joint naval exercises involving Russia, China, and South Africa are a good case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ predictions about the future direction of Russia-China joint exercises also seem quite sound, at least based on the conditions in effect when these papers were first written. At the time, joint exercises appeared poised to continue at high levels and to expand even further, and the authors have made good arguments on just how they would do so. The authors have also focused quite appropriately on the importance of messaging in joint exercises to achieve political effects, which will continue to drive and shape joint exercises. Discussions of the military benefits of joint exercises are also quite useful in highlighting aspects of joint exercises that have received less attention in the West, such as the incorporation of aerial interdiction and winter warfare. The authors have also argued persuasively that exercises are becoming more strategic while taking on greater importance for both sides, even though they have tended to overstate the importance of interoperability and the likelihood of joint operations against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the authors made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory. This is no longer a given, however, since the four articles discussed here were all written prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The events in Ukraine have a high likelihood of altering the course of Russia-China joint military exercises, if not necessarily in ways that one might expect. In the short run, Russia is likely to remain too distracted by the Ukraine conflict to sustain joint exercises with China at pre-conflict levels. In addition, the continuing drain on Russian resources, including loss of equipment and personnel, will make it more difficult for Moscow to free up forces to participate in military drills with China, although this will likely impact large-scale joint ground force exercises more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such limitations, given their military and political importance joint exercises are almost certain to continue, although they are likely to be channeled into areas less affected by the Ukraine conflict — such as counterterrorism, joint naval exercises, and table-top exercises. Based on the PRC’s continuing focus on its maritime territorial disputes and its reluctance to become embroiled in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, we could very well see an increase in joint naval exercises and joint air patrols in the Western Pacific. In this regard, the recent joint air patrols held by the two sides in May 2022 over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea are a good indication of the direction future cooperation may take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the impact on joint exercises is more uncertain. It would be easy to conclude that China would have less interest in exercising with a Russian military that has failed to perform that effectively in Ukraine. While this is possible, countervailing factors make this outcome less likely. First, for all its faults, the Russian military has acquired a great deal of hard-earned combat experience in Ukraine, especially in high-end combat operations. Even though Russian forces have suffered a number of major reverses, they have also had notable successes in Ukraine, especially in the south and increasingly in the Donbas region as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Russia’s combat experience in Ukraine especially valuable is the fact that it has been acquired against an adversary that has received extensive training and equipment from the United States and its allies. When added to its recent military experience in Syria, the low-scale war it waged in Ukraine from 2014 until February 2022, and its 2008 campaign in Georgia, Russia will have much to offer China regarding the latest U.S./NATO weapons and tactics. These lessons would be especially valuable for the PRC, a country that has not engaged in serious armed conflict since its 1979 campaign in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are few countries outside of Russia that could serve as an effective partner for China for conducting complex joint military exercises. No other country willing to exercise with China has anywhere near the kinds of military capabilities and experience held by the Russia military. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the very military challenges that Russia has encountered in Ukraine — so clearly linked to the vigorous Western military backing received by Ukraine — represent a common security challenge for both Russia and China. Developing realistic military solutions to counter future direct or proxy confrontations with the West as informed by the Ukraine conflict will provide a strong incentive for Russia and China to maintain or even expand their current level of defense cooperation, with joint exercises likely to play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed a considerable strengthening of relations between China and Russia. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s decision to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin and issue a historic joint statement in February 2022 — just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine — was widely seen as a signal that China is doubling down on the China-Russia relationship. Beijing’s subsequent refusal to criticize Russia’s invasion further solidified this view in the United States and its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military cooperation through joint exercises has been an important driver behind the strengthening of the China-Russia bilateral relationship. Unlike Russian arms sales to China, which have waxed and waned in importance over the years, China-Russia joint military exercises have remained a robust area of military cooperation. Between 2003 and 2021, the two countries participated in over 60 military exercises, including both bilateral and multilateral exercises. The overwhelming majority of these were held since 2013. Early signs indicate that Beijing and Moscow are continuing to prioritize joint exercises, even in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: the two countries participated in a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Western Pacific just three months after the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several different factors drive China’s participation in joint exercises with Russia. First, Chinese strategists consider joint exercises a unique means for the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to gain overseas operational experience. In the early years of China-Russia joint exercises, the PLA focused on learning from the more experienced Russian military, but it has increasingly positioned itself to gain experience as an equal — or even more senior — partner. Second, authoritative Chinese writings make clear that, despite officials’ claims that exercises are not aimed at “third parties,” Beijing considers joint exercises with Russia to be an important tool of deterrence vis-à-vis the United States and its allies and partners. In recent years, the two sides have timed and positioned their exercises in response to specific geopolitical developments to maximize signaling power. Third, exercises provide a means of collectively shaping security dynamics within the region, especially through exercises linked to the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Chinese thinkers specifically see opportunities to use multilateral SCO exercises with Russia to improve China’s image among regional countries and reassure China’s neighbors about Beijing’s willingness to play a supportive role in the region. Finally, Chinese experts repeatedly point out that joint exercises with Russia play an important role in strengthening and sustaining the broader bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines each of these elements, with a focus on analyzing recent texts and statements from authoritative sources and Chinese analysts. It concludes with an examination of broader implications and potential trends that may emerge within China-Russia joint military exercises, especially in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaining-military-experience&quot;&gt;Gaining Military Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, which has not engaged in a large-scale military conflict in more than four decades, military exercises with Russia are a unique opportunity to gain military experience. Science of Military Strategy, an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University, details the benefits of joint exercises to China’s broader military modernization efforts. It notes that, through joint exercises, the PLA “can not only understand the geographical conditions or sea conditions of overseas mission areas, but also accumulate troop training experience, cultivate joint operations awareness, and improve the organization and command capabilities of command agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting joint exercises with Russia enables the PLA to gain experience in operating in areas far beyond China’s borders. In 2015, the two countries participated in joint naval drills in the Mediterranean Sea focused on navigation safety, at-sea replenishment, escort missions, and live fire exercises. China and Russia had previously held naval exercises in the waters of the Pacific but had not ventured as far as the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises also offer the PLA opportunities to gain operational experience in a growing variety of domains. The first several exercises between China and Russia were largely land-based and focused on counterterrorism operations. However, recent years have seen China and Russia significantly widen the aperture of their exercises. The two countries held their first joint naval exercise in 2012 and have conducted several since. In October 2021, China and Russia conducted their first joint naval patrol, which Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy, described as being of “vital importance” for practicing real-world drills. China and Russia also expanded their cooperation into conducting joint aerial patrols over the Western Pacific Ocean. The first of these came in 2019, with three additional patrols in 2020, 2021, and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts do not consider joint exercises to be vanity projects; they describe the exercises as having substantive value. An article in the Chinese military magazine Tanks and Armored Vehicles describes joint exercises with Russia as “highly practical” and featuring “joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities.” Chinese experts also frequently emphasize the benefits that the PLA can reap by learning from the Russian military’s decades of experience competing with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this dynamic is evolving as the PLA’s capabilities grow and as China widens its lead over Russia in terms of overall national power. Instead of focusing on how China can learn from Russia, Chinese commentators now often emphasize that both sides can benefit from military exercises, with Russia learning from operating with China’s more modernized forces. For example, a 2016 commentary notes that the Russian naval fleet is largely comprised of outdated Soviet-era vessels and equipment, while Chinese vessels have largely been built in the twenty-first century. Another Chinese expert argues that Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.” This analysis concludes, “[Chinese] composite battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance,” but it acknowledges Russian BTGs have the advantage of being battle-tested, while Chinese battalions do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, China has begun to flip the status quo by taking on a leading role in exercises while Russia participates from a more junior position. The “Zapad/Interaction-2021” exercise (also known in Chinese as “Western-Joint 2021”) was the first major example of this. Official PLA media described it as the first time that Russian forces participated in exercises held entirely in China and led by the PLA, and that Russian forces used Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and an expert on Russian military issues, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction-2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and an opportunity to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-the-united-states-and-its-allies&quot;&gt;Deterring the United States and Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend in China-Russia joint exercises is an increased willingness to use the exercises in a more provocative manner to signal to third parties. Chinese officials and state-run media sources have frequently asserted that joint exercises with Russia are for bilateral purposes and not aimed at third parties. In the runup to the first China-Russia bilateral exercise, Peace Mission 2005, China’s then-defense minister Cao Gangchuan stated that military cooperation (including joint exercises) “is not targeted at any third party,” and instead it “serves the interest of regional and world peace.” China’s Ministry of National Defense spokesman Wu Qian made very similar statements about a recent May 2022 joint air patrol, emphasizing the patrol “did not target any third party, and has nothing to do with the current international and regional situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, authoritative sources indicate the opposite is true. China’s Science of Military Strategy includes an entire section on the role of military exercises within its chapter on strategic deterrence. The 2020 version of the textbook states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military exercises against specific threats are not only effective methods of military training but also an important way to implement strategic deterrence . . . The exercise not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions and making it difficult to determine whether we are conducting routine training, maintaining close diplomatic relations, or taking the opportunity to move into actual combat operations, thereby causing psychological panic and conduct a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts and commentators also frequently contradict official statements. Qin An, director of the China Institute of Cyberspace Strategy and a frequent commentator on foreign policy issues, notes that large-scale exercises with Russia showcase the countries’ “determination and will” and play a role in deterring adversaries. He specifically highlights the “strategic significance” of the exercises in warning the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals. Amid negotiations over the first China-Russia bilateral exercise (Peace Mission 2005), Beijing sought to hold the exercise in Fujian Province, the closest mainland Chinese province to Taiwan. Russia pushed back in fear of escalation and being pulled into a Taiwan Strait conflict, and the two sides eventually settled on holding exercises in Shandong Province, well to the north of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid growing tensions with the United States and its allies, China and Russia have demonstrated their willingness to use joint exercises in more targeted ways in response to specific geopolitical developments. Just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, a naval military exercise, in the South China Sea. Both countries stated this exercise was not directed at a third country, but the uniqueness of the exercise and its timing were widely seen as a response to the tribunal’s ruling; Joint Sea 2016 remains the only naval exercise the two countries have held in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (Quad) in Tokyo. The patrol — which included four Chinese H-6 bombers, two Russian Tu-95 bombers, and one Russian Il-20 electronic intelligence aircraft — passed through the air defense identification zones of Japan and South Korea, leading both countries to scramble their own planes. Chinese officials maintain this was a regular exercise that has taken place every year since 2019. However, the timing of the patrol, coupled with the fact that all three previous aerial patrols were held in the second half of the year, made it clear the exercises were directed at the Quad summit. The patrol was also the first joint exercise since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and was therefore widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s continued alignment with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shoring-up-regional-stability-and-security&quot;&gt;Shoring Up Regional Stability and Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third major driver for China is a desire to use joint exercises with Russia to shape security dynamics within China and along its periphery. This includes deterring perceived terrorist or separatist threats and reassuring neighboring countries of Chinese and Russian intentions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deterring the United States and its allies, China and Russia both seek to use joint exercises to deter perceived internal and external threats from terrorism and separatism. Beijing and Moscow share similar threat assessments that the United States and its allies aim to encircle and isolate China and Russia and undermine them by provoking “color revolutions.” China is particularly worried about the possibility of instability or separatist activity spilling over from Central and South Asia into its western Xinjiang and Tibet regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SCO is an important part of Beijing’s efforts to counter these perceived threats. China’s Science of Military Strategy predicts that counterterrorism will continually grow in importance for China, and it notes that strengthening SCO-related counterterrorism exercises will be a key factor in responding to the threat. From Beijing’s perspective, large and complex exercises with Russia (and other SCO countries) help to prepare China and partner countries to deal with these issues while also deterring would-be terrorist or separatist groups that might threaten stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, bilateral and multilateral exercises with Russia play a role in shaping perceptions within governments in the region. First and foremost, they aim to help convince neighboring countries that China and Russia have both the capability and the will to address threats to security and stability in the region. Joint exercises simultaneously aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s intentions. China’s Science of Military Strategy emphasizes that China must go to lengths to ensure that it adheres to international laws, norms, and procedures in conducting exercises with regional partners, since doing so increases those countries’ perceptions that China respects them and their interests. In this light, joint exercises are viewed by China as not just a practical means of enhancing operational capabilities but also an important tool for peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supporting-the-broader-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Supporting the Broader China-Russia Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Chinese commentary puts it, joint exercises are “the most sensitive activity two countries can partake in.” Thus, they naturally play an important role in building trust between the Chinese and Russian strategic communities and strengthening the broader China-Russia bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese and Russian leaders have repeatedly stressed that they share a strong relationship, there is nevertheless a considerable amount of distrust between them. In particular, Moscow harbors concerns about Chinese theft of Russian intellectual property (IP) with respect to military technologies and worries that China may ultimately seek to capitalize on its IP thefts to compete with Russia in the global arms market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises can overcome some distrust by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels between the Chinese and Russian military and strategic communities. Recent joint exercises such as Zapad/Interaction-2021 witnessed the two militaries not just jointly conducting exercises but actively collaborating in planning and commanding the exercises. Exercises also afford opportunities for the two countries’ military leaders to meet and publicly demonstrate high-level cooperation. Following major military exercises in 2018, Central Military Commission vice chairman Zhang Youxia and Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu met for talks in Beijing. In a statement following the meeting, Zhang commented that the “China–Russia comprehensive strategic coordination partnership has reached an all-time high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercises also enable China and Russia to increase trust and transparency by demonstrating their military equipment to each other, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of their forces. Several important Chinese platforms participated in the Zapad/Interaction-2021, including the KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones. All in all, official Chinese media note that more than 80 percent of the Chinese equipment used in the exercise was new, giving Russia a close-up look at some of China’s most advanced systems. Russia has taken this a step further by intentionally using certain equipment, such as the advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in exercises with China with the hopes of selling those items to the PLA. In this way, exercises play an important part in building trust and transparency within the broader bilateral relationship, but they also directly facilitate other forms of military-to-military cooperation, such as arms sales and high-level exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that there are limitations at play. One issue is the language barrier that exists between their militaries. Unlike North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, which typically conduct exercises in a shared language (English), China and Russia communicate using their respective languages. The PLA has insisted this is a non-issue and that “soldiers from the two countries could communicate with body language, simple English and even eye contact.” There have also been reports of Chinese officers learning Russian for certain joint military exercises. However, during the Zapad/Interaction-2021 exercises, the two countries used a bilingual command information system to ensure that both sides were able to fully understand commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-and-potential-emerging-trends&quot;&gt;Implications and Potential Emerging Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises remain an important and enduring element of the China-Russia relationship. Analysts of both China and Russia should continue monitoring China-Russia exercises for new and emergent trends. This is especially important in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine — the impacts of which continue to ripple around the world. So far, there is no evidence that the war has had any specific effect on joint exercises. The timing and nature of the May 2022 joint aerial patrol suggest that, for now, the two sides are compartmentalizing the war so as not to disrupt exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, however, that the war could have consequences for China-Russia joint exercises in the medium to long term. The Russian military has performed remarkably poorly in Ukraine — even after revising its initial disastrous approach to focus on more limited aims — and the war has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Beijing assesses Russia’s performance in Ukraine to be bad enough, that could compel China to rethink the educational and training value of joint exercises with Russia. It may even lead China to question the overall value of its strategic ties with Russia. In the long term, a deeply weakened and overstretched Russian military could compound this by lacking the capacity to carry out large-scale exercises with any frequency. In one scenario, this may lead China and Russia to pivot toward narrower, smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling — like the recent aerial patrols. In another scenario, the two sides could continue with their existing pace and scale of exercises, but with China more consistently leading as the senior military partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth noting that China and Russia may face an increasingly competitive environment with respect to military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region as European countries step up their military and security presence there. In 2021, the United Kingdom sent a carrier strike group to the region for the first time since 1997. The deployment saw Royal Navy vessels participating in multilateral exercises in the Philippine Sea, alongside U.S., Japanese, Canadian, Dutch, and New Zealand naval forces. The war in Ukraine could unexpectedly catalyze Europe’s turn to the Asia-Pacific region: when NATO foreign ministers met in April 2022 to address the war in Ukraine, they also voiced calls to counter Russian aggression in the Asia-Pacific by partnering with regional countries on issues including cybersecurity, emerging technologies, and maritime security (among others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased European presence in the region — on top of the already large U.S. and allied presence — would be an unwelcome development for Beijing and Moscow and could ultimately impact China-Russia joint exercises in the area going forward. If exercises become more politically focused and both countries are facing what they view to be a more hostile and competitive environment, it is possible they could ramp up the frequency of exercises to demonstrate their joint resolve and unity in the face of perceived threats — assuming that Russia has the capacity. If both countries continue to deepen their strategic relationship and partnership, they may also be open to engaging in exercises in areas that they may have previously deemed too sensitive, such as those closer to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late February 2022, during the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian space agency Roscosmos made several announcements that weakened space relations with the United States and European countries. The agency canceled a launch of British commercial satellites unless certain conditions were met, including the UK government’s financial withdrawal from the company. It also announced it was suspending cooperation with European partners in organizing space launches from French Guinea. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the agency, said that the United States could no longer participate in a planned Russian mission to Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by statements from Rogozin and the agency, the rapid deterioration of relations with the West since February 2022 has accelerated a trend of increased Sino-Russian collaboration in space. Instead of partnering with the United States, Rogozin ordered his team to coordinate with Beijing for deep space missions. When discussing sanctions from Western countries that would target supplies of microelectronics necessary for spacecraft, he also emphasized Russia’s relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, this intensifying cooperation poses several challenges. Heightened Russian and Chinese space collaboration could enable U.S. strategic competitors to achieve more capable and integrated space systems and could complicate agreements on space security issues. However, the development is not all negative. Like the United States, China has pursued international space partnerships in recent years. Given Russia’s reduced standing in the world as a result of its war in Ukraine, Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow could make it harder for China to recruit other countries to collaborate. This dynamic could eventually push China away from Russia, opening possibilities for more negotiations on space security issues between Washington and Beijing. In short, the space relationship between Russia and China could take different turns, which could present challenges and opportunities for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-and-chinas-space-collaboration&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Space Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Chinese space collaboration falls into two categories: (1) technology and capability development and (2) space diplomacy. While some of the joint space diplomatic efforts date back at least to the early 2000s, much of the technology and capability development collaboration has been more recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-and-capability-development&quot;&gt;Technology and Capability Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s cooperation on space technology and capabilities has grown partly out of necessity. U.S. and Russian scholars and experts attribute this increasing cooperation, at least in part, to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Prior to that, the United States and Russia had enjoyed an effective and expansive space partnership, highlighted in 1993 when President Bill Clinton invited Russia to join the International Space Station (ISS) program as a full partner. Although the countries remained partners on the ISS after the Crimea invasion, their broader space relationship has suffered. Reduced U.S.-Russian space collaboration created an opening for China, which the United States had excluded from the ISS and from other joint civil space activity. Since 2014, space cooperation between Russia and China has, according to Russian space experts, “further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined.” The technical collaboration has made sense: China has ample resources and has been willing to engage extensively with Russia, and Russia has 70 years of experience and expertise to offer Beijing’s rapidly developing space program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early area for cooperation was on navigation satellites. Both Russia and China have global navigation satellite systems: GLONASS (Russian) and BeiDou (Chinese). In 2014, the two countries established a senior-level committee on “strategic cooperation in satellite navigation.” The committee formed working groups that covered compatibility and interoperability, augmentation and station construction, monitoring and assessment, and joint applications. In 2019, the two countries jointly developed a multi-frequency radio chip designed to support both satellite constellations. In the same year, Russia passed a law establishing cooperation between Russia and China on using GLONASS and BeiDou for peaceful purposes. In 2021, the Russian space agency announced that Russia would start placing GLONASS ground stations in China, while China would start placing BeiDou ground stations in Russia. This cooperation reflects increasing partnership on capabilities that are important for both civil and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where Russia and China have collaborated recently is deep space. In March 2021, the two countries signed a historic agreement to build a base on the moon together. They have also signed agreements to create a joint lunar and deep space data center with hubs in both Russia and China, and they plan to cooperate on each other’s missions to survey the lunar south pole. As some Russian thinkers argue, Russia’s deepening links with China in this area may be driven by a desire to not get left behind technologically as other powers pay closer attention to space beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit for scientific and military purposes. This collaboration is also striking because space exploration has historically been an area in which Russia and the United States have collaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sino-Russian space partnership could also be extending to strategic military capabilities. Both Russian and Chinese outlets have reported that Russia is helping China develop a space-based missile warning system. Currently, only the United States and Russia have space-based missile warning systems, although other countries have expressed interest in developing their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of burgeoning Russian and Chinese space cooperation. In August 2017, Russia and China signed a five-year agreement to continue collaborating in space from 2018 to 2022. In a 2019 meeting on space cooperation, they reaffirmed support for mutual endeavors in remote sensing, rocket engines and launch vehicles, and low-orbit satellite communications systems. The two countries reportedly are nearing another five-year agreement, to be signed in 2023, to outline their commitment to continue working together in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way in which Russia and China have cooperated on space issues is through diplomacy. In 2002, the two countries submitted a joint working paper focused on preventing the deployment of weapons in space to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. The working paper served as the basis for a draft treaty that Russia and China introduced in 2008 called the “Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects,” commonly known as PPWT. In 2014, Russia reintroduced a revised version of PPWT. Due to objections from the United States and other countries, these proposals have not made progress in the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine that PPWT could ever turn into an international agreement. The aim of the proposal is to prohibit weapons from being deployed in space but not to ban weapons that could target objects in space. The treaty would omit any restriction on ground-based anti-satellite weapons, which both Russia and China have tested in the last two decades and which are often characterized as the most likely kinetic threat to space systems. Further, prohibiting weapons in space is difficult to verify because virtually anything in space could be used as a weapon. Space robots can refuel spacecraft to extend a satellite’s life — or tear the solar panels off to kill it. Lasers can provide rapid and secure communications — or destroy sensors and other delicate satellite systems. More generally, given the speeds with which objects travel in space, something as small as five centimeters in diameter could produce an amount of energy comparable to being hit by a bus. Given these limitations, the United States and other countries will likely remain unpersuaded by PPWT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it will likely never become a treaty, PPWT has become a political tool for Russia and China. In 2014, 125 countries voted for PPWT; in contrast, only three countries voted with the United States against it. Both Russia and China point to the proposal as evidence that they support peaceful purposes of outer space in contrast with the United States, which they accuse of “weaponizing” space. They have used the treaty and their rhetoric to deflect from their own activities. After Russia’s anti-satellite weapon test in November 2021, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on the United States to negotiate over PPWT, a document that “Russia and China are proposing to prevent this arms race and which the U.S. cannot accept.” In May 2021, China’s space policies drew criticism because a Chinese rocket body was falling uncontrollably back to Earth, which could have caused damage depending on where it crashed. Asked about the measures China was taking to deal with the falling rocket, a Chinese spokesperson responded: “As a principle, China is committed to the peaceful use of outer space and believes we should conduct international cooperation in this area.” Of course, a commitment to peaceful uses of outer space has little to do with inappropriate disposal of a space launch vehicle that then comes hurtling back to Earth. In both these cases, PPWT and a supposed commitment to peaceful purposes of outer space provided Russia and China a rhetorical means to deflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing Sino-Russian space cooperation has concerning implications for transatlantic security. It means these U.S. competitors are becoming more capable and integrated. It also makes it harder for the United States and its allies to negotiate with either country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear complication for the United States of Sino-Russian space cooperation is that China benefits from Russia’s expertise, and Russia benefits from China’s resources. Another complication is that this technical cooperation could lead to more integrated capabilities that could be used in war. If a war extended to space, both countries could interpret an attack on the same asset as an attack on both countries. Perhaps most worryingly, this integration could also progress to the countries collaborating on counter-space. “Defense planners need to look for indications that suggest Russia and China are moving toward cooperation in the counter-space field out of a growing fear of U.S. dominance in space,” writes Jeffrey Edmonds of the Center for Naval Analyses, warning that joint Russian-Chinese counter-space exercises “should not be discounted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian diplomatic front means that finding compromise may require convincing both countries collectively rather than convincing each one individually. Further, part of why PPWT has generated international support is that both powers have been committed to it, and in turn this international support may make both countries more likely to dismiss alternatives to PPWT — even if those alternatives are in their interest. One such alternative was introduced by the United Kingdom: a 2021 UN resolution to establish an open-ended working group that would “make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by States to space systems.” The resolution passed in a 163-8 vote, with nine abstentions. Those opposed were Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Syria. Given that they are both space powers, Russia and China would benefit from participating in such an effort; it would seem to be in everyone’s interest to consider issues like the types of behaviors that may be perceived as threatening if not accompanied by advance notice and protocols that could be put in place to lessen the likelihood of unintentional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s concerted diplomacy also leads them to defend each other’s worst actions. Russia’s 2021 anti-satellite test is a case in point. The test created thousands of pieces of debris, much of which remains in orbit; the presence of the debris degrades the operating environment for all space actors. Because the United States has the most satellites in orbit, such degradation creates a higher likelihood that one of its assets could be affected. It is also particularly harmful for China, which has the second most satellites in orbit. In fact, in January 2022, a Chinese satellite was reported to have experienced a near miss with a piece of debris created by Russia’s test. But even in this instance, China refrained from publicly blaming its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-dynamic&quot;&gt;Evolving Dynamic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space dynamic between Russia, China, and the United States — which has changed considerably in recent years — could change further because of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine. According to some Russian space experts, Russia’s interest in close collaboration with China on space issues is likely to remain strong. The partnership has brought Russia more resources for space ventures and more support for arms control proposals targeted at the United States. Any rupture in this partnership could undermine Russia’s goal of remaining a leading space nation and weaken its space diplomatic agenda. What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the desire to continue along a course of cooperation with China is driven in part by necessity. Sanctions levied against Russian companies are bound to limit Russia’s capacity to provide commercial space services — which some Russian thinkers considered as a way to sustain Russia’s space program in the long term — and the already low level of state funding for space ventures could attenuate further as Russia’s economy contracts. In this context, funding from China — and to a lesser extent, other countries with nascent space programs — is crucial for Russia to meet its space ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, there is a considerable downside to further integration with Russia’s space efforts. China is actively pursuing space partnerships and wants to be recognized as a world leader in space. It has space research cooperative agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, France, and Malaysia, among other countries. Such partnerships offer important advantages, including being able to spread the cost of operating in space or the cost of developing a capability. Also, in a crisis or war, a country may be less likely to attack a spacecraft that could be owned by or supporting multiple countries than a spacecraft that is owned by and supporting only one country. Because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, countries and companies are severing ties with Russia. As a result, the more China integrates with Russia in space — the more the two countries are perceived as inseparable — the harder it may be for China to recruit new partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, China could follow the precedent set in 2014. When Russia annexed Crimea, China seized the opportunity, establishing more technical cooperation with Russia on space and filling the void left by the United States and others. Because integration with Russia could weaken China’s ability to become a global leader in space, however, China could distance itself from Russia instead. China may not need as much technical assistance as it did in 2014, and Russia’s standing in the world is much lower now than it was then. Along these lines, Todd Harrison, then the director for the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “China seems to be very tactical and pragmatic with the agreements that they make, and I don’t know that Russia has that much to offer anymore, especially after this [invasion of Ukraine]. . . . And there’s a lot of baggage that’s going to come with partnering with Russia from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China did reduce its space cooperation with Russia, that could offer an opportunity for more dialogue with the United States. This is not going to lessen all tensions between the two countries, but it could create some meaningful discussions on space. Newsweek reported in December 2021 that the Biden administration is considering approaching China on bilateral space arms control. Less ambitious measures could be valuable as well. With the amount of activity in space increasing dramatically, the need for mundane principles and rules — along the lines of maritime right-of-way rules — is becoming more important, particularly between the two countries with the most assets in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should pay close attention to the space relationship between Russia and China. A tighter connection will pose considerable challenges, such as potential adversaries developing more sophisticated and integrated systems and maintaining a diplomatic front that impedes efforts to establish norms, rules, and principles on space behavior. A more detached relationship could create auspicious circumstances for bilateral negotiation between China and the United States. The United States would benefit from considering the options and consequences that come with these different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-russia-cooperation-in-space&quot;&gt;China-Russia Cooperation in Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality behind the Speeches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;marc-julienne&quot;&gt;Marc Julienne&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia cooperation in space has been increasing for the past two decades. This cooperation accelerated after the Crimea crisis in 2014 and culminated with the announcement in 2021 of the joint construction of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Yet, behind the hype around the countries’ “rock-solid friendship,” the reality of this bilateral cooperation is more complex. Space cooperation is very strong when it comes to diplomacy, but it has proven to be limited in technical terms. Overall, the ambitious space partnership touted by China and Russia may well be exaggerated, considering three factors: Russian space budgets have been declining for years; the war in Ukraine will most likely undermine Russia’s budget and technical means for space even further; and China and Russia have persisting mistrust that tends to slow down any real, integrated technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly based on Chinese sources, this paper intends to assess the bilateral partnership in space from a Chinese perspective, going through the historical background, the current cooperation programs, and the two countries’ common front in space diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-history-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-space&quot;&gt;The History of China-Russia Cooperation in Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many other domains of the China-Russia bilateral relationship, there are two distinctive phases of cooperation: before and after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade of intense scientific and technical cooperation in the 1950s, all cooperation abruptly ceased as a result of the Sino-Soviet split in 1960. It was not until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that both countries embraced a fresh start. In 1992, they signed the intergovernmental “Agreement about the Cooperation on Research and Peaceful use of Outer Space,” which was followed by a similar protocol signed between the China National Space Agency (CNSA) and the Russian Space Agency (now known as the Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos) in 1994. A cooperation agreement on piloted spaceflight was signed in 1996, just four years after China launched its piloted space program. This represented a much more concrete step compared to the two previous agreements. It allowed China to benefit from Russia’s assistance for the development of its own spacecraft — the Shenzhou — based on the Soyuz design, as well as space suits and training for Chinese taikonauts. This cooperation enabled China to conduct four unmanned flight tests of the Shenzhou spacecraft between 1999 and 2003 and its first manned mission, Shenzhou-5, in October 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of closer cooperation in space continued throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2000, the two countries brought their space dialogue to a more regular basis with the establishment of the China-Russia Space Cooperation Sub-Committee, held during the annual meetings of their prime ministers. In 2007, they signed an agreement on the joint exploration of Mars, with China being a minor contributor. The Russian Fobos-Grunt mission consisted of a sample return from the Martian moon Phobos; it was supposed to carry a Chinese probe (Yinghuo-1) into Mars’s orbit, but it failed shortly after launch in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bilateral cooperation developed effectively from the 1990s to the 2010s, it remained a mostly commercially oriented relationship, wherein Russia sold technology and know-how to China within certain limits. As He Qisong and Ye Nishan from the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai noted in an August 2021 paper, China-Russia space cooperation “lacked depth” before 2014 and did not match the level of the political engagement officially declared by the two sides; it existed merely at a “superficial level” (浅层次).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for limited cooperation at the time was Russia’s lack of will to engage in a close partnership with China. Moscow simply did not want China to progress too quickly and eventually catch up and outperform Russia. Wang Ye and Zhou Yuan, from the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), write that “the Russian government became increasingly cautious about cooperating with China’s space program, mainly for fear of creating a formidable space competitor, and also for the fear of angering the United States, the most important space partner at the time.” A December 2006 public statement by the then-head of Roscosmos, Anatoly Perminov, confirmed this assessment: “Russia will cooperate with China on space projects but will not transfer sensitive technologies that could enable Beijing to become a rival in a future space race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a major turn in Russia’s overall relationship with China. Moscow found itself isolated diplomatically and faced a wave of sanctions from Western countries as well as from Japan, which were directed in part against its space industry. Moscow then turned to Beijing for political and economic support — albeit at the cost of several concessions, like the transfer of technology in sensitive sectors, including weaponry and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China had a significant interest in collaborating more closely with Russia, as the Wolf Amendment passed by the U.S. Congress in 2011 excluded China from any project involving NASA (including the International Space Station), and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) prohibited any export or reexport of U.S. space technology or components to China. As the Russian space industry found itself targeted by sanctions after 2014 and Russia-U.S. space cooperation was drastically undermined, Moscow had an incentive to seek deeper cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contemporary-space-cooperation-great-announcements-but-limited-technical-cooperation&quot;&gt;Contemporary Space Cooperation: Great Announcements but Limited Technical Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Crimea crisis, the two countries pushed forward their cooperation in space in the fields of global navigation satellite systems, lunar exploration, and military space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIDOU-GLONASS SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, Moscow and Beijing established the Russia-China Project Committee on Important Strategic Cooperation in Satellite Navigation, which convenes annually to study the integration potential of BeiDou and GLONASS constellations. The committee is divided into four working groups: compatibility and interoperability, enhanced system and station construction, monitoring and evaluation, and joint application. This led to the signature by Prime Ministers Li Keqiang and Dimitry Medvedev in November 2018 of the Cooperation Agreement on the Peaceful Use of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which aimed to guide joint work on the compatibility (ability to use one system or another) and interoperability (ability to use both systems at the same time, providing better accuracy) of the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, the two countries adopted the “2021–2025 China-Russia Roadmap for Cooperation in Satellite Navigation” to further advance their joint work in this field. According to the road map, each country is expected to deploy BeiDou and GLONASS ground stations in the other country. Roscosmos announced that Russian ground stations would be located in Shanghai, Urumqi (northwestern Xinjiang region), and Changchun (northeastern Jilin Province), while Chinese ground stations would be placed at Obninsk (near Moscow), Irkutsk (Baikal Lake area), and Petropavlovsk-Kamtchatski (Kamchatka Peninsula). A further step toward the integration of Russian and Chinese satellite constellations took place with the signature of the Cooperation Agreement on Time Interoperability of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which occurred on the sidelines of the bilateral summit between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin in Beijing on February 4, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite guiding a range of joint Sino-Russian activities in space, few details are available on the 2021–2025 roadmap. It remains unclear how the two countries will overcome the important technical obstacles to achieve full interoperability between the two constellations. Nevertheless, if successfully achieved, the interoperability between BeiDou and GLONASS would allow better performance and a wider range (GLONASS covering higher northern regions and BeiDou lower southern regions), which could have an effect on each country’s military capabilities, as it would improve missile guidance and positioning for troops, military vehicles, and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOON EXPLORATION: THE ILRS PROJECT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most emblematic aspect of space cooperation between China and Russia is exploration of the moon, under the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. The two countries have discussed the possibility of cooperation in this area for more than 15 years, but it materialized only in March 2021 with the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Construction of the ILRS. The project is highly ambitious, consisting of lunar-orbit and lunar-based facilities for a manned mission, with the first modules to be launched in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the project has attracted significant attention, an analysis of available official documentation on the ILRS reveals certain important inconsistencies. First, the plan provided by the CNSA and Roscosmos to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) in August 2021 schedules five lunar missions (two Chinese, three Russian) by 2025. This sounds rather ambitious, considering the state of Russian space industry and budget — and the fact that Russia’s last moon mission, Luna 24, took place in 1976. Nonetheless, during a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in April 2022, Putin reaffirmed that he would “restore the moon program” and that “by the third quarter [of this year] the Luna-25 mission must be complete” (although it was initially planned for 2016). This may prove to be a challenge for Russia, considering the global geopolitical context and the sanctions against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, according to the plan, the first ILRS module (launched by a Chinese rocket) is expected to land on the moon in the early 2030s. All following modules (ILRS-2 through ILRS-5) will be launched alternatively by Russian and Chinese launchers by 2035. Among these five ILRS missions, the emphasis is put on lunar surface facilities, but little is said about the circumlunar space station, which would be instrumental to developing facilities on the surface of the moon and would need to be constructed in advance of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides claim that they will cooperate on all aspects of the program, including the coordination of scientific and technical research, development, design, modeling, testing, validation, assembly of the ILRS component parts, and the launching and operation of the facilities. However, it remains unclear what specific tasks and technology each side is going to provide or how much funding each side is ready to dedicate. This raises questions about the sustainability of the program if one of the stakeholders is unable to fulfill its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these unresolved issues, in late December 2021, Roscosmos announced that China and Russia would sign in 2022 a new space cooperation program for 2023–2027, which should include further details on the plan to develop the ILRS by 2035. However, the war in Ukraine will most likely impact both the ILRS project schedule and the overall nature of bilateral cooperation in space, at least in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might wonder why China and Russia did not start by cooperating on an Earth orbit joint space laboratory before aiming at the moon. Both countries have experience and ongoing or future projects in this field. Moreover, it could have been a more easily achievable project and could have had a nearer completion date. There are several potential explanations. First, it seems that both China and Russia want to have their own independent space laboratory. Second, China wants to demonstrate that it is capable of building a space station by itself. Third, Russia may also want to maintain a degree of autonomy in space, and this is one of the few areas where it can still do so. Nevertheless, both sides have expressed willingness to cooperate in this field. In June 2021, Dimitry Rogozin revealed that talks with China are ongoing to send Russian cosmonauts onboard the Chinese Tiangong station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHINA-RUSSIA MILITARY COOPERATION IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Beijing claim to be improving their military space cooperation, though it is difficult to assess its depth and nature. One component is the information exchange mechanism provided by the 2009 Agreement on Mutual Notification of Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Vehicle Launches. By preventing miscalculation, this agreement favors mutual trust and security between the two countries. It was extended for 10 years in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia claim to cooperate in two very strategic and sensitive domains: anti-ballistic missiles and early warning systems. During the annual conference of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019, Putin revealed that Russia was helping China to build an early warning ballistic system, which would “fundamentally enhance the defense capability of China.” It is also well known that both militaries conducted joint exercises on computer-simulated ballistic missile interception in 2016, 2017, and 2019. While this is consistent with the fact that Russia has provided China with ballistic missile defense software, it remains uncertain whether Moscow would go as far as to help China develop an early warning satellite constellation or ground-based radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, from where the space dialogue started in the 1990s until today, the discourse and announcements by Russian and Chinese leaders on their flourishing cooperation does not yet match the reality of their technical collaboration, nor does it reflect their ability to commit to their joint programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy-china-russia-alignment-against-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy: China-Russia Alignment against the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to technical and scientific cooperation, space diplomacy is a field where close cooperation between China and Russia has been taking place since the end of the Cold War. Chinese experts on space emphasize this aspect of their cooperation with Russia more than they do the technical side. He and Ye’s August 2021 article, “An analysis of space cooperation between China and Russia,” devotes only 4 of its 24 pages to technical cooperation, while the rest tackles the issues of space diplomacy, space law, and the geopolitics of space. In their view, China-Russia cooperation in space is the result of improving political bilateral relations and, most importantly, changing geopolitical challenges in space, with “the U.S. strategy of space hegemony” at the top of them. The main goal of China and Russia would be to “maintain the multipolarity of space and the overall stability of the China-U.S.-Russia triangular space relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first threat China and Russia want to address is “the weaponization of space and an arms race in outer space.” The two countries blame the United States for a series of actions that they consider undermining security and stability, both in outer space and on Earth. The U.S. withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2001 and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 are cited as examples of such actions. They also condemn Washington for the development of ABM systems and their proliferation, space-based early warning sensors, and space-based missile interceptors, which they characterize as deeply destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Russia and China have been very active within multilateral forums such as the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Conference on Disarmament, and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to promote resolutions and treaties against the weaponization of outer space. The main initiative in this field is the draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT), which was first submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in 2008, where it was blocked by the U.S. delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the UNGA, Russia and China submit annual resolutions on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, the prevention of an arms race in outer space, transparency, and confidence-building measures in outer space, no first placement (NFP) of weapons in outer space, and further practical measures for the prevention of a space arms race. These resolutions are generally adopted with a large majority but are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main point of opposition that Russia and China have against the U.S. role in space is the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources, especially on the moon. They fear that the United States is seeking de facto sovereignty over the moon and other celestial bodies. He and Ye analyze that the U.S. government has adopted a four-step approach to this end. The first step was to grant ownership rights to “nongovernmental” (i.e., commercial) entities to exploit space resources through the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015. The second was to change the legal status of the moon and other celestial bodies through the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2018, which provides that “outer space shall not be considered a global commons.” The third step, according to He and Ye, was President Trump’s executive order on April 6, 2020, that rejected the Moon Agreement of 1979 (which the United States did not sign) as a customary law and confirmed that the United States does not view space as a global commons. The fourth step was the introduction of the bilateral Artemis Accords in 2020, which set a new U.S.-led framework for moon exploration. For He and Ye, these accords “constitute a ‘space version of NATO’ in an attempt to seize lunar sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chinese experts, however, the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources does not seem to be as important as the weaponization of space. In fact, some scholars, including international law professor Ma Chengyuan from China University of Political Science and Law, are rather understanding of the U.S. position, pointing to loopholes in international law on the question of exploitation of extraterrestrial resources. They also acknowledge that formulating a new treaty in the next few years is unrealistic, considering the expected opposition from countries that lack the ability to exploit such resources. This rather soft approach on resource exploitation was also reflected by the lack of any mention of this issue in the China-Russia joint statement of February 4, 2022 — whereas the document devoted two full paragraphs to the prevention of weaponizing outer space. This can be explained by the fact that both China and the United States are well aware that counting on international law is a dead end to legally exploit space resources. In this sense, the U.S. unilateral approach to lunar exploitation is an example that is likely to be replicated by China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;three-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Three Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERSISTING MISTRUST BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind what China presents as a “rock-solid friendship,” it is worth keeping in mind that Sino-Russian relations are not without divergences. The relationship is often described in official discourse as “at its best in history.” However, as Yang Cheng, professor at the Shanghai International Studies University and a specialist on China-Russia relations, notes: “‘the best’ does not mean that there are no flaws in the cooperation.” Considering the rocky history of bilateral ties in the Soviet era, the relationship has indeed improved significantly, but it is still far from an alliance. It is closer to tactical solidarity than mutual trust, and in the field of space, it is closer to a diplomatic alignment than full scientific and technical integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis. He and Ye, for instance, underline that “the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry, and the aging and loss of scientific and technical personnel, including in the space field, have further led to the slow development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and even to difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities. The progress of space projects, especially large-scale ones, is lagging behind expectations, or even seriously behind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, He and Ye note, the number of Russian satellites in orbit has not increased by much in the past few years (about 8 more satellites a year), while the number of U.S. and Chinese satellites has risen drastically (about 266 and 47 more satellites a year, respectively). Li Ziguo and Li Yan, both researchers at the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), also note that “according to the Global Innovation Index reports released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in recent years, China’s world ranking has continued to rise, from 29th in 2015 to 14th in 2020,” while Russia had been hovering at the 45th place between 2015 and 2019 before downgrading to 47th out of 131 countries in 2020. However, they lucidly recognize Russian excellence in basic science (six Fields Medals and five Nobel Prizes in Physics since 1991), and consider that, with limited access to Western technologies, “deepening the scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries is an inevitable choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this feeling of superiority, China also has doubts about its Russian partner. One major doubt is about Moscow’s will and means to fulfill its commitments with China. Chinese experts note that since Russia is unable to implement its own national space program, cooperative projects with China are all the more uncertain. Beijing is also aware that its space partnership with Russia depends on the state of the cooperation between Moscow and Washington; any improvement in Russia’s cooperation with Washington would mean a distancing from Beijing. Finally, Russia also cooperates with India in space. Indeed, as an emerging space power, India is very interested in Russia’s know-how, and it is an attractive partner for Russia in turn. As illustrated by the December 2021 joint statement by Putin and Narendra Modi, the two sides have committed to cooperate in human spaceflight and satellite navigation, which may represent a source of concern for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE IMPACT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2014 Crimea crisis accelerated overall cooperation between China and Russia — including in space — one may wonder about the potential consequences of the war in Ukraine for the future of the bilateral partnership. Will it open a new phase of deepening cooperation, or will it slow it down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Russia will become even more dependent on China if it wants to stay in the space race, and China will have another useful lever to impose on the orientations and the scope of the partnership. Despite the Chinese narrative of “win-win cooperation” in space, and despite the fact that Chinese experts present bilateral cooperation as “highly complementary,” one should expect that Russian cooperation with China will mostly fuel the latter’s space program and ambitions, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the war in Ukraine may also put a stop to China-Russia cooperation in space, and to the ILRS project more specifically. Russia’s space industry was already in a dire situation before the war, and now it is in a critical position after new waves of sanctions and being cut off from cooperation with Western space powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE NEED FOR MULTILATERALISM AND STRONGER WESTERN ALTERNATIVES IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian rapprochement in space geopolitics has taken advantage of the vacuum left by the United States and other space powers in international forums. While the joint PPWT proposal is far from acceptable due to its many loopholes (e.g., the lack of definition of a weapon in outer space, the exclusion of ground-based anti-space weapons, and the absence of a control mechanism), no alternative was offered by Western countries to develop an international legislative framework to address the weaponization of space. The sole exception is the European Union International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, which was submitted in 2010 but remains in limbo today. The lack of counterproposal to the PPWT fuels Moscow and Beijing’s narrative of the United States’ unilateral weaponization of outer space — a view that is widely supported at the UNGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the United States is indeed taking a unilateral path — by adopting federal laws on celestial bodies. This approach undermines international law and multilateralism. Denying space as a global commons, in a time when the importance of protecting the environment — including in outer space — is matter of survival, is a dangerously anachronistic approach. This perspective encourages the perception of outer space as a “new frontier” to conquer and colonize, which legitimizes the unregulated space race. It harms multilateralism and threatens the preservation of peace and stability in outer space and on Earth. To meet the challenges brought by the Sino-Russian rapprochement in space affairs, an approach that emphasizes more transatlantic coordination and multilateralism is far more likely to succeed than the current unilateral framework embraced by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “global hybrid war” is a vision of future global war led by the United States and its allies primarily against Russia, but in a later phase also targeting China. As defined by Alexandr Bartosh, a corresponding member of the Academy of Military Science and the most visible advocate of the hybrid war concept in Russia, the global hybrid war is a protracted, multilevel military conflict between civilizations. The term “hybrid” refers to the simultaneous and coordinated use of military and non-military (e.g., economic, financial, technological, or informational) means of warfare. In general, this type of war is about control of natural resources, spheres of political influence, and competition over technological leadership in the greater Eurasian region, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In a narrower sense, argues Bartosh, the global hybrid war aims to achieve the “liquidation of the Russian statehood, its disintegration and external control of the country.” In his view, the next targets after Russia will be China and India, the two geopolitical contenders that would remain on the sidelines of the conflict between Russia and the West. Bartosh argues that “Russia and its allies should carefully study global hybrid warfare and develop corresponding offensive and defensive strategies in the interests of ensuring national and international security.” But what does this suggestion for closer cooperation in the hybrid sphere mean in practical terms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of questions explored in this article considers China’s role in this arrangement. For example, if the global hybrid war is ultimately a conflict between civilizations, as Bartosh suggests, does this imply a potential conflict between Russia and China as well? Or is this difficult question omitted, and cooperation is legitimized on the basis of traditional great power interests? Recently, Russian scholars have put an emphasis on “mental war” fought against “real” sovereign states, but what role do alliances play in counteracting this type of aggression? Is Russia alone in this struggle, or could China play a role in helping Russia to defend its culture, values, and traditions? An analysis of the material reveals that cooperation with China is framed positively, yet vaguely, leaving many questions still open. Before turning to a more detailed analysis of Sino-Russian cooperation in this area, it is necessary to explore the concept of global hybrid warfare and its place in Russia’s strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hybrid-war-as-a-code-word-for-the-kremlins-worldview&quot;&gt;The Hybrid War as a Code Word for the Kremlin’s Worldview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing transformation of Russia’s political environment toward a more authoritarian — even totalitarian — system, it is possible to argue that the concept of global hybrid war has evolved into a “floating signifier” similar to the concept of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet period. In his work on the history of Soviet cybernetics, Slava Gerovitch shows how Soviet science was flooded with these code words — a kind of newspeak that “blended description with evaluation,” where the meaning of each code word could “shift and change according to context and usage.” However, code words did not acquire their meaning at random; Soviet ideological language had a specific structure whereby certain phenomena or actions were assigned a strong positive or negative value. Cultural theorist Mikhail Epstein conceptualized such words as ideologemes (i.e., a fundamental unit of ideology) that “were not simply words, but concealed judgements that take the form of words.” The Soviet ideological language consisted of three different types of ideologemes (contrastive, conversive, and correlative pairs of words) that, taken together, formed a model of “Soviet Marxist ideolanguage.” The essence of the ideological language, as Epstein shows, was not to exchange information, but to control thinking and action in the Soviet politics. The Soviet regime not only defined the correct use of ideolanguage but also played it against all opponents, and thus acquired full control of the political space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis developed here is that the concept of hybrid war — and other code words related to it — is used like Soviet-era ideologemes to shape perceptions about external and internal threats toward Russia. In this context, it is possible to identify pairs of words that carry positive meaning (denoting what Russia does) and negative meaning (actions by the West).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Negative&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Hybrid war&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Active defense&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Unipolar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Multipolar&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Western cosmopolitanism&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Russian (Chinese) civilization&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Colony (formal sovereignty8)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Sovereign power (real sovereignty)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Soviet ideological language, the meaning of these contemporary word pairs is based not on a specific school of thought but on a combination of political realism (great powers have a right to rule over others), strategic culture (Russia’s imperial legacy and self-perception of exceptionalism), and what one influential analyst deemed the “Barbarossa mentality” (Russia’s traditional fear of encirclement and expectation of decisive surprise attack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power. It considers Russia’s internal political and economic weaknesses and the assumption that foreign powers are building their capabilities to further weaken Russia. This seems counterintuitive, taking into account Russia’s attempted and successful jailing, repressions, and assassinations of dissenters and its hostile operations against foreign countries. However, in the Russian view, these operations (if they are acknowledged at all) are part of the country’s “active defense” against attempts by foreign powers to subjugate Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-role-of-china-in-global-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;What Is the Role of China in Global Hybrid Warfare?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already indicated, the Russian debate on hybrid war operationalizes the sovereignty-versus-subordination dichotomy and places it in the context of global competition between the United States, China, and Russia. In an article published in 2017, Bartosh underlines how the scale of hybrid warfare encompasses not just particular countries but the entire system of international security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The growing scale of hybrid warfare waged against Russia makes this type of interstate geopolitical confrontation one of the most acute threats to national and international security. Moreover, the use of a complex of hybrid threats as an instrument of external pressure to create instability within the state is no longer just a threat to national security but a powerful destabilizing factor for the entire system of international security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In articles written after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Bartosh argues that “hybrid war is evolving into a ‘multi-dimensional inter-civilizational military conflict,’” which he calls the “global hybrid war.” Here, Bartosh draws from Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” argumentation when he asserts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;modern conflicts are moving from the classical linear paradigm to a new type of non-linear wars. The highest form of modern war is “the war of civilizations, that is, the war of the meanings of their existence.” The winner in the war of meanings does not win space or even the right to dispose of the resources of the defeated state, but wins the right to determine its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Bartosh echoes Russian official parlance that distinguishes between states with “real” sovereignty and states that are only “formally” sovereign — meaning that, in reality, they are proxies of a hegemonic power. Currently, the Kremlin uses this dichotomy primarily to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty (representing the country as a U.S. proxy). However, it also reveals an important aspect of the Kremlin worldview, according to which only the strong (“real”) states survive. Given Russia’s inherent political instability (e.g., the problem of succession), the Kremlin cannot attain the level of security it expects from “real sovereign” countries. This feeling of weakness might explain its interest in “mental warfare” and “mental security” as a new trend in contemporary warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bartosh, the two main instruments of the global hybrid war are proxy wars and color revolutions. The term proxy war is mainly used to frame Russia’s war in Ukraine (like any local conflict in Russia’s vicinity) as a conflict between the United States and Russia. Meanwhile, color revolution refers to political instability (e.g., in Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Venezuela) created by external actors that ultimately aims to weaken Russia’s position within its sphere of influence. With this framing, Russia is represented as the victim of hostilities, and the countermeasures it deploys are justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian thinkers, China appears in this arrangement as the next potential “target” of the West due to its rising status as a major power. It is also seen as Russia’s strategic partner. Russia’s relations with China are explained with reference to similarities in their “strategic culture,” such as “the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict.” This idea is far from claiming any civilizational affinity between the two countries. Instead, Sino-Russian cooperation is framed in terms of national interest and great power competition. Bartosh defines relations between the United States, Russia, and China as an increasingly unstable triangle, formed by three pairs of relations: the U.S.-China and subsequent U.S.-Russia rivalries and the Sino-Russian cooperation framework. Although the West is identified as the main source of instability and chaos due to the United States’ desire to maintain its hegemonic position, Bartosh does not consider Sino-Russian cooperation inevitable. In October 2019, he writes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Russia’s cooperation with China is framed as part of “a long-term strategy for a joint struggle” against the West. The affirmation of Sino-Russian partnership by presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in February 2022 echoes this sentiment and makes the case for increased cooperation in countering interference by outside forces. In 2019 — preceding the joint statement — Bartosh identified counteraction against hybrid aggression “as one of the steps to deepen the relations between China and Russia.” Another Russian scholar, Alexander Isaev, went further in 2018, when he argued that “there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations.” According to Isaev, this applies especially to thematic dialogues between different government agencies that ultimately “may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace.” The February 2022 joint statement includes many references to increased cooperation within the United Nations and bilaterally in the cyber sphere, which could be interpreted as confirmation of Isaev’s earlier argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in 2017, Bartosh advocated for coordinated counteraction against hybrid threats in the context of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The broad scope of collaboration could include “strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to counter hybrid threats,” he writes. Bartosh underlines the importance of the cooperation by arguing: “We should submit this as a priority project on adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO and ensuring response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions.” However, he does not develop these ideas further; instead, he calls for the more efficient use of Russia’s internal administrative and intellectual resources. His main concerns seem to be linked to insufficient doctrinal development (e.g., creating a model of hybrid warfare) and problems with inter-agency cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-limits-of-sino-russian-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Limits of Sino-Russian Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Global hybrid war” can be thought of as a code word that has multiple meanings depending on the context. Although it does not carry the weight that “Marxism-Leninism” did in Soviet ideology, certain resemblances to Soviet ideological language help explain how this concept is being used in the current context. The notion of global hybrid war reveals core assumptions regarding global politics and the perception of threats toward Russia’s national interests and security. In other words, it offers a general explanation for recurring tensions and conflicts between Russia and the West, along with the perception of enmity — or even hostility — of Western actors toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of China in this arrangement is clear, although few details on possible Sino-Russian cooperation were outlined by the authors of the materials reviewed for this chapter. China is represented as Russia’s strategic partner and the West’s potential “next target.” An interpretation of China as a potential next target places Russia at the center of the ongoing power struggle, thereby upgrading the country’s importance on the global stage. Although Russian authors frame the “global hybrid war” as a conflict between civilizations, they do not elaborate on cultural-strategic similarities between Russia and China, but rather frame the conflict in traditional security and political terms. For example, the concept of strategic culture is defined very broadly, as an attribute of Russia’s (and China’s) alleged defensive posture and the subsequent prioritization of preventing military conflicts (so-called active defense). Counteraction against hybrid threats is listed as one of the potential areas of cooperation between China and Russia. In the material studied for this chapter, the authors identify specific agencies (Ministries of Defense and Military Academies of both countries) and areas (e.g., cyber security or strategic communications) where that cooperation could take place, but they do not elaborate on possible obstacles. The recurring emphasis on improving Russia’s own capabilities in the hybrid sphere can be interpreted as a sign that Russian thinkers have low expectations for what Sino-Russian cooperation can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail that might also outline the limits of Sino-Russian cooperation is the emphasis among Russian military scholars on “mental warfare.” The concept of mental warfare carries with it an idea of total war aimed at the complete paralysis of the target country and the destruction of its political and moral will to resist conquest by a foreign power. Consequently, with the subjugation of national culture, values, and traditions, a country’s sovereignty is liquidated, and it becomes a colony or otherwise ceases to exist. In the Russian literature on mental warfare analyzed for this article, it is assumed that each country has its own “core idea”: a set of moral-ethical values and traditions, the destruction of which would lead to the loss of real sovereignty. Advocates of the mental warfare concept call for both preventative actions against presumed Western hostilities (“active defense”) and the securitization of Russia’s domestic sphere — its development in terms of Russian cultural-political traditions. Although this type of development does not exclude cooperation with foreign partners in the technological sphere (e.g., the adaptation of Chinese cyber security models into the Russian context), the center of gravity in mental warfare is Russia’s cultural-political cohesion and its ability to secure its own “real” sovereignty. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the traditional realist view of state sovereignty also limits Russia’s potential for alliance formation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;alessio-patalano&quot;&gt;Alessio Patalano&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-3&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of the joint Sino-Russian statement on February 4, 2022, raised the level of the two countries’ commitment to developing bilateral ties. The statement built upon an existing trend of increased cooperation in recent years, which had been further formalized in 2019 during the meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. The joint statement specifically indicated that Sino-Russian cooperation had now no forbidden areas. Its wording suggested nonetheless that Xi was setting a framework that would first and foremost serve his long-term ambitions for China’s process of rejuvenation. This implies that the scope of cooperation going forward — including in areas such as hybrid and gray zone tactics — is likely to be informed by Chinese ambitions and objectives over Russian ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, cooperation between China and Russia is likely to remain strategic and focused on advancing the two countries’ quest for international relevance, if not primacy as great powers. In particular, while assessments about the underlying strength of the relationship vary, developments in bilateral exercises conducted in 2021 — demonstrating greater Sino-Russian command integration — and the conduct of joint patrol activities, especially in East Asia, confirm that the military relationship is growing closer. In particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing is the senior partner in this evolving relationship. Indeed, very recently China and Russia held their annual joint exercise in the region, and this despite resource-based pressure on Russia deriving from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. These developments pose two important questions: What do recent changes in Sino-Russian military ties mean for cooperation regarding the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics, and conversely, how will hybrid and gray zone tactics help create opportunities to further advance cooperation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Chinese perspective, the answer to this line of questioning is significant, and the outcome of the war in Ukraine will inevitably affect it. Much to Chinese surprise, Russian performance in the early stages of the invasion has failed to meet Beijing’s initial expectations. As well-informed foreign observers have noted, for Beijing, Russian military operations in the opening stages of the war were inconsistent with the country’s military doctrine. In particular, the Chinese leadership has likely taken note of Russia’s failure to accurately assess potential Ukrainian opposition, not to mention the lack of adequate preparation in terms of information operations and the wider cognitive dimensions of the war. This, in turn, might lead the Chinese leadership to reconsider whether and to what extent “some limits” to cooperation on hybrid tactics are desirable, if not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the degree of cooperation between Russia and China will be affected by the outcome of the unfolding war, it is nonetheless possible to assess two relevant aspects of this question in the interim. First, it is possible to review how Chinese writers on strategy conceptualize hybrid tactics, and to what extent — if at all — they draw a distinction between hybrid and gray zone operations. Second, it is also possible to assess the extent to which such an understanding creates clear areas of opportunity in terms of cooperation with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-warfare-and-gray-zones-as-geopolitical-competition&quot;&gt;Hybrid Warfare and Gray Zones as Geopolitical Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample of Chinese writers surveyed in this project presents “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition as two different, albeit complementary, tools of geopolitical competition among states. In particular, Han Aiyong, an associate professor at the Institute of International Strategic Studies of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School, pointed out that “hybrid warfare is essentially closer to a competitive means by which great powers use indirect, low-intensity conflict to seek geopolitical advantage.” By contrast, the same author suggested that competition in the gray zone focuses more on cognitive forms of conflict, with “psychological warfare, media warfare, legal warfare, economic coercion, and even diplomatic warfare . . . intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the internal ills of competitors’ economic and social development, and to create ideological confusion and even social unrest in their favor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this conceptual framework, hybrid and gray zone tactics represent two sides of the same coin. The key difference is that hybrid tactics are designed to address the conduct of limited proxy wars, whereas gray zone tactics oversee the conduct of non-kinetic operations directly against an enemy or competitor. Such preliminary observations come with two caveats, however. First, the notions of “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition are foreign ideas imported into Russian and Chinese strategic thinking, making clear reference to their original development in the United States. Second, both concepts are presented as methods through which great powers engage in competition with each other — and specifically, how the United States engages with competitors such as Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main body of English-language literature, however, the notions of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of competition are used to capture a distinctive set of Russian and Chinese behaviors. For instance, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) vocabulary, the former term refers to forms of Russian sub-threshold coercive actions drawing upon the integration of different tools of statecraft (e.g., military, diplomatic, economic, as well as information and legal). Insofar as gray zone activities are concerned, English-language literature tends to emphasize how this concept is helpful in specifically identifying Chinese actions that are seemingly designed to remain beneath the threshold of open war. Except for very limited attempts at reconciling this intellectual separation, in the English-language literature, hybrid tactics are the prerogative of the Russian state, while the gray zone is that of China. However, this distinction finds no correlation in the Chinese presentation of these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Chinese approach to the understanding of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of conflict is based on the assumption that international relations are a persistent struggle — in other words, that they are a zero-sum interaction. As a result, Chinese authors regard these methods of competition as desirable — or even necessary — ways to enable the shaping of the international order in a fashion that is favorable to authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. This idea can be clearly inferred by the Chinese claim that the United States and its allies have developed these concepts to undermine strategic competitors in the first place, with specific attention to China and Russia. Thus, China should be able to master and respond to these forms of behavior. In one sense, however, such an intellectual approach, gauging a strong Leninist thinking, implies that China is already “at war” and that hybrid and gray area conflicts are inherent to this state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Chinese scholarship reviewed in this project, hybrid forms of conflict are designed to avoid direct confrontation among major powers. They target strategically important state actors that can either expand or maintain the reach and influence of any major power. In this respect, however, the authors draw a clear distinction about the intent behind the use of hybrid tactics. The intent behind U.S. “hybrid wars” is “offensive” and “globalist,” as the application of these tactics is designed to support and expand the country’s influence at the expense of strategic competitors like China or Russia. Russian hybrid tactics are instead defensive in nature, informed by a more limited aim of preserving Russia’s influence. Relatedly, hybrid wars, because they take actions at the periphery of major power competition, would seem to make low-intensity conflict a reality in the contemporary world. Chinese writers seem to expect low-intensity conflicts to be a component of major power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, from this perspective, a Chinese writer observes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this conceptualization, the Chinese government’s tolerance for conflict is high because it is assumed that it can be kept at acceptable levels. In part, this is acceptable because the core actions are taking place away from a major power’s territory. The same author also added that in a hybrid context, new technologies and “non-contact” forms of competition — notably conflict in digital information spaces, which includes both conflict to disrupt or manipulate network systems and conflict conducted through social media — add to the possibilities and potential of the “controlled chaos” created by hybrid tactics. In other words, these new tools allow for a more integrated and wider-ranging capacity for the conduct of hybrid wars. By the same token, new technologies also increase the likelihood of hybrid tactics being employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray zone competition shares with hybrid tactics a heightened importance of integrating and synergizing different levers of national power. Similarly, both put considerable emphasis on the advantages of non-kinetic tools for the pursuit of competition. On the other hand, gray zone competition also has two features that make it very distinct from hybrid tactics. First, its core focus rests on the creation and management — both in defensive and offensive ways — of plausible legal and political narratives to enable the pursuit of specific courses of action. Indeed, legal narratives are a significant aspect of gray zone competition in that they relate to the advantageous use of established rules and norms to constrain, shape, and sanction behavior in the pursuit of national objectives. Within this context, competition in gray areas is about manipulating and exploiting ambiguities in international frameworks to craft a favorable narrative, while discrediting or undermining those set forth by competitors. From a Chinese perspective, therefore, gray zone conflict would seemingly fall first and foremost within the realm of psychological, political, and legal warfare — a key feature of Chinese strategic thinking about war and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second distinctive aspect of gray area competition concerns the development of political narratives that specifically reinforce — or at least do not undermine — Beijing’s moral standing. In gray zone conflict, the core aim is to gain an advantage by justifying one’s actions. This is not meant solely to paralyze or limit responses to these actions; it is also meant to erode wider support that might be given to one’s competitors. This sheds new light on how Chinese writers view the utility of Beijing’s participation in multilateral institutions: they consider Chinese efforts to increase influence in these organizations as a way to guide the development of the organizations’ internal mechanisms and approaches in ways that favor Beijing’s preferences. This creates another clear distinction between gray zone activities and the objectives behind the mobilization of legal narratives in a “hybrid” conflict. As the same Chinese author remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pursuit of ambiguity in the gray zone is the use of the ambiguous space of rules and the international law system to justify one’s own behavior. Hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is to find a soft restraint on violence by established rules between the regulations of traditional and non-traditional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authors seem to understand the concept of hybrid tactics as involving competition for influence in states of strategic relevance in a competitive global environment, whereas gray zone competition may focus more directly on the competing powers themselves. Within this context, competition in the gray zone is intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the domestic and internal challenges of a major power. The idea is to weaken the competitor from within through political confusion and social unrest. The significance of such a conceptualization of gray zone competition rests also in the inference that, for Chinese authors, this type of competition is actively conducted against China, thus reinforcing their zero-sum understanding of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-against-destabilization-as-cooperation&quot;&gt;Resilience against Destabilization as Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas. The methods for such cooperation are likely to include a degree of coordination on military activities; yet, new technologies — such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence — and their potential application in shaping public audiences’ perceptions are also likely to become a primary area of Sino-Russian cooperation. Chinese authors, at least, view this type of cooperation as particularly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Chinese authors view the use of social media and information networks as essential to enhance the effect of information dissemination to create favorable international public opinion and to affect the psychological conditions of public audiences in competing countries. These tools can also be very helpful in support of other political, economic, and military means of conflict in the conduct of hybrid wars. Within this context, technology is considered an invaluable tool to reduce gaps between developing and advanced powers — and, crucially, a way to afford precision in the targeting of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts seem keen to prioritize Sino-Russian cooperation to address the risks of political destabilization abroad and at home. In particular, one author focused on the challenge of “color revolutions,” defined as Western-sponsored attempts at destabilizing countries with the ambition to promote regime change. The same author identified states along the periphery of Russia and China as the first targets of a wider attempt at directly undermining Moscow and Beijing. In the Chinese view, purported attempts at regime change in North Africa and Central Asia, as well as presumed Western support for “separatist activities” in places like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, reinforce the need for Russia and China to cooperate closely. A perceived increase in the “violence” of these movements — as the case of the 2019 protests in Hong Kong highlights — also adds to such a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographically, Sino-Russian cooperation on hybrid and gray zone tactics should focus on enhancing public perceptions of Moscow and Beijing among other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Cooperation should cover political, economic, and cultural aspects, with the aim of strengthening political trust and a perceived sense of friendship. Chinese authors are convinced that dedicated cultural exchange activities that reward cultural differences but reinforce an emotional link to China and Russia should be coordinated with political and economic initiatives. For these Chinese authors, improving public perceptions of Russia and China also includes cultivating ties with elites in CIS and SCO countries. However, they note that strategic competitors like the United States might try to cultivate ties with Russian and Chinese elites in turn, with the aim of undermining the two countries’ governments. As a result, Chinese authors emphasize the need for bilateral cooperation to minimize the risk of domestic corruption. Their solution is to promote cooperation to achieve greater monitoring of domestic elites and senior officials, while also seeking to promote positive incentives to ensure loyalty — or at the very least obedience — to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of military affairs, Chinese scholars view joint exercises as a potential hybrid tool to counter the risk of “color revolutions.” Exercises are not hybrid tactics per se; yet, Chinese authors stress the political value of them as a hybrid tactic. One major example in this context is the joint exercise Unbreakable Brotherhood 2020, conducted at a time of acute instability in Belarus. The exercise was a response to perceived NATO provocations in the country and was intended to both strengthen ties with the regime in Belarus and enhance the cohesiveness within domestic audiences around the importance of supporting the Belarus authorities. Chinese specialists, therefore, regard exercises as potential hybrid tactics insofar as their desired effects are designed to shape, manipulate, and counter Western actions in the Russian and Chinese peripheries. Especially in the context of the SCO, the Chinese aim is to strengthen the combined Sino-Russian capacity for conducting exercises so that they can be used on short notice if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the literature surveyed for this project, governance in cyberspace is another area of prime relevance in Sino-Russian cooperation. In this domain too, Chinese authors perceive a clear sense of challenge mounted by Western power — notably the United States. The Western approach to cyber governance fundamentally undermines the Russian and Chinese approaches to sovereignty in this domain. From their perspective, cooperation should aim at promoting the Sino-Russian view that respect for sovereignty should guide developments in governance. In this context, Sino-Russian cooperation is important for shaping support within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, and regional organizations such as the SCO, for a specific understanding of governance in cyberspace. Through these organizations, China and Russia can promote mechanisms to safeguard national laws and combat cybercrime as they see fit, while developing shared technical solutions and wider collaboration with other emerging powers to widen their influence. Unsurprisingly, cooperation assumes that in Russia and China private companies and the state work with each other, with business accepting subordination to national authorities in a fashion consistent with the ambitions of the Chinese civil-military fusion doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-hybrid-and-gray-zone-tactics-as-war-by-other-means&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Hybrid and Gray Zone Tactics as War by Other Means?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars envision cooperation with Russia as an inherent part of Beijing’s ascent on the international stage. In a world that is understood to be antagonistic toward China, with the United States perceived as engaging in the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics to destabilize and weaken Russia and China, these tactics are seen as necessary for China to survive and grow as a major power. The Chinese approach to international affairs as a struggle for survival invites three broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, notwithstanding conceptual differences, among Chinese scholars both hybrid and gray zone tactics are about asymmetric forms of competition. The intellectual distinction in English-language literature — between hybridity as a form of conduct that pertains to Russia and gray zone as a form of competition relevant to understanding Chinese behavior — is not reflected in the Chinese literature. For them, the key distinction would seem to be that hybrid tactics involve higher levels of tolerance in terms of military engagement and destruction, while gray zone tactics put more stress on non-kinetic means. Further, gray zone tactics are directly applied against an opposing major power, whereas hybrid tactics apply to countries of strategic value in which low-intensity wars are acceptable. For Chinese scholars, gray zone tactics are clearly a priority area of cooperation. They view hybrid tactics, on the other hand, as a space of cooperation specially meant to prevent the loss of influence in areas of strategic significance in the CIS and SCO contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, new technologies and their impact on the structures, perceptions, and political stability of societies are an invaluable addition to the pursuit of asymmetry in hybrid and gray zone tactics. Cyberspace, internet networks, and social media are crucial means to manipulate, destabilize, and weaken other major powers, directly or by seeking to undermine their influence. In this respect, Chinese authors consider the improvement of China’s international image as a key area of gray zone cooperation, together with aggressive actions to politically destabilize competing major powers. Cooperation in developing the means to degrade — and, if necessary, destroy — the physical infrastructure enabling a competing major power’s cyber activities seemingly falls within the category of hybrid tactics. Against this background, the establishment of plausible legal and political narratives as a way to maintain or develop positive perceptions of China and Russia are also more “active” ways to take advantage of these means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese thinking about hybrid and gray zone tactics creates a predisposition for pursuing greater resilience against tactics of a similar nature from being deployed against Beijing and Moscow. For Chinese observers, destabilization and regime change are fundamental risks against which both Russia and China need to shield themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken altogether, these conclusions suggest that, while doubts remain over the extent of Chinese cooperation with Russia after the latter’s invasion of Ukraine, the content and perceived needs of this relationship are understood in similar terms by Moscow and Beijing. In fact, Chinese scholars view the political world as one of struggle — one in which hybrid and gray zone tactics may very well provide an asymmetric edge to tilt the scales of the international order in China’s favor toward a more authoritarian balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main Conclusions: In the 1990s, Chinese orders ensured the survival of the Russian defense industry (which had suffered from the collapse of the USSR) and preserved its global competitiveness. In turn, after Western sanctions were imposed in 1989, Russia became the main source of advanced weapons for China. Thanks to Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation, China was able to radically transform its armed forces into a modern military machine. The leaders of the Russian military-industrial complex (MIC) understood that the weapons sold to China would eventually be copied. Nevertheless, Moscow exported weapons to China in an effort to preserve the defense industry and earn money to build new-generation weapons systems. The country’s military and political leadership blocked deliveries of the most sensitive systems, which could ensure a rapid breakthrough of the Chinese military-industrial complex and undermine the competitiveness of Russian arms manufacturers. On the whole, this approach turned out to be justified. In the mid-2000s, the supply of weapons from Russia to China noticeably decreased. The reasons were the saturation of the Chinese market, the progress of the military-industrial complex in the PRC itself, and the increased concerns of the Russian leadership about Chinese copying and potential competition in the markets of third countries. Some Russian leaders have expressed fears about the growth of Chinese military capabilities near Russia’s Siberian and far eastern borders. Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China resumed growth in the 2010s, but a major breakthrough occurred in 2014. After the sharp deterioration in relations with the West, the Russian leadership conducted a systematic assessment of the risks of partnership with the PRC, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. Moscow concluded that the risks of cooperation with China were much lower than was commonly believed. The Chinese military industrial complex is less and less dependent on the unlicensed copying of Russian equipment and more and more reliant on its own developments. Fears of “Chinese invasion east of the Urals” have also turned out to be exaggerated. In these circumstances, Moscow has decided to sell such advanced systems as S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighter jets. Military-technical cooperation does not play a significant role in the trade between the two countries, accounting for no more than 5 percent of trade turnover. For the Russian military-industrial complex, arms sales to China are no longer a vital necessity, although China remains one of its most important export markets. However, the military-industrial complex plays an important political role, ensuring the strategic depth of the Russian-Chinese partnership. Russia still maintains serious advantages over China in a number of military production sectors. These are the creation of air defense equipment and some types of radar equipment, aircraft engine construction, underwater shipbuilding, and so on. However, in other areas China is now ahead of Russia, especially in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles. Overall, for the Chinese armed forces, buying weapons from Russia is a reliable way to quickly increase their military power (particularly given the possible escalation of conflicts in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait). The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and Western sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have increased Moscow’s interest in importing Chinese military technology and equipment. There are isolated examples of the purchase of Chinese military technology for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces, but this phenomenon has not yet become large-scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis around Ukraine, which broke out in early 2014, marked the beginning of a new stage in Russia’s relations with the outside world. In the face of U.S. and EU sanctions, Moscow began to deepen its partnership with China, the largest country that did not publicly condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine and did not join the sanctions regime. By that time, the political relations between Moscow and Beijing already had the official status of a strategic partnership, and since 2010, China had become Russia’s largest trading partner after the European Union. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian crisis has raised cooperation between the two largest powers in Eurasia to a new level. One of the most important elements of this partnership was the development and deepening of military-technical cooperation (MTC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, Moscow conducted a comprehensive study of the potential risks that a deeper partnership with China could entail, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. The results of the analysis convinced the Kremlin that the risks of such cooperation had previously been exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the relatively small volume of transactions in monetary terms (about US$3 billion per year), the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is of great importance for both sides. Although today Russia’s defense industry is not as dependent on Chinese purchases as it used to be, China remains a major export market for the Russian defense industry, and demand from the PLA has spurred the interest of other buyers. For Beijing, the Russian defense industry is the quickest way to obtain systems that can strengthen the PLA’s advantage at strategic points where military tensions between China and U.S. allies are possible. Finally, cooperation in such a sensitive area as arms serves as an important factor in strengthening the Moscow-Beijing political axis at a time when the parties are not seeking a formal military alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance for the Soviet Union of resuming military-technical cooperation with China is demonstrated by the following fact: China, which used to be one of Moscow’s main rivals, was the first foreign buyer of the most advanced Soviet aircraft, while its traditional allies settled for the less advanced MiG-29. The memoirs of Chinese military leaders published in recent years indicate that the Chinese were given fairly broad access to see Soviet military innovations. Moscow even had preliminary talks with Beijing about the possibility of supplying an aircraft carrier and carrier-based aircraft. Apparently, the Soviets assumed that close ties with China would be necessary for successful development after the end of the Cold War, and they were willing to use military technology exports to strengthen relations with Beijing. The Russian Federation thus became only a natural extension of this line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased military contacts and reduced tensions in border areas contributed to the gradual removal of obstacles to the export of increasingly sophisticated military equipment to China and the transfer of Russian technology there. Opposition to such cooperation on the part of the Russian military gradually weakened in the 1990s. China’s interest in military cooperation with Russia increased sharply in the late 1980s due to China’s restricted access to Western sources of military and dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of these factors led to the fact that after the collapse of the USSR, the Russian leadership immediately began to create the legal basis and organizational infrastructure for military-technical cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important feature of the military-technical cooperation of Russia and China was the rather strict formal requirements of the Chinese side to the secrecy of transactions, even in cases where the secrecy was clearly meaningless and even absurd. As a result, Russian and Chinese officials often refuse to discuss projects in the field of military-technical cooperation, even when the whole world knows about them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s attitude towards military issues changed radically under the influence of the war in the Persian Gulf (1990–1991), when the United States and its allies defeated and expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait with minimal losses and in a short period of time. Saddam Hussein’s army of 1990, apart from its rich military experience, was far superior to the PLA in technical equipment. The war demonstrated the growing role of new types of weapons and military equipment, in the development of which China lagged particularly behind: electronic warfare systems, technical reconnaissance, guided weapons, air defense systems, etc. China’s military leadership had to deeply rethink new trends in military affairs and the country’s military construction priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese side was well aware of the complexities of the Russian situation. Significant purchases of new weapons for the Russian general-purpose forces were curtailed in 1992–1993 and resumed only after 2008–2009. The Russian military-industrial complex survived on exports, and amid the global decline in military spending in the 1990s, the Chinese and Indian markets were the main targets. Thus, when negotiating with Russia, the Chinese had enormous market power and used it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first major deals reflected China’s priorities in ensuring its defense capabilities and were primarily related to combat aircraft and aviation weapons. China felt the weakest in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the story of Russian supplies of Su fighters to China may be viewed as a success. Russia was able to preserve and partly even modernize a critical part of its own military-industrial complex during the difficult period, while the damage caused by the Chinese violation of Russian intellectual property rights was not too great and was limited to the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the evolution of Russia’s foreign policy and deterioration of Russia’s economy in the 1990s have appreciably affected the expansion and deepening of military cooperation with China. The poor state of MIC enterprises forced the managers of specific factories, as well as captains of Russia’s defense industry, to lobby more and more actively for the development of ties with China. The end of optimism about relations with the West that was characteristic of the first years of Russia’s foreign policy is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation in the 1990s covered almost all areas of arms and military equipment production for general-purpose forces. The result was a frontal rearmament of the entire Chinese military machine, which, with Russian help, made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas. This process was generally ignored in the United States and other Western countries, which assessed the Russian industry too negatively, exaggerating the depth of its decline, and were particularly arrogant of China’s efforts to modernize its military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, due to cooperation with Russia, in the 1990s to early 2000s China was able to radically upgrade PLA and receive considerably more modern armed forces which are better suited for combat operations in the twenty-first century. At the same time, military-technical cooperation with Moscow enabled Beijing to significantly enhance the potential of its own military-industrial complex through the purchase of licenses, unlicensed copying of equipment, as well as training by Russian specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-2000s, there was stagnation in Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This situation is explained by a whole complex of reasons affecting China, Russia, and relations between Moscow and Beijing. First of all, for the Russian military-industrial complex, exports to China are no longer a vital necessity. Having retained key defense enterprises in the 1990s, Russia began to plan a largescale rearmament of its own armed forces as early as the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;he importance of the Chinese market for the domestic military-industrial complex was declining not only due to the growth of effective demand for Russian military equipment on the part of the Russian Armed Forces; it was also facilitated by the diversification of arms exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, rising hydrocarbon prices and a significant inflow of petrodollars into the Russian treasury provided Moscow with additional financial resources. The state had no trouble covering its social obligations and expanding them with the help of oil and gas revenues. It was now possible to be more selective about other sources of income, including arms exports to China. In addition, the role of military-technical cooperation for the stability of relations between Moscow and Beijing, which had been one of the pillars of the Russia-China partnership in the 1990s, began to diminish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid the rapid growth of mutual trade, the share of military-technical cooperation in its structure was decreasing, making arms trade one of the many elements of cooperation rather than the basis of bilateral economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has paid much more attention to risk analysis. The Russian side was increasingly concerned, first, about the problem of the scale of unlicensed copying of the equipment received from Russia, and second, about the potential of future competition from the Chinese military-industrial complex in the newly acquired markets, especially in North Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the final resolution of the border issue with China in 2004–2006, the Russian leadership rekindled discussions on the possibility of Chinese economic, demographic and, in the distant future, military expansion into the sparsely populated contiguous areas of the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential connection between the restriction of export of advanced weapons systems to China and Moscow’s concern over the PLA’s intentions is also confirmed by the informal statements of the leaders of the Russian military industrial complex. These discussions apparently resulted in the decision not to rush to sell to China the latest systems, like S-400 air defense systems or Su-35 fighters, but to insist on the most favorable (and not necessarily acceptable to China) terms. The absence of a deal at that time was better than a deal that did not satisfy Moscow’s growing demands for bilateral military-technical cooperation. In China, there was also a complex of reasons that, in the middle and second half of the 2000s, temporarily reduced Beijing’s interest in purchasing Russian equipment. After the programs of licensed production of Su-27SK fighters ended in 2003–2004 and the main supplies of Su-30MKK fighters ended, China began to gradually reduce the import of Russian weapons. This was the result of the increased self-confidence of the captains of the Chinese military-industrial complex, who made obviously unrealistic promises to their leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gradual recovery in the volume of military-technical cooperation was recorded in the early 2010s, when the Chinese side was forced to admit the limited capabilities of its industry and its dependence on Russia for some critical components. Moscow also became more optimistic about the prospects for profitable cooperation with China, partly as a result of the economic crisis, which once again raised the issue of diversifying the sources of budget revenues. However, the Ukrainian crisis of 2014 had a decisive influence on the deepening of Russia-China military-technical cooperation at the present stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Ukrainian events that accelerated Russia’s “pivot to the East”: after the introduction of sanctions, Moscow began to intensively search for opportunities to increase ties with its Asian partners in order to compensate for the reduced volume of loans and investments due to sanctions, as well as to provide access to technology. The only obvious candidate for the role of a “friend in need” was Beijing. China was the only major economy that did not impose sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need to strengthen its partnership with China, in the spring of 2014 various Russian agencies analyzed the potential risks of cooperation with China. Before rushing to embrace Beijing, Moscow wanted to understand the limits of the giant neighbor’s safe participation in the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, the analysis of the situation with the Chinese presence beyond the Urals showed that Russia should not be afraid of China’s “creeping demographic expansion” into vacant territories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has come to the conclusion that the perceptions in the Russian media, the expert community, and some of the authorities about the dangers of Chinese migration to the Russian Far East proved to be overly alarmist, and that the scenario of the future “annexation” of Russian territories by China according to the “Crimean scenario” was completely unrealistic. In addition, the Russian leadership has gained a more adequate understanding of the internal transformation of the Chinese economy: the aging population, a shrinking workforce, and a policy to reduce the consumption of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly aware of the problems that Chinese arms manufacturers face and will face, Moscow came to the conclusion that in the long term China will become less dependent on the Russian military industry and that, as the Chinese defense industry develops without Russian participation through direct sales of equipment, transfer of licenses and possibly joint arms development, in the future Russian opportunities to make money in the Chinese arms market will become increasingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change in approach was evidenced by a program interview with Rosoboronexport CEO Anatoly Isaikin in April 2015 in the Kommersant newspaper, in which, among other things, the contract for the sale of S-400 air defense systems to China was announced. In response to a reporter’s question about whether Russian enterprises are not afraid to enter into cooperation with PRC enterprises, Isaikin replied: “I believe that if we work in China’s interests, we also work in our own interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result of this analysis, Moscow’s attitude to the development of military cooperation with China has changed to a more open one. Selling advanced weapons to China became part of the strategy of rapprochement with Beijing in response to the systemic crisis in relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow agreed to more actively help China build up its military power and capabilities in light of the PLA’s tasks in the Pacific (of course, not disinterestedly), expecting in return that China would help Russia more easily survive the most acute period of confrontation with the West through investments and loans, as well as the necessary technology (also not for free). On the whole, this approach worked. Of course, China did not help Russia on a large scale for a whole complex of reasons, among them the consequences of the anti-corruption campaign in China, which paralyzed the decision-making process at many state enterprises; the drop in commodity prices; and the slowdown of the Chinese economy itself. In addition, PRC companies operating in global markets have been attentive to Western sanctions. However, despite this, Beijing has made several important investments in projects prioritized by Russian president Vladimir Putin, as well as providing a number of Russian companies with access to cheap financing. The most significant symbolic gesture of support from Beijing was the participation of Chinese companies in the construction of a power bridge to Crimea, despite Western sanctions. In the field of military-technical cooperation, major shifts took place in the fall of 2014, shortly after the U.S. and EU sectoral sanctions came into effect. Moscow and Beijing completed years of negotiations on the supply of four divisions of Russia’s latest S-400 air defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the volume of military goods and services sold to China in 2016 exceeded USD $3 billion, and the total portfolio of Chinese orders is about USD $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having made serious progress in independent development and system integration of complex equipment, the Chinese continue to suffer from disproportionate development of various components of their huge military industrial complex and lag behind many suppliers of critical materials and components. Russia fills these gaps by carrying out both relevant R&amp;amp;D and supply in China’s interests. Today, cooperation is primarily not a small number of large arms supply contracts, but dozens or hundreds of small agreements, hardly identifiable by the media. The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have led not only to an increase in Russian arms supplies to China, but also to an increase in Russian interest in imports of Chinese technology and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some areas of military equipment production, China is already ahead of Russia. Unmanned aerial vehicles are a typical example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two years after the Ukrainian crisis, we can say that the deepening of military-technical cooperation between Russia and China is evident. This is evidenced not only by structural shifts in cooperation, but also by its increased volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia retains serious advantages over China in many areas of military production due to significant state investments, which have resumed since the late 2000s. This is true of air defense equipment, aircraft engines, a number of types of radar technology, submarine shipbuilding, and so on. However, there are also areas where Russia has begun to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighters sold by Moscow could in the future significantly enhance the PLA’s combat capabilities in critical areas in the Pacific, where China increasingly needs to demonstrate its deterrence capability against the United States and its allies, or where there is a risk of limited military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task of curtailing Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is impossible; the United States and Japan can only try to correct the course of the Russian Federation, inducing Russia to refuse to expand cooperation to other sensitive areas like space technology or missile warning systems. However, given the recent tightening of anti-Russian sanctions by the U.S. Congress, the opportunities for Washington and Tokyo to play in this field are limited, and therefore they can only closely monitor the development of military-technical cooperation between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Товарищество пока на доверии: Военно-техническое сотрудничество России и Китая требует совершенствования” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/60886&quot;&gt;A Partnership Based on Trust So Far: Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China needs improvement, Военно-промышленный Kурьер Military-Industrial Courier, February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of Chinese military and technical publications shows that Beijing positively evaluates the opportunities for a progressive increase in bilateral military-technical cooperation in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, in practice Beijing is striving to gradually abandon the purchase of large quantities of Russian arms and military equipment and to transfer bilateral military-technical cooperation to a qualitatively new level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, China’s leadership officially has no doubts about the importance of further deepening military-technical cooperation with Russia. At the same time, as Russia’s economic potential grows in the long term, contradictions may arise in Russian-Chinese relations due to the mutual desire to expand their spheres of interests in the Asia-Pacific region and in Central Asia. Such a scenario could lead China to contain Russia, including in the field of military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Russia faces a difficult choice: provide China with advanced technologies, realizing that they are likely to be copied, or refuse to sell weapons, knowing that Chinese defense industry enterprises will develop comparable systems on their own in the near future. The former strategy of Russian arms exports, which consisted of selling “secondary” technologies, is no longer viable. China’s military industry has sufficiently caught up with Russia’s, so now the Chinese are interested only in the most modern weapons we have.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems expedient to further diversify Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation and supplement it with the joint development of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The growing maturity of Sino-Russian state relations and the deepening of political mutual trust between the two countries provide the political prerequisites for carrying out military cooperation. China’s growing economic strength and urgent need for defense modernization, as well as Russia’s still strong military and technological capabilities, provide the practical requirements and technical prerequisites for bilateral military cooperation, allowing both countries to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the similarity of their military establishments provides facilitative conditions for military cooperation between the two countries. In the current international security situation, both countries face security pressures to deal with various traditional and nontraditional threats, and they have common interests in opposing hegemony, maintaining world and regional peace, combating the “three evils,” and safeguarding their national interests. This pursuit of security in turn provides internal momentum for the deepening of military cooperation between China and Russia, giving it long-lasting vitality and impetus. On this foundation, China and Russia have now formed a “three-in-one” — military-political, military-technical, and military-operational — military cooperation relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the arms embargo imposed on China by the European Union and the United States, Russia has now become China’s most important source of advanced military equipment, and as a result, China has also become the second-largest export destination of Russian weapons after India. According to Russian media estimates, arms exports to China account for an average of 20 percent of Russia’s total exports, and in individual years account for 40 to 50 percent of all Russian arms exports. To ensure that military-technical cooperation goes smoothly, China and Russia have established the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation, which meets annually in the two countries on a rotating basis. Currently, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is focused on China’s purchase of modern warplanes, ships, new land equipment, and air and missile defense weapons from the Russian side. According to public reports in Russian and Chinese media, China has become the world’s largest user of the Su series of combat aircraft. Between 1990 and 2005, Russia sold China nearly 200 combat aircraft of various types, 12 battalions of C-300 anti-aircraft missiles, a number of Tor missile systems, four Hyundai-class destroyers, and 12 Sovremenny-class destroyers. China was the largest importer of Russian weapons until 2006, when India replaced it. According to the Russian newspaper Red Star, the two sides signed a USD $5 billion arms contract in September 2005, under which Russia would supply, over a three-year period, Su-30MKK multi-purpose fighters, Kilo 636 diesel-electric submarines, 956 and modified 956 Sovremenny-class destroyers, and S-300PMU air defense missile systems. More importantly, China has purchased production licenses for Su series fighters, flamethrowers, and other military products. In addition, China and Russia have cooperated in the aerospace field, jointly carrying out scientific research and experimental design work. Recently, the two countries’ defense ministries have been negotiating the export of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defense missiles to China. Since 2014, with the intensification of Western economic sanctions against Russia, Sino-Russian military cooperation has become increasingly complementary, ushering in a “golden age” of China-Russia military-technical cooperation. On November 26, 2015, at a regular press conference of China’s Ministry of Defense, spokesperson Wu Qian said that China and Russia had achieved “milestones” in cooperation projects for Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 anti-missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of coordination, China Russia military cooperation will maintain strong development momentum for a considerable time to come. From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces. As a country that both possesses relatively advanced military technology and weapons and enjoys the right to sell and transfer military technology on its own, Russia has naturally become China’s first choice for military cooperation. From Russia’s point of view, strengthening cooperation with China in the military field is also of strategic importance. Facing serious threats on its western and southern fronts, Russia is bound to seek strategic mutual trust between Russia and China and strengthen China-Russia military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the level of mutual trust between China and Russia continues to rise, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is moving to the highest stage — joint development of high-tech weapons and equipment — and Russia has even begun buying military products from the Chinese side. China has now started to provide the Russian side electronic components for aerospace, diesel engines for ships, and seaborne supply systems for ocean-going supply ships. [Additionally,] the subject of cooperation will be more sensitive. This is reflected in China and Russia sending their most advanced technical equipment to participate in the “Peace Mission” and “Joint Sea” joint military exercises, as well as in the continuous development of China-Russia military-technical cooperation toward the field of key and sophisticated weapons, especially in the increasingly strong trend toward joint development of modern equipment. Examples include cooperation in nuclear submarine design and manufacturing, space, and missile attack warning. In short, China-Russia military cooperation will be higher-level, deeper in content, and more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that some problems still exist in the field of China-Russia military cooperation. The first is that mutual trust between the two sides remains insufficient. In Russia, some people who start out from a Cold War “China threat” mentality maintain that military cooperation with China, especially military-technical cooperation, will have a negative impact on Russia’s long-term security, and that Russia should “hold back a few tricks” from China. Some people in China, on the other hand, voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination. The second is that improvement is still needed in the specific modalities of military-technical cooperation. For a long time, China-Russia military-technical cooperation has mainly been a buyer-seller relationship with China buying and Russia selling. China hopes to change this kind of cooperative relationship dominated by buying and selling into one of technology exchange and cooperation, with joint research and development and mutual benefits, in order to effectively raise the level of China’s military modernization equipment and maintain national security. Russia, for its part, has frequently criticized China’s imitation of Russian-made weapons. Since 2000, along with the rapid advancement of China’s military technology, its advanced weapons development capabilities have grown increasingly strong. Breakthroughs have been achieved in some fields and key technologies, and the defense industry is now able to meet the nation’s needs for weapons and equipment updating, upgrading, and modernization. Therefore, in the field of military-technical cooperation, there will be a greater shift toward purchasing key technologies and sophisticated weaponry, and the emergence of a new situation in which China even exports equipment to Russia is not to be ruled out. The third problem is that a competitive relationship between China and Russia will form in the arms export market in the future. As Chinese-made weapons continue to go global and the two countries’ weapons and equipment become more “homogeneous” in terms of design concepts, use characteristics, and prices, Russia fears that China will crowd out Russian weapons from the market, thus affecting Russian exports of advanced military technology to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the history of Sino-Soviet relations, the disparity in power between the two militaries objectively caused an asymmetry in bilateral relations and an imbalance in military cooperation, while the Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power, positioning military cooperation between the two sides as a relationship of guiding and being guided, giving and receiving, repeatedly disrespecting the interests of the other side and imposing itself on others, threatening to cancel military aid at every turn, and seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “extended family” style of military cooperation relationship that draws ideological boundaries and transcends normal national interests is doomed to be short-lived and will eventually harm the relationship between the two countries due to its high degree of political sensitivity. The fundamental reason why China and the Soviet Union turned from alliance to confrontation in the 1950s and 1960s was the dislocation between ideology and actual national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current military cooperation between China and Russia is subordinate to and serves the modernization of the Chinese military, creating a safe surrounding environment for defending national interests during a time of important strategic opportunity, but it also conforms to Russia’s strategic need to stabilize its neighborhood and ensure the global balance of strategic power, as well as the idea of using arms sales to drive economic development. Consequently, military cooperation will become an important factor in promoting the healthy development of bilateral relations and maintaining regional and world stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proves that placing the emphasis on foreign technical assistance or the purchase of foreign weapons inevitably results in the dependence of China’s national defense undertakings. Fundamentally enhancing military strength, on the other hand, requires instead the selective and focused introduction of key foreign equipment and technologies while adhering to self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Military-Industrial Courier, September 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, the deputy chairman of the Central Military Committee of the PRC, Zhang Yuxia, and Russian minister of defense, Sergei Shoigu, signed an agreement on the further strengthening of cooperation. According to information from the Committee of the Federation Council on the defense and security of the Russian Federation, the agreement may include the exchange of technology and the Chinese use of elements of the Russian Federation’s anti-aircraft defense systems in the Far East, which testifies to a high level of mutual trust. In the White Book of defense published by Beijing on July 24, it is written that military cooperation with Russia has developed to a high level and plays a significant role in supporting global strategic stability. It is also highlighted that military cooperation is not directed against any third party and will include air, land, and sea forces. Beginning in 2012, officers in both armies have conducted eight rounds of strategic consultations. In 2017, Russia and China organized their first collective naval maneuvers in the Baltic Sea. In 2018, a formation of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army participated in the “Vostok” strategic exercises. In April–May of the same year “Naval Interaction (Joint Sea)” took place in the region of Qingdao.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 23, the Russian and Chinese Air forces carried out their first cooperation air patrol with long range aircraft over the water around Japan and the East China Sea, eliciting an unpleasant reaction from military allies of the United States in the Far East and in other regions of the world. Western experts viewed these actions not as just a regular routine exercise, but as a kind of demonstration of Russian and Chinese readiness for further military collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on official statements by China’s top leaders, they adhere to a policy of non-alignment, exclude military alliances with anyone, oppose the use of force, and favor a peaceful resolution of disputed issues. So, presenting to the members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the PRC and high-ranking officials with a speech on the country’s foreign politics, Xi Jinping declared that China would not enter a military block with Russia or any other country. This would tie Beijing’s hands. China would expand its influence in the world and form a network of allies on all continents through soft power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A military alliance between two such powerful countries would change the entire strategic position of the world. This disturbance is caused not only by the above-mentioned actions in the military and military-technical spheres, but by the fact that the two countries hold identical or similar positions in the majority of international problems and demonstrate them collectively on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These and certain other factors provide a context for the development of mutually beneficial relations between these countries in the interest of mutual opposition to the threats and challenges of modernity and the strengthening of the world order. The question of a military alliance is evidently not entirely imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, conversations on the creation of an official military-political union are premature. This is entirely understandable. Such unions, not to mention states, are not historically threatening to anyone, conducted only in anticipation of extreme circumstances, and created with defense in mind. In other words, the activities of Moscow and Beijing in this sphere will depend largely on the activities of the West and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Военное сотрудничество России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=44888630&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Military Cooperation, Ethnosocium and Multinational Society 1 (2021): 95–105&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2015–2020, Russia and China continued their military-technical policy. Russia and China continued meetings between top military officials. At the same time, the focus of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing was distinctly “anti-American.” One of the most important areas of military cooperation during this period was joint Russian-Chinese military exercises. Strategic command and staff exercises (SSCE) were held regularly from 2015 to 2020. One of the most ambitious maneuvers was “Vostok-2018,” with the participation of Chinese servicemen. The SSCE was organized under the personal leadership of Russian defense minister Army General S.K. Shoigu. At five ranges and water areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the Bering Sea, 300,000 servicemen, more than 1,000 aircraft, 36,000 tanks, and up to 80 ships and support vessels participated. According to the Defense Ministry of China, China sent about 1,600 soldiers, more than 300 vehicles, and 30 aircraft and helicopters for the exercise “Vostok-2018,” and then the same the following year for “Center-2019” as well. About 100 servicemen of the PLA and 18 vehicles were involved in the “Caucasus 2020” SSCE. The naval exercises known as “Maritime Cooperation” are planned and coordinated by the PLA Command with the specific political tasks facing the PRC in mind. Joint naval maneuvers have been held annually since 2015 in the South China Sea and the Baltic Sea. According to PLA commanders, the varied geography of the exercises is a way to mark the growing military power of the two countries. The Chinese and Russian navies have also been involved in the exercises. In December 2019, China, Russia, and Iran jointly conducted a three-day naval exercise in the Gulf of Oman. The maneuvers were held to demonstrate a high level of coordination of joint maritime activities amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. The naval exercises were aimed at two main tasks: to demonstrate the increased capabilities of the PLA to combat traditional and non-traditional threats and to obtain information on the training methods and specifics of the Russian Navy. Anti-terrorist exercises have become a topical area for strengthening military ties with Russia in the fight against international terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism, both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The anti-terrorist exercise “Peace Mission” of the Armed Forces of the SCO member countries has received considerable attention. According to Chinese commanders, this exercise has a stabilizing effect on the regional situation and prepares the country’s armed forces for counterterrorist actions in the territory of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In October 2019, Novosibirsk Oblast hosted the “Cooperation-2019” exercise of anti-terrorist units of the Russian Federal Guard Service and People’s Armed Militia of the People’s Republic of China, where joint actions against international terrorist groups were practiced. The peculiarity of anti-terrorist exercises of Russia and China is that they practiced interaction between battalion-tactical groups, while Sino-Pakistani and Sino-Thai exercises of similar orientation involve units of marines and PLA Airborne Forces numbering from 150 to 250 servicemen. Joint air patrols in the Asia-Pacific region by Chinese and Russian bombers are becoming a new tool for achieving long-term political goals in the region. At the end of December 2020, the Russian Air Force and PLA Air Force conducted the second joint air patrol by long-range aircraft. The air group, consisting of two strategic bombers TU-95 MS (Russia) and four H-6K (PRC), carried out air patrols over the waters of the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. During the patrols, the aviation strictly adhered to international law without violating the airspace of foreign states. The computer-based missile defense (BMD) “Aerospace Security” exercise is seen by the Chinese leadership as a response to the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea. According to Beijing, their main purpose is to demonstrate to regional rivals the high level of relations with Russia. The peculiarity of the Russian-Chinese exercises, which began in 2017, is the use of computer simulations of the missile defense system of the two countries. Let’s specify that the work in real conditions is not possible because of the high level of secrecy and prohibition of access to the facilities of the national missile defense systems. Engineering and design problems at this stage make it impossible for Chinese engineers to develop their own missile defense system, which is confirmed by the unrelenting interest of Chinese specialists in Russian S-400 and S-500 systems, which could eventually form the basis of a Chinese missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian-Chinese military-political cooperation, we should note the multi-vector orientation of the ongoing military exercises. In accordance with the requirements of modern military art, it seems advisable to continue to conduct joint maneuvers of motorized infantry units, which would help military personnel to master the skills of combat in urban areas. At the same time, it would be most appropriate to conduct them at PRC ranges, in order to get acquainted in practice with the pros and cons of the theater command system created in 2016 in the PRC according to the U.S. model. Given the rapid development of PLA naval forces, it is possible to organize Russian-Chinese naval patrols to jointly carry out flag demonstration tasks in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Против кого дружат военные России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://ria.ru/20210705/oborona-1739958628.html&quot;&gt;Joint Defense. Russian and Chinese militaries are friends against whom?, RIA Novosti, July 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military experts emphasize that although the possibility of a military conflict with NATO countries is extremely unlikely, it exists. Therefore, neighboring states need to work out the reflection of potential aggression. “Any such maneuvers are designed to work out the real situation. We have to watch the reaction of the West, especially the Pentagon, but not bow our heads to them and ask their permission,” says Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, former head of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Defense Ministry. In the early 2000s, the joint exercises were declared to be anti-terrorist, but now they have taken on a high-tech, advanced nature, Vasily Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, reminded. “Obviously, they are aimed at transferring experience and increasing interoperability when confronting a major foreign adversary, which can only be the United States,” he believes. In this sense, Moscow and Beijing are certainly pushing back on the American factor, but it is not the only one. “There is, for example, a factor of concern about stability in Central Asia and the desire to maintain military ties to ensure transparency of mutual trust in defense. In addition, in the course of exercises and exchange of delegations, our and Chinese military get a huge amount of knowledge about each other, and, unlike the United States, our Ministry of Defense does not publish its assessments of Chinese military power. However, they stand high on the level of awareness thanks to such wide connections, it allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, understand what capabilities they are actually developing,” the expert adds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russo-Chinese military drill “Zapad/Interaction-2021,” held in the Ninxia Hui Autonomous Region in the northern part of the PRC, showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Russian soldiers underwent an express course in the use of new Chinese wheeled armored cars: the heavy wheeled infantry ZBL-08 and the ZTL-11 mobile assault gun (in the Chinese classification — the contemporary Western convention refers to them as “Wheeled Tanks.”) Both are comparatively new machines without direct Russian or Soviet predecessors, which would make their introduction especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the present moment, the Russian army has no contemporary armored vehicles, let alone a unified family as the moment demands. The BTR-80/82 is a vehicle with roots in the Cold War, with entirely different goals. This situation should soon begin to change: following a drill in the beginning of the Army-2021 exhibition, the development of the Bumerang family of armored vehicles was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, from a political and educational point of view, the most important thing in these drills was achieving a new level of integration in these countries’ military action. A cooperation staff was formed which guided the activity of soldiers through a single guiding information system. Following orders passed through this system, Russian paratroopers and Chinese servicemen carried out landings from Chinese helicopters (admittedly Russian-produced) and seized important objectives held by hypothetical “terrorists”, and the Russian SU-30SM enacted practice bombing runs on orders from the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally both parties are far from being involved in a military alliance, and they are not working towards one: despite the best attempts of both sides of the Russo-Chinese friendship, the U.S. State Department does not hold the most benevolent policy towards these countries. However the increasingly frequent and complex military drills by both countries, such as the one described here (and for China, this is the first drill with foreign soldiers since the beginning of the pandemic), testifies to the intention of these parties to demonstrate that there is no chance of realizing the fantasies of a gang of analysts from the 1990s about an “inescapable conflict” or “the impossibility of close integration because of their fundamental distrust for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“中俄联演 — 演习有何亮点看点？军事专家为你深入解读” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.thepaper.cn/baijiahao_13973728&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian joint exercise — What are the highlights of the exercise? Military experts give you an in-depth interpretation, The Paper, August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the highlights of the Zapad/Interaction-2021 military exercise? How will the Chinese and Russian military forces carry out joint combat operations? China Media Group reporter Wang Ruitao held an exclusive interview at Qintongxia Contract Tactical Training Base with Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and expert on Russian military affairs, who was observing the military exercise on site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qingtongxia Training Base is located in the foothills of the Helan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The terrain consists mainly of the Gobi Desert and hilly ground, with an elevation variation that is largely within 30 meters. It could be described as gentle slopes and level ground. It is a training base representative of combat in Gobi Desert and cold plateau conditions. It is suitable for simulating land where terrorists hide and operate. The climate here is similar to Central Asia; both are dry, with little rain. This makes this base highly suitable for training for desert and plateau combat operations such as anti-terrorist operations and special operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the Peace Mission exercise held by China and Russia in 2005, there have been 16 years of exercises held under the Sino-Russian bilateral framework. The current one, I feel, differs from previous exercises such as the Peace Mission and Joint Sea exercises, in the following areas. First, a change in roles. Instead of a Russian-led strategic exercise which to participate in them Chinese army had to leave Chinese territory, it is an exercise led by China on Chinese territory. The main objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the joint combat characteristics of the Chinese military, particularly the improvements to the joint combat capabilities of our military forces since the national defense and military force reforms. At the same time, this is an effort to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on our military. Second, a change in approach. In previous joint exercises, the Chinese and Russian sides would plan independently and organize independent groups under the same combat plan, largely demonstrating the relatively independent operations of each side under a single combat plan and in the same battlefield environment. This joint exercise, in contrast, has achieved combined planning, mixed formations, and joint training. Third, changes in content. From the perspective of training subjects, there is more joint content, and it is more practical. It presents systemic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unity” has always been a keyword in Sino-Russian joint exercises. By performing a comparative analysis vis-à-vis the previous few exercises, we can see that there has been further improvement in the level of unity in this exercise. I feel that the way to measure the level of unity in the two countries’ joint exercises is to look at their planning and command. In this exercise, a term that we often use is “combined planning.” First of all, a Russian military command branch center was established under joint command, and we developed a unified, Chinese-Russian bilingual joint information system. By building a Chinese-Russian joint command information system, we can more effectively achieve video and data links and communication with the Russian army, allowing us to share data and situation information, while unifying combat rules and laying a good foundation for joint operations by the two armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This training content enables us to experience the improvement in Chinese military training skills and the new breakthroughs in warfare. There have also been new breakthroughs in joint command combat capabilities. By relying on network information systems, the participating officers and soldiers build command links that operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, this exercise amply embodies the high level of friendly Sino-Russian cooperation and embodies friendship and trust between the two militaries, unconstrained by time or place and unaffected by the pandemic. We know that this exercise was held against a background of a coronavirus pandemic that is continuing to spread and that is becoming more complex. There are many major activities that have been delayed or canceled — yet normalized, institutionalized Sino-Russian joint exercises not only have not been interrupted but are still continuously undergoing quality improvements and innovations. This demonstrates that the comprehensive Sino-Russian strategic collaborative partnership and the friendly relationship between the two militaries are continuously ascending to higher stages. In addition, this exercise demonstrates to the whole world the firm resolve of the Chinese and Russian militaries to uphold world peace and regional stability. China and Russia have always worked together to construct a fairer, more reasonable international order. As responsible powers, China and Russia are demonstrating to the world their resolve to continue to be defenders and upholders of regional peace and stability, while also providing a fright to those terroristic forces that wait for opportunities to manufacture terror incidents and disturb regional stability — and to the supporters behind such forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jian Feng, “‘营战斗群战术’与中俄军演” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-TKZJ202117006.htm&quot;&gt;‘Battalion Battle Group Tactics’ and Russian-Chinese Military Exercises, Tanks and Armored Vehicles, September 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military cooperation, including military exercises, is an important part of state relations and is the easiest way for outsiders to observe whether two countries are “allies.” From the participation of the J-20 to the amazingly open weapons interoperability, the concluded China-Russia Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic exercise presented many new points, highlighting the orderly and in-depth military cooperation between China and Russia in the new era and conveying to the outside world in a highly complex form that “China and Russia are not allies but are better than allies.” However, while the strategic significance of this high-level joint military exercise has been the subject of numerous analytical articles in various media, there are very few voices interpreting it from a purely military operational perspective. In fact, this joint Chinese-Russian military exercise was highly practical. The exercises included joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities. In particular, the two armies exhibited a greater degree of pragmatism in their participation in each other’s strategic exercises, where they were mixed and where they planned together to test the capabilities of troop reconnaissance, early warnings, and electronic information attacks. This article is a detailed review of the “dry goods” of the Chinese-Russian military exercise, using “battalion tactical group (BTG) tactics” as the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in addition to the United States and China, the Russian military is also exploring the construction of similar “synthetic battalions” and is likely to be carrying out battlefield practice in such places as Syria and eastern Ukraine. These practical experiences will be invaluable to the PLA in exploring the tactical use of synthetic battalions and making further adjustments to their construction. Although Chinese forces were invited to participate in Russia’s East 2018, Central 2019, and Caucasus 2020 strategic exercises, this indicates that the cooperation between Russian and Chinese armies in the field of joint exercises has entered a new stage and reached a new level. It also means that the PLA will enter a new level of understanding of Russian “BTG tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tactics of Russian BTGs, which have been refined on the battlefield, are not only evident in past Chinese-Russian joint military exercises but also in some unusual changes in the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise can be considered, to some extent, as “an experiment in supporting three to four battalion-sized tactical groups with tactical-level fire support and security forces in a high-intensity but limited-purpose battlefield confrontation.” The relevance of this model is precisely that these are the shortcomings of Russian BTG tactics that have been revealed in actual combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these new BTGs have demonstrated a relatively high level of combat capability during their involvement in Ukraine and Syria and have changed the stereotypical and conservative image of the Russian military, they are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and they are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military. They are prone to be paralyzed by advanced adversaries like the U.S. Army in high-intensity battlefields by knocking out their nodes. Although our synthetic battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance and even possess many weapons and equipment that the Russians do not, their digitization and informatization capabilities are close to those of the U.S. military, and their command and combat systems are very similar to those of the U.S. military, [but] it is difficult to verify their tactical rationality because they have not been hardened by combat. Considering that both militaries need to deal with high-intensity ground warfare and even face a common strategic competitor, the China-Russian Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise provides an opportunity for the two militaries to learn from each other’s strengths and complement each other’s weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military exercises are the most sensitive activity in the relationship between two countries, and mutual participation in internal strategic exercises is the highest level of military cooperation. In recent years, the PLA has been advancing at a rapid pace that is visible to the naked eye. Synthetic battalions have become the main combat force of the PLA’s ground forces, integrating many advantages such as miniaturization, versatility, streamlining, and modularity, [while] highlighting the concepts of information dominance, system support, elite combat, and joint victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this new quality of combat capability still requires the lubrication of actual battlefield experience to realize its military competitive value more effectively. That is why it was significant to exchange in-depth tactical “experiences” with the Russian Army through the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise, which is also an excellent reflection of the fact that “there is no limit, no forbidden zone, no upper limit” for Chinese-Russian strategic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relations between China and Russia in the space industry have intensified sharply in recent years. The two powers have their own rockets and launch sites, are building their own satellites, and are planning an interplanetary expedition, but without joint cooperation, neither Moscow nor Beijing will be able to solve a number of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space program has become a top priority for China: its budget and ambition leave no doubt that Beijing intends to significantly strengthen its position in the space industry over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secret of success is large financial injections, persistence, and Russian technology, which helped the Chinese space program to make a significant leap in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between Russia and China in the space industry is based on two documents: an intergovernmental agreement of December 18, 1992, and an interagency agreement of March 25, 1994. Since the early 2000s, the parties have promoted the idea of joint research and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, but for a long time there was no talk about a breakthrough cooperation. The situation began to change in 2014, when after the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the United States vetoed the supply of high-tech products; a ban was also imposed on the electronic component base that was used in satellite construction. The space industry had some reserves, but it was necessary to look for a complete substitute for U.S. products in the short term. A suitable replacement was found in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Russia and China discussed the possibility of creating a joint space station. However, N. Eismont of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences notes that space exploration cannot be a purely national task. According to him, the Chinese side, which plans to start building a multi-module space station in the next few years, is interested in the Russian experience of long-term space flights and construction of large space objects. In addition, Beijing lacks a number of important technologies and is ready to offer its partnership to Moscow in exchange for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, in a sense, due to the U.S. position, China is in a kind of isolation. For many years now, the United States has been doing everything possible to prevent the development of science and technology in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why China is looking for other partners, and the result of this search, to a large extent, is the cooperation that the Russian Federation is developing/offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, the space sector [of cooperation] was [following] the general trend of development of Russian-Chinese relations, which began to sharply improve after the sanctions against Russia were imposed by Europe and the United States. China is extremely interested in buying Russian RD180 engines, which could be used in Chinese rocket production, while Russia is interested in supplying Chinese space radio-electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both sides have shown considerable interest in such cooperation. In summer 2016, the governments of Russia and China signed an agreement on measures to protect technologies in the exploration and use of outer space: in other words, the Chinese side will not be able to engage in unlicensed copying of Russian products. This was the main condition that Moscow put forward for the beginning of substantive negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the logic of this decision is simple: with a huge number of opponents and lack of like-minded people, it is necessary to be friends with China. All the more so because in the conditions of economic recession, when industry funding is constantly being sequestered, it is almost impossible for Russia to implement projects like the lunar or Mars missions on its own. The success of China’s space program raises the legal question of whether it will compete with Russia. After all, Russia’s position in space is not only one of the undeniable reasons of national pride, but also a significant source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, according to V. Kashin, a leading researcher of the Institute of Air Force Development of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russians do not consider the Chinese as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are no concerns about being squeezed out of the commercial launch sector. Production costs in China are already higher than in our country. At the same time, salaries in dollar terms in the Chinese rocket industry are several times higher. This became especially obvious after the devaluation of the ruble.” A. Ionin, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics named after A.A. Tsiolkovsky, believes that the Chinese are simply not interested in the commercial cosmonautics market. “They have too many national tasks, and commercial launches are not the main priority here. China does not need the money.” In addition, China is still under U.S. sanctions, and this prevents it from reaching the most profitable customers from Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktoriya A. Denisenko and Nikolay A. Malchushkin, “Перспективы российско-китайского сотрудничества в космической отрасли в 2020-е годы” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=44055870&quot;&gt;Prospects for Russian-Chinese Cooperation in the Space Sector in the 2020s, Blagoveshchenskii State Pedagogical University, 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editor’s Note: This article is not written by leading Russian scholars; however, the authors cover strategic goals and challenges and provide a useful framework for understanding the negative and positive outcomes of Russian-Chinese cooperation in space (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current trends in the world aerospace field allow us to speak about the beginning of a new space race. The key feature of the increased interest in exploration of extraterrestrial spaces is a significant expansion of private sector capabilities in the field of design and launch of transport and manned spacecraft — we are talking primarily about large non-state corporations of this industry (for example, the “Space Exploration Technologies Corporation” of American entrepreneur Elon Musk, “Blue Origin” of American billionaire Jeffrey Bezos, or “Boeing,” the transnational aviation giant).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Russian Federation, maintaining and expanding its existing position in the space industry is one of the highest priorities at the moment. The significance of the issue lies not only in the need for Russia to retain its status as a space power, which it inherited together with the technical potential of the Soviet Union as the legal successor of the latter. The developed world’s close attention to near-Earth space and other planets for the purposes of scientific study and possible militarization determines the desire of Russia to at least prevent a technological lag in space exploration, and at most claim equal participation in the use of extraterrestrial resources. The complicated geopolitical situation that developed in the mid-2010s forces Russia to strengthen cooperation in the space sphere with its strategic partners, among which the People’s Republic of China has traditionally occupied a key position recently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For China, which in many ways faces similar foreign policy realities as Russia, space is also of great value. The space program of the “Celestial Empire,” despite its relatively short existence, has already demonstrated significant success in the field of space robotics and communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, China naturally faces the question of whether it should maintain cooperation with Russia in the aerospace industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has a significant material and resource base for the implementation of the space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, however, China fully covers the technological needs for the design and modernization of the rocket fleet with its own production; development of a reusable spacecraft (the “Shenlong”) is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;External and internal destabilizing factors have no significant impact on the implementation of China’s space projects. The COVID-19 epidemic, which began in China in late 2019, has not prevented CASC from conducting four rocket launches since the beginning of 2020. In terms of foreign policy, China’s space ambitions also meet little resistance from Western countries, especially the United States, due to the latter’s increased attention to Mars exploration. If the current conditions remain unchanged, it is safe to say that China is highly likely to achieve its goals of launching its own space station and landing taikonauts on the lunar surface. As for Russia, the foundation of the Russian space industry was laid during the Soviet Union, and by the beginning of the 2020s, Russia managed to be firmly entrenched in the top three space powers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The level of technical development of the Russian space industry meets the requirements for maintaining a position in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning to the most urgent problems of Russian cosmonautics, we emphasize that in recent years there has been a negative trend towards stagnation in the rate of rocket launches relative to other leading space powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to preserving the number of launches, a significant problem at present is the pronounced costliness of the industry and the corruption of related enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the growing competition on the part of private U.S. corporations, it is possible that in the future Russian rockets will be unprofitable to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the prospects for Russian-Chinese cooperation, let us review current joint space arrangements. In September 2019, at a regular meeting of the heads of the governments of Russia and China, Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Rogozin and CNSA head Zhang Kejian agreed to cooperate in the creation of a data center for lunar projects and deep space, as well as in the coordination of the “LunaResource-1” space mission in 2022 and “Chang’e-7” in 2023. A year earlier, there had been talks about bilateral participation in the creation of a Chinese orbital station, and in November 2017, Russian and Chinese state corporations signed a program of cooperation in the space field for 2018–2022. Despite the largely declarative nature of these statements, there is a clear trend towards strengthening the partnership between Russia and China, which is due to the aggressive external environment and long-term cooperation in this industry. What are the possible scenarios for the development of cooperation between Russia and China in the foreseeable future? Despite a declared commitment to a productive dialogue, the rapid technological growth of the Celestial Empire in rocket and space exploration is obvious, and its ambitions to explore other planets and outer space question the necessity of involving other countries, including Russia. An important factor is the role of external powers that also are aiming to maintain a presence in space: the United States and India, which is actively developing its own space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasily Kashin, “Россия и Китай ответят на создание космических войск США – эксперт,” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasia.expert/rossiya-i-kitay-otvetyat-na-sozdanie-kosmicheskikh-voysk-ssha/&quot;&gt;Russia and China Answer to the Creation of Space Forces by the USA – Expert, Eurasia Expert, September 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outer space has already become a military platform. Space systems are now necessary for a number of key weapon systems, in particular munitions with satellite guidance and unmanned aerial vehicles with long flight times. These weapons systems do not live without space at all, but all the rest also depend on space to some degree. Accordingly, ensuring the operation of the entire space infrastructure, including space-based communications, positioning, and reconnaissance assets, becomes a priority issue. The development of means to combat space objects is also becoming a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States has lost much of its former military superiority in many other areas, but so far no one can match them in space. Trump’s decision to create a separate kind of military force is designed to maximize U.S. superiority and achieve overwhelming dominance in space. Other countries, including China and Russia, will have to respond to it to some degree, and so there will be an arms race in space. The placement of weapons in space will not necessarily come immediately. It may not happen for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is building up its forces very strongly now, and it is the number two power in the world (Russia is number three) in terms of satellite constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space is becoming increasingly important precisely because of the development of new types of weapons: drones, satellite-guided precision munitions, and space reconnaissance systems. In the Cold War era, these means were much more primitive and had longer reaction times, but now you have the opportunity to take them to another level. An important factor in the future will be the development of artificial intelligence technologies, which will allow a new level of processing of space reconnaissance data, dramatically increase its effectiveness, and possibly change the approaches to nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space remains primarily in the military [domain]. All this piloted space flight is ornamentation, while military space operations are on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prestige reasons, China is promoting the development of science, and we are lagging behind here. We have no resources, and there is only a weak organizational capability. We are able to solve some military tasks, but we cannot compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have cooperation, of course. The golden age was in the 1990s and 2000s, when China’s manned program and many other programs rose largely due to Russian technology. Now the Chinese are already sensing their own strength and “advancement,” and maybe their need for cooperation with us is no longer so high, although it continues. At the dawn of the crisis and the aggravation of relations with the West in 2014, when we were cut off from the supply of components, there was talk that we would supply new types of powerful rocket engines to China, and that the Chinese would help us establish production of electronic parts and components for space. It is not clear where that went — apparently it hasn’t worked out yet, but these are usually long negotiations. We will see more and more closure of these cooperation programs, because the U.S. sanctions pressure on Russia and China is growing. However, cooperation will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main goal is to create the information infrastructure that enables the use of weapons on Earth. That is, it is the provision of reconnaissance and positioning resources, without which the effective use of high-precision weapons is impossible. Accordingly, the use of high-precision weapons spurs the development of space systems, and new capabilities of space systems, in turn, lead to new high-precision weapons. In the future, demand will increase further by the development of robotic complexes and systems and the further development of unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the other side will have an even greater need, first, to interfere with satellite positioning and communication systems and reconnaissance, and second, to be able to shoot down these satellites. This will all develop at an increasing rate for the foreseeable future. An additional factor that affects the arms race in space is the development of missile defense systems, since ground-based missiles for hitting targets are a side effect of the development of missile defense. They are often just a variant of a missile defense application that sometimes needs some small change in software. And, because, again, missile defense is developing at a high rate in several countries, we will see an increase in the number of threats to satellites and, therefore, attempts to protect them. At some point, we will also see the placement of weapons in space, but that probably won’t be the first thing that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a priority for China to push science forward, because their main field of competition with the United States is in science and technology. Through this, China greatly increases its national prestige, because they are already the second country in the world in the field of space research. Since their investments and potential are growing, they have a chance of someday standing on an equal footing and competing for primacy. In many ways, this reproduces the picture of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this overall background, bilateral space cooperation has gradually intensified and is a concrete expression of the improvement and upgrading of relations between the two countries. In order to preserve space security, national security, and the stability of the international strategic landscape, China and Russia maintain close cooperation on space diplomacy, the objective being to create an external environment conducive to national development. When it comes to space technology cooperation, geopolitical factors play an important role. The space development dynamics of China and Russia, as well as the U.S. strategy of space hegemony (including space weaponization policies and practices), are the key variables in space technology cooperation between the two sides. The expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation dovetails with the development of political relations between the two countries in response to changes in space geopolitics and also has an impact on the shaping of space geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an overall perspective, China-Russia space technology cooperation since the end of the Cold War can be roughly divided into two stages, with the Ukraine crisis in 2014 as the dividing line. The first stage was one of shallow cooperation, mainly in the form of a bilateral “buying and selling relationship.” After the Ukraine crisis, space cooperation between the two countries further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined. In 1970, China successfully launched the “Dongfanghong-1” satellite, thus entering the space club. Although this achievement was the result of China’s self-reliance and hard work, it should not be overlooked that China’s move into space also benefited from the assistance of the Soviet Union: China’s launch vehicle technology originated from Soviet assistance in ballistic missile technology, and the Soviet Union trained a number of young scientists and engineers for the development of China’s aerospace endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the resolution of border issues between China and Russia in the 1990s, bilateral relations were gradually improved and enhanced, and space cooperation could be realized. The 1992 agreement on intergovernmental space cooperation between China and Russia and the 1994 cooperation agreement between the space ministries of the two countries were the beginnings of bilateral space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral space cooperation after the Cold War began in the manned spaceflight field. After China established its manned space program, Russia provided the reference for China’s design of the Shenzhou series of spacecraft. The Russian side not only supplied China with spacesuits but also trained Chinese astronauts and provided technical support for their first spaceflight activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until 2006, the two countries generally cooperated in three areas: satellites, space science, and basic components. In 2007, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement on the joint exploration of Mars — with the Russian Mars probe “Phobos-Grunt” (Фобос-Грунт) to carry the Chinese probe “Yinghuo-1,” and the Russian space-based observatory to be used for joint deep space exploration — but the project was scrubbed due to the failure of the Russian launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before 2014, however, China-Russia space technology cooperation still lagged behind the two countries’ political engagement. After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, space cooperation between the two sides entered a new phase in which cooperation not only expanded in breadth but also increased in depth. Cooperation on positioning and navigation satellites was the starting point of the new phase of cooperation between the two countries. The United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia under the pretext of the Ukraine crisis, including a ban on the export to Russia of satellite-borne electronic equipment, which is precisely one of Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During President Putin’s visit to China in 2016, the Russian and Chinese governments signed an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in the field of space technology, clearing away legal barriers to the development of in-depth cooperation in space technology between the two countries. In September 2017, the two countries finalized the Outline of China-Russia Space Cooperation for 2018–2022, which includes projects on lunar and deep space development, rocket engine and satellite-borne electronic equipment transactions, etc. This is the first five-year agreement between the two countries. It is within this framework that the two countries have realized the vision of cooperation agreed upon several years ago: the purchase of Russian RD-180 rocket engines by China and the export of satellite electronics to Russia. The two countries also held negotiations in 2018 on the joint production of RD-180 rocket engines. A key point in the implementation of the five-year outline of space cooperation is to take substantial steps in lunar and other deep-space exploration fields. After the United States and other Western countries closed the door to cooperation with it, Russia has clearly strengthened its willingness to engage in lunar exploration with China, looking to make up for its failure to go to the moon during the Cold War era with a successful lunar landing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, the two countries discussed the possibility of cooperation in lunar research and deep space exploration, and in 2019 they signed an agreement to establish a data center for lunar and deep space exploration to share relevant information, including on the moon and Mars. . . . This is a historic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia have also taken important steps in cooperation involving the space security field. If the above-mentioned cooperation in space is limited to the peaceful use of space, cooperation between the two countries in the anti-missile and missile early warning system fields is cooperation on space security. Following cyber anti-missile exercises in 2016 and 2017, President Putin announced at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system, which will significantly increase China’s defense capabilities. Only Russia and the United States currently possess missile early warning systems, which include both space-based and ground-based systems. Russia’s assistance on China’s construction of a missile early warning system, whether by helping China develop space-based sensors, building ground-based radar systems, or sharing software and information for space-based and ground-based warning systems, will enhance China’s anti-missile capabilities and sky monitoring capabilities. In addition, in December 2020, China and Russia extended their agreement on mutual notification of missile launches. Given the U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty and the global arms control regime suffering another setback, the continued strengthening of China-Russia cooperation and coordination on mutual notification of ballistic missiles and on-launch vehicles contributes to global strategic stability and security. If in the previous phase of China-Russia space cooperation the two countries only cooperated at a superficial level, the recent phase of space cooperation between the two sides has significantly expanded and deepened. It not only includes the sale of components but has also deepened into cooperation in space technology and space science and further expanded into the field of space security. China-Russia space cooperation has thus taken substantial steps. As China’s space technology continues to make strides, large-scale space projects — including the BeiDou system and deep space exploration on the moon and Mars — are advancing steadily and making great achievements, while Russia is under sanctions from the United States and other Western countries and its space budget is restricted. This has affected the progress of space projects, making Russia change its past “strong” posture and negotiate with China on an equal footing, which in turn reflects the win-win nature of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While one can say that the above China-Russia space technology cooperation is divided into two phases, before and after [the 2014 Ukraine crisis], space diplomacy cooperation between the two countries has maintained a close posture ever since the end of the Cold War, because space is tightly linked to international security and national security. As is well known, the advent of the space age was closely tied to the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race. Space is the “eyes and ears” of strategic nuclear forces and is an extremely important aid in strategic deterrence. With the development of space technology, satellites not only became information platforms that provide services and facilitation for military operations — such as communications, weather, and navigation — but also firepower platforms or firepower delivery platforms. As a result, satellites became military force “multipliers” and “enablers,” and a space dominance doctrine also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under circumstances where diplomatic efforts were unable to curb the U.S. weaponization of space, some countries had to take countermeasures, developing and stockpiling anti-satellite weapons, and thus opening the curtain on a new round of the space arms race. Space-based and ground-based kinetic anti-satellite weapons, directed energy anti-satellite weapons, and cyber and radio frequency anti-satellite weapons have emerged or will soon emerge. Given the irreplaceable role of space and its technologies for economic and social development, the weaponization of space not only threatens the safety of satellites operating in orbit but also has serious negative effects on economic development and social welfare. Furthermore, the increasingly close integration of space with the command and control systems of a country’s military leads to potentially huge threats to national security. More importantly, the integration of space and nuclear strategic forces, along with the weaponization of space, can have serious and potentially disruptive effects on international strategic balance and stability. In short, the weaponization of space is a threat to world peace and can also cause enormous damage to economic development and social welfare. To strengthen national security and promote economic development, as well as to maintain international security, China and Russia cooperate with each other in summit diplomacy and in multilateral processes, taking practical actions to prevent the arms race in space and the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the United States moved to implement theater missile defense systems and a national missile defense system, China and Russia judged that the United States was likely to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and therefore called on the United States to comply with it. The November 1998 Joint Statement on Sino-Russian Relations at the Turn of the Century, the December 1999 Sino-Russian Joint Statement, and the July 2000 Joint Statement on Anti-Ballistic Missile Issues all emphasized that the ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of international strategic stability, and that the U.S. development of a national missile defense system and construction of ABM systems would have destructive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, the United States has not only expanded its ABM system in spite of the international community’s opposition, but it has also deployed the “Shore-based Aegis” system and the “SAD” system in Europe and Asia, and further developed and stockpiled space weapons, sharply increasing the threat that space will be weaponized and turned into a zone of military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2019, the heads of state of China and Russia once again expressed their concerns and worries. Calling on all countries to work to ban the weaponization of space, they said that U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty undermines strategic stability and triggers an arms race; the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and especially “the development of its strategic anti-missile systems, and its plans to deploy them in different regions of the world and in space, continue to have serious negative repercussions for international and regional strategic balance, and security stability,” and “the real prospect of an arms race in space, and its evolution into a frontier of military conflict, threaten strategic stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the originator of the weaponization of space in the post-Cold War era was the United States, and the goal of preventing an arms race in space and controlling space armaments can only be truly achieved by reaching a legally binding international treaty with the United States prohibiting the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral relations have made a qualitative leap, and a new type of Sino relations has been established that is “non-Russian aligned, nonconfrontational, and not targeted at third parties,” and political friendship and trust have laid a firm foundation for in-depth cooperation between the two countries in various fields. China-Russia space technology cooperation is the result of the deepening development of relations between China and Russia, whether that cooperation is in space equipment (e.g., rockets, satellite-borne electronics), joint technology research (e.g., space materials), data cooperation (e.g., deep space exploration information), or technical and policy cooperation involving space security. It is a concrete manifestation of the close relationship between the two countries. The expansion and deepening of once nonexistent space cooperation between the two countries also resulted from the respective space development dynamics of China and Russia, while the United States has been a key variable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, at times of great achievements in China’s manned spaceflight, BeiDou system, and lunar exploration projects, or when they were about to make great achievements or afterwards, Russia significantly slowed down the process of space cooperation with China. “This kind of cooperation was modest in scale in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and this momentum has waned since then.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty in advancing such cooperation lay partly in the fact that Russia and China had yet to sign an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in space fields, but the real reason was that Russia considered itself technologically advanced in space and feared that “serious” cooperation with China would develop China into a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is well known, launch vehicle engines are indeed the core technical components of missiles. Russia banned the export of RD-180 rocket engines to China on the grounds that doing so would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime. Russia let the engines be sold to the United States, however, and even after being subjected to U.S. sanctions, it did not use the mechanism mentioned above to initiate counter-sanctions. This once again showed that Russia did not want to promote the improvement of Chinese space technology through cooperation and turn China into a competitor. On the one hand, in the first phase Russia generally considered its space technology superior to China’s, so cooperation in space was a “gift” to China. On the other hand, with the development of Chinese space technology, including manned spaceflight, Russia was wary of cooperation because it feared that China would overtake it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the existence of a significant portion of pro-Western forces within Russia and the sowing of discord between Russia and China by the United States and the West, from a power transfer point of view, Russia’s decline from Soviet-era superpower to one of the world’s top powers resulted in a significant psychological disconnect, and feelings about China’s rise were complicated. Therefore, in the first phase of China-Russia space cooperation, Russia did not have a sincere desire to cooperate with China. At that time, Russia preferred to cooperate with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, although Russia extended an olive branch of space cooperation to China to promote Sino-Russian relations and alleviate the strategic pressure exerted on it by the United States, the European Union, and NATO, it feared that cooperation between the two countries would promote China’s technological progress in space, thereby diminishing its voice in Sino-Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the technological gap, the degree of Russian-Chinese space cooperation was not as high as Russian-U.S. space cooperation, so Russian-Chinese space cooperation was limited to a buying and selling relationship for some time. More importantly, Russia’s fear that China’s rise would impinge upon its political and economic interests led to further conservatism in China-Russia cooperation in science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis in Ukraine — and especially the annexation of Crimea by Russia — led the West to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, once again demonstrating that the West fundamentally distrusts Russia and still sees Russia as a security threat, especially with Biden having called Putin a “killer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the influence of Western sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry and the aging and loss of S&amp;amp;T personnel — including in the space field — have combined to further slow the development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and there are even difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, development of China’s space industry has been rapid, especially in the twenty-first century, and China’s space technology has become increasingly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development of China’s space technology and industry and the advancement of its space program have propelled China’s rapid space power development. Russia’s space technology, industry, and program have progressed more slowly, and the pace of its development has been far below China’s. China’s leap in space technology has led to a relatively substantial reduction in Russia’s overall space advantage, and its sense of superiority has fallen along with it. While Russia still has certain advantages, by expanding and deepening cooperation with China and mutually complementing advantages with China in the fields of deep space exploration and navigation satellites Russia can exchange its advantages for technologies and equipment it does not have, based on the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, Russia decided to cooperate in the field of positioning and navigation satellites, which was a breakthrough in space cooperation with China. In this second stage, Russia is cooperating with China in space technology on an equal footing, with almost no sense of superiority, and it has provided China with missile early warning system technology while China has given Russia corresponding assistance in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the process of China-Russia space cooperation, there are three aspects that indeed surpass the geopolitical considerations between China and Russia, and this is beyond doubt. First, China-Russia space cooperation promotes the development of space technology in both countries and plays an important role in forming a stable China-U.S.-Russia triangular relationship in space, which is in the interests of both countries. . . . Secondly, the two countries’ close cooperation on launch vehicle engines and global navigation systems, and their commitment to cooperation on an international lunar station, etc., will not only contribute to the joint progress of Russian and Chinese space technology but will also help in building strategic stability and a balanced landscape in space, in making space a common heritage of all mankind, and in striving to put into practice the principles and purposes of the peaceful uses of space as established in the preamble and Article I of the Outer Space Treaty. And thirdly, space cooperation between the two countries will be conducive to the development of the space production chains of both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, they can also give full play to their comparative advantages in the space field, expand and extend production chains, form a new division of labor system, drive the development of technology overall, and enhance their ability to resist Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space cooperation between China and Russia has enhanced mutual political trust between the two countries and further deepened their strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between the two countries on space diplomacy will further consolidate and deepen the strategic partnership. China and Russia alike face strategic pressure from U.S. antimissile systems and space weapons, and the two countries have cooperated with each other at the United Nations, the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the Conference on Disarmament, making ceaseless efforts to prevent an arms race in space and contribute to the maintenance of global strategic stability, as well as making arduous efforts to build a fair and just space governance system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation is the result of space geopolitics, and space cooperation between the two countries will likewise reshape space geopolitics. It will contribute to the relative stability of the space order, specifically by contributing to the multipolarity of space; prevent celestial bodies such as the moon from being enclosed by the United States and other countries; and prevent the weaponization of space, which will have an important impact on the formation of the future rules of space governance and the shaping of the future space landscape. The key to maintaining a multipolar space hinges on a relatively stable China-U.S.-Russia space triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with the outbreak of the [2014] crisis in Ukraine, and especially since the Trump administration took office, the space landscape has taken on an asymmetrical character, with an almost entirely one-sided tilt toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend is detrimental to the stability of the space landscape. With the expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation, there is bound to be rapid development of mutual cooperation between their research institutes and enterprises, whether in state-led space projects or in commercial space projects, and the number of state-owned satellites and commercial satellite constellations launched by the two countries will certainly increase a great deal, narrowing the gap with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In view of the attempts of the United States and other Western countries to seek sovereignty over celestial bodies under the pretext of deep space exploration and planetary resource development, China and Russia have repeatedly signed agreements on deep space exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies, jointly exploring and landing on the moon, establishing their own lunar bases, and setting up a joint lunar research station open to the world. This indicates to the world that any attempt by any country to use advanced technology to enclose the moon and Mars will be strongly opposed by China and Russia, which are determined to preserve the status and properties of the moon and other celestial bodies as a global commons and the common heritage of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weaponization of space by the United States and its allies in NATO and elsewhere is undoubtedly causing damage to the peaceful use of space, as well as to global strategic stability and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, China and Russia possess some degree of antisatellite capability, and they have held joint cyber anti-missile exercises as a direct response to the United States’ weaponization of space and refusal to conclude an international treaty banning the weaponization of space. Although the two countries’ space cooperation does not directly involve anti-satellite content, cooperation in the field of space technology, which is dual-use technology, has a strong connotations of a military alliance in space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, President Putin announced in 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system. This was a strong signal that the two countries are cooperating substantively in the military space field, enhancing the defense partnership between Russia and China, and potentially forming a joint Sino-Russian anti-missile system. The possibility of Russia exporting to China S-500 anti-missile systems with anti-space weapon capabilities in the event of a deteriorating space situation is not ruled out, nor is the possibility of China-Russia cooperation in anti-space technology. According to U.S. reports, China and Russia have different anti-missile capabilities and technologies, with Russia’s space-based co-orbital “nesting doll” anti-satellite technology and China’s mid-range anti-missile technology and antisatellite technology each having its own advantages. Cooperation between China and Russia on anti-satellite technology could be a nightmare for U.S. satellites. Until there is a treaty banning the weaponization of space, China-Russia space cooperation, especially military cooperation in space, is a strong cornerstone for preventing space from being weaponized and turned into a battlefield. The highly developed Sino-Russian military relationship is a key factor in promoting global strategic stability, and it has played an important role in maintaining global and regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the imbalance in Chinese, U.S., and Russian space power, neither China nor Russia alone can stop the United States from pursuing its stated strategies and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation, especially the establishment of a joint lunar research station, is a concrete attempt to implement the concept of global governance of ”negotiation, joint construction, and sharing” and to build a community of human destiny in space, and it is also a way for China to provide Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom for changing space governance. As to whether the above goals can be achieved, or whether there will be one pole in space led by the United States and another pole with China and Russia jointly, depends to some extent on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-documents-on-sino-russian-understandings-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Russian Documents on Sino-Russian Understandings of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Китай и Россию сближает угроза гибридной войны: Медведь и панда на службе миру” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/53176&quot;&gt;China and Russia Are Brought Closer by the Threat of a Hybrid War: Bear and Panda in the Service of the World, Military-Industrial Courier, October 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The correlation between the concepts of “cultural focus” and “strategic culture” is an important subject for another study. Let me merely point out the closeness of the cultural focuses of Russia and China, which reflects the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict. An important step in strengthening the strategic partnership was the decision of the Russian Federation to deploy a Missile Defense Alarm System (MIDAS) in the PRC. Until now, only the United States and Russia had such a system. Now, China will join them. The decision testifies to the real depth of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation and the degree of trust between Moscow and Beijing. The latter will have at its disposal a complex of special technical means for detecting ballistic missiles, calculating their trajectory, and transmitting information to the command center, which is then reported as an attack on the state with the use of missile weapons, prompting an urgent decision on the response. There are also other steps to deepen the relations, particularly in terms of the development of measures to counter any hybrid aggression from the United States and the West as a whole, which may aim at both our countries. In this context, it would be interesting to study the approaches of Russia and China to confronting a hybrid war and a “color revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opinions of authoritative Russian experts on hybrid warfare can be summarized as follows: the term is of Western origin. The theory of hybrid warfare, which was developed in the West, is now being tested all over the world. Its essence lies in the complex use of hard and soft power tools, in erasing the differences between war and peace, which is an important feature of the conflicts of the twenty-first century. . . . Hybrid warfare is characterized by high adaptability to the conditions in which it is prepared and conducted; a continuity and connection with “color revolutions”; and multidimensional struggle in the military, informational, economic, political, socio-cultural, and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov. . . . Our response is based on active defense, which relies on theoretical studies and substantiation of a set of measures primarily aimed at the preventive neutralization of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the type of interstate confrontation studied by Sun Tzu is what we call “hybrid warfare.” The Chinese strategist formulated its conceptual essence: to achieve victory over the enemy without fighting it, by avoiding direct military clashes with enemy armies. He argued that the best war is waged this way: first, by breaking the plans of the enemy; second, by breaking their alliances; and only then, by breaking their troops. For millennia, the essence of Chinese technologies to “live and survive” has been the desire to achieve the necessary results with as little effort and material costs as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technologies of the “color revolution” that Sun Tzu spoke about naturally interact with the hybrid warfare strategy. According to his plan, the main objective of a geopolitical attack during wars should, in fact, be the ruling elite of the enemy state — the ruler himself, his inner circle, and the military leaders, who must be actively influenced by various means — so as to “outplay them with a plan” and thus “prevent them from winning.” Geopolitical adversaries are trying to assign the authorship of the hybrid warfare strategy to Russia and China, arguing that today the all-encompassing integral strategy of geopolitical struggle — hybrid warfare and “color revolution” — are used by China in its competitive struggle with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it is the United States and its satellites that have long been trying to break up Russia and China, relying on the “fifth column” and other subversive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confrontation in the public mind is an important element of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the support of the armed forces, attack and defense are carried out in areas such as social media-based public opinion, electronic means of dissemination of information, psychology, and cyberattacks. Overwhelming advantage is then achieved through the use of a large number of precision weapons in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the assessments of hybrid warfare strategies made by Russian and Chinese experts are very similar. From a political point of view, it is important to have a common understanding that the initiators of hybrid warfare and “color revolutions” against geopolitical competitors have been invariably the United States and Western countries. Any recognition of a single source of threats to the national security of Russia and China should serve as a unifying factor in developing a strategy for joint countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To summarize, we should note that, for Russia’s relations with China in the context of the geopolitical confrontation with the United States and the West, it seems to be extremely important that we take into account one of the distinguishing features of the Chinese logic of thinking, which has shaped its national strategic culture. Its essence is that “a unity may split in two forces, but changes would follow through a combination of not two but three forces.” Thus, by the Chinese logic, one has to find and attract a third force in the face of a clear confrontation between two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktor Murakhovsky, “Безопасность страны как фундамент развития” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arsenal-otechestva.ru/article/1414-bezopasnost-strany-kak-fundament-razvitiya&quot;&gt;National Security as a Foundation for National Development, interview with Andrei Ilnitsky, Homeland’s Arsenal Journal, 51, no. 1, March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, under the influence of various currents of Western ideology, Russian society distressingly and increasingly crumbled from within. Today, we can see that part of both the Russian elite and society is ready to lean on currently fashionable Western ideological trends and lifestyles. Americans do not differentiate between informational, psychological, cyber operations, and electronic warfare, considering them as an equitable domain of a joint battle space in multidomain operations along with space, air, land, and water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, has unleashed an information-hybrid war against Russia. Its task is to overstrain Russia, to knock us off our targets, to unbalance the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this creates a new type of warfare. While in a classical war, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s manpower, in today’s cyberwars, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s infrastructure. In fact, the goal of the new warfare is to destroy the opponent’s identity and to change the mental and civilizational basis of the opponent’s society. I would call this type of warfare mental. Furthermore, if the manpower and infrastructure can at least be restored, the evolution of identity is an irreversible process, especially if the consequences of such mental warfare emerge only gradually — and only by skipping at least a generation, when it is too late to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the main weapon here is the World Wide Web; so, whoever owns it and provides its content has a strategic advantage. Unfortunately, we must admit that in this case the advantage is not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the merging of manipulative and cyber-strike means, followed by their gradual legalization as tools of influence against competitors and potential adversaries during peacetime, we urgently need to clarify the role that the Russian Armed Forces should play in such a setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital platforms and artificial intelligence technologies can also be actively used in the desovereignization of Russia by creating gaps in national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts know that, in the information war, there is only one tactic for victory — an offensive. So, to repel any aggressive attacks on our country, we should bring down the opponent’s agenda and seize the initiative. Now, should we then completely break off the cooperation with the West?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, no! We need a dialogue. The dialogue should not be just for the sake of a dialogue but from the platform of national interests, an example of which Putin gave at the Davos Club when he outlined our vision of the ways and scenarios of world development. I think and hope that, in the near future, “red lines” will be drawn on the geopolitical field, with the mapping of the landmarks of Russia’s national interests, which no one will be allowed to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just a few of the most important countermeasures: Internet sovereignty [and] strict blocking of the activities of foreign social media for spreading any information about unauthorized rallies and for any provocation of a protest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, avoids a direct military confrontation with Russia, as Russia is capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on them. The concept of a rapid global strike and the U.S. National Defense Strategy frankly states that the “hot war” should be preceded or completely replaced by the so-called proxy or hybrid war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Russia “does not change the minds” of our opponents, does not counteract or frustrate the aggressive plans of the United States and NATO, it will lose the initiative and be forced to maintain a passive defense in extremely unfavorable conditions. Inaction actually dooms our country to existence under the agenda imposed by Americans and their agents of influence. And this categorically does not correspond to Russia’s sovereign choice. Unfortunately, in Russia, the expert analytical support of the national security policy is far from optimal. We have not yet created an effective system corresponding to the new hybrid challenges. And the existing institutional and semantic field is broken down by departments and disciplines, which has left it unbalanced. We do not have an integrative center for development and decision making in national security, and we haven’t established a network of expert analytical institutions (think tanks) working and competing under a common government strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Стратегии сдерживания и принуждения как инструменты дипломатии XXI века” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nic-pnb.ru/analytics/strategii-sderzhivaniya-i-prinuzhdeniya-kak-instrumenty-diplomatii-xxi-veka/&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Coercion Strategies as Instruments of 21st Century Diplomacy, Scientific Research Center for Problems of National Security, April 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main task is to take measures to protect the space of our vital interests, primarily in the territories of our neighbors, many of which have been turned into theaters of a hybrid war against Russia. It is necessary to develop a strategy for a long-term confrontation in each direction, to look for a strong ally-partner to counter, who is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of a long-term strategy for joint struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, an important place should be given to maintaining, improving, and building up our intelligence potential, along with its mining and analytical structures, which are capable of carrying out systematic work to preempt enemy actions with the timely detection of non-traditional threats and the preparation of operational recommendations for their neutralization. The potential of forces and means of counterintelligence, special information structures, a well-established mechanism of military-civilian interaction and means of territorial defense should be able to guarantee the internal security of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to consider that the sources of advantage on the battlefield will shift from traditional factors, such as the size of forces and the level of weapons, to factors such as increased efficiency in obtaining and processing intelligence information based on modern forces and means as well as the computing power used in analysis, ensuring the security of strategic management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Разведка России в противостоянии гибридным угрозам” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nvo.ng.ru/nvo/2017-10-06/1_968_scouting.html&quot;&gt;The Role of Russian Intelligence in Countering Hybrid Wars, Independent Military Digest, June 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together with the CSTO, CIS, and SCO allies, we should take steps to update and coordinate our capabilities of implementing preventive strategic communication and optimize our use of monitoring to counter hybrid threats, including any indicators that enable quick predictions and recognition of any threatening situations in the administrative, political, socio-economic and cultural, and ideological areas. A priority area of our joint activities together with the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO should be to ensure our ability to reveal and fend off any threats of color revolutions in a timely fashion and to work ahead of the curve. To this end, within the framework of our joint strategy, we should develop plans to prepare for repelling any threat, introduce information exchange methods for allies and partners, and take joint steps to combat the financing of color revolutions. We should submit this as a priority project: adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO, and ensuring a response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions. We should explore military responses to hybrid threats by developing an appropriate regulatory framework through dialog, strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to countering hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Стратегии сдерживания и принуждения как инструменты дипломатии XXI века” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nic-pnb.ru/analytics/strategii-sderzhivani-ya-i-prinuzhdeniya-kak-instrumenty-diplomatii-xxi-veka/&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Coercion Strategies as Instruments of 21st Century Diplomacy, Scientific Research Center for Problems of National Security, April 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian–Chinese relations, we can attest to the advancement in their bilateral and multilateral interactions. Russia and China have developed a working mechanism for cooperation in the fields of information technology and cybersecurity. Their main working areas are: activities of the Russian–Chinese Subcommittee on Communications and Information Technologies (these concern the diversification of high-tech technology supply channels, including data storage systems and telecommunication equipment; the strengthening of network security; the improvement of management efficiency; and the development of the global information space); . . . interactions within the UN, SCO, and BRICS; . . . cooperation between the defense departments of the Russian Federation and China; . . . [and] dialogs and interactions among experts. . . . An important element in this mechanism has been the Russian–Chinese Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Ensuring International Information Security, signed in May 2015, which defines the areas of interaction in the information and digital areas. According to the document, countries will jointly respond to the most acute threats to international information security, while opposing any uses of information and communication technologies that may assist in any terrorist acts and/or interfere with internal affairs, undermine sovereignty or political stability, or incite ethnic or religious hatred, etc. This agreement has been of fundamental importance for the countries’ bilateral relations, despite its framework nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the process of solving any practical issues of cybersecurity, even within the SCO framework, has been quite complicated and confusing, despite the continual contacts and the existing agreement on cooperation between the countries. Cyber incidents have happened even between full members of the Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need to extend confidence-building measures to cyberspace are also dictated by the current state of affairs within the SCO, the RIC, and in the areas where the interests of the Eurasian countries, trying to build a new type of relations, generally intersect. However, achieving mutual trust in cyberspace has been one of the most difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been some progress in this direction. The defense departments of the Russian Federation and China have taken certain practical measures. These include, for example, staff network exercises. In December 2017, Russia and China held their second joint computer-aided command-and-staff missile defense exercise, Aerospace Security 2017. The first such exercises were held in May 2016 by the Central Research Institute of the Aerospace Defense Troops of the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in the summer of 2017, information appeared in the media about the study of technical capabilities for creating a joint Russian–Chinese technological platform for repelling cyber threats and reducing risks in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations. Today, the partners have created favorable conditions for further thematic dialogs through diplomatic, military, and other channels, and for exchanging information and communication technology products. All this may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace. The sphere of information and digital interaction between the parties has been gradually expanding. It involves the participation in the global management of the information environment, while observing one’s own interests and understanding that one’s partner has similar aspirations. The countries have also been working on creating the conditions for cooperation in the technological sphere and in the development and creation of modern technical means for counteracting and repelling cyber threats. Thus, despite the extreme complexity and inconsistency of the international conditions, Russia and China have managed to build positive cooperative interactions in the digital sphere and to accumulate constructive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Aiyong, “大国地缘政治竞争的新嬗变——以混合战争和灰色地带为例” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDAUTO&amp;amp;filename=JWDP202202007&quot;&gt;The New Transmutation of Geopolitical Competition among Great Powers – The Example of Hybrid Warfare and Gray Areas, Teaching and Research Journal, 2022, original version 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of targeting, hybrid warfare does not seek a head-to-head conflict between the great powers, but rather focuses on how to win hearts and minds. More specifically, U.S. hybrid warfare serves the need to preserve global hegemony, and its logic is offensive and globalist. Russian hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is used to restore Russia’s glory as a Eurasian power, and its logic is defensive and Eurasian. Both point to two key fringes: strategic pivot countries and the periphery of the great powers. The competition for strategic pivot states is intended to maintain and expand the international political influence of the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be seen that hybrid warfare has a distinct political attribute of serving the needs of great power competition; that is, it does not seek head-to-head confrontation between the great powers, but rather acquires geopolitical advantages by means of proxy wars or proxy destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a means of great power competition, the impact of hybrid warfare on the competitive process is extremely obvious. First, the violent nature of hybrid warfare and the competition for the peripheral zones of the great powers and strategic pivot areas are making indirect low-intensity conflicts between the great powers a reality. Second, the combined use of various instruments in hybrid warfare has forced the great powers to pay more attention to the way they use their forces and their composition while strengthening their armed forces. Third, the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Advisory Council summarizes gray-zone tactics into 10 categories: cyber and information warfare, covert operations, special forces, support for insurgent or terrorist activities, financing of nongovernmental actors, assistance to irregular forces, economic pressure, manipulation and undermining of democratic institutions, deliberate ambiguous actions, and explicit or implicit threats of force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic connotation of hybrid warfare also refers to the combined use of various means of destruction. The second aspect is the combined use of unconventional and conventional tools. A common tactic in gray-zone competition is the use of historical narratives, civilian intervention, fait accompli, psychological warfare, legal warfare, and other unconventional tools, which are coordinated with conventional tools such as alliance building, forward force presence, economic sanctions, and support for opposition forces to form a combined competitive force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geographic areas where great powers engage in geopolitical competition are usually on the periphery of another great power — that is, the strategic pivot areas and the periphery of the great powers — and in this respect, hybrid warfare, gray zones, and traditional great power competition are not dissimilar. The new twist, however, is that the great powers are increasingly focused on using “color revolutions,” cyberattacks, and narrative reshaping to induce changes within their rivals in their favor. For example, the “color revolution” as a hybrid warfare tandem configuration is an effort to magnify a certain imbalance in the field of economic and social development within the competitor country, support internal opposition and its base of activity — the fifth column, agents of foreign powers, and other forces — to create, when complemented by external forces, systemic crisis events within the competitor country. . . . This then creates the conditions for the use of coercive means to eventually destroy the legitimacy of the government’s actions or even overthrow it. This suggests a shift in the focus of the strategy of the great powers on the periphery of competition toward internal governance and the winning of hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of hybrid warfare and gray zones also poses new challenges and requirements for building national capacity to respond to international crises. Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy in the Ukraine crisis has put NATO’s proudly strong response mechanism into widespread question and caused NATO to be highly alarmed. This suggests that strong military forces alone cannot effectively respond to new crisis patterns and that maximizing the effectiveness of force use depends not only on the force itself but also on the coordination between force components to create maximum synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new transmutation of geopolitical competition among the great powers has brought inspiration to China. It shows that the means of competition are becoming more integrated, the process of competition is becoming increasingly blurred, and although the focus of competition revolves around the international order, the essence of competition is a struggle over the strength and weakness of national governance capacity. This has at least three implications for China’s response to the increasingly fierce geopolitical competition among the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One is to adhere to multilateralism and to mosaic international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;. . . . At the regional level, China can reduce the concerns of its neighbors about China’s rise by embedding its international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms and by using the construction and smooth operation of these mechanisms to realize its own preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second, it is necessary to establish a systemic concept to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers&lt;/em&gt;. . . . As China’s power grows and its international influence expands, it is especially important to fully estimate the possible international and regional spillover effects of domestic policies and to have the necessary response plans. In terms of timing, it is important to integrate current and future interests, to look to the future, and to reserve sufficient space for rules of action after national rejuvenation. In terms of concrete operations, while focusing on building hard and soft power it is also necessary to pay more attention to the organization and structure of forces and the coordinated use of various forces, so that they can demonstrate more flexible and coordinated response capabilities when dealing with emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third, the fundamental strategy to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers lies in “doing our own thing.”&lt;/em&gt; Although geopolitical competition among the great powers is an international phenomenon, it is fundamentally a competition between the strengths and weaknesses of internal governance capabilities of states. This is evident from the use of hybrid warfare and gray zones as a means of competition, focusing on creating psychological and physical chaos within competitors to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Chensheng, “中俄协作网络空间治理的基础与路径分析” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2018&amp;amp;filename=GJXW201709003&quot;&gt;Reflections on the Joint Prevention of ‘Color Revolutions’ in Russia and China, Eurasian Humanities Studies, 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “color revolutions” originally referred specifically to the regime changes that occurred in CIS countries at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the countries where “color revolutions” occurred, the opposition, with the support of Western countries, took advantage of the presidential and parliamentary elections to demonstrate against the government, using flowers, patterns, or clothing of a certain color as symbols in order to force the government leaders to step down and establish a pro-Western regime based on Western values.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be said that the “color revolutions” around the peripheral regions of Russia and China are only “pre-game warm-ups,” and that Russia and China are the ultimate targets of the “color revolutions” carried out by the United States and other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, as the United States and other Western countries have successfully implemented “color revolutions” in Central Asia and other regions, the circle of “color revolutions” against China and Russia has been quietly tightened. While actively promoting it externally, the United States and other Western countries are also trying to find a breakthrough in China and Russia, frequently meddling in the internal affairs of the two countries and staging despicable plays to subvert legitimate regimes in China and Russia. In addition, Biden has issued several tough statements against China and Russia since he took office. All these signs indicate that the threat of “color revolutions” in China and Russia is growing, and it is urgent for the two countries to cooperate to prevent “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and other Western countries, in collusion with reactionary separatists inside and outside of China, have openly fabricated and provoked China’s internal social problems in an attempt to dismantle China from within by means of “color revolutions.” Whether in the separatist activities of “Xinjiang independence” and “Tibet independence,” or in the Occupy Central rallies and “legislative amendment fiasco” in Hong Kon the West is behind them all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Russia has witnessed several large-scale demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin. Although it cannot be ruled out that some of these demonstrations do express some legitimate political demands of the people, the real situation is that the United States wants to use the social contradictions in Russia to fan the flames and maliciously intensify the conflict between the people and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, “color revolutions” tend to involve younger people. Compared to the traditional “color revolution” in which middle-aged people were the main force, the participants of the “color revolution” in recent years tend to be younger and younger, and students have become the vanguard of the “color revolution”. . . . Not only is the use of social media by the opposition much cheaper and more efficient, the instantaneous nature of social media messages is also more insidious and difficult to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One new development that we must pay particular attention to in terms of the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China is the arrival of Democrat Joe Biden in the White House in early 2021. Compared to his predecessor, Donald Trump, the possibility of a “color revolution” in the United States under Biden’s leadership has increased significantly, and the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China, as the main core targets, has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “the more turbulent the world becomes, the more resolute Chinese-Russian cooperation will be.” China and Russia will build a model of strategic mutual trust, firmly support one another in defending their core vital interests, jointly oppose “color revolutions,” combat all kinds of disinformation, and safeguard the autonomy and security of each regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese and Russian media must strengthen cooperation and effectively carry out international public opinion guidance and public opinion struggles. At present, the dominance of international public opinion is firmly held by Western countries led by the United States. . . . Faced with the powerful public opinion offensive of the West, China and Russia should not simply defend themselves and respond passively but should also make joint statements, take the initiative, and actively engage in a war of international public opinion with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SCO and CSTO are both regional security organizations, and maintaining regional security and stability is a common goal for both. At present, most of the SCO and CSTO member states are common members of both organizations, and most of them are countries at high risk of “color revolutions.” Therefore, it is very important for the two to cooperate in dealing with “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should intensify their military exercises to jointly respond to external interventions. During the political crisis in Belarus in 2020, the opposition fled abroad after the failure of the planned “color revolution” only to receive strong support from Western countries, with plans to launch another campaign to seize power from abroad. For example, the leader of the Belarusian opposition, Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Poland, was given an official residence in the capital as a “presidential palace in exile,” while Lithuania helped her set up an opposition coordination committee in the Lithuanian capital. In addition, Europe and the United States have pressured Belarusian authorities to overthrow Lukashenko’s regime through verbal intimidation, threats of sanctions, and leading NATO troops up to the Belarusian border. In the face of dual pressure from the domestic opposition and the external military, the government in power is usually unable to cope. For this reason, the two organizations should focus on strengthening military exercises with emphasis on emergency response in case of intervention by external forces in member states so that member states will have the strength to resist “color revolution” attempts in the face of external intervention. For example, shortly after the outbreak of the Belarusian crisis, the CSTO held the Indestructible Brotherhood 2020 joint military exercise in Belarus in response to NATO’s provocations on the Belarusian border. In the future, the SCO should also strengthen the organization of targeted military exercises in similar emergency situations to prevent external forces from violently interfering in the internal affairs of the organization’s member states. At the same time, the two organizations can attempt to conduct cross-organizational military exercises to jointly defend peace and tranquility in Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should strengthen exchanges and communication between member states and work together to deal with the threat of “color revolutions.” The SCO and CSTO should conduct security dialogues on the topic of “color revolutions” so that countries can share and exchange information within the organization, conduct risk assessments of “color revolutions” in relevant countries, and then formulate countermeasures to mitigate risks as swiftly as possible. Specifically, member states can be organized to exchange experiences on coping with “color revolutions.” For example, Russia has rich experience in dealing with “color revolutions;” in recent years, Russia has not only successfully thwarted several “color revolutions” against its own country but also accumulated a wealth of practical experience in the process of responding to “color revolutions” in CIS countries, with an impressive capacity for maintaining national interests and strategic security in crisis management. In addition, Russia has adopted legislative control over foreign NGOs and news media, as well as strict legal management of parades and assemblies (Jiang Li, 2015: 13). Russia can teach and share the above experience with members of the two organizations. As an important member of the SCO, China can share with other member states its experience in handling the Hong Kong issue in recent years. As the saying goes, preparedness ensures success, unpreparedness spells failure. Only in this way can we address “the weakest link” and can the overall capacity of member states to deal with “color revolutions” be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more important basis for collaboration is that both governments share the same perception of “cyber sovereignty” and prefer a government-led “multilateralism” mechanism of cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the issue of the attributes of cyberspace, the United States and other information powers consider cyberspace to be a “public domain” and therefore deny or hold an ambiguous attitude toward “cyber sovereignty.” In contrast, China and Russia consider cyberspace as a new domain of national sovereignty and an extension of national sovereignty in cyberspace and thus insist that “cyber sovereignty” is as sacrosanct as national territory. In December 2012, Russia proposed the initiative of “cyber sovereignty” at the United Nations International Telecommunication Union. China’s New National Security Law clarifies the concept of “sovereignty in cyberspace” through legislation. While there is international controversy over “cyber sovereignty,” it is undeniable that the infrastructure and equipment of the internet, the information that flows through it, and the people who use it are all closely linked to traditional states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, China and Russia face a great crisis in the field of information network technology and security, and both have a strong desire to guarantee national cybersecurity and participate in global cyberspace governance. As emerging countries, China and Russia have advantages in certain cutting-edge technologies, though there are still gaps in their independent research and development capabilities in core technologies, key equipment, and operating systems for information networks compared with information powerhouses such as the United States. Moreover, as the independent controllability of cybersecurity is weak, the hidden dangers of their cybersecurity are also more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both China and Russia have outstanding problems with cybersecurity, and thus the two sides can ensure future cybersecurity by promoting the international cybersecurity regime, strengthening technical exchanges between the two countries, and joint law enforcement and other forms of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian and Chinese governments should also strengthen exchanges and cooperation on cybersecurity technologies, improve the ability of both countries to prevent cybercrimes and information attacks, effectively improve the ability of both countries to guarantee cybersecurity, and work together for the goal of building autonomous and controllable cyber systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Russian government strongly supports the research and development of domestic information security technologies and products and insists on independent innovation. After years of efforts, it has developed its own unique advantages. The Russian companies Kaspersky and Dr.Web have not only taken the lead in the world in terms of market share of antivirus software but also provided strong support to the Russian government in terms of information security. Dr.Web is the Russian Ministry of Defense’s designated information security partner. Russia’s chip design technology is unique and has reached the world’s leading level. Russia is also working on developing its own operating system. In turn, China has accelerated the process of developing localization of network information products since 2014 and has also made significant achievements, such as the production of computer servers, with three domestic vendors in the top five server markets. . . . However, breakthroughs have not yet been achieved in the field of core hardware technologies such as chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia are already cooperating in information security, and Kaspersky Lab has been cooperating with our government enterprises for many years. In the future, if we can further strengthen S&amp;amp;T cooperation in the field of information and cyberspace, as well as jointly carry out research and development of information and communication technologies including increasing the exchange of information and training of personnel between the two sides, it will certainly be beneficial for both sides to improve the construction of cyberspace security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the early stage of the development of the internet, the United States had absolute dominance over the governance of cyberspace due to its technological leadership. With the development of the internet in various countries, especially in a large number of developing countries, there is a demand to construct a fairer and more just cyberspace that is more in line with the common interests of all countries. The game of cyberspace governance is gradually unfolding, and the prominence of cybersecurity issues has intensified the intensity of this game. Some say this is the era of warring states in cyberspace governance, while others say that cyberspace governance is fragmenting. It is obvious that this is an era when the established system is gradually broken and a new system is being formed, and the game is quite intense and full of challenges, but also provides opportunities for emerging countries such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It might make sense to buy time in this way if time favored us. But it does not — time favors our adversaries. Accepting risk now to reduce the risk of worse disaster in the future is the wisest and most prudent course of action for the US, NATO, and Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West faces a choice: it can accept the short-term risks of continuing to support Ukraine’s effort to achieve a sustainable and enduring resolution to the current Russian invasion, or it can push for a premature cessation of hostilities that greatly increases the likelihood of renewed Russian aggression on terms far more favorable to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path forward should be clear — the West must prioritize reducing Russia’s ability to renew a war that the Kremlin is more likely to win and that would carry the same escalation risks as the current war by helping Ukraine use its position of relative advantage now to set conditions to deter future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a vital national security interest in averting future Russian attacks on Ukraine. Russian invasions of Ukraine inevitably harm and endanger Europe and NATO, put the US commitment to defend its NATO allies on the table, and entail the risk of conventional or nuclear escalation. America and its Western allies and partners should not accept, let alone push for, a temporary cessation of hostilities in Ukraine that increases the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion in future years. This consideration must drive decisions about when to seek negotiated compromises and what conditions to encourage Ukraine to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US interests in ending the current war on terms that minimize the risk of future Russian invasion can be fully separated from the moral and humanitarian considerations that motivate many people to support Ukraine. American interests flow from the NATO alliance and the obligations it imposes on the US as well as to the close and vital economic interdependence of the US with Europe. Europe and NATO will be profoundly affected by a future Russian invasion of Ukraine as they have been by this one, and the US will face the same imperative to support its allies in the future as it does today. American policymakers today must focus on the imperative of resolving the current conflict in ways that do not set conditions for renewed war for our own interests, not just Ukraine’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely durability of a cessation of hostilities rests on three fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Russia’s objectives with respect to Ukraine, other former Soviet states, NATO, and the US change?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will the future correlation of forces favor Ukraine once the fighting stops?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Western support for Ukraine remain firm?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to all three questions if hostilities were suspended soon is “no.” Russia’s objectives are not likely to change in the foreseeable future and must be taken as a given. The correlation of forces will begin to move away from favoring Kyiv toward favoring Moscow as soon as the fighting stops, and Western support for Ukraine will almost inevitably begin to fall. Ukraine’s position today is such that a drop in Western support and the shift in the correlation of forces will significantly increase the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stable and sustainable cessation of hostilities can occur only if the West helps Ukraine use its current momentum to secure a sufficiently advantageous position from which it will be able to effectively deter a future Russian attack even as the correlation of forces changes and Western support falls. The imperative of seeking to avert a future war in Ukraine thus requires continuing to help Ukraine fight to make necessary military gains and secure necessary reconstruction assistance rather than seeking to freeze war prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s objective in launching the invasions of 2014 and then 2022 was the destruction of an independent, pro-Western Ukrainian state. His aims have increased over that period rather than moderating. His initial complaints in 2014 revolved around Ukraine’s orientation toward the West and away from Russia. Eight years later, he and his subordinates are engaged in a full-throated denial of the validity of a Ukrainian ethnicity or independent Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has clung to its demands despite battlefield defeats and its rhetoric has only become more extreme as Ukraine has turned the tide of the war against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely unlikely that Putin would accept any reasonable compromise terms because of the domestic price he would likely pay for having obtained relatively little at such a great cost. Putin and those around him are also driving his maximalist position on Ukraine deep into the Kremlin’s ideology and trying to imbue the Russian population with it. There is no evidence to suggest that Putin or any Putinist successor will abandon his maximalist objectives toward Ukraine, even if he or a successor is willing to accept a temporary cessation of hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planning assumption regarding Putin’s and Russia’s objectives toward Ukraine must be that they will remain unchanged — Russia will continue to seek to subjugate Ukraine to its control fully and completely by one means or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must learn the right lesson from the period of the Minsk II Accords from 2014 to 2022. France and Germany, with US support, engaged Russia as a theoretically neutral and non-belligerent mediator in a conflict begun by a Russian invasion. They imposed on Ukraine a set of commitments that amounted to partial surrender of Kyiv’s sovereignty while demanding no formal commitments directly from Russia. They accepted the fiction that Russian proxies in Ukraine were independent of Moscow and pressed Ukraine to uphold its commitments even as the proxies continually violated theirs — and never held Moscow explicitly to account for the actions of proxies that were acting on Russia’s orders and with Russia’s direct support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accords imposed a settlement that was extremely favorable to Russia. They specifically required Ukraine to grant the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk autonomy while at the same time allowing them to participate fully in the Ukrainian political process. Such a move would have created permanent Russian levers to manipulate the Ukrainian political system throughout the country while depriving Kyiv of the ability to control Russian and Russian proxy activities in the Russian-occupied areas. The accords did not require Russia to withdraw its forces from the areas it occupied because they did not recognize that Russia had forces in those areas — even though it clearly did. The theory of the case of those in the West who supported these accords was twofold — first, that “peace” in the form of an incredibly violent and constantly-violated ceasefire was better than open warfare, and second, that the “Minsk process” would somehow, ultimately, mollify Putin and bring him to accept a new status quo highly favorable to Russia permanently. Above all the Western backers of the Minsk II Process thought that Putin was focused only or at least primarily on eastern Ukraine, whereas in fact he continued to seek to regain effective control of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumptions underlying the Minsk II Process have been utterly and completely invalidated. Russia’s proxies deliberately ensured that they never met their commitments under the accords and so made it almost impossible for Ukraine to meet its commitments. The proxies were not out of Russia’s control — they were pursuing Putin’s aims. Because Putin was never satisfied with Minsk II — he wanted more, and he used his proxies to try to renegotiate the accords by force. When that effort failed, he invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden on those who would argue that any agreement between Russia and Ukraine today would not follow a similar path toward renewed Russian invasion is enormous. It is almost impossible, in fact, to see how one could persuasively make such an argument given Russian actions and rhetoric over nearly all of Putin’s tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must instead accept as a planning assumption that Putin will continue to try to renegotiate by force any limited compromise agreement made now, up to and including through renewed Russian full-scale invasion if and when he or his successor decides that circumstances are propitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration then raises the question of the likely trajectory of the correlation of forces between Russia and Ukraine. Some advocates of negotiations now point to the fact that Ukrainian leverage at the moment is high because of Kyiv’s battlefield successes and Western support, on the one hand, and Russia’s struggles and relative isolation, on the other. If negotiations conducted at a moment of high leverage could yield a permanent resolution of conflict, then such an approach can make sense. But if, as in the present case, a negotiated settlement can only be expected to generate a temporary respite, then this approach makes sense only if we can expect the future correlation of forces to favor Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration, in turn, requires a closer examination of the factors that have given Ukraine relatively high leverage at the moment. The key factors are the rallying of Ukrainians behind a full mobilization for war and high levels of Western support, on the one hand, and the catastrophically bad performance of the Russian military and Russian defense industry on the other. None of those factors is likely to change in the next six-to-twelve months if the fighting continues. All of them are likely to change rapidly and to Ukraine’s disadvantage once a ceasefire takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians remain willing to support full national mobilization because they are fighting a war for the survival of their state and people. They know that if they stop fighting, Russian troops will drive deeper into their country and inflict horrors on them, ultimately overthrowing their government and subjugating them. But full mobilization is extraordinarily painful. It will be unsustainable once the immediate threat of defeat is removed. Ukraine will have to demobilize partially and attempt to rebuild, greatly reducing its combat power. The Ukrainian government will be under pressure to do sustain a strong enough military to defend against future Russian invasion and reconstruct a vibrant and prosperous economy. Ukraine is not wealthy enough to do both of those things well, particularly if it must lose much of the territory Russia currently occupies, so it will likely suboptimize both. It will likely seek to stabilize a smaller but higher-quality military while satisfying the economic demands of its people. Ukraine’s organic military capacity will thus drop significantly following a ceasefire, possibly increasing again gradually as more sustainable military practices take hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine’s current military power-driven leverage is temporarily high because of full mobilization, Russia’s is temporarily low because of the series of stupid decisions made by Putin and his generals before and during this war. Putin did not mobilize for this war. He did not put Russia’s defense industry on a war footing. He did not prepare his people for war. He did not even prepare his military for war. Once his initial assumptions about the ease of this invasion were falsified he took many months to order the reserve mobilization he should have ordered at once. But he ordered even that mobilization without adequate preparation or warning, and it, too, became a mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces would have benefitted enormously from a months-long cessation of hostilities or even relaxation of the demand for offensive operations. Any such protracted operational or strategic pause would have given them time to reorganize, refit, and prepare for renewed offensive operations on much better terms. Putin gave them no such time, instead whipping his generals to constant offensives that simply ground the remaining combat power of the Russian military into dust. Putin did not allow his military to concentrate the mobilized reservists into coherent units that could be massed to achieve decisive battlefield effects, but instead demanded that they be hurled into combat piecemeal and unprepared, frittering away yet another opportunity to regain the initiative. All these dynamics continue to this day — the Russian military is consuming combat power as fast as it can be generated and is trying to draw on a defense industrial base only slowly and haltingly creaking into gear and badly hampered by international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of Putin’s bad decisions has been to reduce Russia’s effective combat power to a level far below what Russia could in principle generate. Russia’s military weakness is thus very likely temporary. As soon as the fighting stops the Russian military can begin to reconstitute itself. Lessons can be learned. Bad organization can be rectified. Its defense industry can start to come online and replace essential kit, especially if sanctions are lifted even partially — and it is very hard to imagine Putin accepting any ceasefire that does not include some significant sanctions relief. Conscription and training systems can be improved. Russia can start to generate the kind of military power its population, industrial base, and military organization have the potential to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A protracted ceasefire will thus likely allow Russia to restore the correlation of forces between itself and Ukraine that is the natural result of the countries’ relative sizes and economic capacities — in other words, Russia will likely regain its inherent military advantages over Ukraine in the years following a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support to Ukraine is the key factor in this equation. Russia can regain military superiority over Ukraine, but it cannot establish military superiority over Ukraine backed by the West. So the final question is this: Will Western support for Ukraine increase, decrease, or remain the same following a ceasefire? The answer is obvious: it will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support today is driven partly by Russian actions and partly by the heroic and effective resistance of Ukrainians in the face of initially overwhelming military odds and then the atrocities Russian forces continue to commit. The Russian military continues offensive operations to conquer Ukrainian territory. It uses brutal tactics against the Ukrainian military and is conducting war crimes on a scale amounting to crimes against humanity. It is deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure while conducting ethnic cleansing operations using genocidal rhetoric. Russia has created a massive humanitarian and refugee crisis that obviously demands urgent responses. At the same time Ukrainian forces have fought back bravely and brilliantly, defeating the Russian drive on Kyiv, liberating Kharkiv in a stunning and rapid counteroffensive, and most recently pushing Russian troops out of western Kherson. These factors more than any others have kept Western support for Ukraine strong and created a political environment in most Western states that makes abandoning Ukraine highly unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those dynamics will begin to change rapidly once the fighting stops. Attention will turn to reconstruction, which is inherently far less popular. Reconstruction is also inherently political and will focus attention on Ukrainian domestic politics and the natural and historic limitations of Ukrainian governance effectiveness. Domestic tensions within Ukraine will naturally grow as various groups argue for differential distributions of reconstruction aid and more normal politics returns with all its strife and messiness. Russia’s inherent skill in manipulating the information space, overwhelmed during the fighting by Russia’s failures and brutality, will begin to shape perceptions more effectively once more. The current veneer of near-universal support for Ukraine will vanish, and arguments about how and even whether to continue to support Ukraine will become much more prominent throughout the West. Both military and economic aid to Ukraine will certainly decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few years of the cessation of hostilities, therefore, the following conditions are extremely likely to hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian military power will be lower than it is now&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian military power will be greater than it is now and rising&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western military support for Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western economic support for Ukraine will be insufficient and dropping&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General Western enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal Ukrainian cohesion will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s aims toward Ukraine and the US will remain unchanged&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western leaders and Ukrainians should not simply accept these forecasts as givens, of course. Western political leaders should fight hard to sustain Western support for Ukraine, continuing to make the real and urgent case for defending the West’s interests by helping Ukraine rebuild and deter future Russian invasions. Ukrainians should also fight to rebuild as cohesive a state and society as they can, as well as to sustain the strongest defense posture possible in their post-conflict economic and social conditions. But a sober forecast based on normal historical trends and patterns requires assuming that such efforts will be at best partially acceptable, and future policy should be based on pessimistic sobriety rather than hopeful optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious conclusion follows from these observations: Any territory Ukraine does not retake now will likely be lost to it indefinitely. The de facto borders of Ukraine at a ceasefire in the near term will be the maximum territorial extent of the Ukrainian state for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also recognize that the risks of escalation driving the current push to press Ukraine to make concessions will be just as real whenever Russia renews the attack. Russia will always be a nuclear power. It will always be able to attack NATO with conventional or nuclear forces. Those facts will not be changed by a ceasefire now. If Putin or his successor concludes after a few years of rebuilding that he can try to conquer Ukraine again, NATO will face exactly the same risks then that some are now seeking to avoid by driving Kyiv to concessions. Those concessions will only have made the renewed invasion and return of escalation risks more likely while weakening Ukraine’s ability to deter and defeat another massive attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important conclusion to draw from all these reflections, however, is this: Ukraine’s power and Western support for Ukraine is at or near its peak and can remain there only as long as fighting continues and Ukraine continues to make gains. Both will likely begin to drop rapidly once fighting is halted or conditions of real stalemate descend. Russia’s diminishing power and influence, on the other hand, will likely begin to rise when active combat stops. Success for Ukraine and the West lies in ensuring that Ukraine has secured territorial gains, military capabilities, and economic and reconstruction support while it is at or near its peak that are all great enough to deter a recovering Russia from restarting the war even as Ukraine’s power and Western support drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine should not cash in the leverage it might have now to secure a temporary cessation of hostilities that will leave it in a far more vulnerable condition that will invite future Russian aggression, therefore. Kyiv and its Western supporters, rather, should reinforce Ukraine’s current advantages to consolidate Ukraine’s position during the fighting so that Ukraine — and peace — can survive the inevitable erosion of Kyiv’s current advantages after the conflict’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

ISIS is gradually increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria and will use these capabilities to continue freeing imprisoned members and absorbing expertise and personnel in preparation for a larger resurgence. The group will attempt to exploit weaknesses in US-supported SDF counterinsurgency efforts to create sanctuaries. ISIS will use new sanctuaries to mount larger and more sophisticated attacks to degrade the SDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham is increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS has increased its use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), a capability that requires robust logistics. ISIS’s VBIED use surged during two recent periods, indicating that the group’s attack capabilities are strengthening. The first surge occurred between September 2021 and January 2022. ISIS used five VBIEDs — two of them successful — during this period. The first surge also points to an increase in capability compared to early 2021, when ISIS only mounted motorcycle-borne improvised explosive device (MBIED) attacks in northeast Syria. The second surge occurred in September 2022. ISIS built at least four VBIEDs and one MBIED — employing one VBIED and one MBIED successfully — during the second surge. The group’s ability to construct a similar number of VBIEDs in a shorter time frame indicates a capability increase compared to the first surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS likely used freed fighters and redeployed some preexisting cells to conduct its VBIED surges. ISIS moved fighters from the Syrian desert back to Iraq and northeastern Syria in 2021, contributing to the first VBIED surge in September 2021. ISIS’s January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack freed at least 300 fighters. This prison break likely increased organizational capacity, allowing ISIS to begin a second VBIED surge in September 2022. ISIS also appointed a new Iraqi-born emir in the central Syrian desert in 2022 who was freed during the al Sina’a prison break. The need to reintegrate freed fighters into ISIS’s organizational structure in northeastern Syria may explain the time lag between the prison break and the September VBIED surge. ISIS will continue its effort to free sympathizers and fighters. The group’s attack attempt against al Hol internally displaced people (IDP) camp in September 2022 likely sought to free cells and sympathizers, though a successful attack would also have propaganda value by freeing ISIS families and protecting women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), used VBIED capabilities to free imprisoned fighters and improve the quality of its attack cells.&lt;/strong&gt; AQI prison breaks in 2012 strengthened the group’s capabilities in Iraq. AQI prison breaks likely led to its ability to conduct major VBIED “waves” targeting Iraqi population centers in 2012–13. ISIS today is weaker than AQI was in 2012–13, but ISIS is likely using prison breaks to resuscitate some capabilities. Recent prison breaks and smaller escapes likely improve ISIS’s capabilities by providing experienced fighters for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria in 2022 is less permissive for ISIS than Iraq was in 2011–13. AQI was capable of repeated spectacular attacks targeting civilians in Iraqi cities. AQI used 30 VBIEDs on one day in July 2012, a number far beyond ISIS’s current capabilities in Syria. ISIS does not have the freedom of movement or access to funding required to conduct VBIED attacks at AQI’s 2012–13 rate. ISIS also does not have the same organizational capacity AQI had in 2013. AQI had “reconstituted as a military force” with a “force-level planning cell” that could “task VBIEDs to support a complex, specialized operation” by 2013, while ISIS is a “low-level insurgency” in 2022. There is also greater counterterrorism pressure on ISIS in 2022 compared to that on AQI in 2011–13. The SDF receives greater US support than did Iraq during 2011–13, and the SDF may be more effective than the Iraqi Security Forces were between 2011–13. US special operations forces and air support limited the ISIS prison break at al Sina’a in January 2022. Tribes continue to facilitate US and SDF counterterrorism operations by providing intelligence, despite the risks posed to them by ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS will likely pursue a similar strategy to the one that enabled its predecessor’s resurgence in Iraq in 2011, despite a less permissive environment in Syria today. ISIS is at a very early stage in its resurgence, and it will likely pursue its strategy at a slower rate than AQI did after 2008. AQI sowed division between the government and local population in Sunni areas of Iraq in 2011–13 by targeting tribal “awakening” fighters who successfully rolled back Iraqi counterterrorism gains against al Qaeda in Iraq between 2007 and 2011. ISIS is emulating this effort by attempting to turn SDF-controlled territory into “areas of fear and terror” by assassinating members of the SDF and its allies “at will” to create panic. ISIS is also using Syria’s desert as a sanctuary where it can rebuild its capabilities, similar to AQI use of rural areas in Iraq after 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s increased logistical and operational capacity will allow it to intensify its efforts to target detention facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS’s IED manufacturing sites and major weapons depots ISIS possesses a logistical apparatus that will allow it to conduct further attacks against detention facilities or other high-value targets. ISIS is likely also capable of generating intelligence using SDF and local informants to facilitate attacks and prison breaks. The SDF’s capture of a major weapons depot near Tel Hamis in September 2022 could temporarily stop some attacks, but VBIED attacks are likely to resume unless the SDF arrests the VBIED cell and its more permanent assets, such as manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF’s counter-ISIS operations and new security measures around detention facilities have not removed the threat ISIS poses to these facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The SDF’s failure to secure areas surrounding prisons in northeastern Syria will allow ISIS to continue attack attempts aimed at freeing prisoners. The SDF did move “approximately half” of ISIS detainees to “more secure facilities.” The Defense Intelligence Agency, however, reported in May 2022 that many of the same vulnerabilities that enabled the January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack persist at the prison. ISIS VBIED and sleeper cells likely remain active near major detention sites, such as al Hol IDP Camp and al Sina’a prison. ISIS used sleeper cells and VBIEDs staged nearby to conduct the al Sina’a attack in January 2022. These cells fixed SDF forces in place and prevented SDF units from responding to the al Sina’a attack, increasing the ability of ISIS fighters to escape. In Raqqa, ISIS sleeper cells are likely intentionally “lying low” to avoid US and SDF pressure. The group attempted two prison breaks in Raqqa in fall 2022, and it could use sleeper cells to launch future attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF will prioritize confronting Turkish military activity over counter-ISIS operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Turkey is targeting the SDF with air strikes and threatening a ground incursion in northern Syria. Another Turkish incursion will distract the SDF and cause the SDF to decrease its counterterrorism pressure on ISIS. The SDF’s spokesperson said the group could not deter Turkish attacks and fight ISIS simultaneously and stopped counter-ISIS operations on November 23, though the SDF resumed joint patrols with US forces on December 2. Lifting SDF counterterrorism pressure will provide an opening for ISIS to prepare attacks against key facilities, such as al Hol IDP camp. A Turkish air strike on November 23 near al Hol targeted an SDF base. The air strike did not target al Hol itself, but air strikes against SDF security near al Hol distracts SDF forces tasked with securing al Hol’s surroundings. This could allow ISIS to exploit opportunities to target high-value facilities such as al Hol or other prisons in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a significant Turkish incursion, ISIS will take advantage of the SDF’s counterproductive counterterrorism approach. The current SDF approach relies on mass arrests, counterterrorism raids, and destruction of property. These tactics contribute to popular grievances, which are key to a renewed insurgency. ISIS can recruit through detention centers after mass arrests and encourage retaliation against the SDF for counterterrorism raids and property destruction. ISIS is often able to maintain its presence in areas subject to SDF raids and arrests. ISIS reportedly “owns the night” in areas of northeast Syria and threatens to kill SDF employees for their cooperation with the SDF. The SDF’s approach actively worsens core grievances among the local communities, such as reconstruction and a lack of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could undermine the SDF by sowing division between Arab communities and the SDF in northeastern Syria. The group will aim to expand from desert sanctuaries and attempt to create support zones by assassinating and intimidating SDF civilian and military employees, tribal dignitaries, and other local civilians.[1] The SDF’s counterterrorism approach is overly reliant on mass arrests, while its fails to protect its employees and civilian populations. These shortcomings could drive local communities to support ISIS and provide sanctuary to the group. Poor security and governance already created tension between the SDF and local communities in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Division between the SDF and locals will allow ISIS to use its presence in northeastern Syria to limit the SDF’s freedom of movement and gradually reimpose its governance in areas of northeastern Syria. ISIS has successfully fixed the SDF in place during certain operations, such as the al Sina’a prison break. Increased ISIS capabilities could make a similar effort more successful in the future. Fixing the SDF in place or isolating specific bases could cause the SDF to vacate some areas if SDF reinforcements cannot protect outposts or smaller bases in ISIS attack zones. SDF bases and outposts allow the SDF to protect the surrounding areas. The SDF may also become less capable of targeting ISIS cells as local communities lose faith in the SDF’s security. Local activists in Deir Ezzor said SDF raids sometimes target innocent civilians due to faulty intelligence. Decreased SDF presence and capability would allow ISIS to reimpose its governance gradually in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could strengthen quickly should conditions change, causing Syria to become more permissive for ISIS. The SDF remains reliant on US intelligence support to enable operations, though SDF intelligence collection and exploitation is improving. A US withdrawal could decrease the SDF’s effectiveness by ending US intelligence and logistical support. ISIS could use decreased pressure to strengthen capabilities such as VBIED manufacturing and local recruitment. These capabilities would allow ISIS to mount sophisticated attacks against SDF military positions and detention sites. ISIS is capable of generating funds through smuggling and forced zakat collection. The group could expand these efforts further if competing priorities distract the SDF. Finally, increased ISIS intelligence collection and exploitation may allow ISIS to assassinate and intimidate local leaders to cooperate with ISIS, to the detriment of the SDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The death of ISIS’s leader in mid-October is unlikely to change ISIS’s trajectory in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; Local Syrian armed groups killed ISIS’s leader in southern Syria on October 17. The al Sina’a prison break in January 2022 was likely the last major operation planned by ISIS’s overall leader. ISIS’s emir in northeastern Syria likely has both the authority and resources required to plan and conduct complex attacks against high-value targets in northeastern Syria. An Iraqi militant freed from al Sina’a in January 2022 leads ISIS in the central Syrian desert. His time in al Sina’a indicates he may have significant experience within ISIS before 2019 and may be able to assist planning efforts. ISIS cells in the central Syrian desert likely support ISIS activity in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Carter</name></author><summary type="html">Turkish military activity in Syria will accelerate the strengthening of the ISIS in Iraq and al Sham.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI And The Arctic</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-ai-and-the-arctic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI And The Arctic" /><published>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/ai-and-the-arctic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-ai-and-the-arctic.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maps of the Arctic are misleading. The vastness of the region is not fully captured in two dimensions: the Arctic Circle spreads across roughly 14.5 million square kilometers, a greater area than any country save Russia.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This fact is not only trivia; it has serious implications for the well-being of the communities who live there, the militaries who monitor it, and the scientists who seek to better predict the coming global impacts of climate change. To perform their functions well, each of these actors seeks tools to compensate for or overcome these vast distances, as well as the harsh environment that makes sustained presence in the Arctic so challenging. Increasingly, these communities — some of which have been in the Arctic for decades, and others for centuries — are coming to understand that artificial intelligence may be essential to monitor the region and predict changes within it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, the authors tackle the implications of this new tool for national security and climate research. Both pieces illustrate how governments, scientists, and Indigenous communities can use artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to better understand key Arctic problem sets, particularly those that involve parsing either a massive amount of data or complex and shifting future scenarios. At the same time, both note that AI/ML, while holding immense potential, remains not entirely proven. In some cases, a lack of funding hinders a robust deployment of AI/ML; in others, it must compete with more established and orthodox methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first essay, Lieutenant Commander Michael Bielby of the Canadian Armed Forces lays out Canada’s incipient efforts to use AI/ML for its domain awareness mission in the far north. He explains the unique physical challenges of the region and the insufficiency of using only crewed resources to monitor it, given the finiteness of those assets and the vast distances involved. Passive and active sensors are the means to compensate for this reality, but as Lt. Commander Bielby notes, this creates a new problem: a “deluge” of data where it is not always possible for human operators to distinguish quickly (enough) between what might be an adversary vessel and what might simply be natural debris. He argues that AI/ML may well be the answer to this riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second contributor is Dr. Lillian “Doc” Alessa, an Arctic and intelligence expert and a member of the National Climate Assessment Team. Dr. Alessa interrogates the applicability of AI/ML for researching the thaw of Arctic permafrost, which underlies 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. The rate at which climate change causes this permafrost to melt has serious consequences for not only local Arctic communities, but the entire world. Dr. Alessa argues that, especially if paired with the knowledge of those local communities, AI-generated models will allow policymakers to better understand permafrost thaw as well as test different scenarios of melting against various tactics for intervention or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsibility of every state is to exercise its sovereignty through the protection of its defined territory from intrusions by foreign states. For that to happen, the state must understand what is happening within those physical spaces. It must have domain awareness. For a number of reasons, this becomes extremely challenging in far northern regions. In recent years, Canada and other Arctic states are increasingly considering how to develop and deploy AI/ML tools to address this domain awareness challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 40 percent of Canada’s land mass, roughly 3.5 million km2, lies north of 60° north latitude. As with most inhabited Arctic regions in North America, Europe, and Russia, it is scarcely populated — in Canada’s case, fewer than 120,000 people, or less than one person per approximately 26 km2. Understandably, it is very difficult to generate the requisite level of domain awareness necessary for the state to exercise sovereignty in this remote territory. The obvious solution is to start generating that awareness before state actors can breach territorial boundaries — in other words, to detect them at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduces a whole new problem set, as Canada’s exclusive economic zone north of 60° encompasses approximately 4 million km2. The economic and logistical feasibility of monitoring such a vast area using crewed resources would be taxing enough, but the task of generating maritime domain awareness becomes financially and logistically untenable when considering the inhospitable climate of the Canadian north, a lack of suitable extant infrastructure, and the fact that infrastructure development projects are plagued by supply chain issues and a shortened building season. To further exacerbate the issue, the finite crewed resources suitable to conduct this mission are also required to deliver similar strategic effects on overseas missions. As such, the only viable option, at this time, for Canada becomes the employment of space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (SB-ISR) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the various factors that complicate maritime activity in northern waters — such as sea state (high sea states result in sea spray and accumulation of ice on the upper decks in sub-zero temperatures, which can affect ship stability and potentially result in a ship sinking or capsizing), icebergs, and the varying constructions of vessels plying those waters — no single SB-ISR sensor type is a panacea. An active sensor may detect the signal return off an object (e.g., metal reflect signals better than fiberglass) but cannot necessarily differentiate between a ship and a bergy bit, and passive sensors can be defeated simply by turning off an emitter. Therefore, a mix of active and passive sensors ensures a greater probability of detecting contacts. However, in solving one problem, another is created: multiple sensor feeds create massive amounts of positional data. The result is that Arctic operators drown in the deluge of data from SB-ISR sensors while starving for domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the deluge of data is framed as a big data issue, there are four variables to consider: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Maritime positional data from various sensor feeds for the approaches to North America and the Arctic exceeds tens of millions of reports daily (volume), is received in a variety of structured and unstructured reporting formats (variety), and arrives continuously (velocity). System operators are not able to keep up with the velocity of the data flow from SB-ISR sensors while performing the necessary quality-control functions (veracity) while also monitoring for anomalous behavior as bad actors attempt to exploit various interstitial gray areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to correlate the volume and variety of data at the velocity in which it is received is through the adoption of AI/ML. This technology will not only solve the operators’ problems but, at machine-to-machine speeds, will be able to cross-cue additional sensors based on the data received, thereby improving the probability of achieving positive identification and subsequent domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is still somewhat of a newcomer to the adoption and implementation of AI/ML to support maritime domain awareness. However, the Royal Canadian Navy’s Innovation Team recently trialed an advanced maritime domain awareness software that uses AI/ML to detect surface vessel traffic acting unusually. In addition, the Royal Canadian Air Force, as the CAF Functional Authority for space, has factored AI/ML requirements into many of the SB-ISR projects currently under way. Given the complexities of the approval process for CAF projects, the implementation of many of these solutions is still a few years off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, the CAF’s most effective AI/ML mitigating strategy has been the reinvigoration of multinational partnerships, such as the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and the (re)establishment of information-sharing agreements among allied nations and partner departments within the Canadian government. Once the data is shared, recipients can process it and notify the broader operational community of any indications and warnings of anomalous behavior. Within national chains of command, or in accordance with extant multinational treaties, this then allows platforms such as aircraft, ships, and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be tasked to conduct ISR missions against specific targets. This is a more efficient use of limited resources for known high-value targets and for missions of national importance. However, the weakness in this strategy is revealed in situations where the military is dealing with contacts that have not been positively identified and whose value is unknown. In such cases, the competition against other national interests and departmental priorities for the allocation of scarce resources makes it difficult to justify ISR missions. This is why this multinational approach, while useful, remains an interim solution at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more that countries depend on SB-ISR in the vast and remote high north to aid in the exercising of sovereignty, the more likely Arctic operators are to drown in a deluge of big data. In the long term, investing in the development of robust AI/ML capabilities that can be employed in the region is the only way for Arctic states to turn big data into domain awareness and ensure their sovereignty is protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the population of the Arctic is only around 4 million people, the region has global significance due to its strategic geography, exploitable natural resources, and rapid rate of climate and environmental change (CEC). It also contains permafrost, which is ground that remains below 0°C for two or more consecutive years, making it frozen and a largely stable foundation for the active layer, which supports above-ground flora, fauna, and built infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous (deep) and discontinuous (shallow) permafrost comprises a full 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere, and current estimates suggest that between 30 and 85 percent of current subsurface permafrost will thaw within a century, depending on global temperature increases. While permafrost thaw is often thought of as a future phenomenon, it has been changing rapidly for roughly the past 40 years. The effects can be readily seen in natural terrain and built infrastructure, where degradation is ultimately placing at risk roughly $15.5 billion in civil infrastructure in the United States alone, much of which supports the defense enterprise. Furthermore, given that permafrost covers approximately 65 percent of the Russian Arctic, it is necessary to understand, with exquisite precision, where and when changes to Russia’s infrastructure will result in opportunities to gain strategic advantage by improving the Department of Defense’s own resilience to a highly variable operating environment. Understanding the complex dynamics of permafrost thaw and its effects on strategic activities such as defense and security requires leveraging all available tools, particularly AI/ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea bucks a deep-seated tradition in Arctic research, where field research is synonymous with the golden era of exploration. However, field research places significant burdens on local communities and funding agencies, which incur high costs for increasingly low returns on investments. Especially when combined with the deep pools of local and place-based knowledge of Indigenous peoples, new tools such as AI/ML are a better means to improve U.S. and allied resilience to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of resilience in Arctic defense is poorly articulated. It is a term often overused and thrown around in strategic intents and policies, holding different meanings for different interest groups. Here it is defined as the ability of three types of integrated systems — (1) social (people, including their cultures and perceptions); (2) ecological (the natural environments in which they live); and (3) technological (the tools and structures used by human organizations) — to maintain desired functions despite climate change. To be achieved, Arctic resilience in this context must include the social elements of cultures and human behavior. Given the many variables and their complicated interactions, it is more critical than ever that social and societal systems be incorporated into permafrost science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML promises to yield the needed insights in time to be proactive and adapt successfully to the unprecedented rate of CEC. A holy grail for permafrost researchers, geopolitical strategists, and military planners alike is the development of data-driven scenarios within which it is possible to forecast potential early warnings of threats and opportunities to guide proactive interventions. AI/ML permits the user to take known interactions of variables (i.e., rule sets) within academic disciplines and apply them to a range of scenarios at landscape and regional scales as an integrated system. Working within these scenarios, AI/ML can process data to visualize the consequences and trade-offs of different CEC conditions and types of interventions at the local scale. Extending this to permafrost and defense, AI/ML creates knowledge of where and when a strategic advantage may be gained and by whom as CEC affects different types of infrastructure and ecological processes. For example, permafrost underlies the majority of Russia’s Arctic coastline and infrastructure in the region. Using AI/ML to model these effects accelerates the ability to accurately gauge, for example, which military bases will be at risk and what the consequences are to the United States and its partners and allies, which can lead to better precision in defense planning and diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML can be used in this context only because extensive funding over the past 30 years has yielded rule sets for permafrost physics, soil biology, and behavior of built environments that are highly precise. This means AI/ML worlds can be used to scale down to individual structures, which can rapidly improve the way infrastructure, logistics, and operations are designed. However, knowledge of how humans will react to such changes is lacking, such as how communities could be held at risk by and respond to the loss of freshwater resources. AI/ML offers a readily available laboratory to run scenarios and understand trade-offs far more quickly, cost effectively, and safely than could ever be accomplished in the past. Its value is increased when it is used as a tool that enhances engagements with diverse human communities. Since it allows multiple variables to run simultaneously, and since these series can be adjusted and amended in real time by human stakeholders and rights-holders, it also helps eliminate much of the uncertainty that policymakers and decisionmakers dislike. For example, it can be used to better identify key water sources and the systems that need to be in place to either protect them or mitigate their loss, in order to ensure their resilience for future use. In short, knowing the likely effects of permafrost on key resources allows affected communities to articulate consequences, trade-offs, and their approaches to dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that AI/ML does not provide answers or solutions, it merely enables the humans tackling these challenges to ask better questions, refine understandings, and then ask the harder questions together. This cycle has traditionally taken months or years but can be done within hours via AI/ML-assisted research. Indeed, the key to addressing the many unknowns of a rapidly changing Arctic and the roadmap to resilience in defense and security is asking the right questions. Using AI/ML offers the freedom to think and do things differently by envisioning scenarios of plausible futures where a diverse range of adaptation interventions can be examined — in collaboration with the people, especially local actors, who will have to carry them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter point underlines yet another benefit of leveraging AI/ML: this process of refining questions simultaneously enhances partnerships. In fact, one of the most critical factors in using AI/ML effectively is close collaboration with rights-holders and stakeholders — ideally at the same time — whether they be local communities or military planners. Models that are not aligned with the perceptions and knowledge that exist at local scales induce higher uncertainties in outcomes. In other words, using AI/ML to understand the consequences of changes in permafrost and develop the interventions to build resilience relies as much on human behaviors as it does on engineering. AI/ML is a key tool to bring the end users, operators, and stakeholders directly into the data-driven scenarios where human perceptions, decisionmaking, and reactions can be incorporated in real time, something that cannot be achieved outside of AI/ML-built worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming evidence that human behaviors and social dynamics are powerful determinants of resilience outcomes, disciplinary approaches in engineering, human factors (i.e., human-machine teaming), and ecology heavily dominate Arctic permafrost research. Alone, these will not deliver the level of adaptation needed to address CEC in the Arctic because adaptation is itself a human endeavor, which requires the integration of the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptation can be accomplished by leveraging the analytic power of AI/ML to integrate the authoritative data available in hand, in order to identify critical gaps in knowledge, training, and preparedness and gain a more precise understanding of resilience. Approaching permafrost in the Arctic as an engineering problem will not lead to resilience if social dynamics are not central to analyses. AI/ML has often been criticized as something that removes humans from the loop, but it is only through engagement with partners — those who must deal with the consequences of changing permafrost, especially the loss of freshwater systems — that it is possible to develop accurate scenarios where decisions can be made and the effects of those decisions can be seen more quickly. Approaching permafrost thaw in the Arctic through AI/ML-assisted scenarios built and amended by stakeholders will result in more effective policies and the acquisition of technologies that are tailored to specific adaptations. For example, instead of trying to move water over long distances, something that requires an enormous amount of fuel, water storage systems can be engineered specific to the locale in which permafrost is changing. Innovation is often met with resistance even at the highest levels, but a growing number of practitioners — including colleagues across academia, Arctic communities, the U.S. government, and partners from the Five Eyes and NATO alliances — recognize the need to shift the approach to science and encourage the use of AI-related tools such as agent-based modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML is clearly a useful tool for permafrost research in the Arctic, and other nations are beating the United States to it. Leveraging it may even lead to ideas for novel applications relevant for questions of Arctic geopolitics, such as Russia’s militarization of the region. Without AI/ML, the United States may not gain insights at the speed of need, and research will remain slow and expensive, yielding models that are less useful to the U.S. defense enterprise and the stakeholders and partners in the Arctic on whom the United States relies. Leveraging AI/ML allows the mess of reality, in all its glorious diversity, to be incorporated into a structured set of analyses and scenarios that are only possible with advanced computational tools. It is the means by which the inputs from diverse stakeholders, whether the defense enterprise or an Indigenous corporation, can be fully included in establishing and maintaining adaptation actions that collectively ensure resilience in a rapidly changing Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure that those drawing lessons from the conflict do so from a solid foundation, this report seeks to outline key lessons, based on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff, from the fighting between February and July 2022. As the underlying source material for much of this report cannot yet be made public, this should be understood as testimony rather than as an academic study. Given the requirements for operational security, it is necessarily incomplete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to invade Ukraine over a 10-day period and thereafter occupy the country to enable annexation by August 2022. The Russian plan presupposed that speed, and the use of deception to keep Ukrainian forces away from Kyiv, could enable the rapid seizure of the capital. The Russian deception plan largely succeeded, and the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage north of Kyiv. The very operational security that enabled the successful deception, however, also led Russian forces to be unprepared at the tactical level to execute the plan effectively. The Russian plan’s greatest deficiency was the lack of reversionary courses of action. As a result, when speed failed to produce the desired results, Russian forces found their positions steadily degraded as Ukraine mobilised. Despite these setbacks, Russia refocused on Donbas and, since Ukraine had largely expended its ammunition supply, proved successful in subsequent operations, slowed by the determination – rather than the capabilities – of Ukrainian troops. From April, the West became Ukraine’s strategic depth, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) only robbed Russia of the initiative once long-range fires brought Russian logistics under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical competence of the Russian military proved significantly inferior compared with the expectations of many observers based within and outside Ukraine and Russia. Nevertheless, Russian weapons systems proved largely effective, and those units with a higher level of experience demonstrated that the AFRF have considerable military potential, even if deficiencies in training and the context of how they were employed meant that the Russian military failed to meet that potential. Factoring in the idiosyncrasies of the Russian campaign, there are five key areas that should be monitored to judge whether the Russian military is making progress in resolving its structural and cultural deficiencies. These areas should be used to inform assessments of Russian combat power in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF currently operate with a hierarchy of jointery in which the priorities of the land component are paramount, and the military as a whole is subordinate to the special services. This creates sub-optimal employment of other branches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF force-generation model is flawed. It proposes the creation of amalgamated combined arms formations in wartime but lacks the strength of junior leadership to knit these units together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a culture of reinforcing failure unless orders are changed at higher levels. This appears less evident in the Russian Aerospace Forces than in the Ground Forces and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF are culturally vulnerable to deception because they lack the ability to rapidly fuse information, are culturally averse to providing those who are executing orders with the context to exercise judgement, and incentivise a dishonest reporting culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF’s capabilities and formations are prone to fratricide. Electronic warfare (EW) systems and other capabilities rarely deconflict, while processes for identifying friend from foe and establishing control measures are inadequate. The result is that capabilities that should magnify one another’s effects must be employed sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond assessments of the Russian armed forces, there are significant lessons to be drawn from the conflict for the British and other NATO militaries. The foremost of these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In due course, it will be possible to extend this study to cover the later phase of the war when Ukraine moved on to offensive operations. As the UAF expend significant ammunition, however, and now depend on their international partners for equipment, it is important that those partners draw the appropriate lessons from the war so far, not least so that they can prepare themselves to deter future threats and to best support Ukraine. Ukraine’s victory is possible, but it requires significant heavy fighting. With appropriate support, Ukraine can prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no sanctuary in modern warfare. The enemy can strike throughout operational depth. Survivability depends on dispersing ammunitions stocks, command and control, maintenance areas and aircraft. Ukraine successfully evaded Russia’s initial wave of strikes by dispersing its arsenals, aircraft and air defences. Conversely, the Russians succeeded in engaging 75% of static defence sites in the first 48 hours of the war. Nor is setting up a headquarters in a civilian building sufficient to make it survivable. The British Army must consider the vulnerability of higher-echelon enablement. The RAF must consider how many deployable spares kits it has to enable dispersion of its fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighting demands large initial stockpiles and significant slack capacity. Despite the prominence of anti-tank guided weapons in the public narrative, Ukraine blunted Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv using massed fires from two artillery brigades. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not as significant at the beginning of the conflict, with just over a 2:1 advantage: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176; and 3,547 multiple-launch rocket systems against 1,680. Ukraine maintained artillery parity for the first month and a half and then began to run low on munitions so that, by June, the AFRF had a 10:1 advantage in volume of fire. Evidently, no country in NATO, other than the US, has sufficient initial weapons stocks for warfighting or the industrial capacity to sustain largescale operations. This must be rectified if deterrence is to be credible and is equally a problem for the RAF and Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS (CUAS) are essential across all branches and at all echelons. Although critical to competitiveness by providing situational awareness, 90% of UAS employed are lost. For the most part, UAS must be cheap and attritable. For land forces, they must be organic to units for the purposes of both situational awareness and target acquisition. The primary means of CUAS is EW. Another critical tactical requirement is to be alerted to the presence of UAS. For the Royal Navy, CUAS is critical for protecting vessels operating beyond the protection of a task force. For the RAF, the provision of look-down sensing to locate UAS to contribute to air defence is critical. This allows defensive resources to be prioritised on the right axes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The force must fight for the right to precision. Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable. Precision weapons, however, are scarce and can be defeated by EW. To enable kill chains to function at the speed of relevance, EW for attack, protection and direction finding is a critical element of modern combined arms operations. Sequencing fires to disrupt EW and create windows of opportunity for precision effects is critical and creates training requirements. In modern warfare, the electromagnetic spectrum is unlikely to be denied, but it is continually disrupted, and forces must endeavour to gain advantage within it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the pervasive ISTAR on the modern battlefield and the layering of multiple sensors at the tactical level make concealment exceedingly difficult to sustain. Survivability is often afforded by being sufficiently dispersed to become an uneconomical target, by moving quickly enough to disrupt the enemy’s kill chain and thereby evade engagement, or by entering hardened structures. Shell scrapes and hasty defences can increase immediate survivability but also risk the force becoming fixed by fire while precision fires and specialist munitions do not leave these positions survivable. Forces instead should prioritise concentrating effects while only concentrating mass under favourable conditions – with an ability to offer mutual support beyond line of sight – and should give precedence to mobility as a critical component of their survivability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has seen the return of conventional warfighting to Europe. This has provided an unparalleled opportunity to assess Russia’s military capabilities and the impacts of a range of modern weapons on the battlefield. Ensuring that the correct lessons are drawn from the conflict is vital in two key respects: for Ukraine, if it is to receive appropriate military support from its international partners; and for NATO members, if they are to ensure they are militarily capable of deterring aggression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debates about the relative merits of armour, anti-armour weapons, electronic warfare (EW) and airpower have been fierce among external observers of the conflict. Most of these debates, however, have lacked any grounding in data. Much of the discourse surrounding the war has drawn on fragmentary online videos that show specific activities detached from a wider tactical or operational context. A great many definitive statements have been made about Russian capabilities based on the propaganda material produced by both sides. There are partial public datasets regarding Russian losses, but there is almost no detailed information on Ukrainian dispositions, actions, decision-making or setbacks. There is, therefore, a high risk that false lessons will be drawn from the war. Given that Ukraine now depends on its international partners for its strategic depth in training and materiel, a reasonable understanding of what transpired and the actual demands of modern combat in the Ukrainian theatre is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to August 2022, when Ukraine was on the defensive against a large-scale and determined Russian offensive, operational security demanded that the Ukrainian government minimise the available information on its forces, dispositions and tactics. This is still the case with the preparation and conduct of offensive operations by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), their preparations to counter newly mobilised Russian units and the effects of Russia’s renewed strike campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. How Ukraine denied Russia its initial theory of victory and how the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) reprioritised to offensive operations in Donbas are now sufficiently historical to allow for a more open discussion of events. This report is an account of the pre-war plans of both Russia and Ukraine, the course of the initial phases of the war between February and July 2022, an overview of what has been learned about the AFRF, and an assessment of the implications for NATO and specifically the UK military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is methodologically problematic. It draws on the operational data accumulated by the General Staff of the UAF during the conflict, which was made available to the authors. A significant proportion of this data cannot be made public but was used to inform the conclusions of this report. A good example is Ukrainian losses, which are factored into the conclusions reached as regards the relative effectiveness of tactics and capabilities but cannot be disclosed as they remain operationally sensitive. Other data that is cited was sometimes obtained through methods and sources of collection that are sensitive. The authors have considered the data in the context of its method of collection and the corresponding confidence in its accuracy. However, these judgements cannot be discussed in the report because the nature of the underlying sources for this data remains classified. For this reason, this report should not be considered a work of academic scholarship and it does not use citations. Rather, it should be considered as testimony based on personal observations of the authors. This includes the direct participation in strategic and operational decision-making during the war by two of the authors: Lieutenant General Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi and Oleksandr V Danylyuk. It also includes extensive interactions and consultations with Ukrainian military and intelligence personnel at all levels and the observation of tactical activities by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, who worked in Ukraine in January, February, April, June, August and October 2022. Although this report is methodologically imperfect, the speed at which Ukraine’s partners must make decisions on procurement, training and capability development to ensure their own preparedness means that it was felt to be more useful to publish an imperfect study than wait for the evidence to be publishable long after its relevance to decision-makers had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to clarify what is and is not considered in this report. The work is intended to properly frame the international understanding of the conventional military aspects of the conflict. It therefore focuses on areas that deserve attention. It is too short to be a comprehensive study of what transpired throughout the conflict. The conclusions are limited to the consideration of conventional operations and do not seek to assess the extensive unconventional campaign waged by Russia against Ukraine. That said, unconventional operations are necessarily described insofar as they provide context for conventional force employment, but conclusions on the lessons to be learned regarding unconventional operations from the war are to be the subject of a separate and adjacent study. It is also important to reiterate that this report does not cover events after July 2022 when the UAF began undertaking offensive operations; these activities have produced additional lessons that are important for a broader appreciation of the challenges on the modern battlefield, even though they are regrettably inappropriate to publicly disclose at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has five chapters. Chapter I outlines Russia’s invasion plan as set out in captured copies of the orders issued to a range of Russian units. Given the criticality of unconventional operations in this plan, and the impact of these activities on the posture and tasks assigned to Russia’s conventional forces, the chapter necessarily describes these in some detail. Since there was exhaustive discussion of the size and capabilities of Russia’s conventional forces around Ukraine prior to the conflict, these details are only described in terms of the alignment of Russian forces to operational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter II sets out Ukraine’s capabilities, assumptions and starting positions at the beginning of the war. One of the major problems with public analysis of the conflict has been the lack of awareness of the capabilities of the UAF. For example, the public obsession with anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) largely ignored the large number of main battle tanks fielded by the UAF at the beginning of the conflict. This chapter, therefore, seeks to partly explain what Ukraine could field at the start of the war, as well as how Ukraine planned to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter III covers the course of the first three phases of the invasion, from 24 February to the beginning of July 2022. It is largely narrative but focuses on the command decisions and key factors that shaped the success or failure of specific tasks undertaken by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. The chapter tries to also explain the concepts of operation employed by the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter IV details observations regarding the performance of the AFRF. Rather than describing Russia’s strengths and shortcomings in context, this chapter endeavours to identify wider cultural and structural challenges for its military that can be tracked to judge whether Russian military performance is improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter V provides a summary of relevant lessons for the British military seeking to refine its capabilities, training and organisation to be prepared for high-intensity warfare in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with recommendations for policymakers. First, consumption rates of munitions, materiel and systems during high-intensity warfighting will be high, and stockpiles are critical to conventional defence being credible; second, national policies, permissions and industrial processes must be adaptable enough to allow change at the speed of relevance; and third, getting the correct mix of and synergies between new and legacy systems is essential to effective modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russias-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;I. Russia’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s strategic objective in its invasion of Ukraine was the subjugation of the Ukrainian state. This plan was formulated first and foremost by Russia’s special services and a core group within the presidential administration, supported by senior officials in the Ministry of Defence. As such, it is necessary to briefly outline the wider context from which the orders to Russia’s conventional forces were derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military build-up against Ukraine began in March 2021 when large numbers of conventional troops were added to existing forces along Ukraine’s borders. This build-up performed three functions. First, it put pressure on Western governments to re-engage in the Minsk II negotiations to encourage Kyiv to make concessions and thereby avert a conflict. Second, it pre-positioned military equipment around Ukraine that would allow for a more rapid build-up of forces when the time came for the invasion. Third, it provided an opportunity for Moscow to assess the reaction of Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners dismissed the threat in spring 2021 because they did not observe the necessary enablers deployed with the Russian formations nor the necessary political shaping of the information environment in Russia to support an invasion. They were correct on both counts – the build-up turned out to be a mobilisation exercise. However, the lesson for the Kremlin was that the enablers could be brought to the formations faster than Ukraine’s partners could bring military capabilities: if these were the indicators that would cause international partners to react, they would do so too late. The Kremlin’s confidence that it could invade Ukraine without significant international interference was an important reason for undertaking the full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, the 9th Section of the 5th Service of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) was enlarged into a directorate and tasked with planning for the occupation of Ukraine. As part of this preparation, the FSB drew on extensive surveys carried out in Ukraine. These surveys painted a picture of a largely politically apathetic Ukrainian society that distrusted its leaders, was primarily concerned about the economy and thought an escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely. Moreover, Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally articulated in an essay in July 2021 his belief that the people of Ukraine viewed Russians favourably and believed they were part of a shared civilisation, cruelly divided by historical political mistakes. The barrier, in his view, to correcting these mistakes was the government in Kyiv, which he accused of being a puppet to external powers hostile to Russia. The Russian military leadership was also confident that it would defeat the UAF after more than a decade of modernisation. Assurances from General Valery Gerasimov on Russia’s military capabilities played a key role in shaping the confidence of Russia’s special services in their plan. As Gerasimov told international interlocutors on the outbreak of the war, ‘I command the second most powerful Army in the world’. Separately Gerasimov told British counterparts that Russia had achieved conventional military parity with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conception of the Russian invasion therefore was developed around several key assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed was critical to success to render the response of the international community irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of Ukraine’s leaders would remove the barrier for pro-Russian Ukrainians to vocalise support for the occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling heating, electricity and finance would be an effective means of controlling the apathetic majority of the Ukrainian population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian military could defeat the Ukrainian military on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these assumptions, the FSB, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Gerasimov and elements within the presidential administration developed their plan to achieve Putin’s strategic goal. The key military-strategic tasks for the Russian military and security forces were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Degrade Ukraine’s ability to defend itself by destroying its air, maritime and air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defeat Ukrainian Ground Forces by fixing them in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffuse Ukraine’s will and capacity to resist by eliminating Ukraine’s political and military leadership and occupying critical centres of political and economic power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deceive the Ukrainian government as to the time, location, scope and scale of Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a tension in this plan between the aim of diffusing Ukraine’s political unity and deceiving Ukraine as to the intent. The former would have required a sustained shaping phase preceding the invasion. The latter demanded speed. It appears that Russian planners succumbed to optimism bias as to the dislocating effect that speed itself could achieve in diffusing Ukraine’s will to resist and therefore opted to undertake a shock and awe campaign with little preliminary shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to commence the invasion with a massive missile and airstrike campaign against Ukraine’s air defences, command and control (C2) infrastructure, airfields and ammunition storage depots. This campaign would not target critical infrastructure such as power stations and railways, because these were vital to Russia’s plans for occupying the country. The elimination of Ukraine’s political leadership would primarily be a task for Russia’s special services. Another line of effort, allocated to Russia’s special forces and air-assault troops, was to capture Ukraine’s power stations, airfields, water supplies, central bank and parliament. The intelligence community of Ukraine believes that Russia also planned to use Belarusian airborne units to capture the Rivne and Khmelnytsky nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable these operations, Russia’s Ground Forces were to simultaneously advance under several groups of forces to clear and occupy administrative centres on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River, along with Kyiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa. Russian groups of forces were built around the military district command posts, with the name of the group of forces corresponding to the military district commanding the direction. This can cause some confusion as the military district names correspond with their geographical position in Russia, but do not correspond with their relative position in Ukraine. The northern axis was the main effort, focused on the encirclement and capture of Kyiv. For this purpose, the Russians formed two groups of forces commanded from the Eastern Military District Command Post. One group was formed in the Gomel region of Belarus and used the tactical sign ‘V’ with orders to attack Kyiv along the right (western) bank of the Dnipro River. The second group was formed in the Bryansk region of Russia and used the tactical sign ‘O’ with orders to surround Kyiv from the left (eastern) bank. The Southern Military District Command Post commanded units with the tactical symbol ‘Z in a square’, ordered to attack from occupied Crimea to establish control over the North Crimean Water Canal, Energodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, surround Mariupol, take control of the bridges over the Dnipro and advance along the right bank to Voznesensk with the aim of seizing the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant. The Western Military District Command Post commanded groups of forces projected from Kursk, Belgorod and Voronezh using the tactical symbol ‘Z’ and tasked with encircling the Ukrainian troops in Donbas along the Lozova–Gulyapole line or the Barvinkovo–Velika Novosilka line. Such an encirclement, combined with fixing operations along the line of control using conscripts from occupied Luhansk and Donetsk, was intended to cut off about 50% of the UAF (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4b41HF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Original Russian Axes of Advance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground forces were assigned sectors and tasks down to the level of the battalion tactical group. For mechanised forces, the intent was often to rapidly occupy and thereafter isolate and screen key objectives. On the axis from Gomel to Kyiv, for example, the force was divided into a screening force that was to establish positions facing west to cut off Kyiv from western Ukraine, and units responsible for pushing into the city. Very little consideration appears to have been given to Ukrainian reserves or the Territorial Defence Forces (TDF). The assertion in Russian planning that Ukraine could generate only 40,000 additional troops appears to be premised on the anticipated speed of the operation rather than an appreciation of Ukraine’s capacity for mobilisation. This emphasis on speed led to units being ordered to advance in administrative column by road and to attempt to bypass any initial resistance. The assumption was that by D+10, Russian units would transition to stabilisation operations. The synchronisation matrix of the 1st Guards Tank Army (Western Military District), for example, captured near Kyiv in March 2022, stated that by D+10 the force would ‘proceed to the blocking and destruction of individual scattered units of the Armed Forces and the remnants of nationalist resistance units’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final grouping of Russian forces comprised the amphibious component and dispositions of the Black Sea Fleet. Two amphibious task groups were created with the intention of conducting landings ahead of advancing Russian ground forces on the Kherson–Mykolaiv–Odesa axis. These were to go in after the initial invasion, preceding the Ground Forces to seize key intersections and chokepoints to enable the rapid onwards movement of troops along the coast after Mykolaiv. In addition to this task, the Black Sea Fleet was to support the massive strike campaign by launching Kalibr cruise missiles throughout the depth of Ukraine, and isolate the theatre by blockading the Ukrainian coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After D+10, the role of Russia’s conventional forces was to transition to a supporting function to Russia’s special services, responsible for establishing occupation administrations on the territories. Since these activities were critical to the Russian theory of victory in the operation, it is important to outline these plans to appropriately contextualise the role of the conventional force. The assumption appears to have been that Ukrainian government officials would either flee or be captured as a result of the speed of the invasion. It was also anticipated that shock would prevent the immediate mobilisation of the population, and that protests and other civil resistance could be managed through the targeted disintegration of Ukrainian civil society. To manage these protests Russian forces would be supported by Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) and riot control units. Meanwhile the FSB was tasked with capturing local officials. The Russian counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories had compiled lists that divided Ukrainians into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those to be physically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those in need of suppression and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those considered neutral who could be induced to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those prepared to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those in the top category, the FSB had conducted wargames with detachments of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) to conduct kill-or-capture missions. In many cases, the purpose of capture was to put individuals involved in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity (often referred to as the Maidan Revolution) on trial to be executed. Although initial lists of persons in the second category existed, the approach was to be more methodical, with the registration of the population through door-to-door sweeps and the use of filtration camps to establish counterintelligence files on large portions of the population in the occupied territories. Filtration would be used to intimidate people, to determine whether they needed to be displaced into Russia, and to lay the groundwork for records to monitor and disrupt resistance networks. Over time, Russia would bring teachers and other officials from Russia itself to engage in the re-education of Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended method of political control had both a regional and national component. The regional component comprised the coerced cooperation of regional governors and local authorities. The national component involved the murder of Ukraine’s executive branch and the capture of parliament. The pro-Russian faction within the parliament would be encouraged to form a Movement for Peace, which other parliamentarians would be encouraged and coerced to support. This Movement for Peace would ban resistance in the name of preserving peace. Regions that resisted could thereafter be cut off from electricity, water and finance from the central bank, following motions through this parliamentary body. Ukraine’s nuclear power plants served three purposes therefore in the invasion plan: to function as reliable shelters for Russia’s troops and military personnel, equipment, command posts and ammunition depots; to gain control over Ukraine’s energy system, because nuclear power plants are responsible for generating more than 60% of Ukraine’s electricity; and to provide the option to obtain leverage for blackmailing European countries with the risk of radiation pollution as a result of possible accidents at nuclear power plants if they attempted to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the seizure of nuclear power plants and scientific facilities engaged in nuclear energy research in Kharkiv and Kyiv was an important element of Russia’s planned war propaganda. While justifying military aggression against Ukraine, Russian propaganda actively spread disinformation among its own population about the alleged threat Ukraine posed to Russia. Along with the narrative about the alleged presence of ‘American Pentagon biolaboratories’ in Ukraine, which were developing biological weapons, Russian propagandists and officials actively spread information about the alleged intention of Ukraine to restore nuclear weapons, which it gave up in 1994 in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the US and the UK as part of the Budapest Memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the Russian invasion were not only ‘denazification’, the destruction of national sovereignty and the banning of Ukrainian identity and ‘demilitarisation’, the destruction and banning of the UAF and the export to Russia of enterprises of the defence industrial complex of Ukraine, but also ‘denuclearisation’, the capture of nuclear power plants and their transfer to the direct management of Rosatom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces massed on the Ukrainian border in autumn 2021 received orders to the effect that they would be away from their barracks for nine months. These orders, issued approximately three to four months before the invasion, demonstrate that the Russian government anticipated having Ukraine under complete control by summer 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian plans for the invasion of Ukraine were detailed and offered solutions to most of the practical problems that Russia would face in occupying Ukraine. If competently executed, these plans could have succeeded. As shall be seen later in this report, they came much closer to doing so than is widely appreciated. Although the assumption that there would be minimal resistance was incorrect, the occupation of southern Ukraine demonstrates that speed did offer a realistic path to asserting control over territory, even without popular support. Furthermore, despite the resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, Russia had the combat power at the beginning of the war to overcome many Ukrainian formations. Beyond the shortcomings in the execution of the plan and the poor performance of Russian combat units, there are fundamental aspects of the plan that must be understood to appreciate the peculiarities of Russia’s operations in Ukraine in the first phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plans were drawn up by a very small group of officials and the intent was directed by Putin. Many officials executing elements of the preparation were unaware of the wider intent. Russian military personnel – even up to deputy heads of branches within the Russian General Staff – were unaware of the intention to invade and occupy Ukraine until days before the invasion, and tactical military units did not receive orders until hours before they entered Ukraine. While this helped to achieve operational surprise – which was no doubt the intent – the tiny pool of personnel involved contributed to a range of false assumptions that appear never to have been challenged. That the Russians overstretched in terms of the number of axes embarked upon, the small size of the force employed for many tasks, and the failure to develop appropriate contingencies is indicative of many contributing technical judgements to the planning not having been fully briefed about the overall context. No independent red teaming appears to have taken place. Instead, the plan itself – while theoretically plausible – compounded optimism bias in each of its stages and, most tellingly, offered no reversionary courses of action, indicated no decision points to determine whether conventional forces should adjust their posture nor envisaged any outcome other than its own success. Neither did the plan account for the needs of those tasked with implementing it, nor afford any agency to Ukraine. The FSB’s inaccurate assessment of the reaction of Ukrainian society is much less consequential in how the plan actually unfolded than the fact that there is no evidence in the Russian planning that anyone had asked what would occur if any of its key assumptions were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ukraines-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;II. Ukraine’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To properly understand what transpired in the opening phases of the conflict, the preparations made by the UAF since 2014 need to be appreciated. Many claims about the impact of Western military-technical assistance – for example – are problematic because they do not contextualise these systems alongside the existing capabilities of the UAF. Appreciating the scale of the conventional fight is important if the right lessons are to be drawn from the fighting. Once the structure and capabilities of the UAF are understood, the posture and dispositions of the force in February 2022 can be discussed in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-brigades-special-forces-and-territorial-defence&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre Brigades, Special Forces and Territorial Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and condition of Ukraine’s infantry and manoeuvre forces is worth considering, less in terms of their technical capabilities than in terms of their mindset, cohesion and C2. To begin, the Ukrainian Ground Forces had been in constant combat since 2014. Such combat may have been low intensity, but with more than 90 Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russian forces in 2021, it nevertheless required soldiers to take their tasks seriously and to prepare for escalation. For officers who rotated through the Joint Forces Operations (JFO) area, they had months to walk the ground, prepare positions and build an intimate understanding of the battlefield. The conversation throughout the UAF was what they would do in the event of a Russian escalation. Putting aside operational-level planning, even down to the level of platoon, the experience of junior officers and soldiers was to observe – for months – Russian positions that posed a threat to them and their comrades. These units had made extensive plans among themselves as to how they would defeat these positions in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at the operational level, it was understood throughout the UAF that Russia may renew its assault on Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian military had tried to seize the country, only to pull back. Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service and other parts of the Russian government had urged a more deliberate aggression against Ukraine in 2015. The possibility, therefore, had been at the forefront of the minds of UAF officers. Wargames and exercises at formation level envisaged a defence against the full capabilities of the Russian military. Ukrainian units were confident that at the tactical level they would be better trained and better prepared than their adversaries. The persistent concern among commanders was the impact of artillery on their freedom to manoeuvre and, crucially, on their lines of supply. This problem was exacerbated by the shortage of personnel. With 10 brigades covering the entire line of contact in the JFO, a brigade frontage at the start of the war was around 20 km. This left a limited reserve and depended on a manoeuvre defence to counterattack against breaches in the line. Each brigade started the war with around 10 days of ammunition, but there was limited confidence – given the threat from artillery – that more would reach the lines if the Russians committed all their capabilities to this axis. Nevertheless, having observed the treatment of Ukrainians in the occupied territories after 2014, Ukrainian forces were also highly motivated in preventing more of the country falling into Russian hands and morale among the troops was therefore high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining a sufficient force was a challenge from 2014. The main problem was pay. Although pay had been increased, it did not keep pace with inflation, nor was it competitive with pay in the private sector. Combined with the use of short-term contracts, this contributed to a high turnover of personnel. Prior to 24 February 2022, this created serious problems for the UAF. It not only meant that many units had a shortage of specialists such as communicators, but also that the Ministry of Defence was having to expend disproportionate resources to train new specialists who would rarely be retained in the force. There was a benefit to this situation, however. Ukrainian reservists and wider society contained a very large number of people who had military experience and were trained to perform specialist tasks. One of the major errors in Russian planning for the invasion was its assessment of the number of reservists Ukraine could mobilise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also several brigades and units where retention was less problematic, and these constituted highly experienced formations. Among these units were the seven brigades of the Air Assault Forces, and the Special Operations Forces consisting of two regiments and two special operations centres. In addition, there were the Special Units of Ukraine’s Special Services, including the 10th Special Unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Unit Alpha within the Security Service of Ukraine, the Special Forces of the National Guard, State Border Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service, responsible for operations deep behind enemy lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the TDF was an attempt to capitalise on the depth of Ukraine’s reserves and the will of the population to create mass and therefore resilience. Established as a unified entity in January 2022, the TDF were conceptually promising, and over time have proven a valuable means of creating new combat units that can be trained to support the armed forces. However, even pre-existing Territorial Defence units were created far too close to the invasion to be well established and effective at the beginning of the war. It is important to understand that for the Ukrainian government, Russia’s campaign against the country was continued for almost a decade and the cost of maintaining large territorial defence structures versus their immediate military utility made investment in such a structure a challenge for the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the TDF were only established in 2022, they lacked heavy weapons, or the C2 mechanisms to use them. They also had a limited command structure. While the value of the TDF has steadily increased – progressing from rear-area security to ground holding to contributing manoeuvre brigades to offensive operations – at the beginning of the conflict the lack of integrated C2 for these units made them an impediment in many cases. This is not the fault of the TDF personnel who mobilised to defend Ukraine, but simply reflects that trying to mobilise and coordinate such a large body of personnel with just over a month to establish chains of command and to distribute the necessary communications and training imposed a limit on how effectively they could be integrated into the armed forces. As of 24 February, therefore, the UAF had a limited body of experienced and professional manoeuvre brigades and had to make difficult decisions as to where to prioritise their deployment. They also had a large pool of tactically competent reserves, and a larger pool of willing civilian volunteers, but limited stocks of equipment to provision them. The critical question therefore was whether the professional body of the UAF could hold for long enough for a wider mobilisation to bolster Ukraine’s defences in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery&quot;&gt;Artillery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its manoeuvre forces, Ukraine had systematically attempted to strengthen the combat support for its forces after 2014, recognising the significant fires capabilities of the AFRF. In the eight years of fighting before 2022, artillery had accounted for around 90% of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian government carried out a systematic reduction of missile and artillery troops. Thus, by the time of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian Ground Forces fielded one missile brigade armed with 9K79-1 ‘Tochka-U’ tactical missile complexes, two artillery brigades equipped with 152-mm self-propelled and towed howitzers ‘MSTA-S’ and ‘MSTA-B’, 152-mm self-propelled and towed guns ‘Hyacinth-S’ and ‘Hyacinth-B’, and 203-mm self-propelled guns ‘Pion’. They also fielded three artillery regiments, armed with 220-mm ‘Uragan’ and 300-mm ‘Smerch’ multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). In addition, artillery units of mechanised and tank brigades used 152-mm and 122-mm artillery installations ‘Akatsiya’ and ‘Gvozdika’, as well as 122-mm MLRS ‘Grad’. The units of the Airborne Assault Troops had neither their own artillery nor tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since March 2014, Ukraine has focused on recovering its artillery capabilities. As a result, five new artillery brigades and a separate artillery regiment of the Ground Forces were created, as well as one artillery brigade and a separate artillery regiment of the Navy. The 19th Separate Missile Brigade regenerated two additional battalions with tactical missile complex ‘Tochka-U’. All new combined arms brigades in the Ground Forces, as well as all brigades of the marines, received their own brigade artillery groups. By 2019, the number of artillery battalions had doubled. As of February 2022, the Missile Forces and Artillery (RViA) of the UAF had 10 brigades and one regiment as part of the Ground Forces, as well as one brigade and one regiment as part of the Navy. The UAF had 1,176 barrel artillery systems, of which 742 were 152-mm calibre systems, 421 were 122-mm howitzers, and 13 units were 203-mm systems. The RViA also fielded 1,680 MLRS of all calibres, as well as about 40 tactical missile systems ‘Tochka-U’. In terms of the number of artillery systems, Ukraine fielded the largest artillery force in Europe after Russia. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not so significant at the beginning of the conflict: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176, and 3,547 MLRS against 1,680.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAF had ammunition to support these systems in high-intensity warfighting for just over six weeks. Ammunition had been depleted by regular explosions at Ukrainian arsenals as a result of Russian sabotage. From 2014 to 2018, there were six such explosions, which destroyed more than 210,000 tonnes of ammunition, a large part of which were 152-mm shells and rockets for MLRS. For comparison, during the five years of the war in Donbas, the UAF spent about 70,000 tons of ammunition in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of Ukrainian artillery was not limited to increasing the number of artillery systems and units. A lot of effort was also put into qualitative improvement. Since 2015, all battalions began to receive UAVs ‘Furia’, ‘Leleka’, PD-1 and others, which significantly increased their ISR capabilities. US radars AN/TPQ-36, designed to determine the coordinates of enemy artillery, were transferred to Ukraine as part of US military-technical assistance and strengthened the capabilities for conducting counter-battery fire. The use of the ‘Kropyva’ combat control system – Ukrainian intelligent mapping software – saw an 80% reduction in the deployment time for artillery units. Simultaneously, the amount of time to destroy an unplanned target was reduced by two-thirds, and the time to open counter-battery fire by 90%. Special attention was paid to personnel training. Every year, the armed forces conducted more than 35 field brigade tactical exercises and more than 200 field battalion tactical exercises for artillery. Thus, Ukrainian defence plans aimed at using manoeuvre forces to fix and canalise attackers to enable their destruction by concentrated artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armour&quot;&gt;Armour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role and significance of armour in the conflict must be underpinned by an understanding of the tactical evolution of its employment over the past eight years and the scale at which armour is fielded by the UAF. Counting the two regular and four reserve tank brigades, tank units of mechanised and mountain brigades, as well as brigades of marines and air-assault troops, the UAF fielded about 30 tank battalions at the start of the conflict. A significant part of these tank units was formed between 2014 and 2018, for which 500 tanks were delivered to the UAF. The total number of Ukrainian main battle tanks at the time of the invasion was about 900. For comparison, the Russian armed forces had 2,800 combat-ready tanks in their invasion force, and Russian proxies in Donbas fielded about 400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional tank doctrine would see its employment in the direct fire zone. However, during the years of the war in Donbas, the tankers of the UAF changed traditional approaches and developed techniques for indirect fire. For this task, high-explosive fragmentation projectiles are usually used. This requires the use of special guidance devices – an azimuth pointer and a side level. The use of modern technologies, in the form of graphic and calculation complexes, developed in Ukraine with the function of automated transmission of information to other tanks participating in the combat mission, made it possible to achieve high accuracy at distances of up to 10 km and reduced the time for calculating fire corrections to a few seconds. This technique blurs the line between tanks and artillery. The value of this technique is that it allows tanks to concentrate fire over a wide area while they can manoeuvre without the protection and screening needed by artillery pieces. Ukraine therefore planned to use armour as mobile reserves supporting its formations, capable of offering blunting fire against enemy movements and to support counterattacks if conditions permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Ukraine produces BM ‘Oplot’ and T-84U, the lack of necessary funds forced the UAF to refrain from purchasing new tanks, and they instead chose to modernise their existing fleet. It was calculated that three or even four battalions of modernised tanks could be obtained for the funds required to purchase one battalion of new tanks. The 1st Tank Brigade was armed with T-64B and T-64BM ‘Bulat’ main battle tanks, which are modernised Soviet T-64 tanks. Modernised T-64s are equipped with digital radios, new internal communication and navigation systems, sighting systems with thermal imaging cameras, modified dynamic protection and other necessary options. The T-64BM ‘Bulat’ weapon system also includes the Ukrainian-made TAKO-621 tank missile system, enabling engagement of armoured vehicles, fortifications, helicopters and other targets at a distance of up to 5,000 m using Kombat guided missiles. In addition, the UAF have modernised T-72 and modernised gas turbine T-80BVs, which, due to their higher speed and manoeuvrability, are used by airborne assault troops and marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the UAF fielded a considerable tank fleet, this does not alter the fact that Russian tanks at the beginning of the war generally had better protection and sighting systems and were able to engage targets from a greater distance. For short-range engagements, these differences in protection and sensor performance were less relevant but offered significant technical advantages to Russia in mid-range engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-tank-capabilities&quot;&gt;Anti-Tank Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavy emphasis in international commentary on anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) and especially those provided through military-technical assistance, means that it is vital to appreciate the volume of these capabilities and how they were distributed across the UAF to properly contextualise their impact on the fighting. At the beginning of February 2022, the armed forces received about 150 Javelin ATGW launchers with 1,000–1,200 missiles, 2,000 NLAW, as well as a large number of rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade launchers. Since Ukraine’s partners at that time were persuaded that, in the most optimistic scenarios, hostilities would be centred on street battles in the largest cities, the anti-tank weapons transferred were intended for close combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian anti-tank capabilities were not limited to Western-provided ATGWs, however. After 2014, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine purchased at least 650 launchers for anti-tank missile systems ‘Stugna-P’ and ‘Korsar’ and about 7,000 missiles for them, 150 tower systems for armoured vehicles with dual anti-tank missiles and 900 missiles for them, and 1,600 guided missiles ‘Cobra’ and ‘Kombat’ for tank missile systems. Thus, the anti-tank capabilities of the UAF at the beginning of February 2022 amounted to around 950 ATGW launchers (Javelin, ‘Stugna-P’, ‘Corsar’, ‘Barrier’) and about 9,100 missiles. To this should be added short-ranged systems such as NLAW, Kobra/Kombat missiles, as well as more than a thousand Fagot and Metis ATGWs and several thousand missiles for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appreciate the characteristics of some of these systems, which determined how they were employed. ‘Stugna-P’, developed and manufactured at the Ukrainian state-owned enterprise KB ‘Luch’, is a more powerful equivalent of the Russian ‘Kornet’. The range of both complexes is the same – about 5,100 m – but the armour penetration of ‘Stugna-P’ is better. In addition, among the advantages of ‘Stugna-P’ is a quasi-top attack, a thermal sight that can be used at night at a distance of up to 3,000 m, as well as the ability to remotely control the launcher with a cable several dozen metres long, which significantly increases the survivability of operators on the battlefield. This class of ATGW is highly valuable for defensive operations because it allows for armour to be engaged at the ranges within which Russian armour seeks to conduct ATGW launches against defensive positions. This prevents the enemy establishing a safe overwatch position to support infantry advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these ATGWs was shaped by their relative training burden. Despite its effectiveness, Stugna-P and other wire-guided systems required considerable training time for operators to use the system effectively. This restricted these systems to being used by Ukraine’s existing ground forces. After 2014, a lot of attention had been paid to the training of anti-tank crews in the armed forces, and the School of Anti-Tank Artillery was created at the 184th Training Centre of the National Academy of Ground Forces. It took 30 days to prepare crews arriving from military units to properly employ Stugna-P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javelin, by contrast, was much easier to employ, requiring days to train crews, while personnel could be trained to use NLAW in hours. Because of the wide range of additional uses of the Javelin CLU – such as ISR – these systems were prioritised for Ukrainian special forces and other specialist troops. NLAW, by contrast, was distributed widely to ground-holding units. Although Western training on these systems was excellent, the rapid delivery of training to new units often overlooked maintenance of the weapons – especially for maintaining batteries – and, as a result, there was a widespread problem early in the conflict with Western-supplied ATGWs being unusable when distributed to units. Over time, the appropriate instructions were disseminated to address this problem. The tactical employment of ATGWs by the UAF prior to the conflict was largely aimed at fixing or blunting enemy armoured manoeuvre and for use in raiding by light forces because of the speed with which units with these systems could displace. There were too few missiles, however, for these to be the primary means of attriting enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Air-Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most consequential causes of the international underestimation of Ukraine’s military prospects prior to the conflict arose from a simultaneous overestimation of Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) capabilities and a corresponding lack of familiarity with Ukrainian air-defence capabilities. It is therefore important to understand how Ukrainian air defences were organised and equipped at the beginning of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian aggression in 2014, developing the air-defence capabilities of Ukraine has been a constant priority of its government. The radio engineering troops, tasked with warning of an air attack, reorganised after 2014 to ensure they could detect targets at 300–400 km, and direct fighters and anti-aircraft missile troops against them. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the radio engineering forces of Ukraine consisted of four brigades, whose units maintained continuous radar coverage along the state border and ensured monitoring of the airspace of Ukraine. Their coverage over the Black Sea was less extensive. These units fielded 35D6M and 80K6 radars from KP ‘NVC’ ‘Iskra’, P-18 ‘Malakhit’ from HC ‘Ukrspetstechnika’, ‘Burshtyn-1800’ from NPP ‘Aerotechnika-MLT’, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernised 3D radar station 35D6M, which is also used as a surveillance radar for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile complex, is much more powerful than the outdated Soviet 19Zh6. The 35D6M radar can detect up to 300 air targets simultaneously at 360 km, while the 19Zh6 detects only 32 targets at 150 km. In addition, the Ukrainian radar has a higher accuracy in determining the coordinates, improved trajectory processing parameters and a new cooling system that significantly increases the service life of the klystrons. 35D6M also requires significantly less time to fully deploy or collapse the station, which increases its survivability. These developments had not been fully appreciated by the VKS prior to the invasion, leading to tactical errors in the employment of radio-electronic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance in the UAF of the 80K6 ‘Phoenix’ radar, as well as previous versions of this system, including the 79K6 ‘Pelikan’, allowed the remote operation of the S-300PT(PS) anti-aircraft missile systems. This radar can be deployed in 15 minutes after going static, allowing for tactical redeployment. After 2014, the armed forces also received about 50 mobile ‘Malachite’ radars, which is a Ukrainian modification of the Soviet P-18MU ‘Terek’ radar. ‘Malakhit’ can detect targets moving at a speed of up to 1,000 m/s and tracking up to 256 targets at a distance of up to 400 km. In addition, this system can detect small and inconspicuous targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the war in Donbas was mostly land based, many military-political centres and industrial and energy facilities demanded air defence, which could not be limited only to detecting threats. Five nuclear plants, six dams of the Dnipro Cascade Hydroelectric Power Plant and two dams of the Dniester Cascade, and more than 10 enterprises and facilities of the chemical industry required constant cover by the anti-aircraft missile forces of the UAF, limiting protection for its manoeuvre forces. Since 2015, Ukraine has focused on restoring and increasing its combat capabilities. As of 2016, the anti-aircraft missile forces consisted of five anti-aircraft missile brigades and seven anti-aircraft missile regiments comprising 60 air-defence divisions. A Ukrainian air-defence division holds the equipment of a Western battery along with organic C2 and sustainment capabilities, thereby performing a battlefield task closer to that of a battalion. Overall, the UAF held 35 S-300PS/PT divisions, nine S-125 divisions, three S-300B divisions and 15 divisions of the Buk-M1 air-defence system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical component of the air-defence capabilities of the UAF was the extensive employment of man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) across all units. The saturation of MANPADS in Ukrainian units, bolstered by those that were received as military-technical assistance before the Russian invasion, became an important element of countering Russian dominance in the air. MANPADS were complementary to the air-defence missile complexes because the latter forced enemy aviation to engage at low altitudes, where in turn they fell into the zone of impact of MANPADS. After 2014, Ukraine paid considerable attention to extending the lifespan and modernisation of its own MANPADS. The most common MANPADS in the UAF were the modernised ‘Igla-1’, which were distributed as organic elements to its units. Some were held in the Anti-Aircraft Missile Forces as mobile groups intended to provide protection for air-defence divisions as they displaced. A major problem with this distribution was the lack of access to the common air picture among those MANPADS teams not subordinated to the anti-aircraft missile forces at the beginning of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft&quot;&gt;Aircraft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fighter aircraft were also an important component of the national air-defence system. As of 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force had about 50 MiG-29 fighters in service with the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Vasylkiv and the 114th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Ivano-Frankivsk, as well as about 32 Su-27 fighters operated by the 831st tactical aviation brigade in Myrhorod and the 39th in Ozerny. The air force also flew Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft. After 2014, significant efforts were put into repairing fighters and a large proportion of the fleet was modernised. Although this left the air force with a higher proportion of available fighters, from a technical point of view it was overmatched by the combat aircraft of the VKS in almost every regard. Russian aircraft could generally see and shoot further while their countermeasures were effective against Ukrainian air-to-air munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the technical overmatch of the VKS, the training conducted by the air force prior to 24 February played a role in ensuring its survivability. An important element of the training was working out the survivability of units through the ability to disperse aircraft from the main airfields to operational ones. Special attention was also paid to the training of maintenance crews, their ability to carry out pre-flight preparation of aircraft in field conditions, and a full set of measures necessary for the performance of maintenance and routine repair of aircraft damaged during hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Ukrainian pilots understood the technical limitations of their aircraft, and the fearsome capabilities of Russian anti-aircraft systems, they had trained extensively for low-level flight over Ukrainian territory and were highly familiar with the exploitation of terrain to evade radar detection. Finally, as with other technical specialisms in the air force, Ukraine had struggled to retain pilots prior to 24 February, but consequently had a very large reserve of trained pilots. The critical limitation for the air force was airframes and their serviceability, not trained crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Maritime Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Navy was the least well equipped of the branches of service at the beginning of the war. Nevertheless, noting the economic impact of Russia’s control of the Sea of Azov, the navy had pursued modernisation since 2014 and had made important progress in expanding its capabilities. The first phase of naval modernisation was intended to be completed by 2025 and provided for the establishment of control over the territorial waters of Ukraine, maintaining coverage out to 40 nautical miles from the coast. For this purpose, the navy had to acquire the capabilities necessary for timely detection, identification and defeat of the enemy in this zone. The first step was to restore and modernise the system of ISR of the surface situation, including through the integration of capabilities available in other government agencies. In this context, it is particularly important to note the purchase of the multifunctional radar complex ‘Mineral-U’, created by the Ukrainian State Scientific Research Institute of Radar Systems Quantum-Radiolocation. ‘Mineral-U’ is designed for detection in active and passive modes and classification of surface targets at up to 500–600 km. It is mounted on a truck platform, is highly mobile and adapted for close interaction with the anti-ship missile complex ‘Neptune’, which became widely known after the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva on 13 April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Ukrainian design bureau ‘Luch’, the coastal mobile missile complex RK-360 ‘Neptune’ was an important component of the navy’s modernisation, along with the development of coastal artillery, the provision of mine-blocking actions and the conduct of radio-electronic warfare. With a range of up to 280 km, manoeuvrability and sea-skimming capabilities, the Neptune can be considered a critical element of the overall Ukrainian maritime defence strategy. The first battalion of Neptune complexes was to be received in April 2022. The Russian aggression forced the accelerated transfer of systems but did not allow the full use of the capabilities of the complex in the first weeks of the invasion, as the crew still needed some time for final preparation. A serious challenge for the navy was also the lack of a sufficient number of missiles for the complexes. However, Ukraine’s receipt of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems as part of Western military-technical assistance, which are very similar to the Neptune, solved this problem and provided confidence in the ability of the navy to deter Russia in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessments-and-dispositions&quot;&gt;Assessments and Dispositions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having given an overview of the capabilities of the UAF in some critical areas prior to the invasion, it becomes possible to properly outline the resources available and thus prioritisation decisions that underpinned their dispositions prior to 24 February. The General Staff of the UAF had conducted extensive exercises and wargames to assess how to orchestrate the defence of the country against a wide range of contingencies. Despite having identified methods for defending all relevant axes, however, the limited number of available units without full mobilisation meant that the weighting of units had to be driven by an assessment of enemy intent. It is also important to emphasise that the economic impact of full mobilisation made this very difficult for the Ukrainian government in the face of a sustained threat that could delay major attacks for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until days before the full-scale Russian invasion, the intelligence community of Ukraine broadly assessed that the most dangerous enemy course of action was a high-intensity offensive against Donbas in late February 2022, with the Russians using the destruction of the Ukrainian forces in the JFO area as a means of destabilising the Ukrainian state. The most likely enemy course of action was assessed to be a prolonged period of political destabilisation to create favourable conditions for a military offensive in the early summer, with the main effort being against Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors contributed to the assessment that Donbas would be the main effort, despite extensive warnings from Ukraine’s international partners that Kyiv would be the enemy’s main effort. First, an assessment of Russian forces north of Kyiv concluded that they lacked sufficient troops to effectively isolate and seize the city. The offensive was therefore viewed as a diversionary deployment, aimed at drawing and fixing Ukrainian forces away from Donbas. As the terrain north of Kyiv was highly unfavourable for a major attack, it was assessed that Russia’s attempt to draw Ukraine to concentrate on this axis would make Kyiv disproportionately vulnerable from the east. Second, interception of communications and observation of the Russian units on the Gomel axis confirmed that the personnel did not believe they were going to war and were not prepared for major combat operations. The disconnect between strategic-level discussion that emphasised the threat to Kyiv – shared with Ukraine by Western partners – with this tactical picture, supported the belief that there was a strategic influence campaign that did not reflect the tactical preparations being made by Russian units. In this sense, it is worth emphasising that the Russian deception plan was largely successful through the information security measures taken, but that the impact on the combat effectiveness of Russian troops through a failure to brief them with sufficient time to prepare came at considerable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence of Kyiv was seen as a necessary contingency for the UAF to plan against and, as the conflict came closer, the threat to this axis was perceived to have increased. Nevertheless, since Donbas was anticipated to be the main axis, over 10 combat brigades, constituting around half of the manoeuvre forces of the UAF, were kept in the JFO area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Donbas, Ukraine held forces around Kharkiv, Dnipro, Sumy and Odesa, a manoeuvre brigade and two artillery brigades in Kyiv, and units in training areas. There were no major formations committed forwards on the Gomel axis. Nor were there any major units committed to defend the approach from Crimea, even though this was specified in the national defence plan. The reasons for this are currently subject to an investigation. TDF were nascent, only had light weapons and were not yet fully integrated into the military command. Ukraine’s defence plans therefore aimed at a high-intensity defence in the direction of Donbas lasting six weeks, giving time for full-scale mobilisation of the reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major threat, identified before the conflict, relevant to the defence of Kyiv or Donbas, was Russia’s long-range strike arsenal. As a result, beginning one week prior to the invasion and accelerated 72 hours before, munitions stockpiles were dispersed from the main arsenals. Aircraft and air-defence systems were also dispersed hours before the invasion. As it became apparent that the Gomel axis was the enemy’s main effort and that another group of forces would strike through Chernihiv, a redeployment of Ukrainian forces was ordered approximately seven hours prior to the invasion. This took considerable time. The result was that many Ukrainian units were not at their assigned defensive positions when the invasion began and, especially on the northern axes, were not in prepared positions. Redeployments from the southern axis towards Kyiv also left fewer troops to hold the coast. Ukrainian units found themselves in a meeting engagement with the enemy. The critical point here is that the war started with the AFRF holding the initiative at the operational level but with their tactical units surprised by what they were being ordered to do. The UAF found themselves surprised at the operational level but with tactical units which had been psychologically and practically preparing for this fight for eight years. The interaction between these variables would be decisive in determining the outcome of the first 72 hours of fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-invasion&quot;&gt;III. The Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assessed the plans and dispositions of the opposing forces, this chapter outlines what occurred during the initial phases of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shock-and-mutual-surprise-d03&quot;&gt;Shock and Mutual Surprise: D+0–3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion began with a massive fire-strike campaign across Ukraine. The strikes were preceded by the widespread application of electronic attack to disrupt and damage defensive radar and air-defence installations, along with the extensive use of aerial decoys to saturate the defences. This was followed by the employment of cruise and ballistic missiles launched from sea-, air-, and ground-based launch systems. In addition, Russian aircraft penetrated Ukrainian airspace to strike tactical targets. The Russian High Value Target list quite logically included industrial facilities, fuel and energy storage facilities, air-defence sites, C2 infrastructure, ammunition storage points and troop assembly areas, as consistent with Russian doctrine. It was noted that during the first two weeks, Ukrainian transport infrastructure was not targeted, except when it was required by a tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some peculiarities to the order and effectiveness of this initial Russian fires campaign. For example, while the Russians had accurately mapped a large number of military sites, there were very few engagements against tactical groupings of forces, with the preponderance of strikes being at maximum depth and then working backwards towards Ukraine’s tactical echelons. As the tactical elements were the most mobile, however, this sequencing maximised the time available for tactical elements to displace. Furthermore, the Russian lists appeared to be linear and unresponsive to updated information. Many strikes were struck that had not been military positions for years. Moreover, against moving targets, new detections would apparently be added to the target list, without removing the previous reported location, so that dynamic strikes were often delivered too late. Furthermore, the number of munitions assigned to each target appeared to bear little correlation to the size of the target, suggesting limited familiarity with the effects of these classes of munitions among Russian planners. The result was that within the first 48 hours, approximately 75% of stationary Ukrainian Air Defence sites were engaged. At the same time, the estimated percentage for mobile air-defence sites was only about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the Russian strikes was greater than the number of platforms destroyed, however. Given the orders to redeploy Ukrainian forces, the damage and disruption to C2, the unexpected concentration on the Gomel axis, and the forced displacement of systems, many Ukrainian systems were alive, but uncoordinated for the initial 24 hours. A significant proportion of the air-defence infrastructure survived but was not in a position to conduct a coordinated defence. Instead, it largely delivered pop-up attacks against Russian forces. This suppression effect meant that for the first phase of the war, the success rate of interceptions of Russian cruise missiles, for example, was around 12–18%. Given that this rose to 40–60% in the second phase of the conflict, the effect of both the scale of the Russian strikes and the impact of dislocation on the effectiveness of the defence can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian successes were disproportionately weighted to certain axes. The majority of available air-defence coverage for the southern coast around Kherson and Mykolaiv, for example, was destroyed or suppressed. Two air-defence sites responsible for screening the Dnipro River from the north were also destroyed, opening a gap in the defences which enabled the conduct of an air assault against Hostomel from Belarus. In addition to the dislocation caused by missile strikes, Russian aircraft flew sorties to strike specified targets along the axes of advance for their respective groups of forces. This further dislocated the positions of the air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important element of the Russian plan to disorganise Ukraine’s military C2 system was also to neutralise the top military leadership of the UAF. Thus, in the first days of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian generals received personal messages from Russian military leaders urging them to surrender and assuring them that Russia did not intend to do any harm to Ukraine. Messages of similar content, but sent from anonymous numbers, were received by almost all colonels and other senior officers of the UAF. The strategic importance of this campaign is evidenced by the fact that on the second day of the invasion, Putin publicly appealed to the Ukrainian military to not resist the Russian invasion. This failed campaign also highlights the poor assessment of the psychology of the Ukrainian military by the Russian special services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical weakness of the Russian strike campaign was battle damage assessment. First, the Russian military appears to have presumed that if an action had been ordered and carried out then it had succeeded, unless there was direct evidence to the contrary. Evidence of success appears to have disproportionately relied on three data points: confirmation from pilots that they hit their target; confirmation from Russian satellites that a site showed damage; and confirmation from signals intelligence (SIGINT) that Ukrainians reported a strike and damage to their equipment. Russian satellite reconnaissance proved very limited, even though Russian survey space reconnaissance of Ukraine has been conducted since at least 2012, and detailed reconnaissance, in the interests of invasion planning, since mid-2021. A probable reason for this may be the insufficient number of satellites in the orbital grouping of the VKS and the overestimation of their technical capabilities. Indirect confirmation of this explanation is provided by the fact that the AFRF began buying additional satellite images of the territory of Ukraine and individual military facilities on the world market in April 2022. One of the visible failures of satellite intelligence is the inability to detect on time a significant volume of strategic railway movements by the UAF, which, in March 2022 amounted to three–four echelons per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor Russian battle damage assessment process made the Russian military highly vulnerable to deception, which has been consistent throughout the conflict. Early strikes on Ukrainian airfields, for example, destroyed many hangars. By photographing this damage and printing the resulting pattern on to sheets, it became possible to clear the rubble and erect covers for aircraft to return to the site, sheltering in positions that the Russians would confirm as destroyed. This led – somewhat amusingly – to the Russians debating whether Ukrainian fighter aircraft were operating from subterranean shelters at several sites. Repeated strikes on dummy air-defence positions also saw a considerable wastage of ammunition, while Ukrainian troops could confirm that sites were destroyed over the radio even when they were still functioning, causing Russian aircraft to ignore air-defence systems in their mission planning. The already-publicly reported use of dummy HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket system) later in the war to lure Russian fires is indicative of the systematic use of deception to ensure survivability by the UAF, and it has proven widely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presumption of success caused the Russian military to take several unjustifiable risks in the disposition of its forces during the first 72 hours of the conflict. Aircraft did not fly with EW pods during the opening phase as they were not deemed necessary following the presumed success of the strike campaign. Similarly, Russian manoeuvre forces were not properly supported by air-defence units and Russian air-defence units were told to presume that aircraft were friendly. This enabled a significant number of ground-attack sorties by the Ukrainian Air Force, including using UAVs such as TB2, against Russian formations, even when they had attached air-defence units. Ukraine suffered aircraft losses in air-to-air engagements, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penetration of Ukrainian territory by Russian air-assault units on the first day of the invasion deserves special consideration given its significance in the overall plan. Air-assault troops were landed at Hostomel in two waves, each comprising 10 helicopters. These followed the course of the Dnipro River from Belarus to remain below air-defence coverage and successfully reached their objective. In the first wave, two helicopters were shot down at Hostomel by MANPADS. This incident highlights the vulnerability of helicopters to MANPADS as, even under optimal conditions, there is little ability to prevent losses. The assault on Hostomel also highlights why air assault against positions – rather than axes – is extremely dangerous. Upon landing, the Russian VDV came under heavy artillery fire and were subsequently cleared from the airfield by a mechanised counterattack. Similar operations attempted in southern Ukraine and attempts to insert special forces in western Ukraine were unsuccessful for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of Russian Ground Forces during the first three days of the war – which differed considerably from pre-war expectations, from their orders and from doctrine – require some explanation. For reasons of operational security, orders were not distributed until 24 hours before the invasion to most units. As a result, Russian troops lacked ammunition, fuel, food, maps, properly established communications and, most critically, a clear understanding at the tactical level of how their actions fitted into the overall plan. It is not so much the case that tactical Russian commanders are incapable of initiative or mission command, but rather that they lacked the detailed instructions of their commanders’ intent or their role within the wider battle plan to make such decisions. Instead, by the time instructions reached battalion tactical groups (BTGs), what had begun as detailed operational planning descended into orders to reach specific locations within a specified timeframe. Confirming the notion that the conventional military component of the invasion was intended as a supporting demonstration of power rather than the main effort, Russian units were ordered to proceed in administrative column, and to bypass UAF units. Many Russian soldiers arrived in towns without their weapons loaded. They were – for the most part – not anticipating heavy fighting. Furthermore, old maps and a lack of time to coordinate the activity of tactical units led many units to move along the same roads, rapidly becoming intermingled, choking up key junctions and slowing down the rate of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed and conception of the Russian advance posed grave dangers for the UAF. Russian Ground Forces made rapid progress towards Kyiv from Gomel where there were in any case very few Ukrainian troops. The axis past Chernihiv also posed major challenges as Ukrainian forces were caught between their positions, while the orders to bypass resistance left many Ukrainian units cut off, behind Russian lines. The UAF made three decisions at this stage that proved important. First, a large portion of Ukraine’s special forces and the special units of Ukraine’s Special Services were committed on the Gomel axis. Second, Ukraine mobilised reserve units, which rapidly created new battalions near Kyiv. Third, the UAF mobilised its cadets and the teaching staff of its military academies to force-generate additional infantry battalions. In this way a new group of forces was formed within the opening week of the conflict, supported by the two brigades of artillery held in Kyiv and one mechanised brigade. Even with these efforts, the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage on the Gomel axis. Similarly, around Chernihiv, the 1st Tank Brigade found itself encircled and lacking infantry support, necessarily drawing on territorial defence units and reservists to adopt a position of all-round defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Donbas, the Russian operations to fix the bulk of the UAF proved almost entirely successful. Although the AFRF made little progress against the defensive positions along the line of contact, it proved impossible for Ukrainian troops to be redeployed from this theatre. To the south, the Russian breakout from Crimea proceeded in a manner consistent with the Russian invasion plan, with Melitopol and Kherson seized with minimal fighting and significant progress made in achieving the encirclement of Mariupol to bring the city under a state of siege. Russian progress towards Kharkiv proved entirely contrary to their plan and their forces were repulsed with heavy casualties. Initially Russian special forces entered the city in light vehicles, only to be isolated. When offered an opportunity to surrender, these personnel claimed that the Ukrainian defenders would soon be the ones surrendering once larger combat units arrived. The disparity in preparedness between these special forces’ groups and their conventional supporting units, however, hindered their coordination and the advanced parties were subsequently destroyed, while Russian forces transitioned to a deliberate break-in against the city, supported by widespread artillery strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, it is important to recognise that the Russians achieved surprise and succeeded in bringing about highly favourable force ratios on their main axes. On the second day of the conflict, there was considerable anxiety in the UAF as to the ability to halt the advance from Gomel. In understanding why the Russians stalled, despite having the means and forces to push through the small Ukrainian units in front of them, it is necessary to consider the psychological state of the Russian troops. These troops were largely moving in administrative formations. They lacked a clear understanding of where they were. Whole towns did not exist when the maps they were using were made. They had not anticipated heavy fighting, nor did they have established communications to report the situation or to receive updated instructions. Ukrainian forces found themselves bypassed and often confronted with columns of unprepared Russian troops. Even without higher instructions, the immediate task was clear to these units, and, at the tactical level, Ukrainian forces therefore retained the tactical initiative. For the 1st Tank Brigade, for example, the first days of fighting saw numerous meeting engagements in forests at around 100–200-m range, where restricted movement limited the Russian ability to bring their mass to bear against a specific tactical situation. Better crew training combined with short-ranged engagements where their armament was competitive, and the faster autoloader on the T-64, allowed Ukrainian tank crews to achieve significant damage against surprised Russian units. Another example of the problem was that Russian units would arrive in towns and begin to try to engage with the civilian population to understand where they were. Their position would be reported and the Russian unit would be engaged with artillery. This contrast between expectations and reality induced panic and caused the abandonment of equipment that was widely observed on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-battle-for-kyiv-d437&quot;&gt;The Battle for Kyiv: D+4–37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+3, it was apparent to Russian commanders that their plan had gone seriously wrong. It was evident that Ukraine’s air defences were still operational, that the Russian Ground Forces had stalled, and that there was fierce resistance. Moreover, it was apparent that the activities of the special services in Kyiv aimed at neutralising Ukraine’s political leadership – critical to Russia’s theory of victory – were failing as the Security Service of Ukraine identified, isolated and destroyed their infiltrated groups. In fact, as Ukraine mobilised, repositioned its forces, and as its air defences recovered from their initial displacement and surprise, the defence was hardening. There was therefore a need to transition from attempting the coup de main to deliberate combat operations to defeat the UAF. This transition in the Russian posture began on D+3 with a progressive improvement in the enemy’s cohesion over the following month. However, it took considerable time for Russian commanders to understand what was happening, to assert control over their units, or to adapt their tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest component of the Russian force to adapt was the VKS. From D+3, Russian aircraft began to change their tactics. Rather than flying single sorties to strike pre-designated targets, large strike packages of interceptors and aircraft armed with anti-radiation missiles would form up in an attempt to provoke Ukrainian air defences into illuminating. These would then be suppressed with anti-radiation missiles and hunted by Russian aircraft or helicopters at low level. The latter suffered heavy attrition to MANPADS employing these tactics and the depth of aviation operations gradually diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian transition to low-level hunting tactics coincided with the steady activation of air-defence complexes to protect Russian armed forces’ manoeuvre formations. At this time, Ukrainian air defences deconflicted from the Ukrainian Air Force’s interdiction missions by time, so that MiG-29s would conduct defensive counter-air sorties in pairs as the air defences displaced. This proved problematic because it was difficult to distribute awareness of these phases to deployed infantry with MANPADS. Both Russian and Ukrainian aircraft were threatened by friendly fire at this time. As a result, the deconfliction of air interdiction from Ukraine’s air defences was changed to a spatial approach, with areas in depth assigned to defensive counter-air patrols and areas to the rear assigned to air-defence forces. For a time, Ukrainian pilots were able to engage their Russian adversaries in air-to-air engagements, although they often found themselves outnumbered 6:2. Nevertheless, Ukrainian aircraft did inflict some losses in these engagements, despite losing several aircraft, reflecting the comparatively low training of most Russian pilots. In the first weeks of the invasion, when Russian forces neglected the need to provide air cover, long Russian convoys were also subjected to air strikes by both Air Force and Army aircraft, including Su-24M/MR bombers, Su-25 attack aircraft, Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters, and Bayraktar TB2 UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+10, defensive counter-air missions became harder to mount. Russian A50-M orbits ensured that the VKS had ample early warning of Ukrainian air movements. As Russian EW complexes began to be deployed systematically, Ukrainian pilots found that they often had their air-to-ground and air-to-air communications jammed, their navigation equipment suppressed, and their radar knocked out. The use of jamming pods on Russian aircraft also increased. Combined with an intensifying threat from air-defence systems, the Ukrainian Air Force progressively lost access to parts of the occupied territories. Close air support and the use of strike UAS also became impossible over much of the battle space owing to dense EW and air-defence coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapid improvement in the performance and organisation of the VKS is noteworthy because these units were flying from inside Russia’s operational depth and did not therefore suffer from the confusion that was engulfing Russia’s Ground Forces in Ukraine, slowing their adaptation to the circumstances on the ground. Another good indication that the intent of Russian commanders shifted fairly rapidly is the decision by the Russian command not to commit its maritime assault forces, which had been intended to conduct landings between Mykolaiv and Odesa. To conduct the amphibious landing, two amphibious detachments of three large amphibious ships were formed. For the landing in the first wave, units of the 810th Marines Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 336th Marines Brigade of the Baltic Fleet were initially planned. With small breaks, the amphibious forces manoeuvred in the Black Sea until the beginning of April 2022. After the initial reconnaissance landing by Russian special forces in the first days of the invasion with flat-bottomed raiding craft destroyed and heavy casualties, the Russian command determined to refrain from launching this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those Russian ground units already in Ukraine, adaptation was slower. It is worth exploring why. The standard Russian approach to the formation of BTGs provided for the allocation of one or two BTGs from the composition of the full-time brigade or regiment. In forming, or more precisely, collecting, even one BTG from the brigade for a short-term military operation, the command tried to appoint the best personnel to its composition and distribute the best weapons and equipment for its mission. By itself, the BTG, in the understanding of the Russian command, was more like a ‘reinforced battalion’. The main difference with such a reinforced battalion compared with a permanent combined arms formation is that approximately half of its personnel, and the unit commanders, largely saw each other up close for the first time in their lives on the amalgamation of the BTG. One can only assume how much the relevant commanders were informed about the level of training, experience and equipment of such a unit. At best, they had to rely on the reports of the commanders of regular units about the readiness of their distributed forces and their capacity to perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to BTGs being units that had not trained together and lacking staff who knew one another, they were also non-uniform in their composition. These deviations did not appear to derive from the tasks they were assigned but instead arose from the equipment available from the units that generated them. Yet, to commanders at higher echelons, the Russian battle management appeared to treat all BTGs as comparable units of action with no tailoring of tasks to their respective capabilities. When military advances are used as a mere demonstration of force this would not have been critical. But once the force tried to transition to fighting, units were now assigned tasks for which they were poorly equipped. As an example, consider the composition of two BTGs, which operated in almost the same area in the east of Ukraine at the end of April 2022. One of them was from the 228th Motor Rifle Regiment of the 90th Armoured Division of the Central Military District (Svatove district): 23 APCs; six tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’; up to 40 vehicles; and about 400 personnel. Another was from the composition of the 57th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District (Rubizhne district): more than 30 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs); 14 tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a 152-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’ battery; up to 60 vehicles; and about 800 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o4dm8Cx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusion as to the location and composition of units combined with significant deviation from their pre-assigned tasks led to paralysis in command decisions and no new statement of intent being provided to tactical commanders to rationalise their own decisions. A combination of a lack of time to exchange encryption keys on radios, the effects of Ukrainian EW, poor training on communications equipment and the reversion to stealing cellular communications from local citizens allowed Ukrainian forces to monitor a significant quantity of Russian tactical communications. For the period of March, most of the radio exchanges of Russian troops at the brigade-BTG level consisted of information about the locations of units and individual elements, and only 10–20% related to combat management. Later, Friendly Force Information Requirements only partially considered the monitoring of the needs of class III and V supply which, in turn, created problems with ready supply and imposed loads on the control networks. This not only saw significant supply problems but also the nature of the traffic enabled Ukrainian forces to accurately target Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of understanding of Russian commanders as to the location or condition of their units and the lack of situational awareness of their tactical commanders near Kyiv and Kherson in March–April 2022 invariably led to the movement of newly arrived units along the same routes, repeated attempts to conduct already-exposed manoeuvres, the use of the same locations for temporary staging, and the overreliance on a small number of main supply routes. Even in the maritime theatre, this sticking to proven routes enabled a strike in early March using BM-21 Grad by the Ukrainian Marines on a Russian patrol boat at sea. Conversely, communication with 1st Tank Brigade was maintained along a small supply road running northwards on the left bank of the Dnipro that the Russians failed to sever, despite having an overwhelming force presence. This speaks to the poor situational awareness and lack of active patrolling by Russian units. The breakdown of communications also prevented units bringing up equipment to resolve a range of unforeseen tactical dilemmas. From an operational point of view, Russian intelligence obviously did not foresee the use of hydrotechnical structures for the improvement of existing natural barriers. An example of this is the slow response by Russian troops to the use of hydraulic structures on the Irpin River, which made it possible to raise the water level by 0.5–0.7 m and turn the small river into a significant obstacle for the Russian troops who were rushing to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This general confusion among Russia’s Ground Forces gradually eased towards the end of March as senior officers came forward to establish situational awareness. In the meantime, however, on the axes approaching Kyiv, Ukrainian forces had effectively screened the flanks of the Russian force, which was in any case concentrated in too narrow an area for the number of troops pushed forwards. This unfavourable battlefield geometry made it impossible for the Russians to build up significant momentum, as they came under sustained and intense artillery fire throughout the month. By the time Colonel General Chaiko, commanding the Eastern Group of Forces, had re-established a clear picture of the battlespace, he faced a choice to break through Ukrainian lines and sever the roads to the west of Kyiv, or else withdraw. Initially the Russian forces attempted the former course of action. Unable to bring significant artillery or ammunition forward, however, they took massive casualties and, pressed from both flanks, were at risk of encirclement. When it became apparent that the Central Group of Forces was going to fail to invest Kyiv from the left bank, the decision was taken to withdraw from the Gomel axis and recover the troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Group of Forces, attacking via Chernihiv towards Kyiv, and via Sumy, faced a different dilemma. Having bypassed large Ukrainian combat units, while attempting to traverse over 200 km of densely wooded terrain, these forces had dissipated much of their combat power and were suffering heavily in ambushes and meeting engagements. Here the tactical initiative of Ukrainian tactical units and special forces inflicted heavy casualties. Given the use of Chernihiv as a strongpoint in all-round defence, the Central Group of Forces had the choice, once control had been re-established over its combat units, to either concentrate to reduce these positions to its rear, or else to screen these positions and continue towards the original objective, which was Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial success of the Southern Group of Forces slowed considerably as the combat power of this grouping dissipated across multiple axes. The problems that arose in some of the tactical decision-making among this group of forces can be observed from the lack of intent in orders regarding reversionary courses of action. For example, the Southern Group of Forces only encountered serious resistance on reaching Mykolaiv. As on other axes, the Russians achieved an advantageous force ratio and surprise. Available Ukrainian artillery in this sector was limited. Russian forces had also achieved air superiority. Nevertheless, adhering to the orders to bypass centres of resistance, the Russian units proceeded to try and encircle Mykolaiv to the north. In doing so, they dissipated their combat power, gave the Ukrainian Southern Command time to mobilise and organise more units, and left themselves with an exposed flank. As a result, this position became increasingly untenable, although it would take weeks of bitter fighting before Russian combat units stopped trying to push further west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southern Group of Forces had much more success in closing off Mariupol. Despite many of the Russian tactical actions in this phase of the war, originating with precise and appropriate instructions from higher command, few of these commands could be properly executed. The advance on Mariupol represents an exception, where the higher operational intention to achieve encirclement was properly carried out. Here there was a skilful implementation of preparatory measures to block the communication routes from Mariupol to Volnovaha at D+8 during the encirclement of Mariupol. This set up conditions for the subsequent siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Mariupol – where the Russians had anticipated fierce resistance and were not expecting a rapid surrender by the local authorities – demonstrates the difference that could have been made elsewhere if Russian forces were properly prepared for heavy fighting. Here the model was similar to that used against Grozny in the Second Chechen War: massive employment of fires combined with assault groups to break up defensive positions. The commitment of the 8th Combined Arms Army using BTGs with poor infantry–armour cooperation in the first phase saw significant attrition among Russian units. Nevertheless, Russian forces quickly adapted, forming storm groups of armour and infantry, and creating storm detachments of Chechen troops who proved relatively effective. There were shortcomings in the Ukrainian defence of Mariupol that have since been rectified. The main issue was the establishment of unit boundaries and the division of responsibility between naval, ground and territorial defence forces of the UAF. Russian assault units accurately identified the unit boundaries and were able to exploit these to fracture the defence into several isolated pockets. Given that Russian tactical commanders understood the intent was to seize the city, they were able to effectively implement tactical actions. The longevity of the defence of Mariupol reflects the extraordinary bravery of its defenders. Ukrainian forces not only exceeded the expectations of the Ukrainian General Staff, but also inflicted heavy losses on the Russian attackers. The battlefield geometry, however, of an encirclement deep behind Russian lines, the extensive air defences erected around the city, and the lack of friendly air defences enabled the use of heavy bombers, massive artillery and other means to steadily reduce the defence. Ukraine’s Southern Command has subsequently worked to improve the coordination between Army, TDF and naval units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing-on-donbas-d3891&quot;&gt;Refocusing on Donbas: D+38–91&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian retreat from Kyiv saw a change in the objectives and strategy of the AFRF. Instead of seeking to seize the capital, Russian forces would endeavour to implement what the UAF had assessed to be their most dangerous course of action from the outset of the conflict: the destruction of the UAF in Donbas; seizure and annexation of Luhansk and Donetsk; and, from this position, force Kyiv to negotiate on unfavourable terms. The focus of Russia’s special services would also shift, from the destabilisation of the Ukrainian government to economic and political warfare against Europe to undermine international support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before describing the nature of the fighting, it is important to take stock of the relative condition of the forces, which were repositioned over the course of April. Russian forces had suffered from massive attrition around Kyiv and had lost a vast quantity of military equipment. Throughout April there was an ongoing debate in the Russian government as to the need for mobilisation. Eventually the decision was made against mobilisation. Alongside attrition, Russian forces were suffering from low morale given their lack of success on most axes. At this point, a peculiar bifurcation occurred in the Russian forces. On the one hand, the higher command was still convinced of the need to fight with the BTG as the preferred unit of action, even if this non-uniform and non-mission-specific grouping differed considerably in capability. Thus, when the offensive against Donbas was undertaken in earnest throughout May 2022, it is estimated that Russian forces were fielding a total of 146 BTGs located around Ukraine, of which 93 were active, 13 were being restored, and 40 were in first- and second-phase reserves. This included the 136 BTGs in the original invasion force and additional units formed from reserves and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) and Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, where the Russians had achieved success, they had formed mission-specific groupings, as in Mariupol. The need for non-uniform formations was also driven by several factors concerning human and material resources. Although the Russians were beginning to recruit new contract soldiers and commit Wagner mercenaries and other units, these groupings were largely organised into company-sized units. Heavy casualties among spetsnaz and air-assault units also led to these troops being fielded in company groups more often than battalions. Moreover, although the mobilisation of conscripts in Luhansk and Donetsk had produced around 35,000 troops, heavy casualties in these formations left them highly irregular. Equipment losses also led to the consolidation of capabilities, so that fewer BTGs fielded their assigned batteries of 152-mm howitzers, with these concentrated into artillery tactical groups instead. Over time, as the Russian military came under strain, its organisational principles were diverted into task-specific organisation, usually of brigade groups with several attached independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materiel and personnel pressures were also shaping the disposition of the UAF between the assault on Kyiv and the offensive on Donbas. Ukrainian casualty figures remain classified and cannot be detailed in this report. Nevertheless, after months fighting outnumbered, the very high number of wounded – representing around 80% of casualties on the Ukrainian side, with around 40% of wounded personnel sustaining permanent injuries – left a number of key units heavily depleted. It was also noted at this time that the UAF did not have an established doctrine nor procedures for rotating units from contact. Units in Donbas, for example, had been under attack for more than a month with no reprieve, and it seemed probable that they would now face the full weight of a Russian offensive. Fatigue and concussion from artillery fire were serious issues best resolved through troop rotations. It became imperative to develop techniques to ensure the rapid circulation of troops. Despite these challenges, morale within Ukrainian units remained high, first, because of the failure of the AFRF to place Kyiv under siege, and second, because while a fight in Donbas would be difficult, it was also something that Ukrainian troops had prepared for over several years, offering confidence in their ability to blunt the Russian offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is briefly worth flagging here a political factor that shaped, and in some ways constrained, Ukrainian military preparations for the defence of Donbas at this time. The discovery of war crimes perpetrated at scale by Russian forces in occupied territories on the axes approaching Kyiv created a political climate in which the surrender of territory, and especially settlements, became politically unacceptable. Given the disparity in forces, a manoeuvre defence would have been most effective from a purely military point of view, enabling the enemy to be shaped and then cut off through counterattack to maximise its losses. However, the human cost of these tactics on the population, whom the UAF were mobilised to defend, would have been unacceptable. Showing that the Army would hold ground for as long as practicable was therefore not only a political imperative, but also important in underpinning the moral component of the fighting force. This is not to argue that political decisions inappropriately had an impact on military decision-making. Instead, it is one of the ongoing strengths of the Ukrainian state that there remains a healthy civil–military discourse and an ability to balance these critical factors. Nevertheless, this led to tactical dispositions that, from a purely military perspective, may have appeared suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest challenge at this stage in the conflict for the UAF was equipment losses and the expenditure of ammunition. Although Western support had been symbolically invaluable in the early stages of the war, the enemy was stopped principally through the employment of Ukrainian arms. Nevertheless, Ukraine had, by this point, exhausted most of its MLRS and heavier-calibre Soviet-era artillery ammunition. By the commencement of the Russian offensive against Donbas, NATO systems were becoming available. However, only small numbers had arrived, while training and support for first- and second-line maintenance was not yet available. For example, many of the M777 howitzers that were delivered became inoperable due to maintenance issues after being misused by crews. Furthermore, there was not yet a structured way for equipment to be provided. Whereas piecemeal deliveries of a wide range of systems was workable for rocket-propelled grenades and other light weapons, it was problematic for heavy weapons such as artillery. With little consolidation of support, Ukraine began to receive a wide variety of equipment types, all of which differed in their maintenance and logistical requirements. The early stages of the offensive on Donbas, therefore, saw the UAF at their most vulnerable from the point of view of equipment. The question was whether materiel support would accelerate sufficiently to meet the imminent threat. While Ukraine managed to maintain artillery parity in the first stage of the war, in the second stage, thanks to the absolute superiority in the volume of ammunition, Russia began to achieve fires dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian offensive on Donbas proceeded in accordance with the sound logic of operational encirclement through attacks to the north and south of the JFO. Although the overall operational concept was sound, it must be noted that no effort was made to disperse Ukrainian forces on to other axes or otherwise present the UAF with competing imperatives. Thus, while the UAF had a shortage of armaments at this time, they also had a very limited and identifiable area where armaments needed to be concentrated. The protracted defence of the Azovstal steel works – long after the rest of Mariupol had fallen – proved important in slowing the release of forces to simultaneously pressure Donbas from the southern axis and thereby further limited the frontages that the UAF had to cover in the first weeks of the offensive. After initial attempts at an armoured breakthrough failed, the Russian military resorted to manoeuvre by fire. The efficiency of this approach was greatly hindered by the unwillingness of their infantry to make deliberate assaults without massive artillery preparation of the targets. It was not uncommon for a company position of the UAF – occupying a frontage of approximately 3 km – to be subjected to 6,000 rounds per day of fire. At this time, the Russians not only had vastly more ammunition than the UAF but also outranged most Ukrainian artillery and the concentration of EW limited the effectiveness of precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the concentration of effort on Donbas, Russia set up EW complexes with up to 10 complexes per 20 km of frontage. Collectively, these complexes effectively disrupted navigation along the front, and conducted direction finding to direct artillery and electronic attack against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs. The use of UAVs during this period deserves special consideration. As the war became dominated by artillery duelling, the importance of rapid target acquisition increased. The narrowing of the contested front and concentration of artillery also offered fewer opportunities for human reconnaissance. Both sides used UAVs extensively throughout the conflict. These ranged from commercial and adapted quadcopters at tactical echelons to fixed-wing reconnaissance UAVs such as the Ukrainian SKIF and Russian Orlan-10. The latter two were especially valuable because they could fly at medium altitude, were too cheap to be economical targets for air defences and provided extensive imagery to enable rapid and responsive fires. Both parties also used large medium-altitude long endurance UAVs such as Ukraine’s TB2s and Russia’s Orion for target acquisition, although these platforms were scarcer, more vulnerable, and therefore only committed under favourable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of UAVs to remaining competitive, their attrition rates were extremely high. Of all UAVs used by the UAF in the first three phases of the war covered by this study, around 90% were destroyed. The average life expectancy of a quadcopter remained around three flights. The average life expectancy of a fixed-wing UAV was around six flights. Skilled crews who properly pre-programmed the flight path of their UAVs to approach targets shielded by terrain and other features could extend the life of their platforms. However, even when UAVs survived, this did not mean that they were successful in carrying out their missions. UAVs could fail to achieve their missions because the requirements to get them in place – flying without transmitting data, with captured images to be downloaded on recovery, for example – prevented timely target acquisition before the enemy displaced. Furthermore, such a method, while improving survivability, also necessitated the right locations to be preselected for image capture. Many missions failed to find targets because there was no target at the specified location. Alternatively, and more common, was mission failure owing to disruption of a UAV under control through electronic warfare, the dazzling of its sensors or the denial of its navigational systems from determining the accurate location of a target. In other instances, the Russians successfully struck the ground control stations of the UAV. In aggregate, only around a third of UAV missions can be said to have been successful. Here, the Orlan-10 should be singled out in terms of its utility because the cheap platform nevertheless had a high performance and proved difficult to counter, although its inertial navigation makes insufficient account of windage. Even the Russian military, however, found that it did not have enough of these platforms to sustain the loss rate during the battle in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defeat of precision was critical to unit survival. Defeating precision could be achieved by preventing a launcher from accurately determining its position, even with very small displacements, by preventing the enemy determining the precise location of the target or through direct interference with the mechanism for precision strike. The latter did not always require expensive methods. When Russian reconnaissance troops began to mark Ukrainian defensive positions with laser designators, for example, it was found that having laser warning indicators over strongpoints could alert personnel being targeted, who could then pop smoke grenades to disrupt the accuracy of the strike. This would also blind the defenders, making them vulnerable to assault. Thermal optics, or the targeting of the designating team from another position to relieve the suppression of the targeted post was critical. The experience of the UAF showed that precision artillery was not only disproportionately effective, but also limited the vulnerability of the force by reducing its logistical footprint. Nevertheless, in the early phases of the fighting in Donbas when the UAF had few precision systems, Russian EW reduced the effectiveness of these systems. This disproportionately affected the UAF because the Russians primarily relied on saturation fire from unguided shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian EW systems were highly effective, there were also noted weaknesses of these complexes. The Russians suffered extensively from these systems having an equally noticeable effect on its own troops. The AFRF have not yet managed to solve this problem, except in the case of some specific platforms such as the Su-34. Furthermore, there were often weaknesses in planning, partly exacerbated by the issue of fratricide. For example, when military communications were suppressed it was often possible to revert to cellular communications channels. Although the Russians have the means to target these communications, the Leer-3 payload carried by an Orlan-10 UAV is hard to synchronise with EW effects that make the use of UAVs exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, although navigational effects disrupted precision, direct jamming against precision systems was rarely effective. It is apparent that the Russians have refined, but done little to develop beyond, Soviet systems and some of their new systems such as the Repellent complex were largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, the Russians had consolidated much of their artillery into artillery tactical groups and began directing fires from higher headquarters owing to a shortage of trained fire controllers. Russian artillery would tend to operate in batteries a third of their range behind the forward line of own troops (FLOT), with a spacing of 100–150 m between their guns. Missions were usually assigned to the battery, whereas the UAF mostly assign fire missions to guns. Russian units with their own UAVs could deliver highly responsive fires, bringing effect to bear within 3–5 minutes of target detection. For targets that ran through a fire-control headquarters, the Russians continued to add new detections to the bottom of the list and prosecute strikes in order, leading to fire missions taking 20–30 minutes at the tactical level, and around 48 hours at the operational level. Russian artillery would conduct counter-battery fire, but never from the targeted battery. Instead, a targeted battery would immediately displace in the case of MLRS when under fire, or the crews would seek cover until fire lifted and then displace. Counter-battery fire would be assigned to a separate battery. The Russians rarely displaced after firing unless they received fire. This appears to have been because the volume of shells they needed to fire their missions could not be displaced or repositioned quickly, even if the guns could. Given their fires dominance, during this phase, their static approach was not overly costly until longer-range precision systems became available to the UAF, at which point the Russian fires system was severely disrupted. Owing to fire missions being coordinated at a high level, the AFRF at this time also exercised limited discipline in assigning weapons to fire missions but could instead draw on any available weapons system to complete a mission. Thus, Tochka-U were deployed for counter-battery effects. Overall, during the offensive against Donbas, Russian artillery were firing around 20,000 rounds per day, with their peak fire rate surpassing 32,000 rounds on some days. Ukrainian fires rarely exceeded 6,000 rounds a day, reflecting a shortage of both barrels and ammunition. For the offensive on Donbas, the Russians deployed over 1,100 tube artillery pieces with around 80–90 guns usually formed into a group to support the actions of brigade-sized groupings of three to four BTGs. The Russian advantage in artillery during May and June 2022 in Donbas was 12:1. Special attention should be paid to the use of Russian MLRS, including BM-21 Grad, 9K57 Uragan and 9K58 Smerch. Practically all these systems were used at their maximum range; 9K57 and 9K58, in particular, were used at 35–70 km. Despite their doctrinal role, MLRS were used not only on area targets, but also on point targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this overwhelming firepower, the Russians made slow progress. The assault tactics employed by Russian operations evolved over time. Initially there were repeated attempts to make progress using armoured thrusts. A shortage of infantry, and, in particular, of motivated and skilled infantry, led to heavy equipment losses. Thereafter, the Russians resorted to the total saturation of defended areas to compel withdrawal. This created a dilemma for the UAF because if ground was ceded, the Russians would advance, but to prevent it being ceded it was necessary to maintain troops under massive bombardment, with inevitably high casualties. The threat became more acute as the Russians developed more effective means of attack. Rather than uniform BTG manoeuvres, they began to operate in waves. LNR and DNR conscripts would be pushed forwards to skirmish and assault a position, forcing UAF positions to reveal themselves. These would be identified by Russian reconnaissance troops and subjected to precision artillery fire. There would then be a massive artillery bombardment followed by a deliberate assault by more capable troops comprising airborne, spetsnaz or Wagner companies. Notably, spetsnaz during this phase were almost exclusively employed as capable light or sometimes mechanised infantry. Once the UAF withdrew, the Russians would occupy the position with LNR and DNR conscripts and withdraw their more capable forces. This cycle would take one or two days, with the Russians aiming to go firm in the evening to have the night to harden their positions against counterattack. Of course, this process could only ever advance a couple of kilometres per day, and often less, depending on the distance between defence lines. It also incurred heavy Russian casualties, although these were disproportionately concentrated among LNR and DNR conscripts. The Russians also changed their use of armour from thrusts by platoon-sized groups of tanks supported by armoured infantry to using tanks for indirect fire or long-range engagements using barrel-launched ATGMs, copying the preferred approach of the UAF. A lack of training left Russian forces less accurate in applying these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VKS operations during this time also shifted. Although heavy bombing was carried out in Mariupol, the penetration of Ukrainian airspace had declined after the withdrawal from Kyiv, other than with long-range precision fires. The VKS however recommenced the delivery of frontline effects as the offensive in Donbas got under way. This usually saw a fourship of Russian aircraft approach the Ukrainian air-defence zone at medium altitude, applying EW effects or launching anti-radiation missiles if Ukrainian radar illuminated. At the same time, a twoship of aircraft would approach the air-defence zone at very low level and usually conduct strikes with unguided munitions, including indirect rocket attacks after lofting. This technique – also applied by the Ukrainian Air Force and Army Aviation – could be effective in saturating an area target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than close air support, the VKS’s main effort was in releasing long-range precision fires from inside Russian airspace. Strategic aviation of the VKS comprising Tu-22M3 (Backfire) and Tu-95MS (Bear) long-range bomber aircraft operated as launch platforms for Kh-22/Kh-32 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-55/Kh-555 (AS-15 Kent) from the first days of the war and proved to be effective. The first strikes with the use of air-launched missiles were noted on D+3 and continued throughout the conflict. For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, approximately 180 Kh-22/32 and Kh-55/555 launches were recorded. Beyond air-launched effects, however, there was a marked difference in the pattern of long-range precision fires from the first phase of the war to the offensive on Donbas. The main portion of strategic, and sometimes operational, fire missions until the beginning of April 2022 was performed by the short-range ballistic missile systems 9M720 and 9M723 Iskander (SS-26 Stone). For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, more than 200 missile strikes by this system were recorded. Missile strikes were conducted deep into the territory of Ukraine, up to the regions near the border with Poland. More than 160 civilian and military objects were hit. While Ukrainian Air Defences were effective at intercepting cruise missiles throughout the war, 9M720 proved exceedingly difficult to intercept, and 9M723 was almost impossible to manipulate via other means. The situation changed from D+14–16, when the number of SS-26 Stone employments significantly reduced, and at the beginning of April 2022, the Russians shifted from salvo to single strikes. The likely reason for this may be a shortage of missiles, the stocks of which were calculated for a short-term strategic operation. Russian industry has the capacity to manufacture six 9M723s per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive on Donbas, although long-range precision fires continued, the Russians increasingly relied on obsolete systems. Target types that were struck with 9M720 earlier in the conflict were instead engaged, from April 2022, with the short-range ballistic missile system 9K79 (SS-21 Scarab A). A similar transition occurred with the employment of naval fires. For example, from D+60–65 there was a transition from target types that were previously engaged with Kalibr 3M-14K (SS-N-27 Sizzler), instead being engaged with 3K60 Bal (SSC-6 Sennight) and 3K55 Bastion (SSC-5 Stooge) coastal missile systems. The consequence of this inappropriate employment of munitions was reduced accuracy and, in many cases, the tragic striking of civilian structures. The main operational impact of these strikes on Ukrainian cities was to force Ukrainian air defences to be spread over a wide geographic area, limiting protection of the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued threat from strikes originating in the Black Sea further stretched Ukrainian air and missile defences. Although the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva on 13 April 2022 caused the Russian Black Sea Fleet, other than fast attack craft, to move its operations further from the Ukrainian coast, the Russian Navy could still functionally perform two of its defined tasks. It could no longer approach the coast and threaten landings. However, Russian ships and submarines continued to deliver long-range missile strikes against southern and western Ukraine, while the transition from a close to a distant blockade did not fundamentally alter the economic isolation of Ukraine’s ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of fires delivered on the front in Donbas led progressively to the total destruction of defensive positions until they were no longer viable. This led, in mid-June, to the decision to withdraw from Severodonetsk. At this time, the Russian system of war was effectively inflicting casualties and taking ground from the UAF, but it also had several key dependencies and therefore vulnerabilities. The most prominent of these was its sustainment. The supply of fuel for the groupings of the AFRF in Ukraine was more a task of its delivery than a matter of availability. To solve this problem, a historically proven approach was mainly used: the exploitation of railways. The volume of transportation was large. For example, in just the period 1–19 April 2022, and only to the railway station of Rovenki (Luhansk region), 228 railway cisterns with fuel and lubricants (more than 13,600 tonnes) were moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the supply of ammunition, the Russian command used the classic system provided for by doctrinal documents. Its essence is in a multi-level delivery and distribution from brigade to battalion to company/battery. However, during the strategic operation against Ukraine, the function of the ‘brigade link’ had to be performed by divisional- and army-level logistics units because of the volume of materiel moved. The Russians were forced to reorganise their logistics at D+7 upon realising that the conflict would protract significantly beyond their initial planning assumption. The ammunition supply system was based on two organisational solutions. The first was that the supply of ammunition relied on a network of deployed so-called ‘field artillery depots’. Each of them turned out to be a complex of civilian industrial buildings adapted for the storage of ammunition. Such warehouses usually stored no more than two–three ammunition basic loads for an attached group of troops. One such warehouse could supply ammunition to units within a radius of 30–50 km. The second solution provided for the maximum accumulation of ammunition directly in units (company/battery-battalion/artillery battalion). This stimulated the dispersion of stocks and allowed for autonomy of actions in case of disruption of planned delivery. However, it also increased the probability of the destruction of stocks and reduced the tactical ability of artillery units to shoot-and-scoot, since they had large ammunitions stocks at their positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the requirements of Russian doctrine, which is essentially a carbon copy of the Soviet ones, the location of the main support elements and reserves of the divisional and army units is situated at a depth of up to 50 km from the line of contact. It is likely that such a requirement is justified for the conditions of dense operational order of battle with reliable cover of such elements by air defence. The practice of war in Ukraine showed something different – a decentralised operational structure and separate directions for advance. But the Russian command, for reasons not fully understood, continued to follow the doctrinal position unchanged, for more than 60 days. As a result, the specified objects regularly became targets for damage by the long-range MLRS BM-30 Smerch and Tochka-U – fired by the UAF. Only at the end of April 2022 was the concentration of a significant part of the personnel, equipment and materiel moved beyond the 50-km (later 100-km) security zone, based on the maximum range of weapons of the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From D+20–30 the Russians began to secure and exploit surviving rail infrastructure in the occupied territories for the transportation of troops and materiel. Understanding the importance of rail transportation, primarily from the point of view of efficiency, the Russian command managed to ensure the unloading of military echelons 30–50 km from the line of contact in most directions. An understandable condition for this was its repair, restoration and protection with the involvement of military units of the Railway Troops of the Russian Armed Forces. For example, since May 2022, as part of the logistical support for the conduct of actions by Russian troops, the MLZH-VF-VT pontoon rail bridge was installed by the 29th Brigade of Railway Troops of the Western Military District near the destroyed rail bridge in Kupyansk (Kharkiv region), across the Oskil River. This was connected to the main railway by the Kupyansk-Vuzlovy–Vovchansk branch. To ensure adequate protection of rail communications, on the southern axes, Russian troops used such exotic means as armoured trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian logistics system was chaotic in the first phase of the war, the structural efficiency of the approach ensured consistent supply throughout the offensive on Donbas. However, the dependence on fixed rail infrastructure, the viable distances from the known railheads to the field depots, and the lack of manoeuvrability of units because of their materiel-heavy concept of operations all exposed the force to systemic vulnerabilities. The mapping of depots and unit support areas, once Ukraine obtained long-range precision fires through military-technical assistance, allowed for the systematic targeting of this logistics infrastructure and through this means the denial of the Russian concept of operation. The introduction of HIMARS and M270 firing GMLRS into the UAF therefore can be seen as the point where the Russian offensive on Donbas ended and the war entered a new phase. The character of the summer fighting involves many elements that remain operationally relevant, and, to that end, it is inappropriate to discuss this phase of the war at this stage. In due course, it will be possible to discuss the Ukrainian preparation for offensive operations. Nevertheless, what has been discussed already provides a rich body of data from which lessons can be identified as to the structural strengths and weaknesses of the AFRF and wider lessons about modern combat for NATO forces. These are considered in the following chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-assessing-russian-military-performance-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;IV. Assessing Russian Military Performance in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 24 February 2022, Russia’s potential adversaries, through professional respect, assumed that Russian forces would employ their capabilities with a basic level of competence. But the size of their forces, sustained investment, their available firepower and the proficiency with which the AFRF had conducted smaller-scale operations in preceding years led to an overestimation of Russia’s actual military capabilities. There was also an overriding focus on the quantity of equipment, rather than the quality of personnel, their leadership, training and motivations. The general error was to take the best observed Russian performance and set this as the expected standard. This had a pernicious effect on policy by increasing fear of Russian forces among Ukraine’s international partners, which Russia exploited to coerce its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 24 February 2022, many observers who have not had direct experience of the conflict have overcorrected for their early analytical errors. There is a perception that the AFRF are systemically incompetent, irredeemably corrupt, that their weapons are ineffective and unreliable, and that the force is incapable of adapting. This narrative is dangerous, both because it is inaccurate, and also because it encourages complacency. Ukraine benefited significantly in its preparations by measuring its readiness against Russia’s potential rather than its actual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational data outlined above shows that the Russian military suffered from major errors of judgement made by the Russian leadership, special services and the presidential administration. The force also suffers from structural weaknesses in its force design and training system that created specific operational and tactical frictions. It was also a force designed for ‘active defence’ strategic military operations, not for a large-scale attack on another sovereign country without full wartime mobilisation. Nevertheless, the AFRF have already demonstrated that they are able to learn and adapt. They remain highly lethal, determined to achieve the mission set by their president, and employing highly capable weapons systems. In future assessments of Russian capabilities, careful attention should be paid to the extent that they have corrected some of the systemic weaknesses in their force, which they are unlikely to be able to resolve during the current period of aggression. If they can make progress in resolving these issues, the gap between Russian potential and its capabilities may narrow considerably. This chapter outlines these key identified weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-has-a-hierarchy-of-jointery&quot;&gt;Russia Has a Hierarchy of Jointery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from the perspective of Russia’s Ground Forces, its military likely appears to be a highly joint organisation. Against Ukraine, the Russian Navy and VKS were both integrated into the campaign plan, adapted as the Russian plan was forced to change, and each contributed to the overall mission. Conversely, it is evident that Russian jointery functions as a hierarchy in which the Navy and VKS are subordinated to the Ground Force’s needs. This was demonstrated in the C2 arrangements during the conflict and the prioritisations of their mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Russians had both airborne command posts in the form of Il-20 Coot aircraft and AWACS orbits provided by A-50M, the coordination of air operations was subordinated to the military district command posts of the Ground Forces rather than the VKS. Rather than running operations from a central combined air-operations centre, coordination of air tasking was managed by ground-based C2 and planned separately by air armies assigned to support each operational group of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of Russia’s air campaign is that the initial targets were prioritised according to the extent that they enabled the Ground Force’s seizure of critical infrastructure. After the Ground Forces began to struggle to make progress, Russian airpower shifted from targeting air-defence sites to win control of the air and instead attempted to provide increasing levels of close air support. The depth of penetration decreased and became tied to the Ground Forces’ axes of advance. Thus, not only C2, but also the logic of prioritisation of air targets, was disproportionately shaped by the tactical challenges faced by the Ground Forces, arguably at the expense of the VKS planning to bring about control of the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Russian Navy, the task of blockade may be considered an application of sea power. Beyond this function, however, the Navy’s core tasks were similarly in support of land operations, either to put troops ashore to seize key lines of communication in advance of Ground Forces movements, or to simply provide strike platforms in support of the wider strike campaign, and, in particular, servicing of targets of tactical importance to the Ground Forces moving along Ukraine’s southern coast. The impact on the professionalism and identity of the service from being subordinated to the Ground Forces in this way is hard to measure but must necessarily contribute to the generally low level of seamanship demonstrated by the Moskva, whose radar was stowed when struck. A more effective employment of air and sea power would likely require a greater level of autonomy in planning for the separate branches with the prioritisation of tasks geared towards joint ends rather than subordinate to the logic of land operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-force-generation-is-not-aligned-with-its-concepts-of-operation&quot;&gt;Russian Force Generation is Not Aligned with its Concepts of Operation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet military was structured to fight in regiments, divisions and combined arms armies that also held independent brigades under command. The Russian armed forces have, for over a decade, pursued the concept of a BTG, constituting an all-arms formation with disproportionate enablement. After 2015, it was noted by the Russian General Staff that the BTG construct would not work without the divisional logistics structure sustaining it and, so, brigades and regiments would thereafter generate BTGs which would be supported by the divisional logistics effort and commanded by the associated combined arms army. The BTG would pool the experienced contract troops from the peacetime unit, thereby theoretically increasing the combat power of the forces generated. It would also allow mixed units of conscripts and contractors in peacetime, which was consistent with a training model that saw the upskilling of soldiers conducted in their units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia has attempted, for some time, to shift from a conscript-based force to a fully volunteer force, it has not been able to recruit enough contract soldiers to abandon conscription. Nor has the Russian military adopted a contract structure that retains experienced and educated personnel in positions of junior leadership. This is equivalent to the non-commissioned officer cadre in Western militaries. This makes the BTG construct highly problematic. The battalion staff is insufficient to manage all the enablers that are assigned. Moreover, because this is a composite formation drawing from multiple units and is only generated for operations, there is a lack of familiarity among the personnel in different arms of the BTG. The commander does not know their people. Thus, a small team of sufficiently trained personnel is unable to provide detailed instructions to each of its subordinate elements, but also does not know its subordinates well enough to be able to predict how they will handle brief and incomplete instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem with the BTG is its ability to absorb losses. An enabled company group – as a unit of action – either succeeds in its task or fails and can thereafter be rotated out if overly attrited. A BTG, however, because of the level of enablement, can become incapable of executing battalion tasks when key enablers are disproportionately attrited, even if many of its components are still useable. As an example, on 22 April 2022, as a result of engagements in the direction of Kurakhove, a BTG of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade under the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District was taken out of battle having lost 240 servicemen killed in action, 11 IFVs, four tanks, three self-propelled guns and three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’. Statistically, the BTG lost only up to 30% of its initial combat power, and many of its supporting elements were intact. However, as a unit, it was no longer capable of executing the tasks that it was being assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial response to this challenge introduced even more confusion into Russian operations. The units less affected by attrition within a BTG would be removed and assigned to other BTGs so that a new amalgamated formation with the requisite combat power was created. The result was to further intermingle personnel from different units, once again changing the command team and ensuring that commanders had no familiarity with their subordinates. It also created logistical and communications problems as units were cut across from one chain of command to another, creating frictions with encryption keys and compatibility problems, and ensuring that the calibres and thus the sustainment demands within a given formation changed periodically. A further complication was that, because the BTG structure put the most experienced troops and commanders in the first echelon, attrition was disproportionately among those with the most experience and therefore best able to manage the uncertainty of composite and amalgamated formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frictions may have been manageable with a higher proportion of junior leaders. Instead, the Russian military found that junior commanders were rapidly promoted to fill the critical staffing requirements at battalion and higher levels, denuding companies of effective leadership and technical skills. As the conflict went on, the disparity between the precision and elegance of issued orders from headquarters and their execution widened considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the weaknesses of the BTG were the most evident, similar issues have bedevilled other Russian branches, most notably the VKS. Ukrainian assessments concluded that given limited flight hours and the practice of training being delivered in units, the VKS entered the conflict with fewer than 100 fully trained and current pilots. Combined with a military culture that assigns the most dangerous missions to the most experienced crews, attrition in the VKS has fallen disproportionately on this cadre, reducing the overall effectiveness of the force and its ability to train new pilots. In negotiations over prisoner exchanges, the AFRF have been eager for the return of experienced pilots. The mobilisation of trainers from their flying schools to frontline formations has also hampered the ability to generate new pilots. The Ukrainian military has noted a rise in both very young and very old pilots in the VKS, with ageing pilots returned to frontline service. This has corresponded with a significant reduction in the scale and complexity of VKS air operations over Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict. It is also a problem that has affected ground crews, for example with the discovery of left-on covers on the sensors of Russian aviation operating over Ukraine, an easily avoided mistake which has a severe impact on effectiveness and should be considered negligence. This suggests challenges in discipline and junior leadership among maintenance crews in the VKS. Another demonstration of this poor discipline in the VKS is the routine stacking of munitions next to aircraft on Russian air bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is harder to assess the limitations of the Russian Navy in terms of its force-generation model as there are fewer data points. Nevertheless, the alertness and damage-control capabilities on the Moskva suggest similar deficiencies in junior crew leadership may affect the Navy. The key point here is that Russia has built a force-employment concept that is beyond the capacity of its force-generation model to resource with the appropriate expertise. Key indicators for improvements in Russian military capability therefore will be whether it adjusts its force-generation model, or reconceptualises how it task organises for operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-has-a-tendency-to-reinforce-failure&quot;&gt;The Russian Military Has a Tendency to Reinforce Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of the war, it was apparent that the course of events described in the orders issued to units diverged significantly from developments on the ground. Nevertheless, units continued to seek to execute their orders long after it had become apparent that assumptions in those orders were wrong. This behaviour has continued throughout the war. The continuous attempts to assault Bakhmut, for example, long after it ceased to be on Russia’s main effort, demonstrate that until an order is countermanded commanders will continue to try to execute their last instruction. In the early phases, during offensive operations, this was best demonstrated around Mykolaiv and Chernihiv. In both cases, Russian units had been ordered to bypass resistance to reach their objectives. The orders made clear that resistance was expected to be light. When this assumption was demonstrated to be false, however, Russian commanders continued to seek to bypass strongpoints, even when it degraded their tactical position, exposed their flanks and diluted their combat power by spreading concentrated forces over a long frontage in contact with Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not be mistaken for a lack of flexibility or adaptability in implementing combat tasks. Russian units often rapidly adapt their methods in response to failure. They also demonstrate creativity within their assigned boundaries. In some contexts, the tendency to lean into a course of action poses dangers to the enemy. Much Western military literature discusses ‘cognitive shaping’ and the use of ‘information manoeuvre’ to divert or alter the enemy’s course of action. These are unlikely to be effective against such a military culture. Similarly, if a force intending to divert an offensive into a killing area is insufficiently strong to blunt the enemy, the response to contact may be – and often is – to lean into the confrontation. If the blocking force is not sufficiently large or lacks firepower, it risks being destroyed, even if it inflicts high casualties, rather than stops the assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of this tendency, it appears clear that anticipating the enemy’s intent and setting dispositions to optimally respond is more important than trying to shape that intent. If an enemy accelerates through a killing area or recommits to an axis even if its intelligence assessment of resistance was unrealistic, anticipating its assigned axis is the best means of placing killing areas in the right location. Conversely, even if a more favourable or apparently advantageous route presents itself, it is unlikely that the unit will deviate from its axis. Cognitive shaping, therefore, must be aimed at operational commanders, with such decisions rarely being made lower than the combined arms army command post. In delivering such a capability, it is essential to understand the theory of victory and higher intent to which the commander is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of Russian orders, which is a significant weakness, is the near absence of reversionary courses of action. If unsuccessful, or if the higher intent is no longer achievable, this leads to requests for clarification being referred upwards. Once decisions are made at higher echelons, the lower echelons can alter their actions quickly. The decision to withdraw from Kyiv, for example, saw a rapid break from contact – with varying levels of order – on both main axes. This was largely executed competently. However, in the interval when higher headquarters seek to formulate a plan, paralysis tends to grip lower echelons if their initial orders do not reflect the position on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has probably had the greatest impact in creating a gap between potential and actual capability as regards Russian fires. All reported contacts are treated as true. All fire missions appear to be given equal priority and are prosecuted in the order in which they are received unless an order to prioritise a specific mission comes from higher authority. It seems that those directing fire missions either do not have access to contextual information or are indifferent to it. In any case, observations of Russian pre-planned fires shows that they will strike targets that have moved and subsequently engage the same target in its new position, suggesting a purely chronological prioritisation of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Russian Navy, a similar dynamic can be observed. The orders to initiate amphibious landings were conditions-based as they were in support of ground forces which never reached the point to justify the action. Thus, these were called off before the forces were committed. However, subsequently, when the sinking of the Moskva enabled the Ukrainian Air Force to re-establish control of the air over Snake Island, it was notable that the Russian Navy continued to try to contest this outpost and the surrounding waters with fast attack boats. Lacking air defence, these were destroyed, mainly with TB2, while Snake Island became denied by Ukrainian long-range fires. Still, the Russian Navy sought to reinforce this failure even though control of the island had no functional impact on its ability to blockade Ukraine’s southern coast. They only stopped reinforcing this failure when higher-level orders accepted abandoning the position. The tendency to reinforce failure was less evident in the VKS, which adapted rapidly to battlefield developments and emerging threats in terms of the employment of its capabilities. The VKS did suffer from the same tendency when it came to targeting, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of fires without prioritisation is a tendency that should be carefully monitored, except in instances where a battery is directly allocated to a unit, has organic capabilities for target acquisition or is operating under higher command. If the Russians can resolve the cultural tendency to treat all instructions as valid until directly countermanded, and all intelligence as accurate unless contradicted, their capability may rapidly improve, coming closer to what their systems suggest they should be able to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-is-culturally-vulnerable-to-deception&quot;&gt;The Russian Military is Culturally Vulnerable to Deception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of too few experienced tactical commanders and a culture that leans into courses of action without distributing sufficient situational awareness for contextual judgement leads to a force that is systemically vulnerable to deception measures. It is vulnerable to deception for three reasons. First, the tendency to treat information received as true unless there is contradictory information leads to systemic confirmation bias. Second, the force does not encourage honest reporting of failures, while there is a shortage of capabilities for battle damage assessment. Third, Russian systems are largely designed around single missions. Even within an EW or air-defence system, each operator will control a different sensor or function. Operators are trained to examine the specific picture for which they are responsible. Neither in their systems’ design, nor in their culture, is there an effective fusion process. In consequence, although the force often has the information to spot inconsistencies in its sensor picture, it is rarely able to compare its datasets to identify these inconsistencies within an operationally relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deception has succeeded against Russian forces at all echelons and across all three service branches. At the tactical level, the UAF have systematically employed false signals traffic and decoys of prestige systems to misdirect Russian fires. This has almost always succeeded, leading to a vast expenditure of munitions against non-existent targets and a corresponding vulnerability for Russian fires in revealing their positions. Tracking how the Russians were conducting battle damage assessment and thereby assuring the Russian military that all strikes were successful repeatedly led to the loss of Russian aircraft and other capabilities because they proceeded on the assumption that the threat had been eliminated. At the operational level, too, Russian forces have been predictable in allocating resources against telegraphed movements and failing to detect or prepare for concealed movements. This has even taken place when some Russian reporting streams have detected concentrations but have been unable to present a sufficiently convincing case to commanders to win resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of the Russian forces to deception is also a risk for its adversaries. Especially prior to a conflict, the primary aim of a force is often deterrence or shaping. In much NATO discussion of these issues subtle changes in force posture, weapons fits on aircraft, patterns of behaviour and so on are used to try to message varying levels of readiness, preparedness and will. Many of these actions are premised on the assumption that they will be observed by the adversary. From a technical point of view, it is certainly true that the Russians can see these kinds of activities. However, when Ukrainian forces struck the cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles on 13 April 2022 there was no indication that its radar was operating. This was supposed to be the central ISTAR node for the air defence of the Black Sea Fleet, yet despite being in an active warzone, the ship’s primary sensors were not on. Nor was this an isolated incident. Russian aviation, shot down over Ukraine, has been found on more than one occasion to have its radar in the stowed position, with safety covers over primary sensors. These incidents speak to complacency, poor ground crew training and a lack of mission focus. When considering the issues of process and lack of fusion described above, however, the visibility of these subtle adjustments for Russian operational commanders is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent. From a deterrence point of view – or for the purposes of shaping decision-making – this is concerning because it suggests that most of the nuance in messaging may be lost. Therefore, while the Russian forces may be vulnerable to deception, the message must be clearly telegraphed. In the context of deterrence, one of the biggest challenges may be preventing the Russians from deceiving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing whether the Russians are closing the gap between their potential and actual capabilities, it is important to pay close attention to their discipline in the employment of sensors, the level of fusion achieved between sensors and whether the situational awareness that is needed to provide officers context for information is properly disseminated. If these issues are addressed, there could be a rapid improvement in the performance of the Russian armed forces. Left unaddressed, the Russians, having the potential capabilities but not the necessary awareness, may fight by lashing out at sounds and in response to blows. One can readily trick such an adversary into striking in the wrong direction. But that does not stop it from being a dangerous adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-forces-are-prone-to-fratricide&quot;&gt;Russian Forces Are Prone to Fratricide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fratricide has been a widespread problem for the Russian forces during their invasion of Ukraine. This has been across all systems. Russian air defences have regularly engaged friendly aircraft. When Russian troops deviate from their assigned axes or the timing of their actions becomes desynchronised, they are often bracketed by their own artillery. Russian units in complex terrain have also become embroiled in exchanges of fire between one another’s positions. This speaks to a lack of C2 and control measures during operations. It likely reflects Russian troops largely conducting scripted exercises rather than free-play force-on-force activity where they are used to dealing with the ambiguities that arise on the battlefield. Some Russian units are much better at this. Among line units, however, map-reading and other basic soldiering skills are not well understood, leading to disorientation and therefore a propensity to misidentify sources of fire. Artillery strikes on friendlies have arisen either because units have been detected retreating or redeploying by UAV and presumed hostile based on their direction of travel, or because pre-planned strikes have caught units that have moved slower or faster than dictated by planning. Here, a lack of IFF (identification, friend or foe) procedures is notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the sub-tactical errors described above, fratricide is a systemic issue between Russian systems. For example, the Khibiny EW pod, mounted to a number of Russian aircraft, automatically detects radars and disrupts them. Unfortunately for the Russians, it tends to also do this to other Russian aircraft. Pairs of Russian strike aircraft mounting this system have therefore had to choose between having a functional radar or EW protection. They have often been ordered to prioritise their radar. This wider issue of confliction between systems, or lack of compatibility between communications equipment, could be managed if units had good situational awareness and a high level of training and reversionary planning in the deconfliction by time or space of their different EW effects. In practice, it leads to a great deal of confusion and mutual disruption. It also offers innumerable – albeit regularly shifting – seams through which effects can breach Russian defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further fratricidal issue is the culture of reporting within the Russian military. Those who fail are usually replaced or threatened with punishment. Alternatively, for senior officers, failure can lead to a different organisation being given leadership for a specified task. Far from incentivising success, this often leads to dishonest reporting in which the blame for failure is transferred onto others. This scapegoating of colleagues – endemic in the Russian special services but also in the military – obscures the actual operational problems that must be solved. These only become apparent when they can no longer be concealed, slowing the learning of lessons, but also leading to predictable and predicted vulnerabilities not being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of fratricide therefore may be studied in three respects as a measure of progress in the development of the Russian Armed Forces. First, there must be an assessment as to the level of effort in future Russian systems to deconflict their effects. Second, there is the question of free-play exercises and testing deconfliction in a dynamic environment to build the necessary skills to avoid fratricide. Third, there is the cultural issue of an honest reporting culture. Without incentives to resolve these issues, it is likely that the Russian military will continue to employ effects that cause its troops harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point on fratricide is the attitude of the Russian military generally, and of its officer corps in particular, to people – its own and civilians. The widespread war crimes by Russian troops throughout the conflict have been widely documented. But it should also be noted that many Russian officers do not invest time in looking after their personnel or caring for their welfare. The culture of hazing in the Russian military arguably creates strong disincentives for junior officers to become involved in the everyday lives of their subordinates. This stems from a general cultural approach that does not place a great deal of value on human life. For senior Russian officers who spent their time as junior officers in the Soviet Union there is still a mindset of seeing people as an inexhaustible resource to be expended. But that is not Russia today. Russia has a finite number of available military personnel. This culture of not valuing individuals is a form of institutional fratricide. Although it leads Russian troops to take a great deal of punishment without surrendering on the battlefield – there is an expectation and acceptance of suffering – it also leads to low morale, poor unit cohesion and troops who lack the team spirit to effectively conduct sub-tactical manoeuvre. Given Russia’s ageing population and its limited base for recruits, progress in its approach to its human capital is another important metric for assessing whether the Russian armed forces can improve their capabilities after this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-lessons-identified-for-the-british-military&quot;&gt;V. Lessons Identified for the British Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military – as outlined in the second chapter of this report – differed considerably in its size, capabilities, structure and culture compared with NATO forces. There are some threats that proved exceedingly difficult for the UAF that would not pose a threat to NATO armies. For example, NATO would not face the same technological disadvantages in the air against Russian aircraft or be unable to contest Russia’s distant blockade. Conversely, there are areas where the UAF are considerably more capable than the forces of many NATO states. Another feature of identifying lessons for future conflict is that some of the weaknesses identified in the previous chapter as regards Russia’s armed forces may be resolved following this conflict. This chapter, therefore, focuses on those aspects that are considered likely constants and applicable to a range of adversaries. This chapter is also specifically aimed at identifying relevant lessons for the British military in relation to how it is currently projected to develop until 2030, although many of the observations have application across NATO members. For other armies, slightly different lessons may apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-is-no-sanctuary&quot;&gt;There Is No Sanctuary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first clear lesson from the war in Ukraine is that the enemy can conduct strikes on targets throughout its adversary’s operational depth with long-range precision fires. Moreover, in target states, the Russians have proven able to retain networks of agents in place to observe key targets and to update their command on the movement of troops and stores. The integration of human intelligence (HUMINT) into Russian long-range precision-fires kill chains is critical. Given that Ukraine has also retained this capability, despite the exigencies of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories, it seems unlikely that states can plan on the assumption that they can conceal key sites, or the movement of materiel, from the enemy. The Russians have missed targets because of self-imposed frictions in their kill chains, usually striking too late rather than not at all. Their misses have not been for want of intelligence. The effect of these munitions on targets when they strike them is sufficient to destroy most military objects other than deep subterranean or heavily hardened structures. Non-hardened structures are also targetable by loitering munitions, whose accuracy and affordability make them a persistent and pervasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UAF, it was found that the ability to conduct dispersed operations was critical to survivability. Without this capability – to disperse and maintain aircraft in the field for a limited period, while periodically returning to main bases when repairs allowed – it is likely that the Ukrainian Air Force would not have survived the opening days of the conflict. Furthermore, dependence on single critical pieces of infrastructure for C2 is not only risky if they are struck, but also risks encouraging escalatory behaviour by the adversary. For the RAF it appears that a critical question for its survivability is the number of deployable maintenance kits available for its aircraft and the capacity to use secondary and tertiary airfields to disrupt enemy planning. This challenge is especially important in future concepts as aircraft become more dependent on software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Ground Forces similarly found that long-range precision strikes were used against their stockpiles, against training establishments and against maintenance facilities when these were identified. Maintenance facilities had to be situated a long way from the front and dispersed, not because distance assured protection, but because increasing the space over which the enemy had to search for them improved survivability. Ukrainian war stocks survived because they could be rapidly displaced and dispersed. Russian materiel has remained highly vulnerable to long-range fires. The reduction in the logistical tail and therefore reduced vulnerability of precision systems is perhaps as important as their effect in terms of their superiority to non-precision fires. The historical approach of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and 3 UK Division of erecting tented cities – command posts with a large physical footprint – is non-viable in wartime on the modern battlefield. These sites will be identified and struck. Moreover, as the Russians have found to their detriment, concentrated command posts inside requisitioned civilian buildings are similarly vulnerable to long-range precision fires unless all staff retain rigid communications discipline. Even here, the HUMINT threat means that locations should be moved frequently and key components of a staff dispersed. The capacity to access staff work remotely means that it is not strictly necessary to concentrate all headquarters components in close physical proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of pervasive strike capabilities are different for the Royal Navy because naval operations are in continual motion and therefore do not suffer from the same vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine has seen a vast expenditure of anti-ship munitions fired from the air, sea and land. These have mainly been fired against ground targets and in this role have had reduced accuracy. Technical examination of these munitions – and how and why they struck the wrong ground targets – demonstrates that they would be highly effective at sea, however. The volume of long-range anti-ship missiles the Russians can bring to bear means the fleet must not set patterns and work strenuously to break the targeting kill chain. Conceptually, the true problem for the Royal Navy lies in multi-domain concepts. In a constrained sea, in close proximity to the shore, or in sea space canalised by mines, the vulnerability to such fires increases exponentially. While sea power can deliver significant if non-decisive effects on an adversary from afar, if it is to affect the fight in other domains it must come closer. Much UK Commando Force thinking about ship-to-shore manoeuvre for raiding currently emphasises the exploitation of clutter in the littoral environment and the noise of civilian shipping. Ukraine demonstrates that once mines are in play during a major conflict, this clutter rapidly evaporates. Arguably a major conceptual gap has emerged in UK military thinking between the Royal Navy, with blue-water capabilities, and the rest of the force, with its emphasis on multi-domain integration. The conflict in Ukraine demonstrates that this is a conceptual gap to which the UK joint force needs an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the Russian missile systems are reliable and accurate. Cruise missiles can be intercepted, but the Russians routinely adapted flight routes for every mission and such missiles were observed to make up to 80 changes of course on their way to a target. It is not economical for any state to maintain coverage across the requisite frontage to be able to defend all targets with a sufficient density of air defences to guarantee defence against these systems. Russian ballistic missiles meanwhile – notably Iskander 9M723 – fly in a quasi-ballistic trajectory, launch six decoys that significantly alter their radar cross section and targetability, and retain a directional link to satellite-based navigation during the terminal phase, in addition to multiple redundant layers of navigation, that mean it is highly uneconomical to deploy interceptors to defeat these threats against all possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of attention given to Russia’s depleted stocks as regards these capabilities, given the rate of expenditure in Ukraine. This is an issue. Moreover, Russia cannot rapidly produce these missiles. It is estimated that it can fabricate around 100 Kalibr missiles per year, for example, and this may come at the expense of other munitions because many Russian munitions have common key modules that act as bottlenecks in the production of multiple systems. For Iskander 9M723, the Russians have been able to maintain a production line of six per month during the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, given that this arsenal has proven effective during the war, it can be assumed that its replenishment will be a priority for the Russian military. With China and Iran both relying heavily on similar complexes, and the proliferation of knowledge on how to achieve precision with these weapons, it must also be assumed that a convergence in systems design between these states will create economies of scale. Ironically the loss of military equipment may also encourage the Russian military to consolidate around fewer platforms, further increasing the capacity to prioritise resources. This lesson from the conflict regarding the threat that British forces must prepare for is pertinent to both the future as regards Russia and adversaries in other theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;warfighting-demands-significant-slack-capacity&quot;&gt;Warfighting Demands Significant Slack Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professionalism of the British military and the competence of units is high. Ukrainian troops have found British training invaluable. British weapons have also proven highly effective on the battlefield. High morale, skilled soldiering and significant corporate experience are of limited value in high-intensity warfare without ammunition, however. It is abundantly clear that the British military is woefully deficient in its stockpiles across domains. At the height of the fighting in Donbas, Russia was using more ammunition in two days than the entire British military has in stock. At Ukrainian rates of consumption, British stockpiles would potentially last a week. Of course, given that the UAF fielded more than 10 times as many operational artillery pieces as the British Army at the beginning of the conflict, it might take more than a week for the British Army to expend all its available ammunition. All this demonstrates, however, is that the British Army lacks the firepower to deliver the kind of blunting effect that the UAF achieved north of Kyiv. The oft-cited refrain of the UK Ministry of Defence that these deficiencies are not a problem because the UK fights alongside NATO allies would be more credible if the situation were much better among any of the UK’s European allies. It is not, except in Finland. Nor – as Ukrainian troops discovered to their surprise – are ammunition, charge bags and other essential consumables consistent between NATO artillery systems; there is an inadequate capacity to draw on one another’s stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deficiencies are not limited to tube artillery. Air defence – whether air- or sea-launched, or ground-based – is similarly entirely inadequate. Ukraine has practical experience using British MANPADS. They are highly effective. Although Ukraine lacks experience with Sky Sabre, Sea Viper, Meteor or Aster missiles, the effectiveness of these systems has been widely demonstrated. Nevertheless, a cursory study of procurement data and, for the land environment, an examination of the units available for air defence, shows that there is insufficient depth of munitions for any of these systems to be credible in high-intensity conflict. The survivability of Ukrainian units has demanded organic MANPADS to be available at all echelons and across all arms. Even with 60 dedicated Air Defence divisions, Ukraine has struggled to provide air defence to its manoeuvre forces, its critical national infrastructure and population centres. It has had to prioritise between them. It is worth briefly noting that there is a point at which munitions become overly complex, expensive and slow to produce so that the value of their increased performance comes with diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s survival initially depended on its own large stockpiles of Soviet-calibre munitions. Now, Ukraine is almost entirely dependent on NATO supplies. It is evident, however, that manufacturing capacity in many NATO states cannot meet the needs of its members in the event of a major conflict. Establishing production lines and assuring access to key materials such as explosive energetics takes time. Beyond merely holding sufficient stockpiles and spares, therefore, it is also abundantly clear that NATO countries – including the UK – must work out a value-for-money proposition that allows defence industry to maintain slack capacity to be ramped up in the event of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the British Army at present appears particularly strong is in its maintaining large training establishments disproportionate to the size of the force. The British Army maintains dedicated training schools for many of its military specialisms, which all require permanent staff and instructors. As demonstrated by the large-scale training to Ukrainian troops – carried out in parallel to the ongoing training of British forces – there is considerable slack capacity in this system. While this is a disproportionate cost on a small army in peacetime, its importance during any major conflict should not be underappreciated. Even assuming that British forces remain highly survivable, the rate of injury combined with the very small overall size of the British armed forces must see troop levels in frontline units decline in any major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK must therefore be able to train a second echelon. Ukraine mobilised its instructors from training establishments early in the conflict and this has contributed to difficulties in training additional forces. Russia has suffered even more from this problem because it delivers a significant proportion of training in-unit, which is not possible for units that are deployed. The British Army, therefore, must not squander its resilience in training capacity for the sake of efficiencies in the short term. Given that the RAF and Royal Navy have pushed their training establishments towards externally contracted solutions, the scalability and adaptability of these structures in wartime should be critically examined. The air war over Ukraine has demonstrated a rapid action–reaction cycle between offence and defence that has required significant adaptation of tactics and methods. For the Royal Navy and the RAF it is vital that simulators and externally contracted training solutions enable rapid adaptation of tactics and parameters in conflict, lest trainees become forced to learn obsolete tactics as a result of the training tools available rather than operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where slack capacity is invaluable is logistics and maintenance. As explained earlier, the UAF suffered from a high rate of turnover of key specialists during peacetime. This, however, proved invaluable in war. The British military currently lacks logistical capacity for its existing forces, let alone in a situation where more forces would need to be mobilised, or where the UK was seeking to sustain a multinational formation over which it had command. The critical point is less whether logistics units can be retained in the force, but rather whether better recruitment of logistics personnel in which they receive training that certifies them for civilian work can create a depth of reserves with associated liability to underpin the sustainment of both the existing force and additional mobilised units in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appropriately establish which platforms, whether because of their ubiquitous utility, or the inherent vulnerability of their tasks, demand mass. Some, such as pontoon bridging, mortars and UAS must be available at scale. A large number of troops are required to know how to use these tools. While there are minimum characteristics of such devices for them to perform their assigned task, the rate of consumption of these capabilities demands that they are ruthlessly simplified and rationalised so that they can be produced at scale and cheaply. Identifying where such consumables demand complexity and striving for standardisation of complex components, even if other elements of a system may have variations, is vital for achieving sufficient economies of scale. Again, there is a challenge for industry because this demands a great deal of work up front on design, but a very narrow margin of return on each manufactured object. Developing an appropriate value-for-money framework to have industrial capacity in such areas is similarly critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uas-and-cuas-must-be-available-across-all-branches-and-echelons&quot;&gt;UAS and CUAS Must Be Available Across All Branches and Echelons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson from the war is that UAS and CUAS must be available at all branches of the force. It is also evident that the UK and other NATO members have made mistakes in how they categorise UAS, generate the capability in the force and have governance for their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because NATO forces were early adopters of UAS, they have inherited the legacy of earlier generations of system. Early UAS were expensive, complex and often difficult to fly. Thus, specific units were established to be trained to use UAS and considerable investment was put into making the platforms better. Furthermore, because NATO forces have used UAS in an environment where even small numbers of casualties were politically significant, the emphasis has been skewed towards force protection. Since UAS were flying objects, they should be managed as such. In the UK this places permission for launching UAS under the responsibility of the Military Aviation Authority. On NATO exercises careful attention is paid to airspace deconfliction, so that helicopters and UAS, for example, do not find themselves in the same airspace and at risk of collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the evolution of the system of governance for UAS has proceeded logically and the structures around their use made sense when they were formulated, they have produced forces poorly suited for the operating environment, as observed in Ukraine and elsewhere. For pilots and other elements of the force, the expectation that UAS can be excluded from airspace is not viable. There will be many enemy UAS in the airspace. Training to manage this flight risk, therefore, is critical; training in an airspace without this hazard simply transfers risk from training to operations. In any case, given the need for troops to manage their electromagnetic signature and the impact of jamming, tactical echelons cannot guarantee getting information about their flight plans back to higher headquarters. Nevertheless, they will need eyes in the sky to retain situational awareness and to remain competitive. Requiring higher-echelon approval will make the employment of UAS uncompetitively slow. Requiring units to follow the procedures for aircraft in launching UAS also means that it is inordinately expensive to train UAS operators and this too becomes a constraint on their employment that means tactical units will not have enough pilots to keep up the required number of orbits to be competitive. For the UK, the implication is that UAS need to be classified as munitions rather than aircraft. At present, there are fewer administrative restrictions for the Royal Artillery to fire live 155-mm howitzer munitions over civilian roads than for them to fly a UAS over the same airspace to monitor what they are hitting. This must be changed, and it requires changes to policy, rather than simply expecting units to make the administrative burden of employing UAS manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS should be split into three broad categories for land forces. The first are rotary-type UAS able to manoeuvre close to the ground and in complex terrain, fielded across all manoeuvre formations for the purposes of route proving, reconnaissance, situational awareness, target acquisition, fire correction, and a wide range of other tasks. The second are fixed-wing UAS able to fly at medium altitude into operational depth and perform a single task, whether that be target acquisition or direct effects. Where multiple effects are required, this can be achieved by flying complexes of multiple UAS of this type. These should be used by units able to affect what they find, either reconnaissance units or artillery. Both the first and second category of UAS must be cheap and available in quantity. The third category comprises platforms carrying higher-echelon sensors. In Ukraine, this includes the TB-2, which was most useful as a maritime patrol platform. Platforms such as Watchkeeper and Protector fall into this category, best employed behind the FLOT and tasked with standoff sensing. It must be understood that employing these scarce assets depends on shaping, or else they will be rapidly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS were also found to be highly useful for air and naval forces in Ukraine. The ability to put sensors aloft for a protracted period without the need for a wrap to recover pilots or the burden of life support on the platform greatly extended the range at which maritime patrolling could be conducted and the risks that could be taken to gain situational awareness. The lack of loitering munitions able to target air-defence radars has been noted as a critical deficiency in the UAF that would have enabled much more aggressive air operations. Flying at around 50–100 ft and using terrain, Ukrainian pilots have been able to get within around 15–30 km of targets. Although Western aircraft are much more capable, Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) complexes remain highly lethal and would likely drive aircraft low. The Ukrainian Air Force found that the suppressive effect of HARMs (high-speed anti-radiation missiles) launched against Russian radar was short. Loitering munitions, by contrast, can remain in place and thereby create multiple dilemmas for SAM operators that could significantly increase the window within which aircraft could penetrate the Russian missile-engagement zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering UAS has proven no less important across all domains. For land forces, tactical sub-units must first have a means of detecting the presence of hostile UAS. Frontages must be covered by the means of defeating enemy UAS. Defeating UAS does not mean kinetically destroying them. It simply means denying the UAS the ability to achieve its mission. This could be done through the dazzling of sensors, or denial of navigation or control. The most efficient protection against UAS is EW and ensuring that electronic attack and electronic protection is available at all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the British Army has under-resourced this capability. Having two EW signal regiments and assigning their capability to operational tasks leaves most of the force unprotected. It is also important to note that electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) fratricide and C2 are both major challenges of widespread EW employment. The UAF have suffered from battalion staffs who are not sufficiently familiar with EW capabilities to synchronise and manage these tools. The Russian military has suffered even more from this problem. The availability of these troops on exercise and an understanding across units as to how to work with their EW support is vital, especially to avoid EW personnel knocking down friendly UAS, or UAS being launched when the EMS has not been shaped to enable their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, nevertheless, a need for kinetic defeat of some kinds of UAS, especially those penetrating operational depth to conduct target acquisition or loitering munitions. It is highly inefficient to have dedicated CUAS batteries in addition to air-defence batteries. Nevertheless, the munitions that air and missile defence batteries employ do not make CUAS missions economical. The answer must be the provision of intermediate munitions that can draw on the common air picture and guidance available to air-defence units but without the cost associated with munitions that must catch and defeat more complex targets. Point defence for critical sites is also an enduring requirement given the ability for long-range UAS to fly below the radar horizon on complex pre-programmed routes and thereby reach static targets in operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the RAF, the issue of CUAS is foremost one of integration. Given that loitering munitions targeting airfields, critical national infrastructure and other targets are exceedingly small and low flying, elevated sensors such as the AESA radar of the F-35 are ideal for detecting these targets. At the same time, the allocation of F-35s against such targets would be an entirely inappropriate use of the platform. The RAF therefore should either ensure that it has an economical means of supplying wide-area surveillance for tracking these threats or that it can offboard track data from combat air patrols to ground CUAS systems. Given that CUAS systems are often short ranged, these would not usually be priority recipients of such data, but ensuring access to that data will be important if the RAF wishes to avoid having assets drawn to suboptimal taskings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy also faces a CUAS challenge. UAS can be used on maritime patrolling to locate and monitor task forces in a more efficient manner than aircraft, while they are also less economical to engage. Conceptually this is not a novel threat. Of much greater concern is that as the Royal Navy seeks to project power into littoral environments, targets such as ship-to-shore connectors, fast attack boats and other vessels lacking air defence become highly vulnerable to armed UAVs. If the threat from anti-ship cruise missiles drives the main task force out to sea, the ability to operate in the littoral demands that fast attack craft have a means of detecting and countering UAS. The UAF have had considerable success against Russian fast attack craft with TB2. As countries such as Iran increase their investment in strike-capable UAVs, the ability for fast craft to operate within this threat is important beyond contests with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighting-for-the-right-to-precision&quot;&gt;Fighting for the Right to Precision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in the discussion of UAS above, the experience in Ukraine clarifies some of the critical effects of a contested EMS. Military discourse has – for several years – focused on the problem of EMS denial. Its denial was a major challenge for the UAF in 2014 and 2015. Measures were taken to make the force more resilient. The 2022 invasion therefore provides a better canvas to assess the impact of EW on militaries with appropriately resilient systems, and tactics, techniques and procedures. The effect is not EMS denial. Limitations of power, the tactical necessity to manage signatures and the consequences of EMS fratricide all mean that even forces with large EW capabilities cannot achieve blanket denial across large geographic areas for a sustained period. Denial can be achieved for a short period, or across a limited geographic area. Targeted denial can be delivered for a sustained period over a wide area. However, any kind of targeted denial of bands of the EMS can be evaded through altering frequencies or bearers. The result is that EMS interference and disruption is continual, but denial is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that contesting the EMS is less of a priority. Left uncontested, EW slows kill chains, increases confusion and, perhaps most importantly, degrades precision. The inability to determine accurate locations, let alone transmit timely data on target locations, or for munitions to achieve precise impacts against targets, all risk a force losing competitiveness against an opponent. Precision munitions not only inflict disproportionately more damage to the enemy but significantly reduce friendly vulnerabilities in the rear by shrinking the logistics footprint. Precision depends on a functioning kill chain, however. To assure that kill chain and to ensure that the munitions function properly, it is essential to actively contest the EMS. The layering of EW and kinetic attacks is vital to ensure that limited stocks of high-end weapons deliver the effects required. For example, an attempt to deliver precision effects against a target can be disrupted through interference with navigation frequencies so that precise target acquisition is denied. Here, the use of an EW baseline to identify the location of the source of this interference can enable non-precision fires to force the EW platform to displace, thereby opening a window in which the coordinates for an accurate precision strike can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Ukraine distributed EW capabilities across its groups of forces to provide organic support on key axes. It was rapidly discovered that there was insufficient training in units to properly employ these troops. For that reason, the UAF have formed a Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Command, enabling end-to-end management of capability development, electronic-payload preparation and delivery, as well as force protection and direction finding. Although a more centralised approach to the allocation of EW assets has been adopted, it remains necessary to have these capabilities available on all active fronts. The three basic tasks of EW troops are reconnaissance (direction finding), protection and electronic attack. It is necessary for EW troops to understand the fires plan and scheme of manoeuvre, and to have access to the synchronisation matrix of other arms in a force so that they can distribute capabilities to optimally support the other branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of contesting the EMS is pattern recognition in enemy cyber and electromagnetic activities, and the provision of advice on where there are seams in the enemy system that can be exploited. For example, wide-area jamming of navigational systems likely means that the enemy is not postured to conduct accurate fire missions. The lifting of this may indicate that UAS are about to be launched or that a fire mission is about to commence from a sector. However, this also means that friendly UAS committed to that sector can – for a time – accurately determine the location of the targets such as batteries that are fixed by virtue of their preparing to fire. Similarly, if enemy EW protection is strong, targeting the sources of emission will cause EW platforms to displace, revealing gaps in protection that can be exploited to deliver effects. All these effects, however, are limited in duration and require the necessary capabilities to all be available so that the window of opportunity can be exploited once it is identified. Understanding that EW may drive, as well as be a tool applied by, planning is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the British military EW is primarily available from the air and at sea, with limited numbers of specialists available for ground forces. Although Russian capabilities are quite effective in dividing air and ground components, with their air defences also drawing air forces into mission sets that will struggle to complement ground force activity, it is reasonable to assume that the British military could plan on using air assets for electronic attack. Naval EW support is harder to envisage because of the distance at which navies must operate from the land to remain survivable. Air-based electronic attack does not offer electronic protection, however. It is evident that there is a need for EW defence to be widely available for all manoeuvre elements. This includes deception. The British Army has had success in exercises through the emplacement of false command posts and other EW decoys. Russian and Ukrainian forces have also successfully employed these techniques. While units might be able to organically use such measures to improve their survivability, deception in the EMS also offers a valuable means of drawing out and then striking enemy prestige systems, especially those capable of delivering precision fires. Lining up the assets to take advantage of such a lure necessitates drawing on kinetic capabilities and their synchronisation of availability with EW capabilities. There is thus a need for planners – often at quite a junior level – to understand this game of cat and mouse and to be able to assign personnel to enable it. Attriting enemy precision capabilities or EW assets is critical in fighting for the right to precision. Whichever side can secure better access to the EMS is likely to retain significant tactical advantages that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity contesting the EMS requires regular emissions. Operations also create significant EMS signatures even among disciplined forces. A force that sees the EMS as something to be feared, with its sole aim being the limitation of its signature, is likely to introduce so much friction into its operations that it cedes initiative and advantage to the enemy through self-imposed constraints. Avoiding this means that a force exposes itself to greater risk of targeting. Mitigating that risk requires an understanding of the force’s own signature across the force – not just among the specialist EW community – and comfort on planning actions that prevent the enemy’s detections creating timely and reliable information for targeting. Understanding the EMS is also important because in an active contest, EW troops cannot guarantee sustained protection. The enemy may successfully bring about windows of opportunity where it has an advantage in the EMS and can therefore bring precision effects to bear. Understanding the indicators for these conditions among manoeuvre force commanders is important if they are to take the appropriate countermeasures to ensure the survivability of their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the importance of EW to air and maritime operations is significant, the war in Ukraine offers limited lessons for the RAF and Royal Navy in this context because Ukraine’s air and naval capabilities are too technologically inferior to Russia’s to provide a comparable problem set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disperse-dig-deep-or-move-fast&quot;&gt;Disperse, Dig Deep or Move Fast&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dispersion has been at the forefront of British Army discussion since 2015. In general, the importance of dispersion was vindicated by the data from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian infantry companies tend to disperse across a 3-km frontage. Greater concentration often decreases the survivability of units because it begins to make the use of precision munitions and the allocation of ISTAR assets economical in terms of the effect delivered per munition. One important consequence of dispersion is that it increases the tactical commander’s span of control. When combined with the multiple enablers necessary for a formation to be competitive, it is evident that a battalion commander in this conflict is often dealing with a comparable frontage to that traditionally occupied by a brigade, with similar effects in terms of their ability to maintain a physical presence among their troops. Since battalion staffs are not staffed like brigades – and would not be survivable if they were – there is considerable strain placed on company and battalion commanders. The British Army, which tends to put senior personnel within their rank into command positions, is in a reasonable position to handle this challenge. Nevertheless, developing C2 tools to allow beyond-line-of-sight C2 in sub-units is critical. Another challenge for dispersed forces, especially if they must echelon through one another, is identifying friend from foe. Ukrainian troops have tended to sacrifice camouflage for clear identification (using coloured bands) for their manoeuvre forces, relying on speed rather than concealment for survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although dispersion has proven critical to survivability against indirect fire, it also risks individual positions becoming isolated against enemy forces if they choose to concentrate. In concentrating, the enemy likely accepts higher rates of attrition, but that does not necessarily prevent ground from being taken. On both the attack and defence, the UAF have found that localised actions using reserves are critical to the reinforcement of sectors under pressure and thus to ground holding or building momentum. This ability for dispersed elements to echelon through one another to rapidly flank and defeat enemy concentrations has also been important in offensive operations. To do this, however, requires that the force concentrates, as survivability is afforded principally by mobility. If the period of concentration is sufficiently short and the target sufficiently mobile, it is difficult for the enemy to bring effective fires to bear on the right location. If these actions coincide with EW and other effects that extend the enemy’s kill chain, the window of opportunity for concentration at the appropriate point can be extended. Troops must remain mobile if under observation or they will come under highly effective fire. Even Ukrainian Special Operations Forces found that if they went static having penetrated the enemy, they risked being detected by UAS traversing the battlespace to the front and engaged with indirect fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of speed as the best means of protection is also evident in the employment of air-assault operations. Russia successfully penetrated deep inside Ukraine’s air defences precisely because it was able to open a window of opportunity in which the speed of insertion was critical. Ultimately Russia inserted too few personnel too deep for them to be reinforced. Ukraine has also employed aviation assault to cut ground lines of communication ahead of an advance. This too had to be done rapidly, exploiting gaps in enemy air defences. The prospect of pattern setting through second waves or resupply to these troops, however, is bleak, risking ambush for aviation en route or being caught on the ground by artillery. The feasible depth for such operations therefore is very limited. If under observation from UAS, troops ultimately have two options: having defeated the UAS they must either displace or move into hardened cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for hardened cover has been demonstrated throughout this conflict. Shell scrapes and other hasty procedures may improve the survivability of a unit against the opening salvo, but this salvo also risks fixing the unit in cover that is insufficiently protected. Once fixed, the enemy can transition to airburst or thermobaric munitions and thereby kill the target in place. In essence, troops should avoid making administrative stops in the indirect fire zone. If these are essential, shell scrapes may be justified. Mobility is the preferred means of improving survivability in this context. However, if troops are to remain in a position for any length of time, positions must be hardened and have overhead protection. Urban settlements, which often have cellars and other subterranean infrastructure, are optimal defensive points because these positions can be reinforced but begin as a sound basis for shelters. In the open, defensive positions should be dug underground. Both thermal sheeting and overhead cover are very important. Trenches in open ground are too easily targeted so they should be dug along treelines and other areas where there is overhead cover, thereby obscuring where in a trench there are entrances to hardened positions. Hardening positions – including entrances to trench structures – also requires the establishment of UAS detection and laser detection with countermeasures, such as smoke grenades. For any force required to hold vital ground, which is therefore restricted in its ability to displace and manoeuvre, excavation equipment should be available to rapidly emplace hardened defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is far from over. Although the Russian military is now on the defensive and withdrawing in multiple directions, there is not yet an indication that its hostile intent against Ukraine nor its efforts to undermine the West economically and politically have subsided. Although the massive sacrifices of the UAF have inflicted serious and widespread damage to the Russian capacity for offensive operations, Ukraine’s international partners need to fully appreciate the scale of the conflict, the adversary’s capabilities and the cause of their deficiencies to assess whether the Russians are effectively adapting when they try to recover from their recent setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has aimed to properly frame events in Ukraine by outlining Ukrainian decision-making, capabilities and intent, to clarify the scale of operations, and to distinguish between the consequences of Russia’s deficient planning and mistaken decisions compared with the structural and systemic weaknesses of its forces. The shortcomings of this report are that it does not deal in detail with Ukrainian losses nor does it assess the relative effectiveness of Ukraine’s tactics and performance. It also does not cover the second part of the conflict. For reasons of operational security, these issues will need to be discussed at a suitable point in the future. However, the authors have ensured that what is set out in this report’s conclusions is not contradicted by non-public data. It is hoped that this report has therefore provided a sound basis from which to identify critical lessons from the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer a summary of the many detailed and specific observations made in this report, it is worth instead summarising three critical points that policymakers should draw from the conflict if they are to ensure that their national security is built on sound foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated that consumption rates in high-intensity warfighting remain extraordinarily high and that resilience demands a capacity to build new units, produce spare parts and ammunition, and have sufficient stockpiles to remain competitive in the opening phases of fighting. At present, it is evident that NATO members other than the US are not in a strong position on these fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UAF were competitive against their adversaries not because of superior equipment in the early phases of the war but because they were adaptable – especially at the tactical level – and rapidly innovated new capabilities and concepts of employment to address specific areas of vulnerability where the Russians had achieved overmatch. For NATO countries, the critical question therefore is not whether a specific weapons system gives advantage, desirable though this is, but whether a country’s policies, permissions and industrial processes enable the rapid development, experimentation, refinement, acquisition at scale and employment of new systems and tactics. Do personnel at all levels have the permissions to contribute their expertise? Do tactical formations have the capability to procure and test equipment properly? Or is defence procurement a glacial process that is detached from the development of tactics, techniques and procedures? A state in the latter position is unlikely to adapt at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there has been abundant debate over whether the war proves the utility or obsolescence of various military systems: loitering munitions versus artillery, or ATGWs versus tanks. These debates are largely nugatory. Legacy systems, from T-64 tanks to BM-21 Grad MLRS have proven instrumental in Ukraine’s survival. That does not mean, however, that historical concepts of employment for these systems remain advisable. The key priority is to understand how new capabilities not only offer opportunity in and of themselves, but also enable and magnify the effects deliverable by legacy systems. Perhaps most important is to appreciate how the correct employment of exquisite capabilities can magnify the impact of cheap and crude equipment. It is evident that to exploit these opportunities, changes to orders of battle, C2 and novel employment may be necessary. The grouping of armour as a reserve, to be committed under propitious circumstances, for example, may make more sense than its distribution into the leading edge of offensive manoeuvre forces. It is also entirely plausible that the synergies between old and new capabilities shift the balance of requirements for the next generation of armoured platforms. But the enduring utility of these tools is not diminished by these changes. In modernising, therefore, forces need to examine how old and new form novel combinations of fighting systems, rather than treating modernisation as a process of deciding what should be procured and what should be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, for all the new capabilities on the battlefield, the war in Ukraine has been marked by the usual miscalculations, uncertainties and human failings. For Ukraine, victory is essential but can only be achieved with the ongoing support of its international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processes that it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is doctrinally and conceptually committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in multidomain integration (MDI)/Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO)-type capabilities will need to be incremental, compared with the huge Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) programme underway in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potentially useful model for the UK is the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) programme, which has achieved an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting a limited number of core platforms essential to one mission set. To achieve similar results, the MoD will need to carefully prioritise early MDI investment tranches towards seamlessly connecting the assets that will gain the most combat effectiveness from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting priority mission sets and using them as an analytical lens offers one way to identify the platforms and force elements where targeted investment in advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities would add the most tangible value in an operational context. The vignettes examined in this paper suggest that, in general, focusing on connecting key sensor assets such as F-35, E-7A and special operations forces teams, with long-range precision fires and integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capabilities such as guided multiple launch rocket systems and Type 45, appears likely to significantly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios such as suppression of enemy air defence systems/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) and IAMD, where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that a necessary aspect of prioritisation is choosing which assets across the joint force do not currently need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing data sharing and automated command-and-control solution. Over-ambition coupled with a lack of focus in such a complex and interdependent effort involving all the armed services and Strategic Command is a recipe for programme failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MINISTRY OF Defence (MoD) has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processesthat it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control (C2) processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I of this paper demonstrates the scope of the US Department of Defense (DoD)’s ambitions for creating a fully fledged JADO capacity across the entire joint force, via its new Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) architecture. It briefly explains how the US Army’s Project Convergence, the US Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) and the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and Project Overmatch programmes fit into the wider JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapters II to IV use vignettes to examine which elements of the UK’s future joint force might benefit most from JADC2-style connectivity across three specific mission sets. The conclusion explores the implied priorities and considerations for the MoD in pursuing its doctrinal aim of MDI through a capacity to conduct JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note at the start that the scale and scope of the Chinese military threat in the Indo-Pacific, which is driving JADO ambitions in the US DoD, is of a different nature and magnitude to that faced by European NATO members. This has several important implications for what JADO will mean for the UK and its European NATO partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unless European NATO members wish to simply purchase JADC2-compliant off-the-shelf platforms, network architectures and weapons systems from the US, they will have to incorporate JADC2 compliance and compatibility into their own existing and future platforms and C2 systems. If they do not, over time they will lose operational interoperability with the US as the latter moves to ever more tightly integrated and automated data sharing, targeting and C2 arrangements to facilitate JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, both off-the-shelf procurement of JADC2-compliant equipment and modernisation of hardware, software and communications suites on existing platforms will necessarily take place at a much slower pace in Europe than in the US due to limited funding and other competing priorities. For the UK, regenerating the platforms required to deliver a warfighting division, purchasing sufficient munitions and funding adequate training and exercise activity is already overstressing the budget available – especially in light of the refusal of the government to commit to any increases in Defence spending beyond maintaining 2% of GDP in the Budget Autumn Statement. As such, a comprehensive modernisation programme to make the whole UK Joint Force JADC2 compliant or otherwise capable of JADO-type activities is highly unlikely to be affordable for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Defence in the UK (and in other European NATO member states) has limited programmatic capacity to staff and manage large capital programmes simultaneously. In the UK in autumn 2022 a major increase in the Defence budget was promised by then Prime Minister Liz Truss as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. However, this increase was not confirmed in the Budget statement on 17 November. The Chancellor at the time acknowledged the need for increased defence spending, but deferred a decision until the Integrated Review had been amended in light of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation will, therefore, be critical to enable the UK to make efficient use of initial MDI investment tranches and to avoid decision paralysis in the face of the scale of the challenge. Chapters II, III and IV of this paper provide mission-centric vignettes to explore where the greatest potential combat effectiveness gains might be achieved by early investments to unlock JADO-style capabilities between specific UK platforms. The vignettes comprise: a campaign to suppress enemy air defence systems (SEAD) in Eastern Europe; the provision of IAMD to a forward-deployed UK force in the Middle East; and a contested freedom of navigation operation (FONOP). These were chosen as tasks that UK forces may be called upon to conduct, and also because they span the spectrum of conflict from high-intensity warfighting against a peer nation to potentially contested shows of presence during competition. The vignette approach was chosen to demonstrate that tying MDI/JADO questions to mission-focused output metrics can help policymakers move beyond necessary but broad and convoluted conceptual and doctrine discussions and towards identifying practical investment priorities. In addition to suggesting where significant value might be gained, even concise mission-focused vignettes can also shed light on where investment in cross-domain real-time data sharing is not likely to lead to transformative increases in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-joint-all-domain-operations&quot;&gt;What are Joint All-Domain Operations?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADO is a conceptual framework which has been created by the US DoD to describe its goal of integrated military operations across the domains of land, air, sea, space and the electromagnetic spectrum. The working US DoD definition of JADO is ‘actions by the joint force in multiple domains integrated in planning and synchronised in execution, at speed and scale needed to gain advantage and accomplish the mission’. The aim is to deliver integrated effects against an opponent across the phases of inter-state cooperation, competition and armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, JADO is not a programme as such, but rather a guiding vision of the sort of operations the US armed forces are to be capable of undertaking in a future conflict. The intent is that by operating in this way, US forces will be able to create multiple simultaneous dilemmas for an enemy which cannot all be solved, and which compel hostile troops and commanders to make difficult or impossible trade-offs. A critical component of this vision is the simplification and acceleration of current decision-making processes, moving from planning cycles measured in days to hours or even minutes. In some respects, this represents a simple desire to speed up the Observe Orient Decide Act loops which govern military decision-making at all levels. This has led some to suggest that there is little to differentiate JADO from earlier operational concepts.10 As a top-down set of guiding principles, JADO is also very similar to the vision laid out by the UK’s own MDI concept note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the US has a practical strategy which the DoD is pursuing to enable – called JADC2. The working definition of JADC2 in the DoD is ‘the warfighting capability to sense, make sense, and act at all levels and phases of war, across all functional areas, domains, and with partners, to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance’. In more simple terms, JADC2 is a strategy which aims to connect all the sensors across the US Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps into a single and highly automated network. Its primary function is to provide a new kind of joint decision-making and disseminating tool for commanders to enable them to plan, orchestrate and execute JADO. This vision of JADC2 is, to put it mildly, an extremely complex and ambitious undertaking. However, a unified decision-making tool is not the limit of the ambitions for JADC2 across the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, JADC2 is also a way to develop a highly automated ‘any-sensor, any-shooter’ network that will process and disseminate data between all the platforms within a joint force, and automatically allocate fire missions and other non-kinetic tasks to the optimal unit or platform at any given time. In this vision, the key output of JADC2 would be a version of a combat cloud or an Internet of Things, which has been described as an application enabled by modern digital communications networks to interface with connected sensors and shooters in a similar fashion to the Uber ride-hailing app. In this vision, a ‘shooter’ does not know or need to know where the target track that they have been automatically allocated was gathered from, and nor would the original source of that target data need to know which ‘shooters’ were available to prosecute the target when they sent the request for fires. Instead, the system would optimise the matching of detected target tracks and weapons solutions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would represent a major shift from network-centric warfare to data-centric warfare. It requires a C2 system that can be platform-agnostic and capable of taking data from any sensor and supplying firing and targeting solutions to any available effector systems. It is critical to understand what this entails; most networked systems are designed to receive data from a specific sensor. For example, an air defence system is designed to receive target acquisition and tracking data from its own bespoke radars, whose data is formatted for that system’s fire control and battle management systems. The concept of JADC2 holds that the overarching battle management system and C2 network supporting multidomain operations should be able to rapidly receive, interpret, weight and assign actions in response to any data it receives and distribute it in a format that is usable by any other asset or weapons system connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-where-is-jado-now&quot;&gt;I. Where is JADO Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of JADO is being explored through a series of experiments led by the US services that are designed to examine how it can be realised under the aegis of JADC2. JADC2 is both an approach and a procurement effort; it requires the US services to establish common data standards so that information can be shared seamlessly between them, as well as the procurement of new communications architectures that allow that information to be shared. However, it also requires a change in C2 culture with greater thought given to the synchronised, optimal allocation of resources, force positioning and decision-making. There are already several technical efforts underway within each service, which sit underneath the overall JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Air Force is essentially the lead service on JADC2, with its primary efforts in this regard being channelled into its ABMS programme. ABMS is being developed in line with the Joint Warfighting Concept that will shape the doctrines created by the US services to define their role in JADO. JADC2 is the system that will enable US commanders to connect any sensor system to any effector. It is notionally a joint effort, although US Air Force officials have stressed that the technologies developed by the Army and Navy are designed to dovetail into the ABMS. In addition to integrating C2 efforts from across the US armed forces, JADC2 is also expected to integrate the US nuclear arsenal into the same network of sensors and effectors, although details on that effort are classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABMS itself was originally intended to replace the E-3 AWACS before it was expanded to become a programme that will procure equipment and software, as well as implement new C2 and data policies. The US Air Force’s experiments within ABMS have demonstrated the ability to transmit data from Army and Navy radars to F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning fighter aircraft; it has been used in defence of US space assets and to engage cruise missiles. The US Air Force has also demonstrated the use of a KC-46 Pegasus tanker aircraft as a communications node that was used to relay information from fourth- to fifth-generation aircraft. The KC-46 application of the ABMS programme has become the first material step, taking it from a purely experimental standing to an in-service capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army has launched Project Convergence, which is seeking to test the ability of national-level intelligence assets to coordinate and direct long-range fires with the assistance of AI. Project Convergence was established by the US Army Futures Command to test a single use case; a sensor-to-shooter link to enhance and test the ability of in-service systems to pass data between themselves. Its first iteration in 2020 proved that sensor-to-shooter time could be reduced from an average of 14 minutes to a few seconds. However, it also revealed that many of the systems in service with the US armed forces could not pass data to each other in compatible forms, leading to the realisation that the network that facilitates the flow of information is the centre of gravity as far as JADO is concerned. Project Convergence has since expanded to seven use cases and the establishment of the Joint Systems Integration Lab, which is charged with practising the movement of data between systems. Its work has been deemed vital to realising JADC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army’s technical contribution in the land domain is the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), which has experimented with 4G and 5G and hybrid cloud architectures to support mounted and dismounted operations, including the movement of large data sets with low latency. The US Army has also moved its integrated air and missile defence (IADS) Battle Command System (IBCS) into low-rate initial production. The system enables assets from multiple domains to be integrated into a single air defence network. When provided with a suitable relay and datalink translation node (in this case an ‘EMC2’ network bridge on a U-2), IBCS has been used to coordinate an engagement between F-35 and the Army Field Artillery Tactical Data System. In the land domain at least, experimentation with JADO has made clear that passing data between systems in a usable form is the primary challenge to be overcome and emphasises that this is the centre of gravity around which the success of the project will turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy is focused on Project Overmatch, a secretive effort about which little is known except for the intention to introduce an AI-enabled network architecture and facilitate distributed operations through manned–unmanned teaming. Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made under the NIFC-CA programme, which was developed as an advanced version of what was initially termed ‘cooperative engagement capability’ (CEC) whereby aircraft and surface ships could share target track information and guide each other’s weapons in flight. In its fully operational state the NIFC-CA architecture currently connects surface combatant ships equipped with Aegis Baseline 9 or a later version of the powerful Aegis air and missile defence system to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fast jets, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye AWACS aircraft of the carrier air group (CAG). Its primary function is to create a fused recognised air picture which is fed by all the radars on ships and in the air back to the operations centre on the aircraft carrier itself. This allows a huge increase in the effective resolution and coverage of the whole fleet’s radar coverage. It is especially effective at increasing detection ranges against small or stealthy targets such as advanced anti-ship missiles and fifth-generation fighter aircraft due to the ability to exploit the dispersed positions of the various contributing radar sensors for multi-static triangulation. As a secondary function, NIFC-CA was designed to enable assets in the task group to designate targets for and guide each other’s missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which the US Navy developed NIFC-CA is potentially highly instructive for the UK and other Allied nations looking to invest in similar capabilities in their own forces. Rather than making NIFC-CA into a major acquisition programme of record, the US Navy inserted common network connectivity and data standards into the requirements within the major acquisition/modernisation programmes for specific platforms that were judged most critical for a specific mission – in this case counter-air and missile defence. The mission hinged most critically on the forward sensors on the E-2C/D Hawkeye AWACS, the later cancelled Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and the SM-3 and SM-6 ‘shooters’ used by the Aegis combat system onboard US guided missile destroyers and cruisers. Therefore, these systems were prioritised in terms of investment in unlocking shared situational awareness and third-party targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since NIFC-CA was not a major acquisition platform for a poorly defined future connectivity goal, but rather a budgetarily small programme with the power to insert requirements into pre-existing equipment acquisition or modernisation programmes, it did not fall foul of any of a series of major budget cuts over the decade of primary development. Even when JLENS was cancelled, this did not endanger NIFC-CA as a whole. Furthermore, once the cooperative engagement capabilities and combined situational awareness enabled by NIFC-CA in its early form had been demonstrated, it was easier to both justify the funding for and articulate the requirements needed to integrate other platforms, such as F-35C. Consequently, NIFC-CA is currently delivering real-time shared situational awareness and cooperative engagement capabilities between US Navy vessels, aircraft and weapons far in excess of what has yet been achieved by more ambitious but less well-defined US Air Force programmes, such as ABMS. The more ambitious Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made by the US Navy with an incremental and mission-specific approach to unlocking increased combat effectiveness through cross-domain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with this sort of operational capability, tangible UK progress in making JADO-style capabilities a practical reality remains largely experimental. The MoD has specified a guiding ambition to develop the capability to conduct MDI in doctrine and strategy publications such as JCN 1/20, and the Integrated Operating Concept. However, most practical investment is currently being undertaken by experimental establishments within each service. One example is the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), which has taken a somewhat different approach from the US to the problem of joint force connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking to build connectivity through feeds and common applications to link platforms or services, the RCO has focused initially on creating a common data environment called Nexus. The idea behind Nexus is to provide a virtual environment which acts as a Defence-owned portal where other platforms, networks, sensors and applications can both request and feed in data, according to published integration standards. Nexus concentrates on metadata so that applications and platforms alike can see what and who is doing what and where (at varying classifications) across the network, without having to off-board data wholesale as a standard procedure. This keeps baseline bandwidth demands low, and ensures that when a connected user specifically requests detailed data, there is sufficient capacity to pass it through the network along paths which have already been defined using the basic metadata. The RCO conducted flight trials with a hand-carried Nexus portal and a virtual communications hub application called Raven in 2021 on a Voyager tanker, and demonstrated the ability to pull data from satellite communications and a range of other sources into a common operating picture in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the creation of such a virtual data indexing and exchange medium is a significant step, it remains to be seen if it can be scaled up to meet the requirements of the whole force. It also does not by itself solve the problem of how to generate sufficiently low-latency real-time connectivity between joint force assets to enable third-party weapons cueing or guidance. Therefore, Nexus does not fill the same niche for the UK as NIFC-CA does for the US Navy or ABMS does for the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-vignette-1-sead-in-eastern-europe&quot;&gt;II. Vignette 1: SEAD in Eastern Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, the once-theoretical spectre of a confrontation with Russian conventional forces in Eastern Europe has gone from the highest-risk/lowest-likelihood scenario at the top of NATO threat estimates to an unavoidable priority for future force planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of the Russian aerospace forces’ fixed-wing and rotary assets during the initial two months of the war was notably poor – Russia failed to destroy the Ukrainian air force, or exert significant influence on the battles on the ground. This was, in large part, due to its inability to conduct effective suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD). Ukraine’s continued ability to operate its various mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems forced Russian aircraft to operate at very low altitude to take advantage of radar-horizon limitations and terrain for cover, but this left them vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) fire. The majority of combat air losses on both sides during the first phase of the war have been caused by SAMs and MANPADS – with the latter posing a threat precisely because the presence of the former forces both sides to operate at very low level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should prompt renewed prioritisation of SEAD/DEAD capability for NATO air forces, since at present only the US Air Force can field credible answers to the sorts of mobile SAM tactics used by both sides in Ukraine. Therefore, the first vignette in this paper examines where targeted investment in JADO-style capabilities within the UK’s joint force might add greatest benefit during a SEAD/DEAD operation against Russian forces in a geographically constrained flashpoint confrontation in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and its allies would face three primary operational challenges during any SEAD/DEAD operation. The first would be detecting, identifying, mapping and then targeting the key long-range sensors, SAM systems and command nodes which provide the overall coordination for an IADS and allow it to threaten assets at long ranges. The second would be detecting, suppressing and then destroying the more numerous medium- and short-range mobile SAM batteries and systems which move with enemy ground forces. 45 The third challenge would be achieving sufficient effect against these two categories of targets (and their crews) to enable air superiority to be achieved, without taking unacceptable attrition in airframes or running out of critical munitions in the process. Any enemy air superiority assets would also need to be tracked and engaged if they attempted to engage UK or allied SEAD/DEAD assets, although NATO proficiency in the offensive/defensive counter-air mission set is already sufficient to provide a level of overmatch against any likely aerial adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time pressure is also likely to be a major factor, since the UK and most other Western nations depend heavily on the firepower and ISR delivered by air forces to allow their relatively small ground and maritime forces to achieve success against enemies able to field greater mass and firepower. Therefore, there would be heavy time pressure to achieve SEAD/DEAD results so that close air support and airborne ISR aircraft could be used freely within the area of operations. To work out where the greatest benefits might be gained from investment to allow joint, cooperative real-time engagements in such an operation, it is first necessary to identify the critical sensor and shooter platforms across the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the potentially critical assets within the UK’s joint force are relatively easy to identify for any SEAD/DEAD campaign. For the first challenge of detecting, identifying and mapping the key long-range sensors and C2 nodes, standoff signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT) and radar-surveillance platforms – most obviously the RC-135W Airseeker and the new E-7A Wedgetail – would be critical in the run-up to any operation. However, once combat starts these aircraft would need to operate from beyond the reach of the long-range S-400 or S-300V4 SAM systems within a Russian IADS. This is because of their large signature, need to operate at high altitudes where long-range SAMs are most effective, and limited self-protection or evasion capabilities. Furthermore, many SIGINT and ELINT intercepts require significant processing and analysis before they can be fully exploited to help map an IADS and so incorporating an asset such as RC-135W into a JADC2-style real-time data sharing and targeting architecture might add only relatively marginal value compared to current processes. E-7A Wedgetail, by contrast, will be taking over from the E-3D Sentry as a key airborne battlespace management and C2 node within whatever new architectures are designed for combat air and joint forces use. As such, despite its likely position several hundred kilometres from the front lines during combat operations, it will remain a key communications relay and C2 node during active SEAD/DEAD operations, especially as a connective node between the air component and other elements of the force. Therefore, the E-7A is an example of where investing in radical improvements in the ability to exchange data in real time with forward sensors and long-range fires assets across all domains is likely to result in significant efficiency gains for the whole force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once combat operations begin, the most critical sensor nodes will be those that can detect, identify and track high-value enemy sensors, SAMs and C2 nodes from inside the threat range they pose. Obvious candidates within the UK’s current order of battle include the F-35B Lightning II and infiltrated special operations forces (SOF) teams. Both have the potential capability to get relatively close to threat systems covertly and can carry sophisticated sensors. The F-35’s sensor suite is particularly well suited to both hunting key nodes within an IADS and enabling more routine SEAD/DEAD efforts against mobile SAM systems in an ongoing campaign. This is because its sensors and software allow even a single aircraft to rapidly triangulate the position of a hostile SAM radar in flight more effectively than a whole flight of previous-generation ‘Wild Weasel’ F-16CJs with dedicated SEAD sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the F-35 and SOF teams have limited capabilities for direct kinetic attacks due to their relatively small numbers within the overall UK force structure, the need to husband limited munitions carriage capacity for key targets, and the need to avoid detection while deep in hostile territory. In other words, there is a significant mismatch between the ISTAR capabilities and the level of lethality which these assets can project into a hostile IADS when working alone. Therefore, in a SEAD/DEAD context, both F-35B and infiltrated SOF teams are likely to represent key UK sources of real-time situational awareness about key IADS targets, and also force elements whose lethality and survivability would be greatly increased by the ability to call in long-range firepower from other assets in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess which potential ‘shooters’ would bring the most benefit from JADC2-style connectivity with these forward sensors in a SEAD/DEAD operation, the first question is which platforms are likely to be able to deploy standoff weapons from sufficient range? Shooters must be able to threaten targets without unacceptable risk to sustainably leverage the situational awareness generated by the F-35Bs, SOF teams or other forward sensors for increased lethality. Within the UK joint force there are limited potential options, which makes prioritisation for investments in JADO-style cooperative engagement capabilities easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear candidate would be the guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) which currently provide the British Army’s long-range artillery firepower. GMLRS can fire rockets out to 70 km with submunition warheads that make each one lethal against lightly armoured vehicles across a spread pattern on impact. If the British Army’s GMLRS were equipped with such munitions, they would potentially be ideal for use against SAM batteries in the field. Furthermore, the UK has signalled its intention to procure the precision strike missile (PrSM) for its GMLRS launchers, which would provide a long-range precision strike capability of 499 km. PrSM has also been tested with a multi-mode seeker that would enable the missile to track and engage radars, which is expected to be included in the Spiral 1 upgrade of the missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other options could include Royal Navy surface or submerged vessels firing Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAMs), or RAF Typhoons with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. However, due to their high cost and consequently limited inventory capacity, large cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow and TLAMs are likely to be reserved for high-value targets during a SEAD/DEAD mission such as long-range target acquisition radars, command centres and command vehicles. Therefore, they might benefit from real-time target data from penetrating ISTAR assets during the initial phases of any campaign, but would be less critical during the later DEAD phases, where the primary targets are likely to be mobile medium- and short-range SAM batteries. Against these targets, less costly and shorter-ranged munitions would be needed for viable mass of fires to be achieved. Therefore, likely candidates would be RAF Typhoons with SPEAR 3 (if it were purchased for the Typhoon Force), conventional Army AS90 or other 155-mm artillery batteries within range of SAM systems near the enemy front lines, and possibly AH-64E Apache gunships equipped with Hellfire or JAGM missiles. The point is that potential priorities for investment if SEAD/DEAD is chosen as a policy-relevant mission can be identified relatively easily by assessing where lethality would be most significantly increased through tactical real-time sensor-shooter integration across domains, compared to more traditional joint operations integrated at the operational or campaign level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from increased lethality, another aspect to potentially consider is which platforms would benefit most in terms of survivability from JADC2-style connectivity during a SEAD/DEAD operation. This is more difficult to define than lethality enhancement, since the survivability of any given platform is based more on contextual factors, including the risk appetite of both the attacking and defending force and the tactics each employ. However, a basic starting point would be to note that in a SEAD/DEAD operation the assets that might see increased survivability from JADC2-style connectivity are those which will be expected to operate within the missile engagement zone (MEZ) of enemy SAM systems (and possibly aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the competition phase, before kinetic warfare begins, ISTAR assets conducting mapping of the IADS and airspace monitoring may well be operating within the MEZ of long-range enemy SAMs. The same may be true of tanker aircraft conducting aerial refuelling for both ISTAR and combat air patrol orbits close to adversary territory. If they perceive a direct conflict as inevitable or desirable, the adversary might attempt to open hostilities by conducting long-range SAM launches at these high-value enablers while they are within range. Given the lack of agility and limited self-defence options available to airliner-derived platforms, the ability to receive the earliest possible warning of hostile missile launches from any available sensor is critical to increasing their odds of survival. The Voyager MRTT in particular will be a key part of any air operation due to the critical nature of aerial refuelling capabilities for all fast jet and most ISTAR operations. Once shooting starts, tanker orbits will be pushed significantly further back from potential threats, which will keep them safer but means that each fuel offload grants less time on-mission for combat air assets. The centrality of the Voyager MRTT to almost all significant RAF air operations, and its consequent ubiquitous presence in the battlespace, is why it has already been chosen for airborne trials of the new Nexus common data platform and Raven communications node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the survivability of key assets such as the Voyager MRTT, the most valuable airborne connection in a SEAD context is likely to be the F-35, since its electro-optical/infra-red surveillance suite can detect, classify and track missile and rocket launchers from hundreds of kilometres away in any direction around the aircraft. Ground-based long-range missile defence radars such as the MPQ-65 and AN/TPY-2 used by allied Patriot and THAAD batteries could also provide advance warning to airborne assets of long-range SAM launches due to their high flight apexes and consequent similarity to ballistic missiles. As will be seen in Vignette 2, these missile defence assets are also likely to benefit in situational awareness terms from being linked via such enablers to forward air assets for their own mission sets. Orbital missile launch detection and tracking capabilities would also be a potentially useful source of launch warning information if they were able to process the signatures of long-range SAMs and relay warnings in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette is not intended to imply that SEAD/DEAD is necessarily one of the critical missions against which initial UK investments in enabling practical JADO-style capability should be judged. Rather, it is intended to illustrate that considering how the existing and projected force structure would need to be employed against a notional mission set can guide analysis towards the assets that would likely give the greatest return on investment in improved connectivity across domains. In the case of the SEAD/DEAD mission, even a superficial examination of the force structure suggests that necessarily limited early investment could deliver significant increases in combat effectiveness without needing to achieve whole force transformation along the lines of American JADO efforts. The UK has a small number of assets that could be tasked with covertly penetrating defended areas, and which can carry potent sensors, but have limited organic firepower. It also has a limited range of assets that can deploy long-range firepower capabilities but which are reliant on off-board targeting information to hit elusive targets from a safe distance in a high-intensity scenario. Therefore, connecting these two sets of capabilities would be a natural place to invest in delivering an initial real-time cross-domain connectivity programme for the UK if SEAD/DEAD is assessed as an important mission set. The survivability of critical enabler nodes, such as tankers, which lack organic self-defence and evasion capabilities, could also potentially be significantly enhanced by being connected to force elements able to provide early warning of enemy long-range missile launches. They would likely also be present in theatre anyway due to their key roles. Therefore, they might also make logical sense as a priority for early upgrades to enhance their real-time connectivity with other force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, a brief examination of the critical assets for a notional SEAD/DEAD campaign suggests that if this mission were chosen as a key planning task, the MoD could usefully prioritise initial MDI/JADO-style cross-domain connectivity investment towards penetrating assets, long-range precision fires capabilities and large enabler aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-vignette-2-integrated-air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;III. Vignette 2: Integrated Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette examines a notional scenario where the UK is required to provide an element of an IAMD capability for a European force that has been forward deployed to the Middle East in an uncertain political climate with an evolving insurgency led by a regional actor. Across current and future deployments of this type, the threat to British and allied troops deployed on the ground is likely to be increasingly significant and sophisticated. In any political environment where tolerance of casualty risk is limited, having a credible IAMD solution for forward deployed forces is likely to be increasingly essential for operational viability. However, providing IAMD to forward deployed forces is a complex challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat environment has developed considerably over the past decade due to the democratisation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and the proliferation of larger remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) that can be used as munitions in their own right and also to rapidly cue in long-range fires with precision. Whereas past forces would have to contend only with an opponent’s air force and incoming rocket artillery, a European force deployed anywhere in the world today will likely face threats from armed sUAS and RPAS, as were encountered by Russian forces deployed to Khmeimim Airbase in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex missile threats have also proliferated. Houthi attacks against critical national infrastructure in Saudi Arabia have often come from different directions simultaneously, and been conducted across a wide geographical area, forcing the available Saudi air defences to be dispersed, thus diminishing their efficacy. Iran itself has demonstrated the ability to conduct attacks against American bases; the 2020 ballistic missile strikes against the Al Asad air base in western Iraq are the most prominent demonstrations of this capability. Sixteen ballistic missiles were fired at the base in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, 11 of them – each carrying a 1,000-lb warhead – hit the base, causing extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the future threat environment for UK forces deployed to the region is likely to be characterised by a mix of massed sUAS and loitering munitions, as well as higher-end cruise and ballistic missiles, used together in such a way as to increase the complexity of the IAMD challenge. Given this, more traditional siloed deployments of air and missile defence systems, such as Phalanx-B to guard Camp Victory in Iraq from rockets, artillery and mortar rounds, or Patriot PAC-3 batteries to reduce the threat to Eastern European allies from short-range ballistic missiles in 2022, are likely to be insufficient. No one system can efficiently or effectively cover the threat spectrum adequately. It follows that enhancing the ability of UK systems to connect to a common recognised air picture, and the ability to link together and cross-cue different sensors and effectors for layered effects, is likely to offer the best means to increase combat effectiveness for IAMD coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge in any IAMD scenario remains the detection and tracking of incoming threats, and so protecting a UK deployment in the Middle East against the sorts of potential threats outlined would require the provision of persistent omni-directional air situational awareness across all the likely incoming threat altitudes, ranges and speed bands. This is an extremely difficult requirement to meet within the UK’s current order of battle, but in principle it requires the ability to combine the outputs from as many of the available ground-, maritime- and air-based radars and other sensors as possible into a common situational awareness picture. Obvious candidates within the existing force structure include the Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam radar that forms a core part of the British Army’s Sky Sabre medium-range air defence system, the Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar mounted on the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail AWACS aircraft, the Sampson radar on any Type 45 destroyers operating in littoral waters nearby, and the smaller radars carried by counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) solutions such as Drone Dome or ORCUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the IAMD threat encompasses such a broad range of target sizes, speeds and ranges means that operational effectiveness is likely to be disproportionately improved if systems optimised to cover different threat bands and altitudes can be linked together to create a combined situational awareness picture in real time. For threats coming in at close to ground level, sUAS and loitering munitions are likely to be a particularly challenging problem set, since these systems often have a low radar cross section and very small electro-optical/infra-red signature, and can travel extremely slowly. These properties, together with clutter from uneven ground, vegetation and buildings, make them particularly difficult to track and engage with traditional air defence radar systems. The UK has a limited ability to counter these threats in the form of its Drone Dome system procured from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in 2018, which is designed to target sUAS using soft-kill effects. Additionally, the RAF has developed the ORCUS C-UAS system with Leonardo, which also employs soft-kill effects to defeat sUAS, although only four are expected to be delivered. Complex threats such as cruise missiles and RPAS can be countered by the Army’s Sky Sabre, which provides a detection range of 120 km and an engagement range of 25 km. It is claimed to be capable of hitting a target the size of a tennis ball travelling at the speed of sound. Importantly, Sky Sabre is already capable of sharing data with Royal Navy and RAF assets in theatre via the Link 16 tactical datalink. Building on these foundations, an obvious priority candidate for investment in automated, real-time cross-domain connectivity in an IAMD context would be the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail. It not only carries a high-resolution MESA radar that can contribute a look-down view of low-flying targets at far greater ranges than land-based radars but is also the standard Link 16 network gateway that would already be expected to interface between airborne and ground-based IAMD assets to build a common recognised air picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ‘shooters’, the list of UK systems that can be considered for integration is currently quite short but in need of expansion to properly cover the wide range of potential threats. They include: Drone Dome and ORCUS for C-UAS effects; Starstreak and its vehicle-mounted high-velocity missile variant for short-range air defence; Sky Sabre for medium-range air defence; and the Royal Navy’s ship-borne CAMM short-range and Aster 15 and 30 medium-/long-range missiles as part of the Type 45 Destroyer’s Sea Viper air defence system. The ability to integrate high-end land-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 or THAAD fielded by allies and partner nations would significantly increase potential effectiveness from both a ‘shooter’ and a ‘sensor’ point of view. In addition, any IAMD C2 network must incorporate high-fidelity data about friendly and civilian air operations in the airspace in question. Without an accurate, common and comprehensive recognised air picture it is very challenging to manage IAMD engagements safely and effectively. This requirement for deconfliction is another reason why E-7A, as the single best ‘source of truth’ within the air component about the aerial battlespace, would be a high-gain priority for any efforts to enhance IAMD effectiveness through JADC2-style connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK already has a somewhat developed capability that can be used to integrate sensors and effectors from multiple domains into a single IAMD. The SkyKeeper system from Lockheed Martin UK has been developed and refined to meet the Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) capability requirement. A contract for its upgrade and service life extension was awarded in January 2022, which will improve the capabilities of the truck-mounted system and extend its service life to 2029. SkyKeeper can integrate C-UAS, counter-rocket and mortar (C-RAM) and conventional air defence assets into a single recognised air picture for the operators of each system. In the future, the system is claimed to have significant growth potential for use as a battlespace C2 network, which would allow incoming threats to be identified and then allocated to the most suitable of a potentially wide variety of shooters such as C-RAM, Sky Sabre or C-UAS effectors. The current SkyKeeper version unveiled in 2019 can receive data feeds from most sensors and transmit target tracking data using common data links such as Link 16 from air assets and Link 11 from naval assets. Lockheed Martin UK also claims that it can integrate the wide-area sense and detect sights of Ajax into the system, and can also integrate data from the F-35 Lightning II into the network if required. This would be a significant expansion of the current LEAPP requirement set, but illustrates that there are already networking solutions in place with UK forces that could potentially be used as building blocks for increasing the real-time integration of sensors and potentially shooters from across the joint force in an IAMD context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vital importance of a high-fidelity common recognised air picture, and the multifaceted nature of the potential threats ranging from sUAS to salvoes of ballistic and cruise missiles that might face UK forces deployed in the Middle East make the priorities clear for early investments in JADC2-style cross-domain connectivity if IAMD is identified as a priority mission set for the future joint force. Significant increases in effectiveness and operational flexibility could be expected if existing network and C2 capabilities such as LEAPP that currently focus on connecting systems in a single domain could be expanded or linked to allow routine real-time data exchange with airborne sensor nodes such as the E-7A Wedgetail, F-35 and Crowsnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, enabling full-spectrum IAMD coverage in a theatre as complex as the Middle East with capabilities currently in the UK inventory is unlikely to be possible. Seamless data sharing with allied ground-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 and THAAD, as well as E-3A/F/G AWACS, would be necessary for deconfliction purposes but would also be a high priority due to the potential improvements to mutual sensor and shooter coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-vignette-3-contested-freedom-of-navigation-operations&quot;&gt;IV. Vignette 3: Contested Freedom of Navigation Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy conducted a potentially opposed FONOP in June 2021 when HMS Defender sailed close to the Russian-occupied territory of Crimea in the Black Sea. During this operation, Defender was harassed by Russian attack aircraft and gunboats and locked up by shore-based radar systems. The Royal Navy has also conducted FONOPs in the South China Sea close to artificial reefs built by the People’s Liberation Army Navy to create illegal bastions of territory claims and area-denial system coverage. The US Navy frequently conducts FONOPs, and they are seen by many NATO nations as a crucial politico-military tool to assert rights of access to the global commons against aggressive attempts to change borders or interdict sea lines of communication (SLOCs) by force. With Russia committed to long-term confrontation with the West following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and China continuing its policies of attempting to change the status quo in both the South and East China seas, FONOPs are likely to remain an important tool for Western policymakers in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the continuing development and proliferation of highly capable anti-ship missiles, submarines and more novel potential threats, such as swarms of sUAS and loitering munitions, will all ensure that even major surface action groups will face considerable danger during contested FONOPs at times of heightened tension. The US Navy’s NIFC-CA architecture was developed precisely to enhance the survivability and lethality of naval task forces against high-end threats in a warfighting context by greatly improving the situational awareness and weapon effectiveness of the destroyers and aircraft against incoming threats. At a less ambitious scale, it is worth examining where similar automated C2 and data-sharing functions between platforms would add most value for the UK in the context of FONOPs to defend access to contested SLOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to the preparatory stages of a SEAD/DEAD campaign, the first challenge in reducing the risk to a planned FONOP would be to try to detect, identify and then track the locations of the primary anti-ship threats in the contested maritime area. These will generally comprise coastal defence cruise missiles and the ground-based and possibly airborne radars that provide them with target information, as well as, potentially, missile-carrying small-boat swarms, sUAS and in the case of larger powers possibly aircraft and submarines. The nature of the threat in each geographic context will determine the scope and feasibility of mitigation and (if necessary) defence or deterrence measures to ensure a FONOP can be conducted successfully. However, in all cases a thorough understanding of enemy force dispositions and capabilities will be essential. Without such an understanding it is impossible to adequately protect a vessel conducting FONOPs during periods of high tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge will be to ensure that the ship or task group is provided with as many credible defence and/or retaliatory options as possible to deter hostile action by denial and/or punishment respectively. The third will be ensuring adequate connectivity between the ship conducting the FONOP, any supporting assets, and higher command levels who can provide rapid guidance on changing political circumstances, rules of engagement or orders throughout the period of vulnerability. This may be very difficult given that an adversary is likely to make liberal use of electronic warfare to interfere with the sensors and communications of the ship and any supporting elements, as such actions signal displeasure and create windows of kinetic vulnerability without the escalation implications of kinetic force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence collection assets being used to ascertain the localised threat nature and location of key adversary capabilities are unlikely to be a major priority for integration if they will be conducting their missions well in advance of the FONOP in question. By its nature, the side conducting a FONOP generally has a significant degree of control over the timing of the passage through the contested waterway. Therefore, increasing the ability to pull information off ISR assets in real time through greatly increased connectivity is unlikely to provide more than a marginal increase in the efficiency of such preparatory activity compared to current practices. On the other hand, on the day of the FONOP itself, as the ship(s) in question sail towards the contested area, the ability to provide real-time connectivity between supporting ISR assets and the surface action group could add significant value. ISR assets such as P-8 Poseidon or RC-135W Rivet Joint may be able to detect any changes in the movement patterns and electronic emissions of adversary ground-based and maritime threat systems which could signal intent to conduct an attack. The faster this information can be relayed to the task group, the more effective any defensive and/or retaliatory measures can be made, and the greater the deterrent effect on an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the FONOP transit itself, the ship’s onboard radar systems would provide the primary source of defensive situational awareness, alongside the sensors of any embarked aviation – such as the MX15 sensor ball and SeaSpray AESA radar mounted on the Royal Navy’s Wildcat HMA.2 helicopters. The outputs from these sensors are theoretically already supposed to be well integrated via the Merlin Mk2 Crowsnest system which (if present) would also provide another source of wide area radar surveillance to spot incoming threats. These systems should, on their own, provide excellent radar coverage of both the aerial and surface threat picture during the hours of the transit itself. However, the interception of incoming missile threats would still rely on the radar picture from the ship’s own sensors, which restricts the range at which such engagements can be conducted against sea-skimming threats. Sufficiently high-resolution/low-latency data sharing between airborne sensors (including F-35B, if in theatre) and the Type 45 to enable third-party missile guidance for Aster 30 could enable the ship to engage incoming threats beyond the radar horizon of its own sensor coverage. Against supersonic or hypersonic threats this would significantly enhance the odds of a successful defensive engagement and might also allow the launcher to be targeted rapidly with naval gunfire or TLAMs to prevent further hostile launches. This is precisely what NIFC-CA allows for the US Navy. However, the Royal Navy lacks a long-range missile capability comparable to the US SM-3 and SM-6 series, and aside from the F-35B’s radar, the available airborne radars, which include Crowsnest and SeaSpray, may lack the technical capacity to provide missile guidance even if furnished with a sufficiently advanced ability to share data with both ship and missile in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, NIFC-CA or JADC2-style connectivity with airborne assets with high-end sensors offers the opportunity to enhance the guidance quality and effective range against sea-skimming or surface threats for the missiles carried by Royal Navy ships during a contested FONOP. This would not only offer the potential for lower risk against a given threat but also lower the political escalation risk during an actual engagement – since the number of munitions fired can prove the symbolic difference between a skirmish and a major confrontation at the geopolitical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of both the precision and need for any retaliatory strikes against shore-based or maritime attackers. From an escalation-control point of view, the ability to intercept incoming threats is preferable to needing to go after the enemy launch site/vehicle, if possible, but where the latter is desirable or necessary, it is better to use fewer missiles to accomplish the task. Therefore, there are potential efficiencies to be gained from investment in JADC2-style connectivity for the likely force package the UK might deploy for a contested FONOP. However, they are marginal compared to the potentially dramatic combat effectiveness gains identified if initial investment were focused on priority areas in the context of an IAMD or SEAD/DEAD mission set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is intended to illustrate that a mission-facing approach could help UK policymakers identify the most relevant and potentially easiest capabilities across the force to concentrate on integrating in the early tranches of necessarily sequential MDI/JADO-type transformation efforts. Currently, there is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK’s Joint Concept Note 1/20 makes clear that the MoD is committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm. However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions within stretched budgets and limited programme management capacity. Even ambitious transformation projects have to start somewhere, and well-targeted initial investments in integrating a limited number of key capabilities across the domains could deliver significant enhancements to whole-force combat effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy’s approach, with its NIFC-CA programme model, offers a potentially useful model for the UK to pursue JADC2-type connectivity across the force in more manageable and easily defined blocks. Rather than attempting root-and-branch change across the whole force simultaneously, the US Navy created an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting the core platforms essential to a given mission, and then building on the progress made once initial investment had yielded real-world results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the lessons are clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MoD, and Strategic Command as the integrating authority, need to prioritise early investment in real-time data sharing and combined C2 capabilities between the platforms and systems likely to deliver the greatest improvement in combat effectiveness for the force in specific key mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mission-specific analysis can be used to identify which force elements would make most sense to concentrate early investment tranches on, by providing a framework through which to examine if and where advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities between specific platforms would add the most tangible value in an operational context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, even a superficial analysis of kinetic mission sets such as the ones provided in this paper suggests that enhanced data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities linking key sensor assets, such as F-35, E-7A and SOF teams, with long-range precision fires and IAMD capabilities like GMLRS and Type 45, could greatly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that analysis of some mission sets may suggest that for many force elements the potential combat effectiveness gains from currently deliverable JADC2-style integration would offer significantly less in terms of return on investment in the near term than other options for that funding. This should not be seen as a bad thing since careful prioritisation is undoubtedly necessary across defence, given limited budgets, personnel headroom and programme management capacity. Therefore, choosing which assets across the joint force do not yet need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing network and automated C2 solution is perhaps just as important as identifying what assets ought to be connected with all possible speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of defence may eventually include something akin to the vision laid out in Joint Concept Note 1/20 and other top-level strategy documents; a completely connected joint force, fully integrated in real-time not only across all domains but also across government departments. However, there is a huge gulf between this ambition and the current state of the joint force. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in MDI/JADO-type capabilities will need to be incremental and focus on seamlessly connecting and integrating the assets that will see the greatest combat effectiveness increase from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the existing commentary focuses on how or when a Chinese attack on Taiwan could occur, but there is little discussion of the nonmilitary consequences of such a scenario for China and the world. This brief explores the implications of a Chinese attack on Taiwan based on reasonable, albeit speculative, assumptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When considered more holistically, the implications of an attack on Taiwan would be grim for Beijing, even if Chinese forces “successfully” capture the island. China would probably be diplomatically and economically isolated from key advanced economies, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping would have to tread a narrow path to avoid dire consequences for China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a whole. This analysis helps clarify what could be at stake for the world and reaffirms the importance of deterring Beijing from contemplating such an attack on Taiwan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation has increased over the past several years that Beijing is accelerating plans for an invasion of Taiwan. While there is little doubt that Beijing seeks to fully annex Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) one day, questions remain about the timing and methods that China might use to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons Beijing might undertake a military campaign against Taiwan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-standing territorial and national identity aspirations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi’s own personal ambitions and sense of legacy&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to perceived provocations from Taiwan, specifically a formal declaration of de jure and permanent independence from the PRC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of commentary and analysis has explored how the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might undertake a military campaign to annex Taiwan, a critical — yet underemphasized — question remains regarding the types and magnitudes of costs Beijing would pay for such actions. Nearly all discussions of China’s potential invasion of Taiwan ignore the economic and diplomatic costs of such a move, make unrealistic assumptions about what China could achieve (including technological and economic gains), or otherwise minimize the challenges that China would face if an invasion of Taiwan were successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below analysis is an initial exploration into some of these potential nonmilitary consequences for China. It does not seek to prove or disprove Beijing’s true intentions and timelines toward Taiwan, nor does it claim to know how Chinese leader Xi Jinping is assessing the risks and rewards of an invasion. Rather, it highlights costs that Beijing would likely face if it successfully invaded Taiwan, based on plausible assumptions of how China, Taiwan, the United States, the international community, and global investors would react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this brief looks at three distinct phases of a possible Chinese attack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period leading up to an attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period between the initial phase of an attack and the end of major conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period following a successful PLA invasion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the analysis focused on how a successful invasion by the PLA would impact China’s economic, diplomatic, and political circumstances, this brief intentionally remains nonspecific about the type of attack or invasion it might launch. At a minimum, this analysis assumes that it would include the direct use of lethal force by the PLA’s air, land, and sea capabilities to defeat and subdue Taiwan’s military and to depose the civilian political leadership on the island. It also assumes that the U.S. military would intervene, but its actions would be limited and ultimately unsuccessful in halting the Chinese invasion. And it further assumes that no nuclear weapons would be used. Such assumptions are not predictions of actual outcomes, but rather necessary simplifications adopted so this brief can focus on the issue of costs associated with a relatively smooth path to military victory for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conflict in and around Taiwan would entail major economic, financial, diplomatic, and reputational costs for Beijing, both directly and indirectly. Even if China “won” in the military domain and thus accrued additional regional military benefits, its economic and diplomatic position would likely be substantially worse off. Simply put, China would have gained Taiwan but sacrificed its larger ambition of becoming a global and comprehensive superpower. This is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even absent U.S. intervention, any conflict initiated by the PRC would have immediate and dramatically negative effects on China’s ability to import and export goods, on its domestic financial markets, on business sentiment, and on the exchange rate of its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s costs would significantly increase if the U.S. military intervenes meaningfully, even if delayed by several days or even weeks. The blunt geographic truth for China is that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would occur directly off the shore of its most economically important and populated provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even supposing Chinese troops could overcome Taiwan’s defenses, they would then occupy an island inhabited by a hostile population with a shattered local economy, including its semiconductor sector, while China itself would face severe economic and diplomatic repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is necessarily speculative and requires many assumptions. Perhaps the most important ones are that Taiwan offers at least some resistance and that U.S. leadership can effectively organize some semblance of an anti-China coalition among advanced economies. In addition, forecasting the effects of major discontinuities requires considerations for societies’ potential reactions under stress rather than under normal conditions. History suggests that major crises can trigger or inspire rapid shifts in consensuses based on reevaluations of national, political, or cultural priorities that can supersede economic logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has compelling strategic reasons for deterring China from attacking Taiwan. This exercise is not intended to suggest that losing Taiwan to the PRC would be a positive outcome for Washington. Rather, the key point is that even in this dire scenario, China would still likely be the country that most suffers diplomatically and economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the effects of such a conflict with any precision is extremely difficult, in part because there is no analogous historical case upon which to draw. The world’s two largest economies might be at war with each other. Global supply chains are far more integrated now than before World War II — or even World War I, which ended the first era of globalization. The disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war are not a good proxy because Russia’s economy is far smaller than China’s, the conflict and Western response have not stopped key Russian exports, and Western powers are not directly engaged in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this brief concludes that the implications of a PRC attack on Taiwan would be cataclysmic for China, the United States, and the world. Simply put, any attempt to achieve “reunification” through force is likely to fracture global geopolitics and economies far beyond today’s “partial decoupling” trends and preclude any long-term “national rejuvenation” for China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-one-pending-chinese-attack-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;Phase One: Pending Chinese Attack on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing’s preparation for an attack on Taiwan would likely alert foreign governments and investors to the impending conflict, but the signals would not be entirely clear.&lt;/strong&gt; These actions would include measures to mobilize its forces, insulate its economy and financial system, ready its population, and prepare the diplomatic space for a conflict that Chinese leaders might assume will entail enormous costs for the Chinese Communist Party. While Beijing would strive to obscure its intentions in some scenarios, the required military, economic, and political preparations would be at least partially detectable to the international community. Such observable signals might include stockpiling of munitions, a freeze on military demobilizations, and an intensification of bellicose propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States would warn of China’s military intentions, hoping to rally allies and deter Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of such warnings would depend on the strength of U.S. leadership, the state of Washington’s diplomatic relations with third countries, and the credibility of U.S. intelligence. Beijing would likely proceed toward an attack in a manner that clouds or frustrates U.S. efforts to assign blame to China, such as by claiming that Taiwan provoked Beijing by crossing red lines or even that Taiwan’s military attacked Chinese territory or a Chinese asset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some U.S. allies and partners would join Washington in warning of Beijing’s intentions.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. allies — most likely including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom — would coordinate planning for steps that could deter China. However, even among allies, the bar for assuming an attack on Taiwan is imminent would be high. The intensity of allied responses would thus largely depend on the credibility of U.S. intelligence, the strength of U.S. government statements and actions, and Taiwan’s own demonstrations that it took the threat seriously. This would include military preparations and the threat — or perhaps use of — economic sanctions on China to deter military action. On the other hand, the United States and its allies would be wary of acting too drastically, which might escalate the crisis, including by triggering responses from Beijing, precluding off-ramps for China, or damaging the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other governments would be slow to respond.&lt;/strong&gt; Some might believe Beijing’s actions are mere saber rattling, as some Western governments did ahead of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine despite clear warnings from Washington. Some leaders would hesitate because they want to avoid taking disruptive emergency measures not yet seen as justified by their uncertain or oblivious polities. Other leaders would try to avoid committing themselves to either side in a conflict. Behind the scenes, Beijing would likely be using all its diplomatic channels to pressure third countries to remain on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International firms and investors would need to make important early decisions in an environment of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial markets would be the first to respond, with strong downward pressure on Chinese assets and the renminbi’s exchange rate. Many foreign investors would assume the crisis will harm business sentiment in China and, even if resolved, at least incrementally slow the economy. Direct investors would be slower to respond than portfolio investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Beijing’s true intentions, including the scope and scale of a possible attack, would not yet be entirely clear, many firms operating in China, Taiwan, or the broader region would adopt a “wait and see” approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Global headquarters would be looking to in-country staff for information and updates — though even staff in China and Taiwan would be struggling to interpret events. Because the costs of shifting supply chains or divesting from China could be substantial, many companies would delay making drastic decisions in the hope that a crisis never materializes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Beijing would likely impose emergency economic measures such as even stronger capital controls, selling Chinese assets abroad, stockpiling emergency supplies, suspending critical exports, rationing key imported goods, or restricting foreign travel. Early resistance by Taiwan’s military would compel China to take economically disruptive measures to protect its military assets in its eastern provinces and population centers from air or missile attacks from Taiwan or U.S. forces. Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict-1&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Beijing would likely impose emergency economic measures such as even stronger capital controls, selling Chinese assets abroad, stockpiling emergency supplies, suspending critical exports, rationing key imported goods, or restricting foreign travel.

Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two most important determinants of the war’s intensity and duration — and thus economic impact — would be the degree to which Taiwan resists and whether the United States is engaged militarily. Neither condition is certain, but both are probable.&lt;/strong&gt; To assume Taiwan would not resist, one must have a bleak view of Taiwan’s civil society. To assume the United States would not engage militarily, one needs to at least assume that Beijing’s military operations would be extremely effective and quick while also not targeting U.S. forces in the region. Beijing would have an official pretense for any military action, but unless Taiwan took reckless actions, such as declaring independence, it is unlikely that leaders in Washington and other Western capitals would find them convincing. In the early days of the conflict, global firms and investors would assume that U.S. military intervention and general escalation pose high risks, absent extremely unlikely statements by Washington that explicitly disavow Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimated that a year-long war between the United States and China would reduce China’s GDP by 25–35 percent and U.S. GDP by 5–10 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; However, the study did not examine the implications for global supply chains or estimate effects from sanctions, infrastructure damage, or cyberattacks. Given China’s subsequent economic growth, the economic damage ratios now are probably somewhat more in China’s favor, but the overall costs (considering all factors) could be considerably higher. A war would have an immediate impact on the three Chinese provinces nearest to Taiwan — Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang — which together account for 22 percent of China’s GDP and 17 percent of its population. Damage would not be limited to coastal provinces, however, because interior provinces are part of an intricate network of domestic supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most maritime trade and air freight within range of the war zone would be disrupted.&lt;/strong&gt; International shipping and logistics firms would try to reroute traffic around the conflict zone and would avoid entering ports in or near Taiwan. Shipping insurance premiums would surge. Chinese ports accounted for roughly 40 percent of shipping volume among the world’s 100 largest ports in 2020; six of China’s largest ports are near Taiwan and would likely be directly impacted by a Chinese attack. Nearly half of the global container fleet and five-sixths of the largest ships transit through the Taiwan Strait, most of which would be rerouted. A complete disruption of China’s trade would reduce global trade in added value by $2.6 trillion, or 3 percent of world GDP — and this figure, based on peacetime valuations of global supply chains, only captures the first-order effect on trade. In the short term, however, existing inventories of goods or supplies would mitigate the effect on global firms and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even in the early stages of a conflict, multinational corporations (MNCs) would face significant pressure to begin unwinding operations in China.&lt;/strong&gt; Managers’ foremost consideration in the hours and days after a Chinese attack would be employee safety, and many foreign MNCs would seek to exfiltrate foreign passport holders. Companies operating near the eastern coastline would likely halt operations even if they encounter no supply chain disruptions. MNCs exporting from or sourcing parts from China might try to shift production or inputs to other locations, although this would be expensive, and there would be competition from other firms doing the same thing with limited alternative capacity. MNCs operating in China for access to its domestic market would be the least likely to try to pull out because direct investments, such as factories and retail locations, are difficult to liquidate in a crisis. Such firms might conclude that even in dire scenarios, the Chinese market would still be enormous — at least after the conflict. However, they would fear the appropriation of their assets by Chinese authorities and the reputational costs in other markets if they remain in a China hostile to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would face significant capital-flight pressures and a massive selloff of Chinese assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese citizens, companies, and investors — as well as foreign firms — would seek to jump the queue and avoid having their international capital ensnared by Western sanctions. While China already maintains stringent capital controls, the central bank would likely issue additional unofficial “window guidance” to China’s major state banks, directing them to halt outgoing transfers. Unofficial and illicit channels exist for motivated parties, but they are relatively narrow owing to regulators’ efforts to diminish their effectiveness. In addition to selling off onshore Chinese stocks, many investors would also dump their holdings of Chinese stocks listed on overseas exchanges. The exchange rate of the onshore and offshore renminbi would plunge, necessitating heavy interventions by the central bank to arrest the slide. As during other periods of heightened risk, global investors would flee to assets perceived as safe, especially U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would impose at least some economic sanctions on China in any scenario. But if U.S. forces were engaged, the sanctions would be severe, and Washington would probably coordinate with — or even compel — major allies to join such sanctions. U.S. politicians and the public would likely not tolerate continued direct trade or investment with China if U.S. forces suffer even a low number of casualties fighting Chinese forces, although indirect economic linkages would remain. Financial sanctions on major Chinese banks would have a devastating economic impact, including for U.S. firms and consumers. The expected costs of such actions suggest they would only be used in full once a conflict breaks out and the United States becomes militarily involved. If U.S. personnel start dying and the public sees bloody images of China’s attack on Taiwan, Western sentiment would likely turn swiftly and decidedly against China. A Western sanctions coalition could coalesce quickly, as happened after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in part because of lessons learned and coordination mechanisms established in response to the sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major U.S. allies, even if not engaged militarily, would likely support Washington’s efforts to punish China economically.&lt;/strong&gt; While China’s market and supply chains are critical for many international firms, overall, the United States is even more important as a consumer market, investment destination, and financial market. The European Union’s — even just Germany’s — economic and financial ties to the United States are far deeper than those with China. Perhaps more importantly, Europe’s political, cultural, and security ties with the United States would present European leaders with a binary choice they might otherwise hope to avoid. Washington would exert significant pressure on its allies to join its sanctions efforts; if the United States were engaged militarily, those requests might become ultimatums, which Western leaders would need to weigh against the expectation that China’s economic growth and liberalization has peaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s economy would be shattered and cut off from most trade, losing the ability to export the majority of the world’s semiconductors and microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Much of its infrastructure would be damaged during combat or from sabotage by local actors, and Taiwan’s ports would be well within the combat zone. This would halt Taiwan’s microchip exports, of which roughly 60 percent go to China as inputs into electronics that are then exported to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global supply chains for consumer electronics would be particularly damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s exports of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, have accounted for nearly 40 percent of the global total since 2014. Because of shipping disruptions and possible suspensions of trade with advanced economies, China’s domestically produced microchips would also probably not be exported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-three-the-world-after&quot;&gt;Phase Three: The World After&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if the PLA were successful in seizing and holding Taiwan, Beijing would still face enormous economic, diplomatic, and political challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; The only plausible pathway to mitigating these challenges would be for China’s military operations in Taiwan to be quick (to shorten the window Washington has to respond) and clean (to minimize fighting and damage, including civilian casualties in Taiwan), as well as avoid triggering an international backlash, particularly from advanced economies. More realistically, an attack on Taiwan — even a successful one — would result in some level of U.S. military involvement, a direct response from Taiwan’s military and people, and international outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/83OVRSJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would occupy a new but significantly damaged and isolated “special administrative region,” which would face a severe economic contraction and be expensive to subdue, police, and rebuild.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese military and security forces would contend with a restive population, even assuming local resistance is not prolonged. Reconstruction costs would be high and absorb much of Taiwan’s remaining fiscal capacity. The public on the mainland might object to spending Chinese resources to occupy and rebuild Taiwan, given that the island is nominally more developed than most of the mainland and its people are considered hostile. Chinese leaders probably would have planned for the post-war environment based on optimistic assumptions, in part because experts and planners would have been reluctant to suggest that Taiwan’s population is sincerely opposed to “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), would be severely damaged and unable to resume production of cutting-edge microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming TSMC is not affected during combat or destroyed by saboteurs, its seizure by Chinese forces would only give China a snapshot of its technology in an otherwise fast-moving global industry. Beijing would also need to coopt or compel TSMC’s employees to continue working for the firm. Furthermore, TSMC relies on foreign inputs, including for chip designs and chip-manufacturing equipment. The governments of key advanced economies would likely impose export controls on those inputs, even if this means losing access to leading-edge fabrication capabilities. Foreign firms reliant on TSMC for production would no longer consider its Taiwan facilities reliable even after reconstruction. However, TSMC’s overseas assets might continue operating, assisted by TSMC staff who escape Taiwan and perhaps after being acquired by other firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economic and diplomatic relations with advanced economies would significantly deteriorate.&lt;/strong&gt; Western sanctions and export controls on China would probably persist for months or perhaps years after a conflict, even if U.S. military forces are defeated. In Washington, Tokyo, and some European capitals, there would be little to no political appetite to resume normal economic relations with a belligerent China. Both sides would suffer, but China would suffer more. In 2021, the Group of Seven (G7) economies — a reasonable proxy for the U.S. alliance network — had a collective GDP 65 percent larger than China’s, even at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates favorable to China, and directly absorbed 41 percent of China’s exports. China has little prospect of eliminating its key external economic dependences — technology, commodities, and the U.S. dollar — in the medium term. After a conflict, China would largely maintain access to commodities from emerging markets and developing countries. However, China would struggle to overcome technology export controls and sanctions based on the global dollar network, upon which its remaining trading partners would also remain reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s periphery would become increasingly hostile.&lt;/strong&gt; Any Chinese attack on Taiwan would provoke significant anxiety among China’s neighbors. If the United States were perceived to have intervened aggressively, even if ultimately unsuccessfully, U.S. credibility as a security partner would largely remain intact, if somewhat bruised. On the other hand, if U.S. intervention were seen as halfhearted, countries might put less stock in Washington as a security guarantor, and some might develop their own capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter China. Either way, China’s aggression would likely galvanize a surge in military spending and pronounced bandwagoning against Beijing by Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India, but also Vietnam and the Philippines. Most other emerging markets or developing countries, however, would probably try to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annexing Taiwan would likely give Xi Jinping an initial bump in public approval, but the mounting costs of “state-building” would erode overall domestic confidence in the CCP.&lt;/strong&gt; Propaganda organs would seek to contain criticisms of the invasion, but the proximity of the conflict would make it difficult to obscure the likely military casualties. Such efforts would be further undermined by the vast network of overseas Chinese nationals with unfettered access to information on the invasion’s course and consequences. Beijing would probably feel forced to use terror and repression to subdue pockets of resistance (real or imagined) in Taiwan, and reports of such atrocities would inevitably filter through to the mainland population. An invasion of Taiwan and the associated occupation phase would also distract Beijing from addressing China’s pressing domestic agenda and economic headwinds. To take control of the narrative and tamp down on any domestic unrest (again, real or imagined), the CCP would feel compelled to flex all its coercive muscles, and thus China would enter a new and more protracted phase of its police state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economy would be on a wartime footing, and its hope of achieving high-income status would be severely diminished.&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing would struggle with China’s overburdened fiscal system and state-sector debts amid capital outflows — and could face a systemic financial crisis. MNCs would expect Western sanctions and export controls to persist, while also forecasting far less potential from the Chinese market, and thus would generally maintain lower exposure to China. Foreign MNCs operating in China would fear asset nationalization, and even MNCs who want to remain or reinvest in China would face a Chinese government that scrutinizes companies representing “hostile” Western countries. China’s outbound investments and lending would be constrained. Amid draconian capital controls and a loss of foreign investor confidence in China’s trajectory and reforms, the renminbi would not substantially internationalize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this initial exercise is to sketch out some of the likely responses to a Chinese attack on Taiwan and the associated political, economic, diplomatic, and strategic consequences Beijing would face. The conclusion reached is stark: China would court disaster if it launched an invasion across the Taiwan Strait. Even under optimistic assumptions about the combat performance of the PLA and the relatively muted or constrained military responses by Taiwan and the United States, there is a precariously narrow path Xi Jinping would need to follow to emerge from the gambit unscathed. Once more realistic assumptions begin to be layered in, the picture becomes dire for the CCP and China as a whole. Equally as significant, any Chinese attack on Taiwan would also have an extraordinary impact on the global economy, especially for U.S. partners and allies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strategic challenge for the United States remains to ensure Beijing never actively contemplates an attack on Taiwan. While it is likely Beijing broadly understands the costs associated with such an action, the increasing isolation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the concomitant rise in groupthink in Beijing’s policymaking circles means that one cannot assume Chinese leaders will continue to conduct a sound cost-benefit analysis. It thus remains critical to find direct and clear ways to communicate to Xi Jinping the costs he would face for undertaking any attack on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing lessons from the Cold War, the author distills six principles to guide crisis management among U.S. policymakers navigating an increasingly crisis-prone U.S.-China relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With U.S.-China relations already headed toward a more belligerent rivalry, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 was bound to cause heartburn in Beijing. China responded with an elaborate show of force around the island: shooting missiles over Taiwan and into Japanese exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters, firing rocket artillery into the Taiwan Strait, declaring a ring of maritime exclusion zones around Taiwan, and surging over 200 military aircraft and 50 ships into Taiwanese airspace and waters. Many now refer to the event as the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet compared to previous confrontations around Taiwan, the United States this time failed to play much of its appointed part. The Biden administration mostly stayed aloof, condemning China’s actions but not dispatching U.S. forces to confront China directly. If there was a crisis, it was largely one-sided, with China posturing and slinging missiles and the United States watching from the sidelines. The resulting U.S. coolness left China thrashing in a performative display that produced condemnations from Japan, Australia, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This U.S. strategy might have been quietly brilliant, inviting China to stamp and roar and drive many countries further into a balancing coalition. The administration may have decided that a belligerent response would have been inappropriate given that it had been the action of a U.S. official that had sparked the crisis. But it remains to be seen if restraint was the right choice. The crisis arguably furnished China with an ability to set a new threshold for military intimidation in the strait and beyond. Some observers worried that U.S. moderation would encourage China to escalate its coercion in the future, a concern fueled in part by commentary in China that seemed to brag about the absence of a more forceful U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing seems clear: an era of persistent confrontations in U.S.-China relations has arrived. The escalating rivalry is, unavoidably, a long-term campaign for predominance in which each side makes investments, builds forces, and develops technologies to gain competitive advantage — as symbolized by the set of potent sanctions Washington recently imposed on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. But it will also take a more perilous form as a series of discrete collisions that demand careful statecraft. Not all these events will be on the scale of the Taiwan Strait Crisis. Some could involve sudden disclosures of Chinese troops at foreign bases, large-scale cyber intrusions of U.S. systems, or proxy conflicts that emerge out of disputes over third parties. But some of the confrontations could be even violent and dangerous, such as outright Chinese military action against islands in the Taiwan Strait, an all-out blockade of Taiwan itself, or even seeming preparations for an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dealing with the Taiwan issue and larger U.S.-China relations, the United States should keep firmly in mind that these are primarily political issues, which demand diplomatic solutions. Attending to the statecraft of the larger relationship is the essential route to avoiding and mitigating crises. But in intense rivalries, crises are likely to emerge despite such efforts. In such an era of persistent clashes, the United States will need criteria to guide its responses — a handbook for managing a series of skirmishes within the larger rivalry. This essay offers an initial down payment on such thinking by drawing lessons from the most recent U.S. experience with managing crises within a larger rivalry: the Cold War. It uses those lessons to suggest six principles for managing confrontations with China. The resulting approach is to get the fundamentals of a systemic competition right and then strike a difficult but necessary balance: respond rapidly and decisively in support of a few vital commitments while resisting the urge to endow lesser clashes with undue significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagnosing-a-rivalry-lessons-and-insights-from-the-cold-war&quot;&gt;DIAGNOSING A RIVALRY: LESSONS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE COLD WAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some critical ways, the emerging rivalry is unlike the Cold War. China is more of an aggrieved rising power determined to recapture its place in world politics than the Soviet Union was at the beginning of the Cold War. China’s economic and technological power is vastly greater, and it may turn out to be more pugnacious in crises — more self-righteous, more overconfident (partly out of a faith in its ability to control crises and limited wars in a mechanistic way), more anxious to use crises to teach punitive lessons, and less willing to negotiate or even communicate during a skirmish if it believes doing so would signal weakness. But there are enough areas of similarity between these two crisis-prone rivalries that the Cold War experience can offer relevant lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-one-major-rivalries-are-systemic-contests&quot;&gt;LESSON ONE: MAJOR RIVALRIES ARE SYSTEMIC CONTESTS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Cold War suggests that principles for managing confrontations should be grounded in a conception of the rivalry’s essential character. If it is a primarily military or imperial contest for strategic points, then the resolution of individual standoffs at such sites may be decisive. The Cold War, however, was not such a contest — it was a competition between systems and their domestic and international bases of power. The dominant center of gravity was domestic economic, social, technological, and cultural dynamism. Societal dynamism is the foundational measure of systemic competitiveness, and the Soviet system failed that test in the Cold War — it could not generate sufficient growth, innovation, or legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War systemic competition played out in international terms as well, in the struggle for leadership of international markets, institutions, and processes — the ability to set the rules of the international system and become the hub of predominant networks of finance, trade, people, and ideas. In such a systemic contest, power emerges from the production of legitimacy, economic power, and cultural influence that radiates outward and reshapes world politics. Any systemic contest is a struggle to be the dominant gravitational force in world politics. Here, too, the United States prevailed: the primary international institutions became increasingly oriented toward the United States and other leading democracies, which came to embody far greater magnetic power due to their economic dynamism, cultural attraction, military power, and broadly accepted legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the same themes can be detected in the current rivalry between the United States and China. It is certainly a contest of domestic systems: China’s economic dynamism, and the innovation and technological sophistication it has spawned, underlies its ability to challenge the United States. In global terms, China is seeking to gain influence in the United Nations and other international forums, weaken U.S.-led institutions, and build a set of Sino-centric ones, from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China is seeking dominance, and the ability to use others’ dependencies for leverage, in several high-technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory of the nature of rivalries carries important lessons for the management of confrontations. Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash. In a contest powerfully influenced by attractive power and perceived legitimacy, over-aggressive and belligerent states will tend to undermine their long-term strategic position. They will also do so for classic reasons of strategic overreach: great powers that pour resources into distant clashes of secondary importance end up exhausting themselves and becoming strategically insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Cold War also suggests that gravitational effects and network power depend partly on perception and on others’ confidence in an actor’s power. Cultivating a reputation for strength and reliability is a systemic requirement every bit as important as avoiding overreach. Establishing guardrails on a rival’s progress, through a carefully selected set of inflexible commitments — in the case of the Cold War, the core U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia — can safeguard a baseline level of credibility. And it can provide running room to be more flexible on secondary issues without sparking a collapse of a great power’s global position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;overreacting-to-individual-encounters-will-usually-be-a-mistake-a-rivalry-focused-on-long-term-systemic-attraction-will-not-be-determined-by-any-one-clash&quot;&gt;Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such flexibility is available because of a related lesson from the Cold War: while a reputation for credible commitments is important, reputation is a contingent factor — not every standoff carries the same reputational weight, and the lessons that friends and rivals take from individual crises will depend on many factors. Iain Henry has documented, for example, in the context of earlier Taiwan Strait crises, that U.S. allies sometimes prefer that the United States not fulfill other commitments if they do not directly enhance the ally’s security. Some U.S. allies and key regional states welcomed pre-Korean War U.S. statements that it would not defend Taiwan, fearing that to do so would drag them into conflict. More recent cases — such as Russia’s reaction to the U.S. failure to enforce a red line on chemical weapons use in Syria — reinforce the point that the credibility lessons others draw from U.S. actions are specific to each case. There is no imperative to show strength in every test of wills. An important lesson of the Cold War, then, is that even a bitter systemic rivalry is not a zero-sum affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-two-the-ambitions-of-a-great-power-are-a-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;LESSON TWO: THE AMBITIONS OF A GREAT POWER ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also suggests that any strategy for managing recurring confrontations should rely upon an accurate diagnosis of the rival’s intentions. A China on a global mission of military adventurism would demand a very different series of responses in discrete crises from a China in a defensive crouch, reacting to perceived attacks from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategy in the Cold War reflected in part an extended, imperfect effort to calculate the real intentions of Soviet leadership. Debates around such issues began with George Kennan’s “Long Telegram” and “X” article, which detected an urge to power in the Russian culture and Soviet system but also real risk aversion, and continued through the argument over the sincerity of reformers of the Gorbachev era. But in retrospect, perhaps the most important lesson was how inchoate Soviet ambitions were — grand and global in rhetorical content but mixed, often half-hearted, and contradictory in application. Far from being set in stone, Soviet intentions were a work in progress, an evolving set of ideas, commitments, and opportunistic grabs unfolding under nebulous long-term doctrines. A key lesson of the Cold War, then, is the potential gap between the ideological, rhetorical, and even strategic proclamations of a great power and its practical ability, or even at times desire, to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related lesson is that the Soviet intentions and actions, which unfolded during the Cold War, were reactive as much as self-generated. Soviet leaders occasionally glimpsed windows of opportunity based on perceived U.S. or Western weakness. More often, however, their ambitions were driven by concerns about what the United States was doing or might do, or about the dangerous potential of emerging trends. One does not have to fully embrace a comprehensive revisionist account of the Cold War to accept that in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Afghanistan in 1979, the Able Archer nuclear crisis of 1983 and many other cases, Moscow was acting out of reactive alarm rather than calculated revisionist ambitions. Even the Cuban Missile Crisis stemmed primarily from Khrushchev’s worries about a U.S. invasion of Cuba and an unfavorable nuclear balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of emergent rather than fixed national intentions has much in common with the portrait of Germany authored in 1907 by the British civil servant Eyre Crowe. It was obvious, Crowe wrote, that “Germany distinctly aims at playing on the world’s political stage a much larger and more dominant part than she finds allotted to herself under the present distribution of materiel power.” But the issue was whether this reflected a formally outlined agenda or a series of improvisations. It was entirely plausible, he argued, that “the great German design is in reality no more than the expression of a vague, confused, and unpractical statesmanship, not fully realizing its own drift” and that “Germany does not really know what she is driving at.” Crowe concluded that it did not matter much which interpretation was correct: a belligerent Germany fueled by an “erratic, domineering, and often frankly aggressive spirit” was moving in a direction perilous to British interests whether it had a strict plan or not. It had to be opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, the Soviet Union’s ambitions in the Cold War reflected at least as much of an ongoing extemporization under imprecise long-term desires as any consistent long-term plan. This does not mean that the Soviet Union was not aggressive or goal-oriented: Vladislav Zubok has pushed back against excessively revisionist accounts of Soviet intentions, noting that ideology did fuel Soviet foreign policy and that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stalin’s policy was not one of confusion and defense, but one of cautious expansionism. Various factors intervened to prevent implementation of his policies, but historians should not overlook specific designs and intentions that produced those policies in the first place. Stalin was clever and scheming, and he regarded the Western powers as dangerous rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting Soviet objectives were in many ways inexact and conceptual, more of a work in progress than a preset plan. Any given Soviet lunge — backing Kim Il-sung’s invasion of South Korea, putting missiles into Cuba, or invading Hungary or Czechoslovakia — was more likely to be a momentary, unplanned scheme or reaction than a cog in an orchestrated machine of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this emergent, improvisational character of goals and the lack of detailed information about others’ thinking, the Cold War and earlier great power rivalries show the great difficulty of gauging a rival’s true intentions. States uncertain of others’ goals then often engage in worst-case analysis and overreact to specific moves. In the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union frequently misread the true reasons behind specific actions and reacted based on often exaggerated beliefs about each other’s purposes. A classic example was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan: the Carter administration saw it as the first step toward military control of the Persian Gulf, when in fact Soviet leaders were desperately trying to prevent the country from slipping out of the Soviet orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to believe that this basic model applies to China today; it is a state with elaborate goals, but ones without precise form and subject to misunderstanding. China’s international objectives are more of an improvisational work in progress in service of some clear but very broad long-term goals, rather than the working out of a rigid, pre-planned campaign. To be clear, this is not to suggest that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lacks ambition: China aspires to modify and even partially dismantle the U.S.-led post-war order and achieve some version of global leadership and deference to its wishes, at least in its own region. Some degree of global control is inextricably linked to the CCP’s core ambition of national rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s goals are therefore formidable and potentially dangerous to U.S. interests. The argument here is only that the detailed requirements for a world that would meet these goals are being worked out over time, and the strategies China uses to obtain them are also emerging through trial and error. Much like Germany in 1907 or the Soviet Union in 1946, China has a broad sense of a desired future — but the shape of its precise components, and what it is prepared to do to achieve them, remain very much a work in progress. And they will emerge through a long-term interaction with its primary perceived antagonist, the United States — not because the United States is responsible for all Chinese belligerence, but because Beijing will respond in part to perceived threats and to actions which appear intended to deny it the achievement of what it regards as legitimate interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is apparent from the phrases that Chinese officials and scholars have used to depict their goals, which are powerful but also vague and abstract. Statements such as “win-win cooperation” and “a community of common destiny” seem more like assertions of hope and general intent than a commitment to a specific agenda. Hal Brands and Michael Beckley argue that “China doesn’t want to be a superpower — one pole of many in the international system. It wants to be the superpower — the geopolitical sun around which the system revolves,” but even that potent objective could take many forms. They admit that its goals exist more in a “rough consensus” than any “detailed, step-by-step plans” and that it does not require “outright physical dominance” in the manner of some previous imperial powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;much-like-germany-in-1907-or-the-soviet-union-in-1946-china-has-a-broad-sense-of-a-desired-future--but-the-shape-of-its-precise-components-and-what-it-is-prepared-to-do-to-achieve-them-remain-very-much-a-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;Much like Germany in 1907 or the Soviet Union in 1946, China has a broad sense of a desired future — but the shape of its precise components, and what it is prepared to do to achieve them, remain very much a work in progress.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful recent case for an expansive view of China’s ambitions is Rush Doshi’s book The Long Game, which makes the argument that Chinese official sources suggest an almost unlimited thirst for regional hegemony and global predominance. Yet even in his extensive account, most of the phrases attributed to official documents are rather vague: “make new and greater contributions to humanity,” “actively accomplishing something,” “a new type of international relations,” a “community of common destiny,” and other fuzzy exhortations. More pointed and specific demands, such as the suggestion that U.S. alliances must be ruined, tend to come from individual scholars or breast-pounding statements from specific Chinese commentators. In fact, many Chinese sources explicitly reject such terms as “hegemony,” associating it with Western imperial ambitions and claiming China seeks something very different. Some explicitly accept the idea of sharing world power, as Doshi puts it at one point, as “co-equals” with the United States. As Paul Heer put it in a respectful but critical review of Doshi’s book: “What Doshi appears to be overlooking or dismissing here is the possibility that China seeks to escape subordination to the United States, but without presuming that it can, in turn, subordinate the United States: that it expects a central role in global leadership without presuming exclusive global hegemony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other sources recognize the loose concepts and definitions inherent in Chinese strategic statements. One recent RAND study concluded that “no official Chinese document that outlines a strategy for managing competition with the United States is known to exist… At most, officials have described Chinese concepts, guiding principles, and proposals for foreign policy, all of which provide important clues as to Chinese intent.” Nadège Rolland argues that Beijing seems intent on some form of recognized primacy but explains that the precise elements of such a vision remain unformed and subject to debate. The vagueness, silence, and variety of opinions in Chinese thinking on strategic objectives suggest to Aaron Friedberg that “analysis of China’s long-term strategy cannot help but rest heavily on inference and speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedberg is deeply concerned about expansive Chinese ambitions, but he too relies on generic terms to capture China’s intent — seeking “predominance,” “preponderance,” or “hegemony” — while admitting that its “precise definition, and the extent to which” these concepts “can be achieved at acceptable cost at any given moment, remain[s] open to discussion and debate.” At one point he suggests that a more emergent approach to objectives may reflect an essential characteristic of Chinese strategy. Whereas Western strategy tends to be goal-directed, Chinese thinking tends to be “more organic and improvisational and less mechanical and deterministic.” Friedberg also points out that different Chinese officials “may be divided, or even undecided,” about the shape of their objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese writings also admit constraints on the tools the country might use to gain its desired future. They emphasize avoidance of war with the United States as well as other limits, such as an emphasis on nonmilitary forms of power, and recognize “the importance of having a balanced and nuanced strategy that avoids disastrous missteps.” Chinese strategy recognizes that a stable international environment and a friendly regional environment are essential to national rejuvenation, and Chinese official and unofficial sources stress the need for international legitimacy as a supporting pillar for both domestic legitimacy and the kind of leading global role Beijing seeks — based on the open acceptance of Chinese authority as a force for good, not the grudging tolerance of a resented coercion. Some Chinese sources have described an “ideal security environment” in ways that do not appear to demand hegemony at all. Chinese sources dispute the question of whether the United States would accept subordination to a clearly superior China, and therefore whether China should seek such a future. China sees little need to impose its political system on other countries or to develop a global network of military bases. Most fundamentally, the CCP’s predominant goal is to maintain its own power, and risky international steps that could pose serious threats to its rule will usually trade off against this most essential of objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important place to judge the scope of Chinese ambitions as they play out in practice, as opposed to theory, is in its push-and-pull with specific targets of influence. South Korea provides an interesting recent example. When Seoul announced in 2016 an intention to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in cooperation with the United States, China reacted angrily, calling the capability a threat to its nuclear deterrent. When South Korea went ahead with an initial THAAD deployment in 2017, China imposed economic sanctions, which cost South Korea and estimated $8 billion or more. The Moon Jae-in administration in South Korea sought to proceed with a partial deployment while mollifying Beijing, offering a promise of “three nos”: Seoul promised not to deploy more than one THAAD system, not to actively join a U.S. missile defense network, and not to seek a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This result demonstrated some Chinese influence but not an ability to dictate outcomes: China backed off its sanctions even though the initial THAAD system remained in place. Since that time, China’s belligerence has had a significant price. Public opinion in South Korea turned starkly against China. The new president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has declared that the “three nos” do not represent permanent South Korean policy and describes the U.S. alliance as “fundamental” to South Korean security. Chinese diplomacy on this issue has been improvising in service of a general goal — and the outcome does not reflect a linear march toward the future of Chinese regional suzerainty described in the most aggressive statements of its scholars and officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More evidence for the emergent, unplanned nature of Chinese ambitions comes from studies of its primary tool for achieving hegemony — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As analysts such as Raffaello Pantucci, Alexandros Petersen, Will Doig, and Jonathan Hillman have chronicled, to observe the working out of the BRI on the ground is to see a massive exercise in decentralized initiative and frequent ad-libbing. The overall enterprise does support a broad Chinese hope to play a leading role in world politics, and surely elements of it are planned from Beijing. But the empirical record of its unfolding suggests an accumulating set of emerging programs and ideas rather than a rigid and deterministic program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions thus appear to reflect a typical degree of elaborate geopolitical self-image characteristic of rising great powers, infused with China’s particular blend of resentment over past mistreatment and sense of cultural superiority. The United States should not underestimate the intensity, reach, or emotional resonance of those ambitions. On the other hand, the precise scope of a world China could live with remains undefined. “The question of whether they will have to settle for something less than clear-cut preponderance is probably unresolved at this point in the minds of China’s leaders,” Aaron Friedberg concluded. Individual confrontations, much as in the Cold War, can represent many things: a carefully planned step toward regional hegemony, a defensive reaction to a perceived threat, a trial or experiment, or the initiative of one part of the CCP bureaucracy. And along the way, U.S. actions and responses to Chinese behavior will shape Beijing’s perceptions of the degree to which the United States is fundamentally opposed to its core interests, and the sort of world it believes is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-three-there-is-wisdom-to-moderation-in-crises&quot;&gt;LESSON THREE: THERE IS WISDOM TO MODERATION IN CRISES.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War offers a final lesson in the handling of individual U.S.-China clashes. Despite the common idea that containment demanded an immediate answer to every Soviet and Chinese initiative, in fact, Washington succeeded in the Cold War in part precisely because it picked its spots. President Harry Truman rejected demands to escalate the Korean War and accepted an unsatisfying draw. Dwight Eisenhower refused French pleas to join the war in Indochina during the 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu, rebuffed calls to intervene during Moscow’s invasion of Hungary in 1956, and sought to preserve U.S. geopolitical legitimacy by opposing British and French interventions in Suez that same year. The United States did not commit force to respond to Soviet interventions in Czechoslovakia in 1968 or Afghanistan in 1979. It accepted a communist takeover of Cuba and allowed an anti-American theocracy to take root in Iran. In some of these cases, of course, Washington turned to covert regime change operations to pursue its goals, but it avoided the use of force in the initial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dismal parade of nonresponses would seem to be an obvious recipe for failure — allowing a rival to succeed, or accepting U.S. losses, in one crisis and war after another. Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided first and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies. The United States did erect a strong floor under the day-to-day competition by committing resolutely to a handfulof treaty commitments and vital interests, notably the defense of Europe, South Korea, and Japan, which placed strict limits on how far Soviet or Chinese success in other crises would cascade. But it prevailed (and survived) as much due to restraint as to belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathering these collisions required something else as well: a mutual willingness to combine steadfastness with reassurance and compromise during even the worst crises. Both sides showed a recurring ability to respect the most essential interests of the other and to accept that avoiding escalation demanded conciliation. This was the pattern in U.S. restraint in Korea and Vietnam, in the series of crises over Berlin, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in many other cases. Managing confrontations was as much about empathy and compromise as it was about power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;yet-the-united-states-prevailed-because-the-rivalry-ultimately-represented-a-clash-of-systems-one-decided-f-irst-and-foremost-by-the-organic-power-of-the-relative-societies&quot;&gt;Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided f irst and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, U.S. appreciation for this fact was wildly inconsistent. All too often, U.S. officials misread individual confrontations as the result of Soviet aggressiveness and belligerence rather than fear and desperation. Some of the most dangerous moments in the Cold War flared up when one or both sides exaggerated the stakes of local disputes. This basic misperception cropped up again and again, from the Berlin crises to Afghanistan to perhaps the most famous and perilous example, the 1983 war scare produced by Soviet fears of an imminent U.S. nuclear strike. It was also a product of a related fact about Cold War clashes: despite immense intelligence apparatuses and decades-long personal ties, each side often had only the most rudimentary information about the other’s true thinking. Partly as a result, crisis signaling never worked as well in practice as in game theory. In the chaos of major clashes, signals were misinterpreted or ignored as often as accurately read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But U.S. moderation through many Cold War crises also suggests a more reassuring lesson: Soviet imperial objectives were to some degree self-correcting in the responses they provoked from others. Before 1950, for example, the United States was not fully committed to the defense of either South Korea or Taiwan. It was willing, for a time, to assume that Taiwan would be reabsorbed into the new mainland regime. But the Soviet-sponsored invasion of South Korea changed all that, sparking renewed U.S. and allied defense investments and commitments. The Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 turned out to be strategically disastrous, alienating much of the nonaligned movement and speeding the collapse of domestic support for the Soviet system. The more belligerently aggressive Moscow became, the more it drove countries to seek implicit or explicit security help from the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is seeing much the same dynamic play out with China today. The more it seeks to intimidate its neighbors and capture influence within the societies of other countries, the more it steals intellectual property and imposes elaborate technology transfer demands on foreign firms, the more Beijing alienates those it is trying to win over. With Europe imposing much stricter controls on technology cooperation, Japan considering a doubling of its defense budget, and countries throughout Asia accelerating networks of security cooperation, China’s most aggressive ambitions may turn out to be, like the Soviet Union’s, a self-correcting threat. This has implications for its goals: China may seek regional hegemony, but if it encounters more visceral opposition with every new step, it will have to recalibrate its objectives over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sources of insight lead back to the central goal of this essay — to nominate principles for managing an era of persistent altercations within a combative rivalry with China. The Cold War lessons summarized above can help inform these principles. Those lessons highlight the possibility of a rival whose ambitions are substantial but not clearly defined. They warn of the risks of misinterpreting China’s true motives in any crisis and suggest that a long-term systemic rivalry will not be determined by almost any one clash — but they also emphasize the need to draw some clear limits to an aggressive state’s opportunism. They make clear the need to balance strength in any one standoff with the need to remain patient, signal a willingness to compromise — if such a step remains possible in the context of U.S. China Policy — and avoid escalation. And the Cold War experience hints that China’s belligerence will be partly self-correcting and that successive crises can be one tool for shifting the global alignment of power against Beijing. Seven principles for managing confrontations embody these lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-one-establish-the-boundaries-of-us-tolerance&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE ONE: ESTABLISH THE BOUNDARIES OF U.S. TOLERANCE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle requires identifying the potential confrontations that would justify strong and determined responses, with either military force or a comprehensive nonmilitary campaign of cost imposition. These are the confrontations in which the United States would draw red lines to circumscribe the outer bounds of China’s territorial encroachment, identifying those commitments and interests that will generate a rapid and substantial U.S. military response. Some U.S. experience with China indicates that China does respect firm boundaries when others draw them, suggesting that the strictest red lines would largely be respected (except for Taiwan, discussed below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 suggests a rough categorization of potential crises along two indices: (1) the degree of U.S. national interests involved, and (2) the precedential importance of an issue in regulating Chinese ambitions. Confrontations that reflect high measures on both indices (the top-right box) would call forth a powerful and direct response. An example would be a massed Chinese maritime coercion campaign to impose Japanese withdrawal from the Senkakus: such a gambit would demand rapid and substantial U.S. military deployments, reaffirmations that any action against Japan would trigger the U.S.-Japan security treaty, and other steps. Once it has identified the issues in this quadrant, the United States would then make unequivocal deterrent threats around them to avoid clashes in the first place. It has begun to do this with actions such as the statement that the Senkakus fall under the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the 2019 clarification that “any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea would trigger mutual defense obligations under Article IV of our Mutual Defense Treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the figure also highlights confrontations in which the United States would have more room for maneuver. The bottom-left corner includes issues that call for ongoing competition rather than risk-taking confrontations; when they flare into momentary public crises — such as the revelation of a specific Chinese human rights abuse or agreement to build a new military base — the United States could react calmly and indirectly. The most challenging quadrant to handle would be the bottom right: forms of Chinese coercion or outright aggression that threaten non-treaty allies, but which could, if successful, turbocharge Chinese ambitions. Here, the United States could potentially rally world opinion, support the beleaguered state in significant ways, or impose punishments on China, but not deploy forces or risk a direct confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/byDcnVA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Categorizing Potential Confrontations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matrix does not distinguish crises based on who initiates confrontation, a crucial factor. The restrained U.S. approach in the recent Taiwan Strait Crisis was probably dictated in part by the role of U.S. actions in creating it. Whether a given crisis arises from U.S. or allied actions, or fully unprovoked Chinese belligerence, will have to be considered when categorizing a given confrontation and the appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue is notably absent from the figure — Taiwan. Much of the debate about U.S. policy really amounts to which cell it belongs in. Many would place it on the right-hand side, as a precedent-setting issue for Chinese ambitions — though some would disagree, suggesting that it is such a unique issue that it holds limited meaning for restraining wider Chinese ambitions. Most of the debate, though, will be about the lower-right versus upper-right cells. Is this an issue that, when crises erupt, the United States should signal a strong and immediate response, including military deployments and threats of escalation? This question is addressed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-two-emphasize-understanding-and-strategic-empathy&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE TWO: EMPHASIZE UNDERSTANDING AND STRATEGIC EMPATHY.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major theme of Cold War crises was how often each side misread the intentions of its rival — and how dangerous such misperceptions could be. In the current rivalry, these risks may be compounded by China’s doctrinal emphasis on moving rapidly, decisively, and violently at the beginning of a crisis or war to seize the strategic advantage. China’s own myopic conviction that its ambitions reflect a rightful demand for fair treatment may make it blind to the ways in which it generates crises, something the United States needs to understand and navigate around. In recent crises, U.S. signals of toughness, based on limited information about Chinese intentions, have arguably created unnecessary risk. And the history of Chinese crisis behavior suggests that, like most great powers, it is most likely to take risk and escalate events when it perceives itself in a domain of losses, under severe pressure, and losing strategic position and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will therefore be essential for senior U.S. officials to put in place wide-ranging sources of information, from inside as well as outside government, and formal analytical products that constantly invite them to put themselves into the mindset of leaders in Beijing. This is easier said than done, and the hints of a new orthodoxy on China are already evident that will make it even tougher. It will demand committed effort from presidents and senior advisers to be sure they are drawing from the widest possible basis of information and interpretations — offices, products, and processes that go well beyond reporting on China to representing its mindset, as well as relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials that provide some basis for correcting misimpressions during future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-three-keep-from-generating-crises-ourselves-especially-with-unnecessary-political-provocations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE THREE: KEEP FROM GENERATING CRISES OURSELVES, ESPECIALLY WITH UNNECESSARY POLITICAL PROVOCATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be times when the United States believes it needs to take strong action on some issue in the relationship, actions China will view unfavorably. But Washington should avoid provoking unnecessary confrontations to the greatest degree possible. Partly this is simple resource management: Expending time, diplomatic capital, and military readiness on needless clashes is not good strategy. This imperative is partly about managing Chinese perceptions, avoiding, to the degree still possible (which may be limited), the idea that the United States is determined to challenge China in every opportunity. But it is also partly about sending a signal to third parties that both sides in this rivalry are not equally responsible for its most dangerous moments — that the United States, to the degree possible, seeks stability and China is the author of instability. All of those principles help to set the context for the successful resolution of individual confrontations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the challenge for the United States is to avoid the central source of instability when dealing with rising, dissatisfied powers — signaling that the only way for them to achieve their rightful place in world politics is through warfare. Accommodating some Chinese aims and ambitions is not only appropriate, it is essential if we are to avoid a bitterly zero-sum contest with an aggrieved and increasingly paranoid great power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-four-develop-options-for-shoring-up-credibility-away-from-the-local-confrontation&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FOUR: DEVELOP OPTIONS FOR SHORING UP CREDIBILITY AWAY FROM THE LOCAL CONFRONTATION.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant clash will raise the age-old issue of credibility and reputation, sparked by fears about the lessons that third parties will draw from U.S. conduct in such standoffs as well as concerns about domestic political costs of inaction. As noted, this concern for reputation can sometimes push great powers to take risks beyond those the interests at stake would seem to support. To avoid being trapped into excessive reactions out of a concern for credibility, the United States should identify indirect ways to shore it up — actions away from the local confrontation that signal U.S. strength and commitment without undertaking costly adventures. Partly this can involve preset options to quietly reset expectations in the wake of crises, including enhanced U.S. military posture, public statements of commitment to friends and allies, arms aid and transfers to partners, and expanded security cooperation activities. It can energize dialogues with U.S. friends and allies on shared steps to bolster collective credibility when a local military response is not judged to be sensible. None of this would involve starting new proxy conflicts or putting U.S. credibility on the line in new places or conflicts. The options would focus on reinforcing existing alliances and commitments to make clear that restraint in one confrontation will not produce a domino effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-five-multilateralize-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FIVE: MULTILATERALIZE CONFRONTATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the great advantage of enjoying the active or tacit support of most key industrial powers, and most countries in Asia, in the effort to constrain the most aggressive forms of Chinese power. Both before and during crises, the United States should continue to seek to recruit collective support for norms and principles; then, when China prompts a clash with belligerent actions, it will face significant global criticism and confront a strong coalition of states insisting that it respect certain norms of conduct. One example is the growing European presence in Asia, in particular, conducting various forms of freedom of navigation demonstrations and security engagements with Asian nations. There is an ample institutional framework for such an effort, starting with the United Nations and running through bilateral and multilateral alliances, minilateral groupings such as the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) initiative, informal groups such as the Quad, and regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The United States will have uneven success in recruiting support in these venues depending on the nature of the crisis, but a major focus now can be to build a strong normative foundation for later support in crises. It would accelerate efforts to ensure that, especially in crises involving true U.S. red lines, China would confront a substantial coalition opposing its belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-six-use-confrontations-as-levers-to-seek-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SIX: USE CONFRONTATIONS AS LEVERS TO SEEK COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should seek with every event not merely to fulfill its immediate interests but to rally world opinion against Chinese coercive provocations and put into place a gradually increasing deterrent posture in the region. After each crisis, for example, the United States can approach key regional actors, such as the Philippines, and propose slightly improved U.S. force presence and deepened bilateral training and exercise activities. It can try to ensure that each confrontation has some of the echo effect of major Soviet adventures in the Cold War, from Korea to Czechoslovakia to Afghanistan, in stiffening the commitment of other states to respond to the next provocation. To do this, however, the United States will need far better tools of informational statecraft to help shape opinions, especially in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reap such competitive benefits, the United States should develop concepts and capabilities to ensure that, once a confrontation is underway, the passage of time benefits the United States rather than China. Whether it is a maritime standoff over a set of disputed islands, a partial or complete quarantine of Taiwan, or another clash with the potential to last days, weeks, or even months, the side that accumulates more strength over time will have the advantage. If China believes it can outlast the United States, it will have every incentive to disregard short-term challenges and hold out to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-seven-use-each-confrontation-as-an-opportunity-to-build-communication-channels-rules-of-engagement-and-norms-of-conduct&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SEVEN: USE EACH CONFRONTATION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, AND NORMS OF CONDUCT.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also highlights the role of mutual understandings in helping to manage the pressure-packed days or weeks of individual crises. A great risk with China today is that the formal crisis management mechanisms that do exist are embryonic, frequently ignored or bypassed, and not developed through mutual practice. Personal relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials are either nonexistent or, with a few exceptions, poorly developed. In some past crises, the absence of rapid U.S. responses to Chinese signals was potentially dangerous. In the wake of every crisis, the United States could approach China with an offer to jointly learn lessons and find ways of avoiding inadvertent escalation in future clashes, including through codified rules of engagement, mechanisms of communication, and informal standards of conduct. This is especially true at senior levels: Chinese habits of centralized decisionmaking and constraints on regular contacts at many levels may leave little room for strengthening rules of engagement from the bottom up. Senior U.S. officials and U.S. presidents should therefore use the aftermath of any crisis as an opportunity to argue for processes and contacts that improve mutual understanding, and mechanisms for easy conversation, at their level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-great-risk-with-china-today-is-that-the-formal-crisis-management-mechanisms-that-do-exist-are-embryonic-frequently-ignored-or-bypassed-and-not-developed-through-mutual-practice&quot;&gt;A great risk with China today is that the formal crisis management mechanisms that do exist are embryonic, frequently ignored or bypassed, and not developed through mutual practice.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-does-this-leave-taiwan&quot;&gt;WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE TAIWAN?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those principles may work reasonably well for most U.S.-China confrontations, but they may be of less use on the dispute most likely to spark crises: the status of Taiwan. The issue resides in a vague middle ground between the two right-hand cells in Figure 1 — possibly, but not necessarily, justifying inclusion with the clashes that would prompt an immediate and uncompromising U.S. response to Chinese coercive modes. That obscure status is becoming ever more complex and strewn with dilemmas. On the one hand, the case for the U.S. policy of ambiguity remains strong: to promise unqualified defense of the island would provoke China and possibly tempt Taiwan to take actions which would irretrievably inflame the issue. Signaling restraint to extend China’s timeline for achieving its interests, in part by “keeping the possibility of peaceful unification alive” to the degree possible, has been an essential component of maintaining peace. This has meant avoiding symbolic actions that will infuriate Beijing and doing everything possible to reintroduce a degree of patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustaining that approach is critical and should be a U.S. policy priority. Yet it cannot be denied that all trends are now running in the direction of more formal U.S. commitments to defend Taiwan. Having watched the horrors of the Ukraine war unfold, the United States may now be far less likely to exercise similar restraint over Taiwan. President Biden has said multiple times that the United States would defend Taiwan, only to have his words walked back. The most recent of these statements implied the United States would fight even if Taiwan declared independence, a clear shift from existing policy. Meanwhile, Congress seems on the verge of passing a Taiwan Policy Act that would represent nothing short of a revolution in U.S. security relations with Taipei. There may now be no going back to the precise forms of mutual restraint around the Taiwan issue that helped produce relative stability for the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of dealing with confrontations over Taiwan is further complicated by the fact that they may not represent an outright invasion. More likely is an interim series of crises below that threshold, intended to signal China’s determination and warn the United States, Taiwan, and others off any course that hints at de facto independence. Such moves could include repeated exercises, penetration of Taiwanese airspace, cyberattacks on Taiwan’s civilian and military infrastructure, large-scale political warfare, direct attacks on islands in the strait, attacks on undersea cables carrying internet connectivity to the island, temporary or quasi-permanent blockades of parts of the surrounding waterways, or an energy embargo. Even if Beijing does move toward a full invasion, it would have to undertake many forms of preparation — from months or years of surging defense production to national mobilization to more immediate movement of forces — that would create a crisis of impending war long before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be no simple playbook for U.S. responses to such a diverse array of actions, but the principles for managing persistent confrontations suggested above can still provide some guidance. First, the essential foundation for any U.S. approach to future crises should begin with an effort to reaffirm elements of stability to reset the context for future confrontations. If China comes to believe that the United States is inching toward open support for Taiwanese independence, it will have less incentive to restrain the escalatory dynamics of any crisis. It may be too late to resuscitate the comprehensive policy of ambiguity, but Washington can still offer a modified reassurance to Beijing. It can pledge that the One China Policy remains in place, indicate that the United States has no intention to formally recognize an independent Taiwan, and insist that both sides restrain actions that could lead to war. Washington could even publicly signal that a Taiwanese declaration of independence would void any U.S. promises. (In fact the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy came fairly close to saying all of this.) In return it should request more consistent pledges from Beijing that it remains committed to the peaceful resolution of the issue, as it has long claimed. A mutually agreed series of such statements could move the public position of both sides back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, however, and in tension with that effort, the United States now seems compelled to clarify its red lines for future Taiwan crises in ways more explicit than the policy of ambiguity had allowed. It could declare that an unprovoked Chinese attack on Taiwan proper would produce U.S. military involvement of some kind, leaving substantial leeway in terms of what military response it would undertake. It could continue to insist on freedom of navigation in international waters — including international maritime freedom to engage with Taiwan (thus placing a comprehensive Chinese blockade across the U.S. threshold of tolerance). This would amount to placing only the most severe confrontations in the upper-right quadrant of Figure 1, actions that would trigger a U.S. military response in a crisis (such as large-scale military movements). Lesser contingencies — including Chinese cyberattacks, missile flights, violations of Taiwan’s airspace, and even direct attacks on small islands in the strait — would fall into the lower-right quadrant and leave the United States with greater freedom of action in responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under such an approach, the United States would not reflexively seek to confront any Chinese coercive act around Taiwan. It would not adopt a policy of disrupting any Chinese exercises, flights, or sailings that cross certain territorial lines, unless they dealt with red-line issues. As in the recent strait crisis, it would take a largely hands-off approach unless there were clear actions or indications that China was preparing to violate one of the red-line issues. The approach aims to recreate, in miniature, the essential U.S. approach during the Cold War, combining firm commitment to a small number of essential red lines with flexibility on most other clashes. The result would split the difference on ambiguity, but in ways that do not reflect a major departure from U.S. policy, which has always insisted on a peaceful resolution of the issue and strongly hinted that the United States would respond militarily to an outright invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, before or during a major crisis, the United States could follow other elements of the principles for managing confrontations suggested above. It could recruit statements from other countries insisting that China not use military force as well as expand multilateral exercises, sailings, and security cooperation efforts to make clear that an unprovoked use of force would put Beijing afoul of most of the world economy. For lesser contingencies where it chooses restraint, such as the recent crisis, the United States could undertake parallel actions to demonstrate strength, reassure regional actors, and reaffirm its credibility. It could finally get serious about its information instrument of statecraft and use Chinese belligerence to drive regional and global opinion during future skirmishes. At the same time, it would do everything possible to enhance channels of communication and personal relationships and approach Beijing after each clash to reaffirm key rules of the road. Fourth and finally, this approach has implications for U.S. operational military posture in the region. A relatively calm and contained approach to many confrontations will have much greater credibility if the United States and Taiwan have a stronger persistent, preset ability to impose costs on aggression, rather than having to spend weeks or months flowing forces to the area. This demands, first and foremost, that Taiwan take stronger steps for its own defense. More spending, a true commitment to a more asymmetric emphasis, and a transformation of Taiwan’s reserve forces are minimum necessary steps. For the United States, this approach would call for more submarines; unmanned undersea systems; advanced sensing and targeting systems, including long-range drones; loitering munitions; some number of long-range precision fire systems (including bombers); and demonstrated offensive cyber capabilities. The United States would also need to design the highest-impact forces to be able to rapidly deploy to the region — even onto Taiwan — once it received unambiguous warning that China was assembling forces for a full, unprovoked invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-temperate-strategy-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;TOWARD A TEMPERATE STRATEGY FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conceptualizing the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, most U.S. officials and analysts have become accustomed to thinking of the competition as a persistent contest to shape measures of advantage on some grand long-term scorecard. But an equally important set of choices will be episodic — the ways the United States approaches specific crises and confrontations to gain strategic advantage while avoiding conflict. It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Cold War offers a blueprint for such a strategy, it suggests that a great power must first get its fundamental socioeconomic engine right and work to set the alignment of world politics to its advantage. To limit the cascading effect of any one loss or compromise, it must lay out a handful of vital commitments on which its commitments are resolute and credible. The U.S. experience with China in recent decades suggests that such explicit line-drawing on the most important issues can have a meaningful effect on Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;but-an-equally-important-set-of-choices-will-be-episodic--the-ways-the-united-states-approaches-specif-ic-crises-and-confrontations-to-gain-strategic-advantage-while-avoiding-conflict-it-needs-a-strategy-for-managing-such-clashes-as-much-as-it-requires-a-general-approach-to-national-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;But an equally important set of choices will be episodic — the ways the United States approaches specif ic crises and confrontations to gain strategic advantage while avoiding conflict. It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done these things, great powers can then be restrained in most individual crises beyond those issues or allies because they are not going to decide the outcome. Repeatedly in the Cold War, the United States responded to clashes with at least a degree of restraint — in Korea, Dien Bien Phu, Hungary, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. There is every reason to believe the same basic rule will hold in the rivalry with China: the United States cannot be so spring-loaded to respond that it turns every clash into an existential contest of wills. This suggests, on Taiwan and other issues, a challenging but manageable balancing act that combines strengthening the most essential commitments with a determination not to overreact to other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk, at this point, is that the room in the U.S. national security context for compromise, understanding, and sensible accommodation appears to be narrowing rapidly. Especially with the recent announcement of understandable constraints on dealing with China’s semiconductor industry, the United States is giving every indication of viewing the rivalry in increasingly zero-sum terms. This will convince Chinese officials and commentators that their most pessimistic instincts have been correct: the United States has no intention of offering shared leadership of world politics. The policy case for each of these specific actions, such as information technology constraints or arms sales to Taiwan, may be compelling. But the sum of these actions is creating an environment in which Beijing has much less incentive to hold back when a crisis arrives because it thinks its rival is operating according to a zero-sum mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;there-is-every-reason-to-believe-the-same-basic-rule-will-hold-in-the-rivalry-with-china-the-united-states-cannot-be-so-spring-loaded-to-respond-that-it-turns-every-clash-into-an-existential-contest-of-wills&quot;&gt;There is every reason to believe the same basic rule will hold in the rivalry with China: the United States cannot be so spring-loaded to respond that it turns every clash into an existential contest of wills.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Chen Weiss recently made an impassioned plea for strategic goals and direction in a U.S. China Policy rapidly being swallowed up by worst-case assumptions and zero-sum thinking. “U.S. politicians and policymakers are becoming so focused on countering China that they risk losing sight of the affirmative interests and values that should underpin U.S. strategy,” she argues. U.S. policy “has struggled to define success” in the overall competition and has become dangerously reactive and, at times, exaggerated. As a result, “Both countries are intent on doing whatever is necessary to demonstrate that any move by the other will not go unmet.” The same dynamic could easily come to characterize the U.S. approach to specific crises. In its approach to the periodic clashes that will increasingly come to characterize this relationship, no less than in the overarching rivalry, the United States needs a positive strategy for success.&lt;/p&gt;

What is far less obvious is the level of confrontation between the U.S. and its strategic partners with both Russia and China, the rising levels of other types of violence emerging on a global level, how serious these wars and crises can become, and what kind of future could eventually emerge out of so many different crises, confrontations and conflicts, and trends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis explores the risk on the basis that war does not have to mean actual military conflict. Here, it is important to note that avoiding or minimizing combat is scarcely peace. As Sun Tzu pointed out in the Art of War well over 2,000 years ago, “war” does not have to involve the use of military force or any form of actual combat. His statement that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting” applies to every form of major military confrontation and gray area warfare between opposing powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It recognizes that it is all too easy to predict dire outcomes from the War in Ukraine, the current arms races with Russia and China, and growing levels of violence and confrontation between other states. There is still a case, however, for examining the broader impact of the war, the growing intensity of the arms races with Russia and China, and the current overall patterns of global conflict as the world enters the winter of 2022-2023. It is already clear that this will be a deeply troubled winter in many areas of the globe, that the level of confrontation between major powers has risen sharply, that they do seek to subdue the enemy without fighting, and their rivalry has become the equivalent of political and economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally clear that the wide range of lower-level conflicts between other powers, their civil wars, and the abuses many governments commit against their own citizens are also intensifying, although many of these conflicts have been going on in some form for years or even decades. In far too many cases, the world is not moving toward peace. It is moving towards repression and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, this analysis argues that the world already faces a series of possible and ongoing “Winter Wars” in 2022-2023 that may not escalate to open military conflict but that are wars at the political and economic level and in competition to build-up more lethal military forces both for deterrence and to exert political leverage. It also shows that these “Wars” already pose serious risks and could escalate sharply and in unpredictable ways for at least the next five to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global list of wars that are ongoing in the winter of 2020-2023, and that seems likely to continue to affect global security in the future, that this study examines includes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Winter War” in Fragile, Divided, Authoritarian, and Undeveloped States&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis warns that the world is not moving towards peace, that new forms of Cold War divide all the world’s major powers, and that far too few smaller states have solid levels of development, effective governance, and are moving toward peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one war has already escalated into a major conflict, and that involves fighting between Ukraine and Russia that seems almost certain to continue to escalate through the winter of 2022-2023. The Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 began with what appeared to be a Russian effort to seize the entirety of Ukraine, became a war of attrition on the ground, and has now escalated to a strategic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, however, has had sufficient support from the West and other states to be able to defend against Russia to the point where it has forced Russia to mobilize. The U.S. alone has provided some $60 billion in arms, economic aid, and other support by early October 2022, and is fighting the equivalent of a proxy war against Russia. Britain, the EU, and several other strategic partners have been providing major aid to Ukraine as well, and while Russia may have tried mobilizing up to 300,000 troops in October, it had also mobilized a substantial part of the developed world against it in ways where their aid to Ukraine did far more to challenge Russia than any aspects of their normal defense spending and modernization of their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tying-combat-to-attacks-on-ukrainian-civil-targets&quot;&gt;Tying Combat to Attacks on Ukrainian Civil Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and other supporters of Ukraine have waged an economic war of sanctions, and trade controls on Russia, as well as have provided economic and military aid to Ukraine, but Russia has responded more effectively in other ways with a combination of military escalation and an economic war over energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has escalated to conducting military attacks on Ukraine’s population and economic and military warfare against its infrastructure. Russia has adapted its past reliance on “General Winter” and “General Mud” to try to destroy Ukraine’s economy and its ability to resist. The War in Ukraine has escalated from fighting a land/air/missile battle for the control of the Eastern Ukraine to a Russian strategy designed to destroy enough of the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure to force the Ukrainian government to end the fighting in ways that leave Russia with significant territorial gains, and Ukraine with a crippled economy that will take years to repair and with an uncertain future political and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the expansion of Russian attacks to civil and critical infrastructure targets has already reached critical levels by the end of October 2022 and has briefly shut off the flow of water and electric power to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in early November. The Ukrainian government reported then that strikes on key electricity generating targets in Ukraine had destroyed almost a third of its electric and other power generating facilities and left at least 1.5 million Ukrainians without power. They deprived Kyiv of safe drinking water for at least several days. Ukraine may be able to repair part of its infrastructure and deploy more effective and air defenses in the months to come but this is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Russia military attacks interacted with broader forms of economic warfare in Ukraine. They include attacks on Ukrainian grain exports and other targets that affect the entire Ukrainian economy. They have already levels of inflation that have reduced many Ukrainians to the poverty level and sharply increased Ukraine’s needs for economic aid as well as created a legacy that will require a massive post-war recovery program. Unless the Russian attacks halt or Ukraine is given a much larger set of missile and air defenses, they will create steadily growing problems in maintaining a decent life as winter progresses – often increasing poverty to the point where hard choices have to be made between “heat” and “eat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accurate cost and supply data are lacking, Russia’s purchase of low-cost precision-guided conventionally armed missiles and drones from Iran may allow Russia to both destroy such Ukrainian economic targets and to saturate the more advanced air/missile defense systems the U.S. is providing to Ukraine – systems which will only provide limited area coverage for much of the winter, and whose operation is substantially more costly than Russia’s missile strike forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such attacks may cumulatively limit internal Ukrainian popular support for the war, and sharply reduce Russian casualties and embarrassing military defeats. At a minimum, the new Russian tactics and missile strikes will extend the length and intensity of the fighting, sharply raise its cost of military and civil aid and the cost of any postwar recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may well force Ukraine to compromise on a settlement or to fight a debilitating war indefinitely into the future and show NATO European states – especially those near the Russian border – that Russia still presents a major threat them regardless of the problems the fighting has revealed in its land forces. They also seem likely to make Russia steadily more reliant on such tactics in the future, and to continue to link the use of such missile and air attacks to the threat of escalating to theater nuclear warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-realities-versus-the-laws-of-war&quot;&gt;Russian Realities Versus the Laws of War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, such Russian attacks provide all too clear a demonstration of the fact that future combat is likely to involve more intense and deliberate attacks on civilian targets in spite of the “laws” of war. The war in Ukraine is also scarcely unique. Virtually all recent lower-level conflicts have involved attacks on civil targets – often by terrorists or in internal civil conflicts, but also by states against states, regimes against parts of their own, or the factions in civil conflicts. With few exceptions, is also clear that the laws of war are unenforceable. Even most of the cases where the attackers lost the war did not result in any special punishment, and little real-world effort has been made to find more effective deterrents to such strikes on civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is striking that Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu openly stated on November 1st, 2022, that Russia was deliberately targeting the Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure in a legitimate effort to reduce the country’s military capacity. He stated that, “With precision-guided strikes, we continue to effectively hit military infrastructure facilities, as well as facilities that affect the reduction of Ukraine’s military potential.” The most Shoigu did to imply any restraint was to state that, “Comprehensive measures are being taken to prevent the death of Ukrainian citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key legacy of the war in Ukraine from the fighting of 2022/2023 may well be that it demonstrates that relying on unenforceable laws of war to provide real-world security for civilians may sometimes have worse consequences for the civilians involved than having no laws at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a grim reality of modern warfare that other recent conflicts have shown almost any war fought in populated areas or cities involving key lines of communication or involving the use of artillery near population centers and critical infrastructure, will produce serious civilian casualties and amounts of damage to civilian facilities. The same is likely to be true of conflicts against terrorists, extremists, and any other faction that shelters in populated areas and use civilians as some form of shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-between-the-west-politics-and-energy&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” between the West Politics, and Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It currently seems doubtful that any resolution of the war in Ukraine will produce any stable form of peace or fail to lead to enduring confrontation and between Russia and the West and a continuing risk of new forms of active conflict. The current confrontation has already escalated to the level of political and economic warfare and may well be followed by a struggle to modernize and reshape the military forces on each side that has both conventional and nuclear dimensions and gray area clashes and spoiler operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;war-without-combat&quot;&gt;War Without Combat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is important to note that avoiding or minimizing combat is scarcely peace. Russia and the West, are clearly seeking to “subdue the enemy without fighting.” The same is true of the current relations between the U.S. and its strategic partners and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, many “winter wars” are being fought on a political, economic, and ideological level – and by building up national military forces in ways that give them enough strategic leverage to force the opposing side to meet its opponents’ strategic goals without direct combat between them. The versions of these wars between are also generally being fought to change the political and economic behavior of other states rather than conquer them, to keep them from intimidating or forcing given patterns of action on other states, or to make them conform to international standards that are cooperative in nature. As such, some have a massive grand strategic impact on the world even though they are being fought without combat and an effort seeking to dominate or conquer the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other such wars are far more limited. For example, proxy wars can be fought in ways that involve indirect combat. Examples are proxy wars like the West’s military aid to Ukraine, and Russia’s use of mercenaries in Libya and “advisors” in Syria. More generally, they can be fought in the form of spoiler operations that push other parties into fighting, in the form of deployments and exercises that act as military threats, and by using military forces passively to exert political leverage and influence. In practice, military deterrence is simply another a form of warfare: it too exploits the competitive use of military forces to achieve as strategic objective without fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is reflected in the fact that the war in Ukraine has created broad political and economic conflicts between Russia and much of the West. Both sides have steadily escalated their political and economic conflict since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Putin has responded by mobilizing Russia, carrying out a major political campaign against the West, denouncing the U.S. and other states for supporting Ukraine, and accusing the United States and other Western powers of seeking to dominate Europe and isolate and dismember Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West has responded by building up its military presence in the forward areas of NATO, denouncing Putin, seeking support from the UN in criticizing the Russian attack and conduct of a war in Ukraine with steadily increasing civilian casualties and damage. The West not only is fighting a proxy war against Russia, but it has also launched the equivalent of economic war against Russia, which included halting gas and other imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., Canada, European NATO and EU states, and many other states are now providing arms transfers, security assistance, financial aid, and economic aid to Ukraine while simultaneously waging economic and political war directly against Russia. And, as noted previously, Russia is replying in kind. This form of economic and political warfare, and competing major military build-ups, seems certain to escalate steadily throughout the winter and may well continue for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-broader-forms-of-economic-and-political-warfare&quot;&gt;The Broader Forms of Economic and Political Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Russia nor the West are currently winning the economic and political side of the Ukraine War, nor seem likely to emerge as the winner in the near future. On the one hand, it is all too clear that Putin sharply underestimated the economic and political reaction of Western and many other states prior to his invasion of the Ukraine. There is no doubt that the Russian people have suffered deeply from Western reactions and sanctions. As yet, however, there has been only limited Russian popular resistance to the war, and Putin has escalated his war fighting efforts in spite of Western political and economic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the West has miscalculated as well. It began to implement major economic and political sanctions against Russia immediately after its invasion of the Ukraine. However, Western planners seem to have sharply underestimated Russia’s ability to survive them. They did not foresee the sustained and escalating impact Russia’s reactions would have on European and other energy supplies, on global food exports, on global political divisions, and on Russia’s actual military behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 2022, the economic and political side of this war has escalated to the point where the West keeps adding sanctions and trade and investment barriers, including controls over the critical technologies, components, and materials similar to the war of sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Russia has replied in kind by using its gas exports to sustain its economy, and its ability to limit Ukrainian grain and other food exports by sea – measures that have sharply increased the cost of food to many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Figure One shows that Russia has actually increased its exports to a number of countries that support Ukraine and has not suffered nearly as much as some planners initially estimated in developing sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-energy-war-as-an-indicator-of-the-seriousness-of-economic-warfare&quot;&gt;The Energy War as an Indicator of the Seriousness of Economic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade war and political and economic sanctions are only a part of this story. Figure Two shows that Russia has successfully retaliated against NATO and the other outside powers supporting Ukraine by conducting an energy war that has done critical damage to many Western economies. This energy war has interacted with impact of COVID and other Western economic problems that COVID helped create. The end result is that the West may have suffered as much as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Russia has had some success in working with OPEC – and states as divided as Iran and Saudi Arabia – to place limits on global exports that help support its position. This has helped raise energy prices in virtually every Western and energy importing state and has succeeded in creating a level of inflation and other economic damage to the West which is roughly equivalent to the damage the West has done to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy war has also had many negative impacts on the rest of the world. It has again interacted with the impact of COVID, an uncertain global financial situation, and the damage done by global climate change. It has helped create a broader global crisis in food supplies, the rising levels of international poverty now reported by the UN and World Bank, and internal and local wars on a global basis. It is all too clear from this aspect of the War in Ukraine that there is no global “village,” but there clearly is “globalism” in the form of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear way to predict the future impacts of this energy warfare during the winter of 2022-2023, or how it may develop in the months and years that will follow. However, the war’s impact on Russian energy exports and the global cost of oil and gas has already been critical and may lead to major strategic changes in the flow of energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in the annual World Energy Outlook for October 2022 that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is in the middle of a global energy crisis of unprecedented depth and complexity. Europe is at the center of this crisis, but it is having major implications for markets, policies and economies worldwide. As so often is the case, the poorest and most vulnerable are likely to suffer most. The strains did not begin with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but they have been sharply exacerbated by it. Extraordinarily high prices are sparking a reappraisal of energy policies and priorities. The Europe-Russia energy relationship lies in tatters, calling into question the viability of decades of fossil fuel infrastructure and investment decisions built on this foundation. A profound reorientation of international energy trade is underway, bringing new market risks even as it addresses longstanding vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of the contours of this new world are not yet fully defined, but there is no going back to the way things were. And we know from past energy crises that the process of adjustment is unlikely to be a smooth one. That adjustment will also be taking place in the context of commitments made by governments to clean energy transitions. A central theme of this World Energy Outlook 2022 is how the levers of technological change and innovation, trade and investment and behavioral shifts might drive a secure transition towards a net zero emissions energy system, while minimizing the potential risks and trade-offs between various policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s energy crisis shares some parallels with the 1970s oil price shocks, but there are also important differences. The crises in the 1970s were concentrated in oil markets and the global economy was much more dependent on oil than it is today. However, the intensity of use of other fossil fuels has not declined to the same extent; for natural gas it has risen in many cases. The global nature of the current crisis, its spread across all fossil fuels and the knock-on effects on electricity prices are all warning signs of broader economic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having far-reaching implications for households, businesses and entire economies, prompting short-term responses from governments as well as a deeper debate about the ways to reduce the risk of future disruptions and promote energy security. This is a global crisis, but Europe is the main theatre in which it is playing out, and natural gas is center stage – especially during the coming northern hemisphere winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High energy prices are causing a huge transfer of wealth from consumers to producers, back to the levels seen in 2014 for oil, but entirely unprecedented for natural gas. High fuel prices account for 90% of the rise in the average costs of electricity generation worldwide, natural gas alone for more than 50%. The costs of renewables and carbon dioxide have played only a marginal role, underscoring that this is a crisis where energy transitions are the solution, rather than the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Price and economic pressures mean that the number of people without access to modern energy is rising for the first time in a decade. Around 75 million people who recently gained access to electricity are likely to lose the ability to pay for it, and 100 million people may revert to the use of traditional biomass for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There remain huge uncertainties over how this energy crisis will evolve and for how long fossil fuel prices will remain elevated, and the risks of further energy disruption and geopolitical fragmentation are high. In all our scenarios, price pressures and a dim near-term outlook for the global economy feed through into lower energy demand than in last year’s Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the loss of its largest export market in Europe, Russia faces the prospect of a much-diminished role in international energy affairs. 2021 proves to be a high-water mark for Russian export flows. Its share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30% in 2021, falls to 15% by 2030 in the STEPS and to 10% in the APS. Importers in China have been actively contracting for liquefied natural gas, and there is no room in China’s projected gas balance for another large-scale pipeline from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends in this energy war through early November 2022 are shown in Figure Two, and it is clear that the rise in energy prices through the late fall of 2022 illustrates the overall success of Russia’s ability to conduct economic warfare and the risks it may impose for the future. It should be stressed, however, that there is no way to predict the future extent to which Russia and OPEC states will cooperate, nor whether Russia may make a major effort to shift its energy exports from pipelines to northern Europe to pipelines to China and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such shifts in Russian exports to China would take time to make and major new pipelines to China would be highly expensive, require gas exports to be liquified, and tie Russia to a single customer, and present potential issues in dealing with climate change to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, estimates of future Chinese oil and gas demand by the International Energy Agency indicate that if Russia did shift its export capabilities to provide far larger exports to China, China would become a major Russian customer well beyond 2030. Moreover, any analyses of China’s strategic vulnerabilities do indicate that obtaining energy imports that did not pass through the Indian Ocean, Straits, and South China Sea could greatly reduce one of its key vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that there is one area where such a war might have global benefits, but such benefits are questionable. Some analysts also feel that the energy crisis may help speed reductions in the global use of fossil fuel as well. However, the IEA stressed in its October 2022 estimates that reaching zero emissions by 2050 would require clean energy investments higher than $4 trillion by 2030. It also estimated that currently planned investments would only reach half of that figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-conventional-build-ups-by-the-us-nato-and-russia&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Conventional Build-Ups by the U.S., NATO, and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of semantics as to whether an arms race should be described as political or as military warfare, and the answer is probably both. The same is true of arms control, which generally is as much a battle for political influence, and the ability to use military forces as political leverage, as any move towards peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the War in the Ukraine has already shown Russia and the world that Russian conventional military forces have serious weaknesses, has helped lead to a new and more proactive NATO strategy, and led key Western nations like Germany and Britain to call for major increases in military spending. It has also led the United States to put more emphasis on NATO at a time it sees China as its primary threat and adopt a strategy that calls for major new efforts in military reform and modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. made this clear in the new National Security Strategy that it issued in October 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alongside our allies and partners, America is helping to make Russia’s war on Ukraine a strategic failure. Across Europe, NATO and the European Union are united in standing up to Russia and defending shared values. We are constraining Russia’s strategic economic sectors, including defense and aerospace, and we will continue to counter Russia’s attempts to weaken and destabilize sovereign nations and undermine multilateral institutions. Together with our NATO Allies, we are strengthening our defense and deterrence, particularly on the eastern flank of the Alliance. Welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will further improve our security and capabilities. And we are renewing our focus on bolstering our collective resilience against shared threats from Russia, including asymmetric threats. More broadly, Putin’s war has profoundly diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other Asian powers such as India and Japan. Moscow’s soft power and diplomatic influence have waned, while its efforts to weaponize energy have backfired. The historic global response to Russia’s war against Ukraine sends a resounding message that countries cannot enjoy the benefits of global integration while trampling on the core tenets of the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While some aspects of our approach will depend on the trajectory of the war in the Ukraine, a number of elements are already clear. First, the United States will continue to support Ukraine in its fight for its freedom, we will help Ukraine recover economically, and we will encourage its regional integration with the European Union. Second, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory and will continue to build and deepen a coalition with allies and partners to prevent Russia from causing further harm to European security, democracy, and institutions. Third, the United States will deter and, as necessary, respond to Russian actions that threaten core U.S. interests, including Russian attacks on our infrastructure and our democracy. Fourth, Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning. The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons. America retains an interest in preserving strategic stability and developing a more expansive, transparent, and verifiable arms control infrastructure to succeed New START and in rebuilding European security arrangements which, due to Russia’s actions, have fallen in to disrepair. Finally, the United States will sustain and develop pragmatic modes of interaction to handle issues on which dealing with Russia can be mutually beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new National Security Strategy also made it clear that the U.S was returning to a broader emphasis on supporting European security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe has been, and will continue to be, our foundational partner in addressing the full range of global challenges. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are broadening and deepening the transatlantic bond – strengthening NATO, raising the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and standing with our European allies and partners in defense of the rules-based system that underpins our security, prosperity, and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, Europe stands at the front lines of the fight to defend the principles of freedom, sovereignty, and non-aggression, and we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure that freedom prevails. America remains unequivocally committed to collective defense as enshrined in NATO’s Article 5 and will work alongside our NATO Allies to deter, defend against, and build resilience to aggression and coercion in all its forms. As we step up our own sizable contributions to NATO capabilities and readiness – including by strengthening defensive forces and capabilities, and upholding our long-standing commitment to extended deterrence – we will count on our Allies to continue assuming greater responsibility by increasing their spending, capabilities, and contributions. European defense investments, through or complementary to NATO, will be critical to ensuring our shared security at this time of intensifying competition. We stand behind NATO’s continued adaptation to modern security challenges, including its emphasis on defense in cyberspace, climate security, and the growing security risks presented by the PRC’s policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new U.S. strategy document described support of the Ukraine in terms close to support of continuing NATO aid at a level equivalent to proxy warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe has been, and will continue to be, our foundational partner in addressing the full range of global challenges. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are broadening and deepening the transatlantic bond – strengthening NATO, raising the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and standing with our European allies and partners in defense of the rules-based system that underpins our security, prosperity, and values. Today, Europe stands at the front lines of the fight to defend the principles of freedom, sovereignty, and non-aggression, and we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure that freedom prevails. America remains unequivocally committed to collective defense as enshrined in NATO’s Article 5 and will work alongside our NATO Allies to deter, defend against, and build resilience to aggression and coercion in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we step up our own sizable contributions to NATO capabilities and readiness – including by strengthening defensive forces and capabilities, and upholding our long-standing commitment to extended deterrence – we will count on our Allies to continue assuming greater responsibility by increasing their spending, capabilities, and contributions. European defense investments, through or complementary to NATO, will be critical to ensuring our shared security at this time of intensifying competition.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putting-the-conventional-military-balance-in-perspective&quot;&gt;Putting the Conventional Military Balance in Perspective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet, there are no clear Russian plans to correct the many weaknesses the War in the Ukraine has revealed in its forces. It is clear, however, that Russia must be making such plans, and will take a much more competitive stance to shaping forces that can influence, deter, and – if necessary – fight NATO and Western supported countries. Putin’s speeches have made this all too clear, and Russia would in any case have to make major efforts to restructure and modernize its forces just to keep up with the many new advances in weaponry and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., Canada, and NATO European states must make similar changes. They not only must compete with Russia, but also most must compensate for years of decline in the size of their forces, rates of modernization, and any real-world effort to improve interoperability either within their forces or by providing new forces and capabilities to match the changes in the most advanced national forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of the Ukraine has shown all too clearly that most NATO countries have underestimated the Russian threat and have taken excessive “peace dividends” in terms of cuts in their defense efforts since 1992. Most former Warsaw Pact states that are now in NATO, and on or near the borders of Russia have failed to properly convert and modernize their forces to fight as part of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, most NATO countries also failed to take effective steps to correct this situation after Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. They never met NATO’s goal of spending 2% of their GDP on military forces, and those that did found that this goal was too low to properly modernize, and maintain, readiness and force size. Seen with the hindsight provided by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO countries generally came closer to “farce” planning than force planning. So far, neither NATO nor any NATO country have made their plans to deal with this situation clearly. They do not publish meaningful force plans, net assessments, or projected budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is no current way to know how well either Russia or NATO countries will engage in the “war” to modernize their forces and make them more effective, although Russia is clearly attempting to increase its influence and military role in Belarus and Moldova. The broad structure of U.S., European NATO, and Russian conventional military balance is shown in Figure Three, along with the forces of China which is the core of another winter war discussed later in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of traditional comparison of personnel and major weapons strength does not, however, approach a meaningful net assessment. It does not cover the wide range of competition for economic power, dominance in technology, and the capability to fund military competition between the United State and its strategic partners, Russia, and China. This analysis is far too long to include in this analysis, but it is summarized in a different study entitled Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not reflect the scale and impact of the massive cuts in the military forces of the former Soviet Union as shrank to become Russia, or the equally serious cuts in the forces that NATO countries deployed in Europe in 1992. It only compares key elements of force size based on active personnel and major weapons platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it does not compare training, other elements of readiness, sustainment and warfighting reserves, military industrial and technology bases, deployments and power projection capabilities, and interoperability. It also does not show comparative modernization and the massive shifts taking place in the role of battle management and secure communications, space, cyber, smart and long-range munitions, artificial intelligence, joint all-domain capabilities, and all the other emerging and disruptive technologies that are reshaping military forces on a global basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such force comparisons help put the military dimension of the winter wars in perspective, but they also have serious limits. In many ways, traditional force comparisons are the equivalent of the kind of military analysis that focus only on infantry and cavalry before World War I, or that ignored the new role of armor, air power, and changes in the role of sea power before World War II. Put generously, traditional military strength analysis probably only addresses about 20% of modern military capability, and much of the “war” in the restructuring of Russian and NATO conventional forces triggered by the ongoing war in Ukraine will parallel the changes triggered by shifts in nuclear forces, dual capable forces, and precision conventional strike capabilities discussed later in this analysis. They will play out over the coming decades as a revolution in military forces that no one can currently predict and fully characterize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukraine-war-and-the-conventional-arms-race&quot;&gt;The Ukraine War and the Conventional Arms Race&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are very real financial limits on what both sides can spend on improving and modernizing their conventional military forces, and the economic war between Russia and the West will have a major impact on their spending. The improvements in military capability that both sides must now make are also driven by the need to make very costly improvements in their military forces and will probably involve the need to higher percentages of total national GDPs over the period of a decade or more. This will inevitably increase the competition over military spending versus spending on civilian programs and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly true of Russia. The military and economic cost of the war in Ukraine alone has already reached levels which the Russian leadership almost certainly grossly underestimated in launching the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to Western states and their strategic partners of their military and economic support for Ukraine has also been far higher than political leaders anticipated in shaping their initial aid plans. The rises in prices for energy and other imports mentioned earlier have raised inflation to critical levels, and there already have been political calls for less aid to Ukraine and broader political indications that NATO countries are cutting back on their plans to modernize and improve their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, however, is now far poorer than its Western challengers. Once again, the full range of trends involved is too complex to show in this analysis and is provided in a separate report called Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment. One metric alone, however, shows how serious the economic challenges Russia faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimates that the U.S. alone had a GDP of $22.966 trillion in current dollars in 2021, the EU had a GDP of $17.089 trillion, and NATO estimates that NATO Europe and Canada had a GDP of some $22.687 billion. The World Bank estimates that Russia only had a GDP of $1.776 billion in 2021, which scarcely makes it an economic superpower in global terms. Unlike the U.S. its only major strategic partner is Belarus, which had a GDP of only $0.682 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracies do have to respond to popular civil demands by paying far more of their government income to meet civil needs, but NATO’s total estimated GDP in 2021 was $45,653 trillion, some 26 times the Russia GDP of $1.776 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are no reliable ways to compare the publicly reported military spending of command economies like Russia or China – which often conceal key aspects of national security spending – with the relatively open and reliable reporting of Western states. If one looks at some of the best and most directly comparable estimates of military spending, however, NATO reports that the U.S. spent $793.99 billion on military forces in 2021, and NATO Europe spent $361.29 billion for a NATO total of some $1,096.6 billion. In contrast, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that Russia spent only $62.2 billion by the NATO definition of defense spending. This is only 5.7% of the reported total for NATO, which is 17 times the Russian figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, these GDP and military spending figures indicate that Russia is anything but a superpower in economic strength and military spending military. This becomes even more clear if one looks at the GDP and military spending of China and America’s key Asian strategic partners as additional standards of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimated that China had a GDP of $17,734 billion in current dollars, while key Asian strategic partners like Japan had a GDP of $4,937 billion and South Korea had $1,799 billion. These figures show that the World Bank estimated that China’s GDP was almost exactly ten times larger than Russia’s. If one looks at the IISS military spending estimates, the IISS indicates that China’s official military spending figure was $207 billion and was $270 billion by NATO’s definition. The $270 billion figure indicates that China was spending 4.5 times as much on military forces as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comparisons are critical because it seems likely that the winter of 2022-2023 will mark the beginning of a lasting military confrontation between Russia and NATO, and a race to modernize and improve military forces that will last at least as long as Putin is in power. If the previous economic and military spending figures do represent real comparative power, they indicate that the funding of such a race to improve the military capabilities could sharply favor the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also illustrate why the U.S. and Western effort to support Ukraine is so important, and so cost-effective. The U.S. aloe had sent well over $50 billion in military, humanitarian, and civil aid by November 2022 – scarcely a minor sum – and it was clear that the Ukraine would be dependent on outside aid indefinitely to both continue fighting and recover from the war after any settlement. The cost to Russia, however, was far greater and placed a burden on a far weaker economy – to the point where it was pushing Russia into the status of a second level military power. At the same time, it sent a critical message to China about U.S. strength and resolve that was equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. national security strategy issued in October 2022 singled out China as the primary threat to the U.S., and several key U.S. security partners in NATO – notably Britain – have recently focused on China. Funding a “race” to modernize NATO will be limited by the fact that the U.S. and some strategic partners must also focus on China and other threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some experts question whether the current estimates of Russian military spending are too low. Russia has the potential military advantage of unity and a totalitarian leadership that can exert direct control over a command economy and do so with far less need to respond to popular civil needs. Although Russia also has suffered major losses in the fighting in Ukraine and has used up many of its reserves of weapons, munitions, and parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, NATO countries will enter the winter of 2022-2023 with major civil economic problems, and new popular demands for government spending that seem likely to limit member country military spending. NATO will also begin the broader Ukrainian War arms race having taken larger peace dividends over the last two decades, and with 30 (32?) member countries that have radically different force structures, poor overall interoperability, and radically different trends in real world force modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the unclassified data on the Russia military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, are very limited. While it is not clear that this is still the case, it is also important to remember that Cold War intelligence estimates of the military expenditures of the Soviet Union were later shown to be gross underestimates of the actual spending as the West gained access to the Soviet Union. The same was true of the Soviet Union’s military research and development activities, and the size and efficiency of its military industries – many of which provide to be far larger – and at the same time less efficient – than expert estimated during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data are available on the U.S. and Western military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, but a close example indicates that many seemingly comparable data are not truly comparable, and that there are many gaps in coverage, particularly on actual programs, ongoing active activities, and any credible measures of effectiveness. It is also clear from the history of many national efforts that quantity is not a measure of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-warin-precision-strike-capabilities-airmissile-defense-and-emergingdisruptive-technologies&quot;&gt;The “Winter War”in Precision Strike Capabilities, Air/Missile Defense, and Emerging/Disruptive Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is also important to put any such arms races in the proper context. Advances in military technology will have their own influence and all of the world’s major powers will have to compete in making major expenditures on new military technology, weapons, and new forms of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine have shown that new conventional weapons with precision strike capability, and advances in targeting and related forms of intelligence, can make a major difference in both military combat and in strike civilian targets. These weapons range from short-range systems like anti-tank missiles and drones to long range missiles and launch platforms ranging from hand-held weapons to theater-wide strike capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and a number of European states already have long-range precision conventional strike systems that can destroy critical infrastructure and high value targets, and all of the world’s major powers are working on the development of new longer-range ballistic, cruise, and new approach to strike technology. Other developments include other related advances in precision strike capabilities against critical civil and military systems, advances in many forms of targeting, and the deployment of steadily more to advanced 5th generation aircraft, in multi-platform weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost inevitably, these advances in strike systems mean that missile and air defenses will be a matching source of competition, and another form of “war.” As is discussed shortly, the advances in precision strike also creates the risk that many new systems may acquire dual capability and nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the more advanced current defense systems like the Russian S-400 and the U.S. Patriot have serious increase limits and there are good reasons why Ukraine had steadily increased its calls for more advanced air and missile defenses, why Russia will seek to speed up the development of its new systems and why the U.S. and NATO Europe must now seriously consider major near-term investment in effective theater defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also highlighted the vulnerability of existing armor, the need for more advanced artillery, the vulnerability of ships to missiles, and a host of other advances in secure communications, battle management, logistic support systems. They also interact with a wide range of new military technologies that affect the use of space, cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, and other emerging and “disruptive” technologies that can do far more to integrate every aspect of military operations and forms of joint all-domain operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these advances are cheap, but some deployments have already begun, and they may amount to a near revolution in military force structures and operations over the coming decade. This means the competition in the development and deployment of high technology military capabilities and systems will be a form of “warfare” where selecting the right mix of improvements could give one side a major advantage in terms of both deterrence and strategic leverage in peacetime, and where making the right investments selectively will be critical in shaping both deterrence and the nature of any actual warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2022-2023 is not likely to produce major new developments in these areas, but each round of Russian missile attacks and every expansion of the target base does increase NATO’s need to move more quickly, invest more, and develop some coherent plans for deployment in all four areas. Like many other aspects of the “winter war,” the fighting already is a major catalyst in shaping global arms races and one where it seems less and less likely that the world will return to anything like the levels of pre-Ukraine War stability, peace dividends, and arms control that had
existed since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-inrussia-us-and-western-and-chinese-nuclear-forces&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” inRussia, US and Western, and Chinese Nuclear Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges will also be further increased by yet another form of winter war. Russia has raised the issue of tactical nuclear warfare in the Ukraine War, and this is only a small part of the near collapse of many forms of nuclear arms control, and a steadily heightening nuclear arms that has reached the point where the competition in global strategic weapons has shifted from a competition between the U.S. and Russia to one that includes China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, Russia, the U.S., Britain, France, and China became involved in a major nuclear modernization effort long before the Ukraine War began. Here, a substantial amount of official unclassified data are available. The total nuclear weapons holdings of Russia, the U.S., Britain, France, and other powers are summarized in Figure Four. U.S. nuclear modernization plans are summarized in Figure Five, and Russian and Chinese plans are summarized in Figure Five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed that the summaries in Figures Four, Five, and Six use unclassified material developed in 2021, and their contents may differ significantly from current intelligence estimates, as well as from outside analysts who produced Figures Four and Five, which include Hans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Robert Norris, and Amy F. Wolf of the Congressional Research Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for China are particularly uncertain, since comparatively little unclassified detail is available on Chinese nuclear weapons developments. However, there have been reports that China has built three new fields of at least 250 new missile silos, and now has three new fast breeder reactors it can use to increase its production of Plutonium and nuclear weapons. Reports have also surfaced that China will actively participate in adapting different types of theater and tactical nuclear weapons to provide proven, functional nuclear warheads for the newer missile systems of Russia, China, and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the data for 2022 in Figure Five show, the War in the Ukraine has given Russian nuclear efforts a new and higher profile. Its importance has also been highlighted by the fact Putin has talked about “dirty” radiological bombs and made repeated references to the use of theater nuclear weapons, in his public speeches on the Ukraine War. Reports have also been made that Russian generals have begun to seriously discuss tactical and theater nuclear options, and members of the U.S. Congress have debated the need for new nuclear armed cruise missiles as a possible counter to such Russian weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear what holdings Russia and each NATO country now have of operational weapons because many are in storage, but unclassified estimates in Figure Four indicate that Russia has close to 2,000 theater and tactical nuclear weapons out of an inventory of as many as nearly 4,500 stored weapons, and the U.S. has some 3,750.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear that nuclear weapons represent the one major area where Russia is still a true superpower in military terms. The Ukraine war has made its weakness in conventional forces all too clear, and current estimates of its research and development resources indicate that it cannot compete with the West in military technology, or with the rising technology base of China. It does, however, have major holds of nuclear weapons that it inherited from the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some aspects of such estimates are uncertain – particularly for China; the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) is almost certainly broadly correct in estimating that Russia had some 6,257 nuclear weapons in its total inventory in 2021. This compared with 5,550 for the U.S., 350 for China, 225 for Britain, 290 for France, 160 for India, 165 for Pakistan, 90 for Israel, and 45 for North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s holdings also give it the ability to deploy large numbers of theater/tactical nuclear weapons, although the figures involved are uncertain. An unclassified estimate by the FAS indicates that Russia had 2,565 strategic nuclear warheads and 1,912 non-strategic and defensive force warheads in early 2022 and reported that some experts felt the latter number might double 2030. It also listed possible deployments of tactical and theater weapons in naval, air, land, and missile defense forces, and a wide range of possible delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no similar estimates of the holdings of non-strategic weapons by most other states, but the FAS does indicate that the U.S. may be the only power with large holdings that could be rapidly adapted for theater and tactical use. It could draw upon 2,000 nuclear in storage and 1,750 more weapons awaiting dismantlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAS also reports that the U.S. had 100 B-61 nuclear bombs in Europe for F-16, F-18, Tornado, and F-35 combat aircraft with yields from 50 KT to 170 KT and is adapting some strategic weapons to have a lower yield option that could be used for theater and tactical targeting. It states that, “Belgian, Dutch, German, and Italian air forces are assigned nuclear strike missions with US nuclear weapons.” It reports France had some 300 variable yield nuclear weapons – three sets of 16 for its submarines and 54 cruise missiles for carrier and land-based Rafale delivery systems which could be used for both strategic and theater strikes. It does not report Britain as having tactical or theater nuclear weapons and indicate all of its weapons are for its SSBNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arms Control Association reports that the United States has some 100 B-61 nuclear gravity bombs, and that that are forward-deployed at six NATO bases in five European countries: Aviano and Ghedi in Italy; Büchel in Germany; Incirlik in Turkey; Kleine Brogel in Belgium; and Volkel in the Netherlands. Another 130 U.S. B-61s are in inventory. France and Britain also may have low yield or other nuclear weapons in storage that could be used or modified for theater use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, a situation already exists where there is a revival of active competition in the deployment of theater nuclear forces as forms of military leverage and a higher – if still limited – risk of their use actual warfare fighting. It is also clear that the future of arms control is highly uncertain, and that Russia has on obvious incentive to try to use its nuclear weapons to obtain political and military leverage. Combined with the faltering progress in arms control and the fact the U.S must now compete with China as well as Russia, the War in the Ukraine again highlights the fact that there is another kind of Winter War, and one that potentially is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Seems to be more than doubling its stockpile of nuclear weapons. May have risen from around 200 to 350 by 2020. 272 operational for exiting missiles and bombs and 78 for new systems. Possibly grew by 118 warheads during 2020-2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-china-from-cooperation-and-competition-to-confrontation-and-active-war-planning&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in China: From Cooperation and Competition to Confrontation and Active War Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is clear that the levels of tension between China and the U.S and several of its strategic partners have created yet another form of winter war. While the active combat in Ukraine has gotten more public attention than the growing level of political, economic, and military confrontation between China and the US and its European and Asian strategic partners, the extent of political and economic warfare between the U.S. and China is nearly as great, and the current level of military confrontation between the U.S. and China has received at least as much attention in U.S. strategic and war planning as the confrontation between the U.S. and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of tension between China and the West has also increased sharply as the world has entered the winter of 2022-2023. President Xi Jinping clearly emerged at the dominant leader of China at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 and made it clear that he was committed to make China the dominant economic and military power in the world, and to expanding its political role and leverage on a global basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-china-in-the-new-us-national-security-strategy&quot;&gt;The Role of China in the New U.S. National Security Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Strategy issued October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. now sees China as the primary threat to its security, and more in terms of war than any real intention to emphasize cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Defense Strategy advances a strategy focused on the PRC ,and on collaborating with our growing network of Allies and partners on common objectives. It seeks to prevent the PRC’s dominance of key regions while protecting the U.S. homeland and reinforcing a stable and open international system. Consistent with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, a key objective is to dissuade the PRC from considering aggression as a viable means of advancing goals that threaten vital U.S. national security interests. Conflict with the PTC is neither inevitable or desirable. The Department’s priorities support broader whole-of-government efforts to develop terms of interaction with the PRC that are favorable to our interests and values, while managing strategic competition and enabling the pursuit of cooperation on common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences, The PRC seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and leverage its growing strength and military footprint to coerce its neighbors and threaten their interests, The PRC’s increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. This is part of a broader pattern of destabilizing and coercive Chinese behavior that stretches across the East China Sea, and along the Line of Actual Control. The PRC has expanded and modernized nearly every aspect of the PLA, with a focus on offsetting U.S. military advantages. The PRC is therefore the pacing challenge for the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power. It is using its technological capacity and increasing influence over international institutions to create more permissive conditions for its own authoritarian model, and to mold global technology use and norms to privilege its interests and values. Beijing frequently uses its economic power to coerce countries. It benefits from the openness of the international economy while limiting access to its domestic market, and it seeks to make the world more dependent on the PRC while reducing its own dependence on the world. The PRC is also investing in a military that is rapidly modernizing, increasingly capable in the Indo-Pacific, and growing in strength and reach globally – all while seeking to erode U.S. alliances in the region and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…Our strategy toward the PRC is threefold: 1) to invest in the foundations of our strength at home – our competitiveness, our innovation, our resilience, our democracy, 2) to align our efforts with our network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause, and 3) compete responsibly with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the future. The first two elements – invest and align – are described in the previous section and are essential to out-competing the PRC in the technological, economic, political, military, intelligence, and global governance domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Competition with the PRC is most pronounced in the Indo-Pacific, but it is also increasingly global. Around the world, the contest to write the rules of the road and shape the relationships that govern global affairs is playing out in every region and across economics, technology, diplomacy, development, security, and global governance. In the competition with the PRC, as in other arenas, it is clear that the next ten years will be the decisive decade. We stand now at the inflection point, where the choices we make and the priorities we pursue today will set us on a course that determines our competitive position long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of our allies and partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific, stand on the frontlines of the PRC’s coercion and are rightly determined to seek to ensure their own autonomy, security, and prosperity. We will support their ability to make sovereign decisions in line with their interests and values, free from external pressure, and work to provide high-standard and scaled investment, development assistance, and markets. Our strategy will require us to partner with, support, and meet the economic and development needs of partner countries, not for the sake of competition, but for their own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will act in common purpose to address a range of issues – from untrusted digital infrastructure and forced labor in supply chains and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We will hold Beijing accountable for abuses – genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, human rights violations in Tibet, and the dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms – even as it seeks to pressure countries and communities into silence. We will continue prioritizing investments in a combat credible military that deters aggression against our allies and partners in the region, and can help those allies and partners defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-chinese-ties-to-russia&quot;&gt;Growing Chinese Ties to Russia?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, serious questions exist about the extent to which U.S. and other security efforts to deal with China can be separated from those necessary to deal with Russia. Although most experts feel there are serious limits to the level of “friendship” and alliance between the two countries, this is far from certain. For example, Japan’s 2022 defense white paper notes that Russian and Chinese overflights and naval exercises have sharply increased in the areas north of Japan and treats them as a serious potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Strategy, issued in October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. sees both China and Russia as major threats to the international order, although it views such threats as different in character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly….The most pressing strategic challenge facing our vision is from powers that layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy. It is their behavior that poses a challenge to international peace and stability – especially waging or preparing for wars of aggression, actively undermining the democratic political processes of other countries, leveraging technology and supply chains for coercion and repression, and exporting an illiberal model of international order. Many non-democracies join the world’s democracies in forswearing these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) do not. Russia and the PRC pose different challenges. Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown. The PRC, by contrast, is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… we recognize that globalization has delivered immense benefits for the United States and the world but an adjustment is now required to cope with dramatic global changes such as widening inequality within and among countries, the PRC’s emergence as both our most consequential competitor and one of our largest trading partners, and emerging technologies that fall outside the bounds of existing rules and regulations. We have an affirmative agenda for the global economy to seize the full range of economic benefits of the 21st century while advancing the interests of American workers. Recognizing we have to move beyond traditional Free Trade Agreements, we are charting new economic arrangements to deepen economic engagement with our partners, like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF); a global minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share of tax wherever they are based in the world; the Partnership for Global Investment and Infrastructure (PGII) to help low- and middle-income countries secure high-standard investment for critical infrastructure; updated rules of the road for technology, cyberspace, trade, and economics; and ensuring the transition to clean energy unlocks economic opportunities and good jobs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The world is now at an inflection point. This decade will be decisive, in setting the terms of our competition with the PRC, managing the acute threat posed by Russia, and in our efforts to deal with shared challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and economic turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also made it clear since at least the early 1990s that its military build-up is focused largely on the U.S., the Pacific, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Middle East. It has cooperated with Russia in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization since the days when it was the Shanghai Five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also based much of its military modernization on Russian weapons and technology, and Japan’s 2022 defense white paper notes that Russian and Chinese overflights and naval exercises have sharply increased in the areas north of Japan and treats them as a serious potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems likely that Russia will ultimately emerge from the war in the Ukraine in greater need of a major outside strategic partners, China and Russia could both gain from a stronger partnership in the strategic aspects of their wars in energy, economics, and technology, and building up their military strength in gaining military leverage and in the event of any serious regional or theater conflict. It is true that authoritarian regimes tend to seek partnerships that serve the ambitions of their individual leader, but in this case that ambitions may increasingly coincide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-military-build-up&quot;&gt;China’s Military Build-Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does seem to be far more successful than Russia in moving towards the point where it can compete directly with the U.S. and its strategic partners in conventional military power. The new U.S. strategy describes China’s efforts to improve its conventional military forces in terms that describe them as focusing on all the major elements of the U.S. effort to improve its conventional military forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to expanding its conventional forces, the PRC is rapidly advancing and integrating its space, counterspace, electronic, and informational warfare capabilities to support its holistic approach to joint warfare. The PLA seeks to target the ability of the Joint Force to project power to defend vital U.S. interests and our Allies in a crisis or conflict. The PRC is also expanding the PLA’s global footprint and working to establish a more robust overseas and basing infrastructure to allow it to project power at greater distances. In parallel, the PRC is accelerating the modernization and expansion of its nuclear capabilities. The United States and its Allies and partners will increasingly face the challenge of deterring two major powers with modern and diverse nuclear capabilities – the PRC and Russia – creating new stress on strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has already made significant progress in achieving parity with the U.S. The conventional balance shown earlier in Figure Three reflects massive increases in China’s conventional military strength since 1990, and these numbers only show a comparatively small part of the massive Chinese shift away from a reliance on creating the largest possible ground forces to defend Chinese territory in 1990 to creating land, naval forces, and air forces as modern or more modern that U.S. forces. China has been creating major power projection capabilities in the Pacific and Indian Ocean since at least the md-1990s, and China has published a variety of unclassified defense white papers and strategies that make it clear that it is seeking to become superior in its ability to use the most advanced emerging and disruptive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unclassified series of estimates of the growth of Chinese sea power relative to U.S. sea power is shown in Figure Seven, and shows that China is not only becoming a major blue water navy, but could also overtake the US Navy in numbers. While Chinese ships would generally be smaller, they do not need the ability to project power across the entire Pacific over long periods of time that the U.S. Navy must provide, and work by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and General Accountability Office (GAO) warn that the U.S. Navy may have significantly overestimated the ship building efforts that current budgets allow it to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Chinese efforts over the past few decades are also reflected in the estimate of the military balance in the northwestern Pacific is shown in Figure Eight. It shows that Chinese, Taiwanese, and U.S. military forces are already postured for a possible war over Taiwan, and the overall level of military confrontation in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Figure Nine shows that unclassified intelligence assessments, and a variety of unclassified studies by outside experts, report that that China is increasing its military spending far more quickly than Russia, and Figure Ten highlights a Japanese official estimate of how the increases in Chinese military spending are affecting some key aspects of the regional balance by showing the rising totals of modern Chinese naval surface vessels, submarines, and combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures Nine and Ten show that China and Xi can also draw upon a far stronger economic base and level of military spending in stepping up such competition than Putin can in Russia. China is also making a far larger annual investment in technology and a far higher level of manufacturing capability. These affect many aspects of its comparative military industrial base and ability to eventually match the U.S. and West’s technology base – trends that are shown in detail in Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends in latter assessment also show that China’s rapid growth as a global economic trading power, aggressive foreign investment, and state-driven ability to seek economic ties and leverage on global basis – exemplified by its Belt and Road Initiative – have made it a much more serious challenger than Russia, although its action have alienated a number of states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s future growth does, however, face growing challenges. Its rate of economic growth has diminished since 2021, it has badly mismanaged its effort to deal with COVID, its property market is in a crisis, its labor and manufacturing costs are rising, it is over-regulating its technology sector, unemployment is rising, and its population is aging. Nevertheless, China is still growing sharply as a military and global power, and the U.S. National Security Strategy issued October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. now sees China as the primary threat to its security, and more in terms of war than any real intention to emphasize cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Defense Strategy advances a strategy focused on the PRC ,and on collaborating with our growing network of Allies and partners on common objectives. It seeks to prevent the PRC’s dominance of key regions while protecting the U.S. homeland and reinforcing a stable and open international system. Consistent with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, a key objective is to dissuade the PRC from considering aggression as a viable means of advancing goals that threaten vital U.S. national security interests. Conflict with the PTC is neither inevitable or desirable. The Department’s priorities support broader whole-of-government efforts to develop terms of interaction with the PRC that are favorable to our interests and values, while managing strategic competition and enabling the pursuit of cooperation on common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences, The PRC seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and leverage its growing strength and military footprint to coerce its neighbors and threaten their interests, The PRC’s increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.

The PRC has expanded and modernized nearly every aspect of the PLA, with a focus on offsetting U.S. military advantages. The PRC is therefore the pacing challenge for the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guessing-at-the-future&quot;&gt;Guessing at the Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reliable way to project the comparative rate of Chinese and U.S. modernization at this point of time. As has already been discussed in the case of Russia, the unclassified data on Chinese military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, are very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is also important to point out that more unclassified data are available on the U.S. and Western military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, but a close example indicates that many seemingly comparable data are not truly comparable, and that there are many gaps in coverage, particularly on actual programs, ongoing active activities, and any credible measures of effectiveness. It is also clear from the history of many national efforts that quantity is not a measure of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available unclassified data do clearly indicate that China’s efforts are now massively greater than Russia. Nevertheless, it is still far from clear when China expects achieve any parity in its conventional forces and power projection capabilities in its areas of primary interest. Chinese national strategy and defense reports have listed a number of possible years for such parity that have extended from the late 2020s to well beyond 2035. In practice, however. China has been careful to qualify their meaning and strategic impact. It also has failed to tie them to future forces levels, success in meeting modernization goals, and levels of defense spending, or any clear intensions to use them for active combat as distinguished from military leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, the full range of U.S. efforts to reshape and modernize its forces to deal with China is also unclear. The full impact of the new strategy on U.S. plans to deal with China and Russia will only begin to become clear when the President submits his new defense budget proposal to Congress early in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., however, is already reshaping its Navy and Marine Corps to deal with the emerging Chinese threat, however, and media reports make it clear that it is conducting a wide range of war games and studies to deal with the possibility of war to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion as well as to support Japan, Australia, South Korea, and other partners and friendly states. The National Security Strategy document notes that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which is critical to regional and global security and prosperity and a matter of international concern and attention. We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, and do not support Taiwan independence. We remain committed to our one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. And we will uphold our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan’s self-defense and to maintain our capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any major conflict or clash between the U.S. and China seems unlikely in the near term, and both President Biden and a top U.S. official in the Department of Defense have stated that war is unlikely in next two years, although he expects the PRC to increase pressure on Taiwan as it expands its military capabilities for an amphibious invasion. Two years, however, is scarcely a long period in strategic terms, and media reports make it clear that the U.S. is conducting war games and exercises to find the best way to deal with a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and is planning for a sudden war over Taiwan and one that could easily escalate to cover much of the South China Sea and the rest of the western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the “Winter War” between the U.S. and China is far more serious at a practical military level than U.S. and Chinese political rhetoric usually indicates and presents a special challenge for the US. The late Andrew Marshal highlighted this challenge early in China’s competition with the U.S. by highlight what he called “countervailing power:” The ability of one side to pressure the other by create a military crisis and build-up that forced the other spend far more of its money and military efforts to meet a challenge than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Taiwan is a clear case in point. Competing at the far end of the Pacific where China normally deploys much of its military power, and over the comparative vast distances the Pacific imposes in terms of power projection, is far more expensive for the U.S. than for China. China could step up the level of force the U.S. needs to compete through relatively simple deployments and at little cost, and it takes relatively minimal risk. A successful U.S. defense of Taiwan would scarcely lead to an invasion of China and would confront the U.S. with having to then sustain a far greater forward military presence tailored to the defense of one strategic partner, while any U.S. failure to defend would undermine its entire strategic position in Asia. The base case for the U.S. is close to the worst case in terms of countervailing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear from the U.S. National Security Strategy that the U.S. sees the expansion of Chinese influence in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf, the rest of the Middle East, and Africa as hostile and as a far broader threat. No one on either side can dismiss that risk of a conflicts somewhere else in the Pacific or Asia, or be certain of the level of theater-wide escalation or intensity of combat that might occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the level of tension over trade, economic policy, and technological espionage has also reached a level of confrontation bordering on economic warfare. China is after all the land of Sun Tzu and has already shown how well it can focus on forms of warfare that rely on economic power and military influence rather than combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it seems likely that if the full range of Western intelligence on Chinese nuclear weapons, and nuclear and dual-capable delivery systems was made public, it might well indicate that China intends to become a far larger nuclear power and one that can directly compete in strength with the U.S. and Russia. Certainly, its improvement in ICBMs and SSBNs, and its development of a wide range of longer range and advanced strike systems will be given far greater capacity than it has had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meeting of President Biden and President XI on November 14th, 2022, tried to put a different face on these developments, and give the impression that the U.S. and China were actively seeking to improve their level of cooperation. In reality, however, it seemed to be largely an attempt to find ways to maintain trade and more limited forms of economic cooperation between two powers that were actively involved in political and economic warfare in many areas than any real progress towards real cooperation and cutbacks in their military build-ups on ongoing levels of political and economic warfare. It was all too clear from the White House statements about the meeting that the meeting did not resolve any key issues, but was designed rather to find some areas where both sides could benefit without making any serious changes in their competition, and that it reflected more of a reaction to the common problems the U.S. and China faced because of COVID and the war in Ukraine than any serious effort to change their strategic positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Xi and the 20th Party Congress, and the new US National Security Strategy issued in October 2022 have already made China part of a “winter war,” and one with all of the same major risks as the “winter war” with Russia. However, this is a combination of military confrontation and political and economic conflict whose intensity has been steadily rising for more than a decade, and that seems just as likely to ensure for years to come as the “winter war” with Putin’s Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-the-middle-east&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in the Middle East&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wide range of other active and potential “winter wars,” most of which preceded the War in Ukraine, and that involve threats and actual conflicts that will continue through the winter of 2022-2023. Many seem certain to continue for years to come. All have the potential to become much worse, however, and their cumulative impact places yet another major burden on U.S. and partner resources and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key center of such “winter wars” is North Africa, the Middle East, and the Persian/Arab Gulf. Algeria and Libya are key centers of instability and civil tension in North Africa. Syria and Iran are key centers of instability in the Middle East, Iraq’s stability and unity is uncertain, and it seems likely that the Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Tigray, Somalia, and Yemen will continue to be flashpoints in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why the U.S. has been actively involved in warfare in the Persian/Arab Gulf region since at least the first Gulf War in 1990, although it was indirectly involved in the Iran-Iraq War during 1980-1988, as well as every major Arab-Israel conflict. It is still involved in the fighting in eastern Syria and support its strategic partners in their fight against terrorism and their deterrence of external threats. Russia is involved in the civil war in Libya and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a purely military viewpoint, Iran is the most current serious regional threat in the region. Its arms race with the Arab Guld states has been a war for political and military leverage. Iran is also a potential nuclear power, and one that may well have completed the design and passive testing of non-fissile nuclear weapons. It can come steadily closer to the production of weapons grade Uranium, and it that may form serious security and economic ties to Russia and China. There is also a risk that Iran may be able to form a more serious security alliance with Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and even a Hezbollah dominated Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are both competing with the U.S., Britain, and France for military influence and leverage in the region. China now has a military base in Djibouti, is playing a major role in the development of Pakistan’s ports and may be seeking to create more serious ties to Iran that include port facilities on its territory outside the Gulf. Russia is buying missiles and drones from Iran and Russian mercenaries have been active in the Libyan civil war. In contrast, U.S. ties to Egypt and the Arab Gulf states are weakening, as is European influence and ability to deploy land and air forces east of Suez. It is also clear that extremist and terrorist movements continue to be a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure Eleven shows, the Middle East and nearby areas in North Africa and Asia are also major centers of terrorism and extremism. The terrorist activities sometimes interact on a regional basis, and most are driven by both failed governance and development, and at least low-level fighting between sects, ethnic groups, and tribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet, these shifts do not seem to pose serious risks of new levels of conflict, but they do have that potential. Moreover, U.S. relations with Turkey do seem to be steadily more distant, and the overall level of development, stability, and security in the region continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-asia-and-the-koreas&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Asia and the Koreas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan conflict seems to be over, although the Taliban have yet to show they can actually govern effectively. However, Asia and the Indian Ocean region present a continuing range of regional and internal security problems and the own range of wars for territory and military influence. China has recently clashed with India. India and Pakistan are steadily arming for another possible round of war, that could involve the use of nuclear weapons. Myanmar is a nightmare of internal conflict and repression, Afghanistan faces major internal instability, and there is a wide range of religious and ethnic tensions that include Chinese repression of the Uyghurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious current risk of a major conflict in the in the region, however, seems to be the rising level of tension and arms race between North Korea and South Korea, which could easily escalate to involve the U.S. and Japan, and possibly Russia and China.An estimate of the conventional military balance in the Koreas is shown in Figure Twelve, but it seems likely that the level of U.S. forces in South Korea would change so quickly if a serious combat began that such a Figure can only provide limited insight into the risks involved. It also does not mention North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of Figure Twelve also warns that North Korea has begun a new kind of “winter war” by sharply increasing its missile firings, and this chart does not include the further massive increases in missile tests, and violations of South Korean territory in October and November of 2022. By early November. North Korea had already launched 86 missiles – an annual record – and fired 23 missiles in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Korean missile tests have illustrated its potential threat to Japan, and to U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam, and North Korea seems to have tested an ICBM-like missile in November 2022, although the test failed. It is clear that North Korea is increasing its nuclear weapons inventory, is making extensive use of its centrifuge facilities to produce more fissile material and may conduct its first nuclear weapon test in years during the winter of 2022-2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, this new level of confrontation does seem to be designed more to use military force to gain influence than present a near-term risk of any major conflict. Nevertheless, the possibility remains of that incident could trigger such a conflict. North Korea’s ties to China, its recent sales of artillery weapons Russia, and the sheer extremism of North Korea’s authoritarian leader are all warnings that such an incident could occur in ways that involve all of the major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-wars-in-gray-area-spoiler-and-proxy-campaigns&quot;&gt;The “Winter Wars” in Gray Area, Spoiler, and Proxy Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to predict what existing or new gray area, spoiler, or proxy campaigns will escalate to the point where they become serious problems for the U.S. or its partners, but many risks already exist – including ones in Latin America and the rest of Africa, and rising tensions with China and Russia will inevitably increase this risk over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Russia’s trade war with the West qualifies as a serious level of gray area operations, as does the West’s proxy war in the Ukraine, and Russia’s more direct proxy roles in Syria and Libya. So does China’s effort to control critical mineral and manufacturing resources in solid state devices, batteries, and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and its strategic partners also have come to realize how serious industrial and technology espionage and efforts to dominate key areas of trade have become, and that these are serious forms of gray area warfare that they have taken actions to address that approach to economic warfare. The same seems to be true of Chinese efforts to control strategic minerals and investment patterns that have been designed to give China added economic leverage, particularly in areas like the materials need for advanced batteries and solid-state devices – area critical to both civil and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-fragile-divided-autonomous-undeveloped-states-and-against-terrorism-and-extremism&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Fragile, Divided, Autonomous Undeveloped States, and Against Terrorism and Extremism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is no doubt that the larger “winter wars” are only part of the overall threat to the developing world, where most states face increasing problems in terms of food supplies, energy imports, and poverty this winter, as well as serious damage from climate change and global warming. These have, however, been increased to some extent by the War in the Ukraine’s impact on food exports and energy costs, and many of these problems are the result of internal tensions and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new U.S. National Security Strategy recognizes the existence of a growing global food crisis and energy problems. The various NGO lists of fragile states also reflect a growing number of what are called “fragile states,” also they often should really be called “failed states” or governments – something that is all too clear when the rankings of “fragile states” are compared with the corruption rankings of Transparency International and the governance rankings of the World Bank. UN estimates of population growth, and various failed state indices of NGOs warn that this is a major problem for poorer and less developed states that gets far too little practical attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global trends in the winter of 2022-2023, and the risk they create of more serious forms of war, are also clear. The IMF World Economic Outlook for 2022, issued in October 2022, warns that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest forecasts project global growth to remain unchanged in 2022 at 3.2 percent and to slow to 2.7 percent in 2023 – 0.2 percentage points lower than the July forecast – with a 25 percent probability that it could fall below 2 percent. More than a third of the global economy will contract this year or next, while the three largest economies – the United States, the European Union, and China – will continue to stall. In short, the worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to powerfully destabilize the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond the escalating and senseless destruction of lives and livelihoods, it has led to a severe energy crisis in Europe that is sharply increasing costs of living and hampering economic activity. Gas prices in Europe have increased more than four-fold since 2021, with Russia cutting deliveries to less than 20 percent of their 2021 levels, raising the prospect of energy shortages over the next winter and beyond. More broadly, the conflict has also pushed up food prices on world markets, despite the recent easing after the Black Sea grain deal, causing serious hardship for low-income households worldwide, and especially so in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Persistent and broadening inflation pressures have triggered a rapid and synchronized tightening of monetary conditions, alongside a powerful appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies. Tighter global monetary and financial conditions will work their way through the economy, weighing demand down and helping to gradually subjugate inflation. So far, however, price pressures are proving quite stubborn and a major source of concern for policymakers. We expect global inflation to peak in late 2022 but to remain elevated for longer than previously expected, decreasing to 4.1 percent by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank warns that while the rise in global poverty caused by COVID may now be declining, this decline is uncertain and that some 75 to 95 additional millions of people are still in a state of dire poverty. Its 2022 Poverty and Prosperity Report indicates that, “nearly half the world – over 3 billion people – lives on less than US $6.85 per day, which is the average of the national poverty lines of upper-middle-income countries,” and that “574 million people – nearly 7 percent of the world’s population – will still be living on less than US $2.15 a day in 2030.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the World Bank list of Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations in FY2022 shown in Figure Thirteen includes so many countries governed by regimes that have failed to develop effectively, have failed to heal the division between their peoples are actively exploited, and/or highly authoritarian and repressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UN Human Development Report for 2022, reports record levels of political polarization, and negative views of the world, and that more than 6 in 7 people polled feel insecure about the level of global progress. It notes that declines on the Human Development Index (HDI) were widespread, with over 90 percent of countries enduring a decline in 2020 or 2021. The Global Peace Index, which covers 163 countries, found the 11th deterioration in peacefulness in the last fourteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These negative trends were partly driven by the impact of COVID, and the inflation and food crisis caused by the War in the Ukraine, but they were also driven by failed national governance over what has normally been periods of several decades, and the end result is that there has been a steady rise in global political extremism, and in ethnic, sectarian, and tribal tensions and conflicts. They have also led to a more than 100% increase in the number of refugees since 2011, and an 8% increase in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR report on the global trends in refugees for 2022 reports that by the end of 2021, there were 27.1 million refugees globally and 53.2 million people displaced within their home countries. In virtually every case, the country involved at most received humanitarian aid and only provided temporary relief and failed to make any serious advances in development or providing lasting solutions to the problems that were creating more refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the current level of global conflicts is illustrated in the fact that the summary list of ongoing conflicts that is available on Wikipedia is four pages long, although this list ignores many smaller ethnic, sectarian, tribal, and other low-level internal civil conflicts. ACLED also provides an extensive analysis of such conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of global terrorism and extremism have also risen in recent years, as is shown in the graphs showing the trends in global terrorism developed by START shown in Figure Fourteen, and in the series of maps in available in the Counterterrorism Guide of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. It also is all too clear from the 2021 U.S. State Department Country reports on Terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key irony behind any focus on these trends in terrorism and extremism, however, is that they are a relatively minor part of the problems affecting the overall patterns in global violence, particularly in lower incomes states. If one examines the trends and impact of poor governance, corruption, leadership that favors given internal factions, failed development efforts, and repression; they almost certainly do more to threaten their populations than terrorists or extremists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of governments that Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have characterized as competitive authoritarianism: “In competitive authoritarian regimes, formal democratic institutions are widely viewed as the principal means of obtaining and exercising political authority. Governments that control a pliant or cowed media as well as the security services and many elements of the economy and where the regime fails to meet conventional minimum standards for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, such authoritarian governments probably do at least an order of magnitude more damage to their peoples than terrorist and extremist movements. They also make their countries more vulnerable to exploitation by more developed powers and encourage more developed powers to exploit their weakness and instability interact with the forces creating instability. One key example is Assad’s Syria. His Russian-backed war to reestablish his power and control has been estimated to have killed as many as 499,700 to 600,000 by March 2022. More conservative estimates put the figure at over 350,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the total deaths caused by terrorism and extremism differ sharply, but a high estimate indicates that they average around 26,000 per year over the same ten-year period as the estimate for Syria, or a total 260,000. Statista reports annual figures ranging from 11,098 to 32,763, or 250,141 for the eleven years of the Syrian civil war. The Global Terrorism Index For 2022 reports only 7,142 deaths from terrorism and extremism, in 2021, and an uneven pattern of decline in deaths from a peak of only 10,669 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Syria is only the worst of many countries where governments kill their peoples. No similar estimates are available, but there are all too many examples. Myanmar is certainly one of the worst. Iran is another, and there are all too many additional states in Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it should be remembered that all of these trends generally interact with failures to adequately cope with disease, global warming, and population growth. The first two of these trends are already the source of global attention, but Figure Fifteen indicates a massive rate of actual population growth between 1950 and 2020 that makes the additional threat from population pressure all too clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-peace-globalism-and-a-global-village-to-a-world-filled-with-global-tensions-and-warfare&quot;&gt;From Peace, “Globalism,” and a “Global Village” to a World Filled with Global Tensions and Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this discussion of “winter wars” may seem to be deliberately pessimistic and to focus on worst cases. It also discusses wars that have sometimes already gone on for decades, and many that seem likely to gone on for a decade or more after the winter of 2022-2023. It is still striking, however, that it describes overall patterns in global violence and conflict a world where it has taken less than a decade to go from a focus on how the world might come together in a form of “globalism” – one that approximates a peaceful and cooperative “global village” – to a world with so many tensions and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the broad use of the term “war,” this analysis also shows that Sun Tzu was all too correct in stating that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” World War I and World War II have shown how dangerous it can be to escalate to major conflicts, and today’s world of nuclear weapons, tightly integrated global supply chains, and steadily more lethal forms of conventional combat have greatly increased the damage a truly major war can inflict. It is all too clear that the relations between the great powers, and between the more advanced and developed democracies and authoritarian and repressive states, have shifted from the image of cooperation to active confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows that major powers and developed nations are actively involved in trying to achieve the “supreme art of war.” The list of “winter wars” makes it all too clear that major powers now focus on political and economic conflicts and confrontations and on efforts to use military force that are limited to exploiting political and military leverage without engaging in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the major powers still seem to find it obligatory to at least mention “cooperation,” and actively seek to keep some degree of real-world cooperation in areas where all sides can still benefit from cooperation, the primary focus of their political and economic confrontation, and military build-ups, has clearly shifted. They are all trying to achieve their strategic objectives by creating a far more confrontational set of military goals and plans, and taking more serious risks in terms of political and economic struggles that at least approach a form of warfare and increase the risk of some form of escalation to the actual use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the analysis does understate the full threat of “winter wars” to the extent it has touched relatively briefly on the number of developing and poorer states that are experiencing serious internal violence, and where the failures of their governments to come to grips with internal tensions, population growth, and sustained development makes them as much of a threat to their peoples as any terrorist or extremist faction. It has not tried to address the combined impact of war, climate change, population pressure, and disease – although all of these problems reinforce each other, and climate change, population pressure, and disease – like failed governance – often have greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the analysis has concentrated on the nature and scale of key types of political, economic and military conflicts, but not on whether any given side has a clear strategic objective in trying to “win.” Putin’s grand strategic objective seems to be close to one of rebuilding the former Soviet Union and strategic partnerships of equal importance, but there is no way to know how real this goal really is. The same is true of China’s grand strategic objectives which are equally broad and vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. new national strategy does talk about the creation of a world with a common economic system and set of international rules – one most it strategic partners support but does not present any plan for achieving it. As for all too much of the rest of the world – rhetoric aside – the national grand strategic goal of its leadership seems to be to retain or expand their power at the national, local, and regional level. The current process of a given “winter war” is clear, but the grand strategic goal is not defined beyond some broad level of rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santana once warned that “he who forgets the past is condemned to repeat it.” In some ways, the world has already done so in two World Wars. For all of the military tensions that preceded World War I, most Europeans though assumed that the equivalent of a stable level of deterrence had been established following the war of 1870, which would prevent any major European conflict in spite of the arms races that were increasing the lethality and size of European forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were devastating, but similar assumptions about postwar stability largely governed Europe until the depression and the collapse of the Weimar democracy in Germany, and then helped encourage isolationism and appeasement until the German invasion of Poland. The result was World War II – a war that did even more damage on a global basis than World War I, and then helped to create a Cold War that may well be returning in more lethal and even more global form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, this analysis of Winter Wars warns that the corollary to Santana’s thesis may well be that “we repeat the past regardless of whether we remember it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

Fosun’s investments in Portugal provide insight into the Chinese Communist Party’s activism in shaping the business environment for private sector players, as the company’s international strategy faced the challenge of balancing alignment with state goals against a regulatory crackdown on private sector outbound spending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, China’s unique brand of state capitalism has undergone profound changes at home and abroad. These have involved a widening array of state and non-state actors and an enhanced role for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in both top-down economic strategy and bottom-up business decisions for a range of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previous reports in this series on the evolving Chinese economic model have detailed, this latest iteration of state-directed economic decisionmaking is most notable for the increasingly complex array of incentives and alignments between commercial and national strategic objectives that characterize outbound spending by Chinese companies today. This framework for conceptualizing, and responding to, the unique non-market aspects of China’s emerging global investment regime is best articulated as a shift from “China Inc.” to “CCP Inc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” is comprised of an ecosystem of key state-owned and private commercial actors, state-owned financiers, government regulators, and CCP organs that are connected through an increasingly complex web of direct and indirect transactional, financial, strategic, operational, and political relationships. Importantly, these ecosystems operate both within the domestic commercial space, where they have been honed to provide integral support to state development goals, as well as in the international commercial space, where they provide a significant boost to the reach and economic influence of a given Chinese commercial entity, when compared with standalone private sector competitors from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study explores how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has enabled a range of state-owned and private Chinese companies to embed into Portugal’s financial system with a view toward widening China’s financial presence within the country, in Europe more broadly, and in a range of other markets. This study focuses in particular on Fosun International Limited [复星国际有限公司] — a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the Shanghai-headquartered conglomerate Fosun Group and a key private sector player — which for many years has acted as a prominent source of foreign direct investment into Portugal’s financial sector, alongside and in concert with a range of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, this study will examine the role of two key Fosun subsidiaries in Portugal — insurer Fidelidade Companhia de Seguros, SA, (Fidelidade) and Banco Comercial Português (BCP Millennium) — and the role they have played in enabling the CCP Inc. ecosystem to engage in Portugal’s financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pMIFvQS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Key Fosun Subsidiaries in Portugal.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.fosun.com/en/investor-relations/fosun-ecosystem/corporate-structure/&quot;&gt;“Corporate Structure,” Fosun International&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this study will explore how Fosun — as a nominally private company — was both allowed and encouraged to invest heavily in a range of Portuguese assets as the contours of the CCP Inc. model have developed in recent years. Fosun’s success in aligning its investments within the parameters of the CCP Inc. framework is particularly notable given that its expansion in Portugal occurred at a time when outbound private investment by other major Chinese conglomerates was not only under scrutiny but also being actively reined in by senior Chinese officials, who had become acutely concerned about aggressive outbound spending by the Chinese private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique ability of Fosun to continue investing abroad at a time when private sector outbound spending was otherwise being actively curtailed speaks to one key aspect of the CCP Inc. model: private sector alignment with national strategic objectives. While such alignment has long been a part of the key performance indicators for China’s SOEs, the CCP’s activism in shaping the business environment for private sector players, as well as increasingly impacting the business strategies of private companies, is a more recent phenomenon. It is also foundational to the shift from the earlier “China Inc.” model to today’s “CCP Inc.” ecosystem. Nowhere is this more evident, at present, than in China’s domestic technology sector, specifically regarding platform economies, as the CCP has sought to bring the sector firmly in line with national governance objectives over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this dynamic is also apparent in China’s approach to outbound spending and specifically in recent investments in Portugal’s financial sector. As Portugal has become a critical node in China’s strategy for engaging with and investing in Europe over the past decade, Fosun and other companies’ ability to align with that geopolitical objective set the stage for some of the largest Chinese investments in the continent. Moreover, this occurred even as other private sector conglomerates were being pressured to divest a range of assets throughout the world, thanks to the CCP’s efforts to contain outbound spending and reduce those companies’ overall debt loads and related systemic debt risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study proceeds in four chapters. The first chapter outlines the initial Chinese foray into Portugal as SOEs, and notably Fosun, played a key role in bailing out the country on the back of the European debt crisis that erupted in 2010. Importantly, these initial investments from 2011 to 2014 largely took place within the more well-known China Inc. model, whereby SOEs (primarily) invested in a foreign country to directly, and to a large extent overtly, support China’s geopolitical aims. However, these initial investments, particularly by Fosun, laid the groundwork for the more complex CCP Inc. ecosystem to deepen its presence within Portugal in the following years, especially as the importance of the Portuguese market and Sino-Portuguese relations became a linchpin in China’s Europe strategy amid increasing Sino-European tensions and European skepticism toward the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second chapter of this study examines the ways in which Fosun, in particular, used its initial investment in the Portuguese financial sector, a key element of China’s bailout of Portugal, to pave the way for additional Chinese investment and relationships within the sector. Through this investment, Fosun increasingly became part of a wider network of Chinese companies operating in the market while bolstering commercial and diplomatic ties with a key European partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third chapter steps back to examine the wider context in which Fosun’s investments took place. Key to this context was a concerted, protracted effort by senior Chinese officials to gain better control over outbound private sector spending, shore up financial stability, and ensure much closer alignment between private sector business operations and strategic objectives of the party-state. Private sector alignment is a key element of the CCP Inc. model, and Fosun’s ability to continue operating successfully within this narrower scope for maneuver not only epitomizes the CCP Inc. model at work but also underscores the pitfalls for nominally private Chinese companies of stepping outside of the CCP Inc. framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final chapter of this report concludes by highlighting the elements of Fosun’s use of the CCP Inc. model, via its two key Portuguese subsidiaries, to leverage its presence within the Portuguese financial sector to support China’s wider geopolitical and global commercial aims throughout Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies began investing heavily in Portugal in 2011, when the country was facing mounting economic headwinds thanks to a decade of lackluster economic performance and associated debt accumulation, the lingering effects of the 2007–08 global financial crisis, and the subsequent debt crisis that metastasized throughout Europe in 2010–13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s challenges culminated in a €78 billion ($104 billion) economic bailout program lasting from 2011 to 2014 that was initiated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in conjunction with the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission, the three of which would colloquially come to be referred to as “the troika.” These funds provided to Portugal by the troika were part of the group’s wider European bailout program that ultimately amounted to close to €500 billion ($667 billion) and included a wide range of countries, most notably Greece, Ireland, Spain, Hungary, and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The troika’s key stipulations around its bailout program for Portugal included the need for the Portuguese government to lower public debt and spending, introduce structural economic reforms, and privatize certain national assets, including stakes in national power companies. Additionally, Portugal’s domestic banks had significant exposure to the country’s economic challenges, which set the stage for Chinese companies — and Fosun in particular — to invest in state-owned assets in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as part of the bailout, the Portuguese government opted to raise funds through the sale of stakes in electric utility company Energias de Portugal (EDP), grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), and Caixa Seguros e Saúde, the insurance arm of Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), Portugal’s largest state bank. At the time, Caixa Seguros e Saúde enjoyed a 26 percent market share in the insurance sector, making it the country’s largest insurance group. Three major subsidiaries were at the core of the group: Fidelidade, Portugal’s largest insurer, health insurer Multicare, and travel and transport insurer Cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dclf8vY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese SOEs stepped in to undertake investments in the Portuguese power sector, and in late 2011, Portugal completed the sale of a 22 percent stake in EDP to the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) [中国长江三峡集团] for €2.7 billion ($3.8 billion), making the Chinese SOE the utility company’s largest shareholder. Months later, the State Grid Corporation of China [国家电网] purchased a 25 percent stake in power company REN for €390 million ($543 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s backing of these deals, and strong interest in pushing forward a commercial and bilateral relationship with Portugal at the time, was underscored by the premium that CTG offered on the EDP investment. The Chinese SOE outbid other interested parties by offering to purchase its stake in the Portuguese utility company at a 53 percent markup on EDP’s share prices at the time, bringing in an unexpectedly large revenue windfall for the embattled Portuguese government. This revenue generation was particularly important given the troika’s requirement that the Portuguese government raise at least €5.5 billion ($7.7 billion) via asset sales during the period of the bailout program. That goal would be aided considerably by Fosun’s €1 billion ($1.39 billion) investment in Caixa Seguros e Saúde, which is more commonly referred to by the brand name of its key subsidiary, Fidelidade, the largest and most important subsidiary of the group. Ultimately, the Chinese asset purchases detailed above would account for over 70 percent of the revenue generation requirements put in place by the troika around Portugal’s bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the economic bailout program from the IMF, ECB, and European Commission progressed, Portuguese authorities began the process of undertaking an equity sale in Caixa Seguros e Saúde throughout 2013. Lisbon contacted 66 potential investors and received five preliminary offers for the insurance group. Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Limited was one of two bidders selected to provide a final proposal, with the U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management tendering the other final offer. Fosun would go on to successfully win the bid and acquire an 80 percent stake in Fidelidade, Multicare, and Cares for €1 billion ($1.3 billion). Fosun’s financial adviser, Morgan Stanley, said the deal, which was financed in part by the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), was the largest acquisition between Chinese and European financial institutions since 2008. Importantly, Manuel Rodrigues, Portugal’s secretary of state for finance, said that Fosun won the deal over Apollo not only because of a better financial offer but also because Fosun promised it would not break up the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal enabled Fosun to become the only major private sector Chinese player to participate in Portugal’s bailout. However, the deal progressed with clear backing at the highest levels of the Chinese party-state, with Chinese president Xi Jinping and Portuguese president Aníbal Cavaco Silva both on hand to witness the official closing of deal in Beijing in May 2014. According to Fosun, the deal also marked the first major outbound investment of a Chinese firm to acquire a foreign insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment ultimately laid the groundwork for Fosun to further deepen its presence in the Portuguese financial sector and also set up future key investments in the sector by other Chinese players, namely state-owned UnionPay [中国银联], in 2018. It also further widened the reach of Chinese players in the power sector and enabled a foray into the Portuguese healthcare sector, among other key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, later in 2014, Fosun joined state-owned State Grid Corporation of China as an investor in the Portuguese grid operator REN by purchasing a 3.97 percent stake in the company. Later that year, through its newly acquired Fidelidade subsidiary, Fosun acquired a 96.07 percent stake in healthcare services provider Espírito Santo Saúde – SGPS, SA, which owned one of the largest private hospitals in Lisbon, Hospital da Luz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, Fosun clearly indicated the strategic nature of its investments in Portugal as an anchor through which to pursue investments throughout Europe. In the press release announcing its acquisition of Espírito Santo Saúde, for example, Fosun directly stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Portugal is a very important market for Fosun and a strategic destination in Fosun’s global investment footprint. Fosun aspires to anchor from Portugal to seek and identify different investment opportunities within Portugal and in other parts of Europe, covering industries including real estate, leisure travel, healthcare, and consumer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such an approach would seem to be justified in terms of the company’s business strategy toward the European market, the approach paralleled a similar tack by Chinese officialdom. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this approach after a 2013 meeting between then-foreign minister Yang Jiechi and Portuguese minister of state and foreign minister Paulo Portas, underscoring that Portas “welcomed more Chinese enterprises to invest in Portugal, noting that Portugal is willing to further advance the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership and thereby promote the comprehensive development of EU-China ties.” This approach by Fosun similarly parallels that of Chinese SOE investments in Portugal, with CTG’s investment in EDP being undertaken in large part as an effort by the Chinese company to gain a foothold in the wider European renewable energy market — a goal that would be further underscored by CTG’s 2018 attempt to take full ownership of EDP and its renewable energy subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wider strategic push by Chinese authorities and companies into the Portuguese market is highlighted by the fact that overall Chinese foreign direct investment in Portugal went from virtually zero in 2010 to €5.7 billion ($6.3 billion) by the end of 2016, with Fosun playing a critical role in some of the largest investments during this period, most notably in the financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this study details, Fosun’s ongoing ability to deepen its investment presence within Portugal throughout this period was due in significant part to the company’s recognition of and integration into the evolving CCP Inc. model of outbound investment, especially as it was crystalizing in 2017–18. As such, the company’s direct connections — including through its leadership — to different elements of the CCP are important to note, as such associations work to reinforce alignment between official party and state bodies and private sector actors in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Fosun’s founder and chairman, Guo Guangchang, has long-standing connections to various CCP institutions. Guo was a member of the 10th and 11th National People’s Congresses — China’s legislature — which ran from 2003 to 2008 and 2008 to 2013, respectively. He was also a member of the 9th (1998–2003) and 12th (2013–2018) National Committees of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference — China’s top political advisory body, which has a remit to undertake so-called United Front work to ensure alignment between the CCP and non-CCP groups, including the private sector. Guo is also a current member of the standing committee of the All-China Youth Federation, a CCP-led body affiliated with, among other groups, the Communist Youth League of China, a key power base of former CCP general secretaries Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as well as the current premier, Li Keqiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Guo, Fosun’s board features several other members with connections to the party-state. Co-CEO and executive director Chen Qiyu, for instance, was a member of the 12th and 13th standing committees of the Shanghai Municipal People’s Consultative Conference. Another co-CEO and executive director, Xu Xiaoliang, is a member of the Shanghai Youth Federation, Shanghai’s local chapter of the All-China Youth Federation. Meanwhile, non-executive director Zhang Shengman was previously a deputy director at the Ministry of Finance, and non-executive director Zhang Huaqiao is a former People’s Bank of China official and former non-executive director of the state-owned Sinopec Oilfield Service Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the key public affiliations that Fosun’s leadership has, or previously had, with institutions within the party-state system. And while such affiliations are not unusual among Chinese private sector executives, such associations and relationships could only have helped in Fosun’s successful navigation of and alignment within the CCP Inc. ecosystem in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Fosun was well placed to play a key role in China’s strategic expansion within the Portuguese financial sector, for a range of reasons. As the next chapters of this study detail, the company was able to deftly execute that expansion — not only to its own advantage, but also in a way that enabled other Chinese entities, notably some key state-owned financial institutions, to deepen their presence within the country throughout the years following the initial bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fosun-and-ccp-incs-growing-presence-in-the-portuguese-financial-sector&quot;&gt;Fosun and CCP Inc.’s Growing Presence in the Portuguese Financial Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun’s initial investment in Fidelidade established a foundation through which the company would deepen its own ties, and widen the CCP Inc. network, within the Portuguese financial sector — as well as eventually act as a base of CCP Inc. connectivity throughout key BRI countries and Latin America. In coming years, these investments would enable deeper relationships for other Chinese SOEs, particularly UnionPay International and China Reinsurance Corporation (China Re), within Portugal, a process that continued to run in parallel to the wider CCP courting of Portugal as a key component in its strategy toward Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the initial Chinese bailout of Portugal, Fosun made one of its most critical investments when it purchased a sizable stake in Banco Comercial Português (BCP Millennium), Portugal’s largest private bank, in November 2016. Fosun signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with BCP Millennium to acquire a 16.67 percent stake for €174.6 billion ($193.2 billion) and signaled its intention to raise its stake to 30 percent over the years to come. The initial share purchase made the company BCP Millennium’s largest shareholder alongside Angolan state oil company Sonangol Group. Subsequently, Fosun acquired a 30 percent stake in multiple tranches over several years, upping its stake in the bank to 27 percent throughout 2017 and to 29.93 percent in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fosun boosted its ownership of BCP Millennium, the bank also began to undertake a critical role in pushing forward Chinese commercial, policy, and geopolitical aims in Portugal. Critically, in May 2018, BCP Millennium acted as the intermediary for state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) in its €9 billion ($10.6 billion) bid to take a controlling interest in utility company Energias de Portugal (EDP) as well as the company’s renewable energy arm, EDP Renováveis. CTG launched the bid as an all-cash tender offer for the outstanding shares that the Chinese SOE did not obtain in its 2011 investment in the company, looking to purchase the outstanding 76.7 percent at a 5 percent share-price premium over the €3.09 ($4.30) share price at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Fosun’s Evolving Ownership Stake in BCP Millennium over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTG’s bid was of particular importance at that time: it not only represented a major new push by a Chinese SOE into the European renewable energy market, but it came at a time when Chinese foreign direct investment into Europe had become increasingly controversial. EDP shareholders, led by activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management, which held a 2.9 percent stake in EDP at the time, eventually blocked the bid, arguing that Fosun undervalued CTG and citing a shareholder voting rights reform requirement, included by CTG as part of the takeover bid, as too onerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, though, the potential transaction came in the wider context of increased Western skepticism around Chinese outbound investment and was under scrutiny from European and U.S. regulators. Indeed, the episode underscored a growing rift between Portuguese and other European governments over Chinese investment in Europe. Portugal’s then-prime minister António Costa indicated he had “no reservations” around the proposed takeover, even as German, French, and Italian regulators had moved to push forward a draft EU screening framework for investment into the bloc that would give EU regulators in Brussels the ability to weigh in on investments deemed “likely to affect security or public order in one or more member states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ultimately unsuccessful, BCP Millennium’s participation — and by extension Fosun’s participation — in facilitating the offer on behalf of CTG highlights a key example of the CCP Inc. ecosystem at work. The foothold of the nominally private Chinese company in the Portuguese financial sector was key to allowing CTG to push the bid forward. It reflected not only an effort to expand the reach of CCP Inc. into the Portuguese economy but also an attempt to further China’s foreign policy aims by boosting its presence in the European renewable energy market and trying to circumvent growing European skepticism toward Chinese investment in strategic European assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as CTG’s takeover attempt faltered, BCP Millennium continued to act as a key conduit for a deepening Chinese presence in the Portuguese financial sector and the wider Portuguese economy. Indeed, throughout 2018, the bank’s ties to a number of Chinese financial institutions, and within Chinese financial markets, grew rapidly. In May of that year, BCP Millennium re-signed an MoU in Beijing with Chinese state-owned lender ICBC — one of the underwriters of Fosun’s initial Fidelidade investment in 2014 — which had initially been drawn up in 2010. BCP Millennium’s explicitly stated intention, and that of its major shareholder, Fosun International, in re-signing the MoU was to leverage the relationship to deepen economic ties between China and Portugal, using the latter as a key launching pad for deepening these same ties in Europe and Portuguese-speaking African countries. Indeed, the press statement accompanying the MoU signing stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[BCP Millennium] remains committed to being a relevant part of an international business platform between China/Macao, Portuguese speaking countries — namely in Africa — and Europe, in order to support trade activity and investment flows in those geographies . . . taking advantage of ICBC’s regional presence and influence as well as other potential synergies in cooperation with the bank’s principal shareholder, Fosun International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/d5s7OQs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Key Fosun Acquisitions in Portugal over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, BCP Millennium signed an agreement in June 2018 to conduct renminbi clearing and settlement with the Bank of China Macao, which “reinforced the bank’s presence in the Chinese market” as it became “the first bank in Portugal to be considered a participating bank with access to Macao’s payments system.” Importantly, the Bank of China had been another major underwriter of Fosun’s initial Fidelidade investment, underscoring the long-standing relationship between Fosun, its Portuguese subsidiaries, and the Chinese lender. That same month, BCP Millennium officially signed an agreement with Alipay (the payment arm of China’s fintech giant Ant Group), pursuant to a March 2018 MoU, which allowed it to become the first bank to facilitate transactions between Portuguese merchants and Chinese travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, in December 2018, BCP Millennium signed an agreement with UnionPay International — a subsidiary of the state-owned payments provider China UnionPay — to become the first European bank to issue UnionPay bank cards, marking a major overseas expansion for the Chinese SOE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PwB9rbU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: Fosun Relationships with Other Chinese Entities in Portugal through Its BCP Millennium Subsidiary.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCP Millennium agreement with UnionPay marked a particularly exceptional example of the CCP Inc. ecosystem in action. Not only did the agreement offer UnionPay — officially the largest global issuer of bank cards at the time but with little presence in the European Union — a key foothold in the European market, the deal also further underscored BCP Millennium’s place as a key touch point for a range of Chinese financial and non-financial institutions in Portugal. The unique placement of BCP Millennium as a key player in the Sino-Portuguese relationship was underscored in no uncertain terms by the fact that the deal with UnionPay International was signed as part of a state visit by Xi Jinping to Portugal in late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trip, Xi Jinping and Portuguese prime minister António Costa signed several bilateral cooperation agreements, including a formal agreement for Portugal to sign onto the BRI. These agreements were paired with an additional announcement of 17 key commercial agreements in the areas of infrastructure, finance, automobiles, and science and technology, including the UnionPay International deal with BCP Millennium. Other key deals inked at the ceremony included a memorandum between telecommunications company Altice Portugal (formerly known as Portugal Telecom) and Huawei Technologies Company to strengthen cooperation on 5G frequency band licenses and an agreement to establish the STARlab project — a joint space and maritime technology laboratory between the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Portuguese aerospace and defense company Tekever, and Portugal’s Centre for Product Engineering and Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the international subsidiary of the state-owned China Oil and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) signed an agreement with the Portuguese Trade and Investment Agency to establish the COFCO International Centre of Excellence for corporate shared services. Following the deal, the chairman and CEO of COFCO International stated that “Portugal’s positive approach towards international business, skilled human resources and strategic location were the main reasons for choosing Portugal over several other candidate locations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing of the BCP Millennium agreement with UnionPay alongside such obviously important strategic agreements in the areas of technological infrastructure, aerospace and maritime research, and agribusiness underscores both the high-level Chinese government backing for the financial sector cooperation as well as its own strategic importance. Indeed, during a meeting with Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on the same state visit, Xi highlighted China’s strategic approach to the bilateral relationship with Portugal by saying that “as a member of the European Union, Portugal has huge influence on Africa and many Portuguese-speaking countries, and is a key link in China’s economic internationalization strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Fosun International indicated that the BCP Millennium tie-up with UnionPay International, first floated in late 2017, was a major milestone in the company’s push to “promote the synergy of various sectors such as banking, insurance, and health” within Portugal as the company moved to “fully mobilize resources to promote outstanding domestic [Chinese] financial enterprises, [including] . . . [the] Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China UnionPay, the China-Africa Fund, [and] the China-Portugal Fund.” Additionally, Fosun leadership indicated that “together with BCP, [the company would] help Chinese enterprises to go global, and jointly carry out cooperation in payments, investment, loan business, and other aspects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s 2018 state visit to Portugal, and the wide array of commercial deals and relationships connected to that visit, represent a snapshot of CCP Inc. in action. While high-level state visits are used by many countries to help reinforce commercial ties, the highly strategic nature of each of the deals that were signed on Xi’s Portugal trip speaks to a more fundamental alignment between CCP strategic objectives and Chinese commercial interests abroad. It further underscores the incentives of a range of companies — including BCP Millennium’s Chinese parent, Fosun — to support official efforts to cement Portugal as a critical partner on the European continent and as a potential launching pad into the wider region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-context-of-fosuns-success-with-bcp-millennium&quot;&gt;Critical Context of Fosun’s Success with BCP Millennium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun and BCP Millennium’s success in enabling a wider CCP Inc. network of investment into Portugal is particularly notable considering that it came at a time when outbound investment by other private sector Chinese conglomerates was being actively reined in by Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2017, Chinese officials had become increasingly concerned about soaring rates of outbound investment over the previous several years. For example, Vice Premier Liu He commissioned a study to examine the economic vulnerabilities created by such large outbound flows of direct investment, particularly in light of the role such investment played in bursting Japan’s economic bubble in the 1990s. According to media reports, the study included a recommendation to gain greater control over, and reduce the scale of, outbound investment by some of China’s largest private sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the topic of outbound investment, and its potential role in destabilizing the domestic financial system, reportedly emerged as a key topic of discussion at an April 2017 Politburo meeting. Importantly, China’s 25-member Politburo typically discusses key economic policy priorities at its monthly meetings once a quarter, in January, April, July, and October. And while the official readouts of the Politburo meeting and Politburo study session from that month do not explicitly mention the goal of reducing outbound spending by Chinese companies, they focus intensely on senior Chinese policymakers’ clear concern about reducing financial system volatility and instability, including vulnerabilities and potential spillover effects created by the Chinese financial system’s growing linkages with the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, in the readout of the Politburo study session on financial security on April 26, 2017, Xi clearly stated that “financial security is an important part of national security and an important foundation for the stable and healthy development of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8WC9zxj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Overall Chinese Outbound Investment 2010–2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fec.mofcom.gov.cn/article/tjsj/tjgb/&quot;&gt;“走出去”公共服务平台 [“Going Out” Public Service Bulletin], 中华人民共和国商务部 [Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China], accessed November 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key Politburo meetings would ultimately set the stage for a prolonged, multiyear effort to de-risk the domestic Chinese financial system, part of which involved a crackdown on foreign and domestic financial activities by some of China’s largest private sector conglomerates, including the HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the crackdown on outbound investment deals, these four companies alone accounted for a whopping $57 billion in outbound spending from 2015 to mid-2017, representing a full 15 percent of all outbound spending by Chinese companies during this period. In June 2017, financial authorities specifically requested reports from banks on the overseas loans made to each of these companies, and over the following several years, scrutiny of the companies’ financial positions, and specifically their overseas spending and assets, ramped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the State Council released a key set of opinions in August 2017 to codify and tighten the previously disparate rules around outbound investment by laying out specific areas of overseas direct investment that were encouraged, restricted, and prohibited. Encouraged investment areas included those in the services sector, in technology that would help to move China up the value chain, and for projects under the umbrella of the BRI. Restricted investment areas included real estate, hotels, cinemas, entertainment, sports clubs, and “investment platforms without specific industrial projects.” Meanwhile, prohibited investment areas included “investment involving the production of core technologies and products of the military” or “investments that endanger or may endanger the interests of the state” — a broad umbrella under which Xi had placed financial system stability just months before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following several years, the four major private sector conglomerates that had been singled out by authorities for renewed scrutiny, including Fosun, would see a range of regulatory outcomes in terms of their ability to maintain and expand their respective portfolios of overseas assets, a process that further highlighted some key aspects of the emerging CCP Inc. framework at that time. Core among these was the need for nominally private sector entities to more clearly align with national strategic objectives in undertaking outbound spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, then, it is notable that Fosun was able to continue deepening its ties in the Portuguese financial sector, through its Fidelidade subsidiary and related investment in BCP Millennium, over the course of 2017 and 2018. Indeed, of the four conglomerates that came under Beijing’s scrutiny, Fosun has seen by far the best regulatory outcomes and clearly maneuvered to get back into the good graces of senior policymakers. By comparison, Anbang Insurance Group (安邦保险集团) was taken over by the government in February 2018. The company’s non-core assets were wound down over the following three-year period of government receivership, and its founder and chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was handed an 18-year prison sentence for fraud. Meanwhile, on the very same day that Anbang’s government takeover was announced, Fosun announced plans to purchase a controlling interest in one of France’s oldest fashion design companies. For its part, HNA Group [海航集团] has been placed into bankruptcy and taken over by provincial authorities, while its chairman and CEO were both detained by authorities on suspicion of crimes in late 2021. Finally, Dalian Wanda’s [万达集团] overseas asset base is now a fraction of its peak, as the company shed assets amounting to $19.2 billion between mid-2017 and early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun’s success in navigating the regulatory crackdown, especially in comparison to its highly chastened peers, can be explained in part by the clear alignment between its investments in Portugal and Chinese policymakers’ objectives to leverage commercial and diplomatic relations with the country as an avenue for deepening commercial engagement and investment in Europe more broadly as well as to cultivate a key ally in mitigating rising European skepticism toward Chinese investment. Indeed, as internal concern around capital outflows via unruly overseas direct investment was beginning to percolate among the Chinese leadership in late 2016, Xi called directly for more Chinese investment in Portugal, going so far as to say that China would encourage expansion in areas including finance, insurance, and healthcare — areas in which Fosun was already the leading Chinese player in the country through its investments in Fidelidade and BCP Millennium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the government’s crackdown on outbound investment and high debt levels among China’s private sector conglomerates moved forward, Fosun’s domestic messaging within China also began to align more closely with CCP and Chinese state priorities. As soon as July 2017, Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang began to publicly support Beijing’s tougher rules on overseas investments, citing a reduction in potential risks to financial security as one element of his support of the eradication of irrational outbound investment. Guo’s clear and public alignment with the new outbound investment framework, and his company’s subsequent ability to operate successfully within it, is particularly notable given the fates of the Anbang and HNA chairmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this alignment came not only on the back of the crackdown on overseas spending but also after Guo had previously been caught up in Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption crackdown on the financial sector. In late 2015, Guo was among several high-profile private sector Chinese executives that were subjected to anti-corruption investigations and temporarily went missing from public view. On December 10, 2015, local financial media reported that Fosun executives had been unable to reach Guo since noon that day. Guo’s sudden disappearance ultimately led to a brief suspension of trading for Fosun International shares on the Hong Kong exchange before he resurfaced on December 14, saying he had been assisting judicial authorities in their investigations but offering no further details. Some observers speculated that Guo’s detainment was related to his relationship with Yao Gang, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or Ai Baojun, vice mayor of Shanghai, both of whom were under investigation by anti-corruption authorities at the time. Such an experience may have heightened Guo’s political sensitivity and helped him shepherd Fosun successfully through the evolution of the CCP Inc. ecosystem in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after the crackdown on outbound spending, Fosun International began to more explicitly tie its outbound investment efforts to support of the BRI, with co-CEO Xu Xiaoliang saying in September 2017, just weeks after the release of the State Council’s opinions on outbound investment, that “now that we know what the government encourages and discourages, we have a clearer idea of where to expand our global footprint.” Guo further highlighted this point in a 2018 interview, stating: “Our overseas investments are approved by the Chinese government and the local governments, not just in Europe but globally” and “The Chinese government . . . support[s] the companies who respect the law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3uXqOOW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Timeline of the Regulatory Crackdown on Outward Direct Investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short order, these increased efforts at public alignment with the CCP’s enhanced oversight of outbound spending by nominally private sector Chinese conglomerates were overtly recognized. In December 2017, the CCP’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, went so far as to publicly praise Fosun’s outbound investment activities in an op-ed, juxtaposing those efforts directly against other Chinese companies that had failed to realign to the emerging CCP Inc. model of outbound investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article highlighted the achievements of China’s ongoing investment presence beyond its borders, arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Behind the dazzling achievements, some enterprises take advantage of the “going out” strategy to strengthen and refine their brands; however, some are involved in undesirable foreign investment behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article went on to call out Fosun’s investment in BCP Millennium as a model for other companies to emulate, highlighting the initial groundwork that the tie-up was already laying for UnionPay to expand in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recently, BCP [Millennium], which has Fosun as an investor, reached a strategic cooperation agreement with UnionPay to jointly carry out UnionPay card issuance, innovative payment promotion, and other cooperation in Europe. This exemplifies Fosun’s successful practice of helping the Belt and Road Initiative and Chinese enterprises with their global layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the article hit home the point that outbound investment by a range of Chinese companies can only succeed within the framework of overt policy support, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Steady and positive “going out” is not possible without policy support and guidance. In the face of the excessively rapid growth of outbound foreign investment in fields such as real estate, hotels, cinemas, entertainment, and sports clubs in recent years, relevant regulatory authorities have provided risk warnings and adopted a series of policy measures. According to Guo Guangchang, chairman of Fosun International, “Capable government ensures effective markets. Stable, predictable, more transparent, and fairer policies can support real and legal foreign investment in line with the national strategy, which guarantees long-term and healthy development of companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear realignment of Fosun within the parameters of the CCP Inc. model not only allowed the company to gain high-level backing for its ongoing investments in the Portuguese financial sector throughout 2017 and 2018 but also underpinned increasing ties between Fosun-invested Portuguese companies and other major Chinese financial players along the BRI and into a wider range of international markets over the following years, as the next chapter of this report explores. Moreover, the ability of Fosun to continue operating within Europe and to deepen its ties — and those of the wider CCP Inc. ecosystem — is even more striking when considering the outcome of similar investments by the other nominally private sector Chinese conglomerates during this period of enhanced scrutiny. Most notable in this regard is the fate of HNA Group’s 2017 investment in Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a move similar to that of Fosun’s investments in Fidelidade and BCP Millennium, HNA Group bought stakes in Deutsche Bank in February and March 2017, becoming one of the bank’s largest shareholders, with a 4.8 percent stake, worth just over €1 billion ($1.13 billion). Then, in May 2017, just around the time that Fosun was increasing its stake in BCP Millennium, HNA went on to boost its investment in Deutsche Bank further, ultimately taking on a near 10 percent stake in the German lender, making the Chinese conglomerate its largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels between the HNA and Fosun investments in key European financial players are particularly notable, not only for their similar timing but also given that HNA’s investment came as the German lender was struggling under the weight of an array of regulatory penalties and poor investment decisions from 2013 to 2016, requiring infusions of outside capital to help steady the bank in 2016 and 2017. These dynamics were similar to the challenges faced by a range of Portuguese financial institutions in the wake of the European debt crisis, which opened the door for the initial Fosun investment in Fidelidade and later BCP Millennium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sg4CMvZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Selected Major Overseas Investments by HNA 2015–2017.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report and others. Please reference the endnotes for complete additional citations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ultimate fate of Fosun’s investments in Portugal could not have been more starkly different than that of HNA’s investment in Deutsche Bank. Indeed, rather than utilizing its position as a key shareholder in the German lender to enable a growing presence of the CCP Inc. ecosystem within the German economy and financial sector, as Fosun was able to achieve in Portugal, HNA quickly made an about-face on its German investment, selling down its stake to 8.8 percent in February 2018 and losing its status as the firm’s largest shareholder after less than a year in that position. While this initial paring of HNA’s stake in Deutsche Bank was widely attributed to the need to raise capital in order to address liquidity issues that the Chinese conglomerate was facing in early 2018, the company continued to sell off its stake in the coming years as Chinese officials demanded that the company wind down its non-core business lines and assets. Ultimately, HNA was effectively taken over by the provincial government of Hainan, where the group is based, which began the process of restructuring the group in late 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of HNA’s failed overseas investments, as well as the forced spin-off of its foreign assets and its ultimate takeover by local authorities, against the ongoing flourishing of Fosun’s overseas expansion throughout this period throws into stark relief just how successful the latter company was in both recognizing and aligning with the rapid evolution of the CCP Inc. model during the 2017–18 time period. Fosun’s public and high-profile alignment with the concerted regulatory push to fully align overseas spending tightly with CCP and Chinese state strategic objectives was a critical element in its continued success investing abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Fosun’s overt drive to leverage its investments and business relationships in Portugal to open additional overseas business opportunities for a range of Chinese state and private companies — both within and beyond the financial sector — speaks to a clear recognition of the importance of the ecosystem aspect of the CCP Inc. model. Indeed, in this model the outbound spending and foreign commercial presence of a given company is not simply meant to boost that company’s bottom line, nor even to solely support China’s diplomatic and strategic objectives abroad. Importantly, such investments are also meant to boost commercial opportunities for other Chinese players in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, Chinese companies — both state-owned and nominally private — can swim in the wake of other Chinese companies’ success in penetrating foreign markets, and the relationships between these companies work to reinforce China’s overall foreign commercial presence. The People’s Daily article praising Fosun’s efforts to open a pathway for UnionPay International’s expansion in Europe makes this point explicit, and Fosun would go on to further internalize and execute on this element of the CCP Inc. model in future overseas operations alongside other key Chinese SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-on-success&quot;&gt;Building on Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fidelidade’s Presence beyond Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the increased scrutiny of outbound investment by nominally private Chinese companies in 2017, Fosun continued to deepen the alignment between its global investment portfolio and China’s national objectives, further integrating into the CCP Inc. model in the process. Another key tie-up came in 2019 when Fosun’s Fidelidade subsidiary entered into a strategic partnership with China Reinsurance Corporation (China Re) [中国再保险] to provide project financing and reinsurance for the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with Fosun’s moves to align both messaging and investments with CCP priorities, the agreement was signed in April 2019 in Beijing at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, a gathering that was widely seen as core to furthering China’s geopolitical and global commercial objectives at the time by seeking to redefine the BRI against growing global critiques of the effort. The initiative’s growing reputation as environmentally unfriendly, corrupt, and debt-fueled had led Chinese leadership to seek to recast the effort. This push fit within officials’ wider efforts to gain greater control over outbound spending as they sought “to exert more control over the program . . . including [with] clearer rules for state-owned-enterprises, restricting use of the BRI brand, and building overseas auditing and anti-corruption mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping chaired the forum, which was attended by thousands of participants, many from the foreign business community, and dozens of foreign heads of state. Xi held a spate of bilateral meetings as part of the forum, including talks with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal, where Xi characterized the bilateral relationship as one of “prominent strategic significance, high complementarity in interests, and strong economic complementarity.” The readout of the meeting further underscored China’s view of Portugal as a key channel for stabilizing and improving broader relations with Europe, saying “it is believed that the Portuguese side will also continue to play an active role in maintaining the right direction of China-Europe relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inking the Fidelidade partnership with China Re at the forum, therefore, worked to boost the prominence of the agreement, which was listed by Chinese state media as one of 17 key investment projects announced at the gathering. Reporting around the agreement further indicated that the primary area of focus for the partnership would be to enhance “reinsurance solutions for projects in Portugal, Spain, France, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde and Peru.” For its part, Fidelidade expressly stated that the partnership with this important SOE, the only state-owned reinsurer in China, would enable the Fosun-owned group to widen its reach throughout various geographies to “diversify its scope and develop new opportunities for international business growth, bolstering its offer to the Chinese community around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China Re’s publicity around the agreement further underscored that it would help to unlock new investment opportunities within China and around the world for Fidelidade, saying: “The two sides will also seek opportunities for cooperation in the construction of the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, especially to exert the influence of Fidelidade Insurance Group of Portugal in Portuguese-speaking countries and provide professional services for Macao to exploit markets of Portuguese-speaking countries.” In addition, linked to the Fideldidade-China Re strategic cooperation was a separate effort between China and Angola to enact a strategic cooperation agreement with Fidelidade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 12: Key Fosun and Fidelidade Investments in Latin America 2019–2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedialogue.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chinese-Insurers-in-Latin-America-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Margaret Myers, “Going Out, Guaranteed: Chinese Insurers in Latin America,” The Dialogue, January 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the establishment of its partnership with China Re appears to have been the marquee agreement that Fidelidade undertook in 2019, Fosun was simultaneously expanding its presence in a range of other markets around the world through its Fidelidade subsidiary with the express purpose of offering insurance support to Chinese projects, most notably throughout Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Fidelidade announced it would sell insurance in Chile “through a series of partnership agreements. Elsewhere in South America, the Portuguese company acquired 51 percent of Peruvian insurer La Positiva Seguros y Reaseguros, through its local subsidiary, and purchased an almost one-fourth ownership of Alianza Compañía de Seguros y Reaseguros in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These investments were undertaken within the context of specific Chinese policies to leverage the insurance sector to support and stabilize a range of investment activities in Latin America, as emphasized in a January 2022 report on Chinese insurers in Latin America from the Inter-American Dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s top planners have noted the importance of enhanced insurance support for the country’s overseas operations in recent five-year plans and in policies toward Latin America. China’s 1+3+6 Cooperative Framework, introduced to the region by Xi Jinping in 2015, is among the Latin America-specific policies intended to boost funds, credit loans, and insurance to the region — in this case for project development in logistics, electricity, and information technology. . . . As Zhu Junsheng, deputy director of the Insurance Research Office of the Financial Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council noted, Chinese infrastructure firms, insurers, and other actors are expected to increasingly work together to identify high-quality overseas projects and ‘increase the attractiveness of infrastructure projects to market funds.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These deepening investments and relationships, in both Latin America and BRI countries, that Fosun has pursued in recent years via its Fidelidade subsidiary show the ongoing and intensifying alignment of Fosun’s global commercial objectives with Chinese geopolitical and strategic interests. Additionally, the ever-growing roster of key SOE financial players with which Fosun and Fidelidade are partnering in these endeavors further highlights Fosun’s ability to leverage the CCP Inc. ecosystem to its advantage. That is especially true considering that over the past several years senior Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, have repeatedly stated their view that the Portuguese relationship and market should be seen as a critical anchor for China’s growing commercial and diplomatic presence around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of Chinese-invested companies such as Fidelidade and BCP Millennium to leverage their relationships with Chinese SOEs to expand into a wide range of markets around the world is a core component of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. Such cooperation allows for a wider array of relationship building, networking, and financial and policy support than any one company could achieve on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as important, Fosun’s maneuvering to embed itself within the Portuguese financial sector through high-profile, strategic investments has allowed the company to act as one of the key anchors in the wider CCP Inc. approach to the Portuguese market. Indeed, the fact that this nominally private company worked to boost the presence of key state-owned actors within Portugal — including the China Three Gorges Corporation, UnionPay, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Bank of China — rather than the other way around, speaks to the essence of the shift from “China Inc.” to “CCP Inc.” that has taken place in recent years and is ongoing today. Moreover, Fosun’s maneuvering to buoy the strategic national objective of developing commercial and diplomatic ties with Portugal as a jumping off point to pursue deeper engagement in European and other markets underscores how thoroughly the CCP has co-opted the Chinese private sector as the CCP Inc. model of economic governance has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has highlighted, these achievements are all the more remarkable given the fast-evolving nature of policies dictating outbound private sector Chinese investments at the time Fosun was pursuing its expansion into Portugal, especially in light of the failure of other private Chinese conglomerates to achieve similar alignment with national goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this case study not only highlights some of the crucial elements of the CCP Inc. model in action but also underscores the still-evolving nature of that model. As state-owned and nominally private Chinese companies continue to widen their investment footprints throughout the global economy, it will be critical for policymakers and business leaders in Western countries to deepen their understanding of the contours of the CCP Inc. ecosystem as it has evolved to date. But additionally, to compete against the CCP Inc. ecosystem going forward, Western countries must also seek to anticipate how the ecosystem will become further refined and design forward-looking global trade and investment regimes robust enough to meet the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) conducted significantly more extensive fixed-wing strike operations during the first days of the invasion than has been previously documented, while Ukrainian ground-based air-defence (GBAD) capabilities were suppressed by initial attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this period, Ukrainian fighter aircraft inflicted some losses on VKS aircraft but also took serious casualties due to being totally technologically outmatched and badly outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian fighters have remained highly effective and lethal against Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines throughout the war, especially the Su-35S with the R-77-1 long-range missile and, in recent months, the Mig-31BM with the R-37 very long-range missile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From early March, the VKS lost the ability to operate in Ukrainian-controlled airspace except at very low altitudes due to its inability to reliably suppress or destroy increasingly effective, well-dispersed and mobile Ukrainian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian GBAD has also been highly effective since March, especially the long-range S-400 SAM system supported by the 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude long-range surveillance radar system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numerous MANPADS provided to Ukrainian troops and later mobile air-defence teams meant that low-altitude Russian fixed-wing and rotary penetrating sorties beyond the frontlines proved to be prohibitively costly during March, and ceased by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the war, most Russian airstrikes have been against pre-designated targets with unguided bombs and rockets. The Su-34 fleet has regularly also fired stand-off missiles such as the Kh-29 and Kh-59 against fixed targets, and Su-30SM and Su-35S fighters have regularly fired Kh-31P and Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles to suppress and target Ukrainian SAM radars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without air superiority, Russia’s attempts at strategic air attack have been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. These failed to achieve strategically decisive damage during the first seven months of the invasion. However, the latest iteration is a more focused and sustainable bombardment of the Ukrainian electricity grid, blending hundreds of cheap Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 loitering munitions against substations with continued use of cruise and ballistic missiles against larger targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity. It is purely thanks to its failure to destroy Ukraine’s mobile SAM systems that Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multi-role fighter fleets to bombard Ukrainian strategic targets and frontline positions from medium altitude, as it did in Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It follows that if Ukrainian SAMs are not resupplied with ammunition, and ultimately augmented and replaced with Western equivalents over time, the VKS will regain the ability to pose a major threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the short term, Ukraine also needs large numbers of additional man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, such as the Gepard, to sustain and increase its ability to intercept the Shahed-136s and protect its remaining power infrastructure and repairs to damaged facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs cost-effective ways to defend itself against the Shahed-136. One option could be compact radar and/or laser ranging and sighting systems to allow numerous existing anti-aircraft guns to be much more accurate and effective against them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Air Force fighter force needs modern Western fighters and missiles to sustainably counter the VKS. Russian pilots have been cautious throughout the war, so even a small number of Western fighters could have a major deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any Western fighter supplied in the short–medium term needs to be capable of dispersed operations using mobile maintenance equipment and small support teams, and flying from relatively rough runways, to avoid being neutralised by Russian long-range missile strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it initiated the first large-scale peer conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The stakes are extremely high, as the outcome of the war will define not only the future of Ukraine and of Russia, but also the global geopolitical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, therefore, there has been an unprecedented degree of sustained global public, political, military and media interest driving external analysis of the war. Since the start of the invasion, military analysis in both public and professional communities has focused heavily on Russia’s employment of ground forces. This is logical since the Russian Ground Forces have done by far the most damage, possess most of Russia’s conventional firepower and are the most important component of Russian military capability. By contrast, Russian Aerospace Forces’ (VKS) fixed-wing and helicopter operations during the conflict have remained more sparsely documented and only partially understood outside those Ukrainian Air Force, Navy and Army personnel directly involved in countering their operations day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External analysts, including the lead author of this report, have so far focused on trying to explain the apparent absence of a large-scale air campaign or strategically significant results achieved by the VKS. The pervasive use by both sides of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) – usually called ‘drones’ – and UAVs – also usually called ‘drones’ – carrying modern cameras, and the ubiquitous presence of smartphones among troops, has ensured that detailed footage of the ground war has been captured and broadcast in unprecedented detail throughout the war. By contrast, the combat air environment is inherently much harder to film due to the speeds, distances and altitudes involved. Consequently, much of what is known about the air war over Ukraine has been gleaned from isolated clips filmed from the ground, and carefully selected footage collated and released by both the Ukrainian and Russian Ministries of Defence as part of information operations. Therefore, while analysts have been able to observe fragments of the air war, and to track competing kill/loss claims and count wreckage on both sides, there has so far been very little granular information available in the public domain about the actual Russian air war over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report sets out to start the process of uncovering how Russia’s VKS has operated over Ukraine between the start of the invasion in February and late October 2022. It is based on fieldwork conducted in Ukraine in August and October 2022, which included interviews with Ukrainian Air Force officers working in both the aviation and air-defence branches, interviews with senior intelligence officers and military scientists, and examination of captured and recovered Russian weapons systems. To protect sources, the interview subjects have been anonymised and precise dates and locations are not disclosed. The interviews were, of necessity, conducted with Ukrainian officials and officers but not Russian ones and, consequently, they represent an incomplete view from only one side of the air war. To guard against over-reliance on single sources, most of the interviews were conducted with multiple individuals representing different parts of their services. Where possible, information has also been cross-referenced between different interviews, and also evaluated against externally available footage and existing open-source intelligence data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I provides details of the operations undertaken by the fixed-wing fighter, fighter-bomber and attack aircraft of the VKS. There were significant changes in objectives, tactics, operational intensity and weapons use at various phases of the war, so this chapter takes a chronological approach to explain their evolution over time. Chapter II examines Russian attack aviation (helicopter gunship) operations during the war. Chapter III examines the Russian long-range precision-strike campaign, looking at the patterns of use, targets and some characteristics of the cruise and ballistic missiles Russia has used to bombard Ukraine. It also provides some analysis of the Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 (called Geran-2 by Russia) loitering munitions (often inappropriately called ‘kamikaze drones’) that have been extensively used against Ukrainian infrastructure since September 2022. Finally, the report concludes with an analysis of the main priorities for aid that Ukraine needs from its international partners to improve its air-defence capabilities. There are several areas that are already becoming critical requirements if Ukraine is to sustain the battlefield momentum that it has won over Russia at such a devastating cost since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report deliberately avoids giving detailed descriptions of Ukrainian air combat and ground-based air-defence (GBAD) tactics, operations and losses to protect Ukrainian operational security. As such, it does not attempt to give a comprehensive or final account of the air war, but rather to usefully increase Western understanding of the use of Russian airpower during the conflict within the bounds of what can be verified and publicly discussed at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE IMPACT OF hundreds of Russian cruise and ballistic missile strikes across Ukraine and the ill-fated air-assault operation at Hostomel Airport dominated the external view of Russian air operations during the initial week of the invasion. Ukrainian fast jets flew several visible combat air patrols (CAPs) over Kyiv and other cities, but various viral pieces of footage claiming to show air-to-air combat between Russian and Ukrainian jets were quickly recognisable as fakes created using commercial flight simulator software. This led several commentators, including the lead author of this paper, to put forward various theories for the apparent absence of VKS activity during the first week of the invasion. The VKS had deployed a fast-jet force of around 350 modern combat aircraft for operations in Ukraine; so the lack of a publicly visible air campaign came as a major surprise to most analysts. The tentative conclusions reached by this author in March about the lack of VKS capacity to mount complex, large-scale operations still hold today, but early analysis was wrong about the lack of significant Russian air activity in the early days of the war. This chapter explains how, in fact, the VKS mounted significant strike and offensive counter-air operations during this period, and the Ukrainian Air Force engaged in numerous air-to-air clashes to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first week of the invasion, Russian electronic warfare using jamming equipment and E-96M aerial decoys were highly effective in disrupting Ukrainian GBAD. S-300 and SA-11 ‘Buk’ radar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems were particularly badly affected in the north of the country, especially to the north of Kyiv along the Hostomel/Irpin and Chernihiv axes. Cruise and ballistic missile strikes had also damaged or destroyed multiple long-range early warning radars throughout the country, and destroyed various Ukrainian SAM sites in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in the south. The physical destruction, along with the electronic disruption and suppression of SAM systems in the north and northeast, left the Mikoyan Mig-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighters of the Ukrainian Air Force with the task of providing air defence over most of the country for the first few days of the war. The Ukrainian air defences progressively recovered as jammed and damaged radar systems were reset and assets were rapidly repositioned during the second and third days. After that, the Air Force and air defence infrastructures worked in tandem. Deconfliction between aircraft and GBAD was coordinated by time until 3 March, after which deconfliction began to be coordinated by space because of friendly fire incidents. In other words, SAM systems and combat aircraft sorties began to be deconflicted by being allocated separate operational areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukrainian GBAD units were electronically degraded and trying to reorganise and recover from physical strikes, Russian GBAD units inside Ukraine were also suffering from major limitations. Mobile air-defence assets, such as the short-range SA-15 ‘Tor’ and medium-range SA-17 ‘Buk’, had been sent into Ukraine with no functional communications plan. They were also advancing out of sequence and often separated from the formations that they were supposed to protect; and they were operating under very restrictive rules of engagement which instructed them to assume anything flying was Russian. The inability of radar-guided SAMs on either side to perform as anticipated during the first week and a half meant that fixed-wing aircraft on both sides had remarkable freedom to penetrate significant distances across the rapidly changing frontlines. This would quickly cease to be the case from early March, when both sides’ GBAD reorganised and became far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the invasion, Russian Sukhoi Su-34 ‘frontal bomber’ and Su-30SM and Su-35S multi-role fighter aircraft flew around 140 sorties per day, conducting fighter sweeps and strike sorties up to 300 km inside Ukrainian territory at altitudes of between 12,000 ft and 30,000 ft. During the first three days, the primary targets of these VKS strikes were Ukrainian air defences. Over 100 fixed long-range radar installations, bases, munitions storage sites and positions occupied by mobile long- and medium-range SAM systems were attacked, with Russian fixed-wing sorties concentrating their activities along the routes intended to be used by airborne and helicopter assault forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, all the medium- and high-level strikes were conducted against pre-designated locations that had been extensively mapped by Su-24MR reconnaissance bombers. The Ukrainian Air Force observed that the latter constantly flew two–four sorties per day at medium to high altitude along Ukraine’s borders from early February to the end of April. Su-34s carried out the bulk of the strikes with multiple unguided FAB-500 and OFAB-250 bombs, and, during the first week, typically operated at medium altitudes of around 12,000 ft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these medium-level daylight strikes were carried out by single aircraft, with fewer than 25% of strikes conducted by pairs or larger formations; and none were observed that involved more than six aircraft in a strike package. This contributed to inconsistent damage results as well as inefficient battle damage assessment (BDA), meaning that follow-up strikes were seldom carried out. Nevertheless, VKS fixed-wing air strikes were effective in the south, where, in conjunction with cruise and ballistic missiles, attacks badly degraded the limited Ukrainian Air Force and Naval air-defence capacity deployed in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, most of the targets hit were static radars and outdated S-125 (SA-3) SAM sites, and the only serious damage was to Ukrainian mobile SAM systems against trailer and truck-mounted S-300PS/PT units that either received too little warning to be able to move, or were stuck due to lack of spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian Su-35S and Su-30SM fighters flew numerous high-altitude CAPs at around 30,000 ft in support of the medium-altitude Russian strike aircraft operating widely during the first three days. They scored multiple air-to-air kills against Ukrainian Mig-29 and Su-27 fighters, as well as against low-flying Su-24 and Su-25 attack aircraft that were conducting strikes with unguided bombs and rockets against Russian military convoys on the Kyiv axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian pilots confirm that Russia’s Su-30SM and Su-35S completely outclass Ukrainian Air Force fighter aircraft on a technical level. The long range and good look-down, shoot-down performance of their N011M Bars and N035 Irbis-E radars, and the much longer reach and active-radar guidance capability of the R-77-1 air-to-air missile compared with the semi-active R-27R/ER available to Ukrainian fighters, are the most important aspects of this technical overmatch. Throughout the war, Russian fighters have frequently been able to achieve a radar lock and launch R-77-1 missiles at Ukrainian fighters from over 100 km away. Even though such shots have a low probability of kill, they force Ukrainian pilots to go defensive or risk being hit while still far outside their own effective range, and a few such long-range shots found their mark. Furthermore, the R-77-1’s active radar seeker, combined with the modern N011M and N035 radars, give Russian fighters the ability to launch missiles in track-while-scan (TWS) mode, meaning that Ukrainian pilots are unlikely to get warning from their radar-warning receivers (RWRs) that they have been launched on until the missile itself goes active a few seconds before it hits. In contrast, the R-27R/ER missiles that Ukrainian fighters are armed with require a single target track (STT) lock to be maintained by the launching fighter’s own radar throughout a missile engagement. This means that Russian pilots receive an RWR warning when a Ukrainian pilot launches a radar-guided missile at them, and that if the Ukrainian fighter even briefly loses radar lock during missile flight, due to either side manoeuvring, deploying countermeasures or electronic warfare, then the missile will miss.&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Internal view of R-77-1 air-to-air missile section showing rear fin control actuators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deeply unequal radar and missile performance compared with Russian fighters, as well as being tactically outnumbered by up to 15:2 in some cases, forced Ukrainian pilots to fly extremely low to try to exploit ground clutter and terrain masking to get close enough to fire before being engaged.30 This was still highly dangerous, and flying low further increased the range discrepancy between the effective ranges of Russian and Ukrainian air-to-air missiles, since Russian fighters were at higher speeds and high altitude, giving their missiles much more energy at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TB0O4uG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
▲ Section of casing from R-77 warhead showing expanding rod and pre-formed shrapnel sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these disadvantages, aggressive Ukrainian tactics and good use of the low-level terrain during the first days of the invasion led to multiple claims and several likely kills against Russian aircraft, although Ukrainian fighters were often shot down or damaged in the process. After three days of skirmishing in which both sides lost aircraft, there was a notable pause in Russian strike and fighter sorties venturing deep behind Ukrainian lines, which lasted for several days. As such, during the latter half of the first week, Su-34 and Su-35S pairs instead conducted numerous standoff launches against suspected Ukrainian radars and bases using Kh-31, Kh-58 and Kh-59 missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March, however, Russian SAM defences rapidly became much better coordinated and the threat from long-range S-400 ‘Triumph’ SAM systems based in Belarus and Crimea forced Ukrainian aircraft to fly at extremely low altitude – below 100 ft – for most of their sorties on the northern and southern axes. The threat from these long-range SAMs was compounded by the presence of a Russian S-band 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar in Belarus covering the Kyiv axis, and another in the south (which was later destroyed near Nova Kakovkha). These mobile radar systems were introduced in 2018, and have allowed Russian forces to track Ukrainian fixed-wing and rotary sorties at altitudes as low as 15 ft at well over 150 km. Given the method of operation of the Podlet-K1, it is unlikely to be capable of successfully supplying the high-resolution data required for terminal guidance illumination of low-flying targets at longer ranges. The success on various occasions of low-flying Ukrainian fighters in ambushing Russian high-altitude patrols during the first week of the war in areas covered by the Podlet K-1 system would suggest it only gives a relatively low-resolution tracking capability. On the other hand, this may simply indicate a poor dissemination of surveillance information from the radar to the Il-20M ‘Coot’ airborne command post and relay aircraft passing information from ground networks to patrolling Russian fighters. However, Podlet-K1 was designed to allow modern S-300 variants and the S-400 system to fire long-range missiles at a detected target, relay mid-course updates on the target movements to the missiles while in flight, and hence guide the missile close enough to detect and lock on to the aircraft in question with its own active radar seeker head as it descends from a high apex. The confident Ukrainian attribution of the loss of several aircraft to S-400 missile engagements while flying at very low altitude and at significant distances would, therefore, seem to suggest that longer-ranged missiles fired by these SAM systems do indeed possess a post-apex lock-on capability as previously theorised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Donbas front and in the south, a similar task was performed by A-50M/U Mainstay AWACS aircraft which flew an average of two–three sorties per day, providing higher-resolution early warning and vector information on low-flying Ukrainian aircraft in those sectors. However, the effectiveness of A-50M as a force multiplier has been limited throughout the war by two factors. First, Ukrainian forces have found A-50 to be fairly easy to degrade via electronic attack, and report consistent success in doing so. Second, because the Russian air operation is subordinated to the Ground Forces, surveillance information is not typically relayed directly between A-50M and fighters on CAP or to long-range GBAD units such as S-400 batteries. Instead, information is normally relayed via the military district command post or a combined arms army command post, then either directly or via an Il-20M relay aircraft to the GBAD units and fighter patrols. This significantly slows the rate of data transfer and limits the VKS’s ability to use A-50M/U to directly guide weapon engagements by GBAD assets or fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the first chaotic week of the invasion, it was becoming increasingly clear that Russian ground forces on the Kyiv and Kharkiv axes had become bogged down amid fierce Ukrainian resistance and Russian logistics difficulties. The airborne assault on Hostomel Airport had been repulsed by Ukrainian rapid reaction forces, and suddenly Russian forces had to adapt to a new plan. However, they had no coherent communications plan; many units had not exchanged encryption keys and had a shortage of trained radio operators. Furthermore, some radios were found to contain cheap Chinese substitute components lacking military-grade encryption, and so jamming resistance became a critical issue. The electronic warfare capabilities that had been initially very effective in degrading Ukrainian SAM systems were also causing serious electronic fratricide problems and thus compounding an increasingly critical communications breakdown among Russian ground force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian ground forces being unable to effectively communicate now became a greater threat to the Russian operation than Ukrainian SAM systems, so their electronic warfare assets began to greatly scale back their operations after the first two days. This allowed newly relocated Ukrainian SAM systems to regain much of their effectiveness, although it took time to repair or adapt to much of the damage to key radar systems for early warning and long-range missile guidance. In the first week of March, however, Ukrainian SAMs began to inflict significant losses on Russian attack sorties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective Ukrainian SAMs against Russian fixed-wing aircraft have consistently been SA-11 ‘Buk’ systems operating transporter-erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles as individual pop-up threats rather than as formed batteries alongside the usual target-acquisition radar and command vehicles. Alongside the longer-ranged S-300PS/PT and S-300V SAMs that had escaped destruction during the initial wave of strikes, the SA-11s quickly made Russian medium- and high-altitude operations prohibitively dangerous on the Kyiv and Kharkiv axes. At the same time, the VKS received new targeting priorities as it was swiftly becoming clear to the Russian leadership that the original military plan to rapidly seize Kyiv and other key cities and overthrow the Ukrainian government had failed. Therefore, the main VKS air effort was switched from attacks on Ukrainian air-defence capabilities to attempts to support the ground forces directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Ukrainian GBAD capabilities rapidly recovering from initial suppression and damage, they took over as the primary arm responsible for repelling the VKS near the frontlines from 3 March. The failure of Russia’s initial strike campaign to destroy the bulk of Ukraine’s medium-range SA-11 and SA-8 SAMs meant that as the VKS was re-tasked to attack Ukrainian Army positions in aid of the ground offensive, its pilots were forced to abandon flying at medium or high altitudes when penetrating Ukrainian airspace. At very low level, radar-guided SAM systems have a comparatively short effective range due to clutter and the curvature of the earth blocking their radar field of view to the target. Therefore, the final days of February and the first week of March saw the VKS conduct around 140 sorties per day, using Su-25, Su-30SM and Su-34 aircraft to conduct strikes at 500 ft or below using unguided bombs and rockets on Ukrainian positions. Once again, the sorties were flown as singles or pairs rather than larger formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While flying low did reduce losses from radar-guided SAMs, it also brought Russian jets into the range of the thousands of man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) that had been widely issued to Ukrainian troops. The results were predictable, with at least eight assorted Su-25, Su-30 and Su-34 jets being shot down by MANPADS in a week. These strikes were also significantly less accurate than the medium-level bombing that had been conducted in the first few days and in Syria, since they were also conducted with unguided bombs and rockets. At very low levels pilots have only seconds to visually acquire, identify and then manoeuvre their aircraft to accurately drop weapons on targets. In this case, the targets were Ukrainian forces which were frequently well dug in and operating many of the same vehicles and weapons as Russian forces. A lack of up-to-date maps also compounded low-level navigation and target-recognition difficulties for Russian pilots. Consequently, penetrating daylight low-level strikes achieved little serious damage against Ukrainian forces and the concept of operations was rapidly judged to be unsustainable by experienced VKS fixed-wing pilots, who quickly began to refuse to fly missions beyond Ukrainian lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Air War and Ukrainian Requirements for Air Defence15Bronk with Reynolds and Watling very low levels pilots have only seconds to visually acquire, identify and then manoeuvre their aircraft to accurately drop weapons on targets. In this case, the targets were Ukrainian forces which were frequently well dug in and operating many of the same vehicles and weapons as Russian forces. A lack of up-to-date maps also compounded low-level navigation and target-recognition difficulties for Russian pilots. Consequently, penetrating daylight low-level strikes achieved little serious damage against Ukrainian forces and the concept of operations was rapidly judged to be unsustainable by experienced VKS fixed-wing pilots, who quickly began to refuse to fly missions beyond Ukrainian lines. In response, the VKS shifted its penetrating sorties to night attacks from 9 March 2022. Since most Ukrainian MANPADS operators lacked night-vision goggles at this time, initial VKS losses were greatly reduced by operating in darkness. However, the only one of its fast jet fleets with cockpit equipment and appropriate training for contested low-level night operations was the Su-34s. Consequently, the Su-34 fleet bore the brunt of the remaining penetrating strike operations flown by the VKS before they were curtailed in April. As before, the primary armament remained heavy loads of FAB-500, or mixed OFAB-250 and OFAB-100 unguided bombs, although the Kh-29T/L standoff missile and Kh-31P anti-radiation missile (ARM) began to see increasing use for specific targets and suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD). With the difficulties of target acquisition and accurate attacks at low level compounded by flying at night, the general targeting profile also changed. Unable to accurately hit Ukrainian military units, the VKS defaulted to simply bombarding besieged cities as it had in Syria, except at night and from low level. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol were all heavily bombed by the Su-34s during this period, since Russia was desperately looking to make symbolic progress as the Battle for Kyiv increasingly swung in Ukraine’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout March, Su-35S and Su-30SM fighters continued to conduct CAPs between 30,000 and 50,000 ft, but generally without entering Ukrainian-controlled airspace. Instead, they acted as a deterrent to Ukrainian attack sorties, but were also tasked to conduct SEAD operations. To this end, their CAPs were used as bait to try to make Ukrainian SAM systems turn on their radars to fire at them. If SA-11s or other SAMs did try to engage them, the Flankers would fire Kh-31P and, later, older Kh-58 ARMs at long ranges to home in on the radar emissions, and then turn away. Meanwhile Su-25 singles or pairs flown by experienced crews would fly in at low altitude to try to find and kill the SAM with rockets while it was suppressed. However, there were few Russian pilots capable of low-level destruction of enemy air defences (DEAD) sorties in an Su-25 with unguided rockets, and those that could frequently paid for their bold tactics by being hit with MANPADS from Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian Air Force aviation and air-defence commanders confirmed in multiple interviews that while Ukraine has lost a number of SA-11 and SA-8 SAMs to the many Kh-31P and Kh-58s fired since the invasion, none of the low-level Su-25 DEAD rocket attacks was successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Kyiv axes in April, Russian forces were reorganised and concentrated against Ukrainian positions in Donbas and in the southeast in the surrounded city of Mariupol. This allowed far better coordination of Russian aircraft, long-range strike capabilities, electronic warfare assets and GBAD with ground operations. Alongside continued heavy use of Kh-31P and Kh-58 ARMs by VKS fighters, Russian troops also began to effectively coordinate operations with hunting complexes of Orlan-10 UAVs to force Ukrainian SAM systems to unmask and then suppress them for long enough using electronic warfare attack to designate individual SAMs for accurate artillery and missile strikes. This rapidly forced medium-range Ukrainian Air Force SA-11 ‘Buk’ and short-range Ukrainian Army SA-8 ‘Osa’ SAM systems to operate further back from the frontlines to reduce loss rates, and allowed Russian aircraft a significant degree of freedom to operate at medium and high altitudes in the vicinity of the frontlines. Nevertheless, actual penetrations of Ukrainian lines to conduct strikes with fixed-wing aircraft on targets other than Ukrainian Army positions rapidly decreased due to persistent losses during even low-altitude night-time operations by Su-34s against cities such as Kharkiv, which involved very limited penetration distances. Instead, the Su-34 fleet began to regularly employ Kh-29T/L tv/laser-guided missiles for standoff attacks from medium altitude at distances of 8–15 km against fixed targets from mid-April. During this period, Russia also used 16 Tu-22M3 ‘Backfire’ bombers to drop heavy unguided bombs on the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol from medium altitude by day on 21 April, in addition to repeated attacks by Su-34s carrying sticks of heavy FAB-500 unguided bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable feature of VKS fixed-wing strike operations from February to April was that BDA was poor. The primary assessment metric was whether crews reported hitting the target upon landing, and orbital imagery assessment was used to then confirm damage observed as expected. This meant that in most cases where damage was only superficial or had actually failed to hit the intended targets, follow-up sorties were not flown. A marked tendency to overstate successes has been a consistent feature of Russian intelligence and military BDA and planning cycles during the period leading up to and then during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This is an almost unavoidable consequence of the way that the Russian political system works, where reporting what seniors wish to hear, reinforcing their previous decisions and inflating successes, is an absolute prerequisite for promotion to higher rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the war to date, Russian Su-25SM/SM3 ground-attack aircraft have been used differently from the rest of the VKS fixed-wing fleet, being generally tasked with operations against Ukrainian Army targets at grid locations supplied by friendly assets on or near the frontlines. The deepest recorded strikes using unguided lofted rocket attacks by Su-25 formations were less than 100 km from the Russian frontlines, and most involved far shorter penetrations of Ukrainian lines. Su-25 sorties remained almost exclusively at low altitudes below 1,000 m and often at less than 100 m, especially close to the frontlines during rocket attacks or if patrolling for targets. MANPADS have been the primary threat for the Su-25, due to the need to regularly cross parts of the frontlines during such operations. However, their defensive aids suites have performed consistently well against most MANPADS; the losses have come from repeat exposure in areas with high concentrations of MANPADS teams, rather than a high probability of kill during individual engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 2022, the launch of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson and subsequent counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region in the northeast granted Ukraine the initiative and has forced the Russian Army to go on the defensive across almost the whole of its remaining frontlines. In the air too, Ukraine has been able to significantly attrit and subsequently impose a degree of suppression on Russian GBAD using the Western-suppled AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation (HARM) missile. As such, Ukrainian Su-25 and Su-24 attack aircraft have become increasingly active, conducting regular standoff rocket attacks and even bombing runs against Russian positions in Kherson and Kharkiv. This has forced the VKS to adopt an increasingly defensive posture. The VKS has divided the Ukrainian/Russian lines into eight zones and maintains a regular posture of a pair of Su-35S fighters or Mikoyan Mig-31BM interceptors in each one. Without regular tanker support – which the VKS does not provide to fighter units due to limited capacity and prioritising the strategic bomber force – times on station for these CAPs are unlikely to exceed two hours, so at minimum this posture requires around 96 sorties per day to sustain in daylight. However, these patrols have proven highly effective against Ukrainian attack aircraft and fighters, with the Mig-31BM and R-37M long-range air-to-air missile being especially problematic. The VKS has been firing up to six R-37Ms per day during October, and the extremely high speed of the weapon, coupled with very long effective range and a seeker designed for engaging low-altitude targets, makes it particularly difficult to evade. The long range of the R-37M, in conjunction with the very high performance and high operating altitude of the Mig-31BM also allows it significant freedom to menace Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines from outside the range of Ukrainian defences. The VKS has also started employing the R-37M from at least a few of its Su-35S fighters, which not only increases the reach of the latter in combat but may also suggests Russian stocks of the R-37M are in little danger of running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2zzOuTc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
▲ MiG-31 BM carrying R-77-1 and R-37M missiles taking part in operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the demands for close air support from the Russian Army which has been forced to retreat from Kharkiv oblast and parts of Luhansk and Kherson, the strike tempo being flown by the VKS Su-25 and Su-34 fleets has not noticeably increased. The Su-25 force continues to conduct regular standoff rocket attacks, but these are only capable of producing a barrage effect in a rough area. The lack of targeting pods and multi-role expertise across the Russian fighter fleets leaves the Su-34 fleet as the only VKS element theoretically capable of conducting effective standoff dynamic targeting against Ukrainian forces moving in the open. The VKS is almost certainly anxious to minimise further losses of these expensive and complex aircraft, after losing at least 17 since February. Therefore, footage of Su-34s conducting unguided bombing runs over the frontlines at low level – exposing them to a high degree of risk from MANPADS and ground fire – suggests a degree of desperation. It may be that stocks of Kh-29T/L and other standoff missiles are running low, or that the Su-34s are struggling to accurately find and hit Ukrainian battlefield targets without coming in very low and getting close enough to visually identify them. There have also been several crashes in the VKS Su-25, Su-30 and Su-34 fleets during non-combat-related accidents since early September. Each one may be individually explained by bird strikes, pilot error or technical failures. However, collectively they suggest that eight months of war have taken a toll in terms of accumulated airframe and aircrew fatigue. Tired aircrew, ground personnel and continuing operational demands for support from the ground forces that force normal maintenance, leave and overhaul periods to be ignored are all likely to be contributing factors. In particular, the ground-attack-focused Su-25 and Su-34 fleets have both taken much heavier losses than the fighter fleets, with 23 of the former and 17 of the latter confirmed lost from pre-war fleets of around 110 modernised Su-25SM/SM3s and 130 Su-34(M)s. This will have further increased the burden of an operating tempo far in excess of peacetime expectations on the aircraft and pilots that remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the VKS conducted a more significant fixed-wing strike campaign during the initial days of the invasion than has previously been documented by external analysts. The ground-based Ukrainian air-defence network was initially suppressed by electronic attacks, decoy use and physical strikes, and this allowed Russian aircraft to attack more than 100 targets deep inside Ukraine. Ukrainian Air Force fighter aircraft bore the brunt of the air-defence task until the SAM systems and radars of the GBAD network had been relocated and reset sufficiently to take over primary responsibility at the beginning of March. The great disparity in technical capabilities and numbers between Ukrainian Air Force fighters and Russian ones meant that while Ukrainian fighter pilots were able to inflict some losses on Russian aircraft using aggressive low-level tactics, they also took many losses in return. However, once the SA-11 and S-300 SAM systems began to operate effectively, Russian strike aircraft were forced to operate at low altitudes when penetrating Ukrainian-controlled airspace, and Russian fighters had to stand off to patrol at high altitudes. Russia’s inability to effectively conduct DEAD against Ukrainian SAM systems has so far denied them the ability to control the airspace over most of Ukraine. The VKS has used Kh-29 and Kh-59 missiles to hit fixed targets from standoff ranges, usually using the Su-34 fleet. It has also used the Su-35S and Su-30SM fleets to fire large numbers of Kh-31P and Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles to suppress Ukrainian radar-guided SAMs, though this has failed to produce many actual kills. However, Russian close air support efforts have generally been limited to low-level unguided bombing runs and unguided rocket barrages, which have failed to inflict decisive damage on Ukrainian ground forces and have led to sustained losses to MANPADS among the Su-25 and Su-34 fleets. On the other hand, Russian high-altitude fighter CAPs with Su-35S and more recently with Mig-31BM interceptors are continuing to shoot down significant numbers of Ukrainian ground attack aircraft near the frontlines from distances that render them all but immune to return fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-russian-attack-helicopter-employment-and-performance&quot;&gt;II. Russian Attack Helicopter Employment and Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Su-34 frontal bomber fleet, the dominant ground-attack platform in the Russian air campaign has been the Ka-52 ‘Alligator’ attack helicopter. Alongside Mi-28 ‘Havok’ and Mi-24/35 ‘Hind’ gunships, the Ka-52 fleet conducted aggressive hunter-killer sorties at very low altitude against Ukrainian forces during the early months of the war. These sorties were generally flown in pairs and used a combination of unguided rockets and cannon fire against troop concentrations and soft-skinned vehicles, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) against armoured vehicles and other hardened targets. In Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in the south, where Ukrainian air defences took particularly heavy damage in initial strikes on 24 February, hunter-killer sorties from Ka-52s were observed penetrating up to 50 km into Ukrainian-controlled territory during late February and into early March. Ka-52s and Mi-24s also escorted the Mi-8/17 transport helicopters carrying Russian airborne troops into Hostomel Airport on the first day of the invasion, with at least one Mi-24 being shot down by a Javelin anti-tank missile used in direct attack mode and a Ka-52 force landing after taking small arms fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the battle for Kyiv, Mi-24 and Mi-28 gunships operated alongside the Ka-52 in the hunter-killer role at night, as well as in daylight. However, typically night operations of this kind have been flown by the Ka-52 fleet due to their superior night-vision equipment. It is also likely that the doctrinally established role for Ka-52 – to provide support to Russian special operations forces including in adverse conditions and at night – meant that a much greater proportion of Ka-52 aircrew were trained and current in low-level night operations compared with in the Hind and Havok fleets. However, following the Russian retreat from Kyiv in April, penetration distances and the number of hunter-killer sorties began to diminish rapidly across all the gunship fleets. Heavy losses taken during daylight operations, especially among experienced crews, created a dynamic whereby Russian rotary crews became very hesitant to cross the Ukrainian frontlines from April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian helicopter (and fixed-wing attack jet) defensive aids suites combining missile-approach warning sensors and countermeasures-dispensing programmes have functioned reasonably well throughout the conflict, succeeding in decoying many incoming missiles. However, the sheer number of MANPADS fired at them during penetrating sorties ensured that many hits were still scored. Furthermore, at several points during early March and later in Donbas, Russian helicopters failed to dispense flares when engaged by MANPADS. This suggests that either they had run out already during that sortie, or potentially supply chain issues were forcing crews to fly with their defensive aids suites set to semi-automatic or manual modes to reduce consumption rates at the cost of reduced effectiveness. The British Starstreak and the American Javelin anti-tank missile (used in direct-attack mode) have been particularly effective against all Russian helicopters as they are immune to being decoyed by flares or chaff countermeasures. However, these weapons require a significantly greater level of operator training and are more expensive and scarcer than normal MANPADS. Javelin has also largely been saved for attacks on Russian tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After heavy initial losses, Russian helicopters almost solely engaged in attacks with unguided rockets from behind the Russian frontlines during the Russian offensive in Donbas between April and July, and in defensive operations against Ukrainian counter-offensives in Kherson and Kharkiv since September. During these indirect rocket attacks, Russian helicopters typically approach a target area while flying at below 200 ft, then pitch up to between 15 and 30 degrees and fire S-8 and S-13 unguided rockets in a lofted trajectory against known concentrations of Ukrainian forces in a general grid square. Immediately after firing all their rockets in a salvo, they turn away while dropping countermeasures without crossing their own lines. The accuracy that can be obtained using these tactics is generally poor, sufficient only to force Ukrainian forces in the open to take cover, or to fix dug-in units in place until the impacts subside. In Donbas, both Ka-52 and Mi-24s also regularly conduct these indirect attacks at night to keep Ukrainian troops awake. In general, however, Russian helicopters have struggled to conduct low-altitude sorties at night outside the areas of Donbas, occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014 and thus well known to them. Russian maps of most of Ukraine as provided to all troops are often decades out of date and helicopter crews are no exception, making low-level flight at night very hazardous since obstacles are unlikely to be mapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATGMs are sometimes also used by gunships to attack Ukrainian positions, or vehicles that can be spotted and identified without crossing the lines. However, Russian gunships face a notable disadvantage when operated in this manner since they have very poor vibration dampening. This means that the gyro-stabilisation of internal optics struggles to produce a clear picture at high magnification levels, making acquisition, positive identification and precise laser or command-wire guidance at longer ranges very challenging. This limits the practical range of Russian helicopter-launched ATGMs, and forces them to expose themselves to potential attack by MANPADS, Javelin in direct attack mode, and ground-launched ATGMs by firing from close to the frontlines. The final penetrating hunter-killer sorties were conducted by Ka-52s in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmed losses of Russian gunships at the time of writing, where wreckage has been positively identified, include eight Mi-24/35 ‘Hind’, six Mi-28 ‘Havok’ and 23 Ka-52 ‘Alligator’ helicopters. The true total is undoubtedly higher, but Stijn Mitzer and Joost Olieman’s numbers in the Oryx blog also include several helicopters destroyed on the ground or in accidents, and the overall proportions are likely to be fairly representative. What stands out is that the Ka-52 fleet has taken a disproportionate number of losses compared with the other gunship types operated by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons that are likely to have contributed to this. First, the Ka-52 has seen more intensive use than the other fleets, both by day and especially at night, on all fronts in Ukraine. Second, the Ka-52 has notable deficiencies in armour protection compared with other Russian attack helicopters, especially the engine compartments, which have no armour plating at all – leaving them potentially vulnerable to damage from even small arms fire. Third, the Ka-52 uses a different ATGM from the Mi-28 and Mi-24/35; the 9K121 Vikhr uses a laser beam-riding guidance system with the seeker on the missile mounted at the rear facing backwards rather than in the nose like a traditional laser seeker. In other words, the seeker on the Vikhr looks back at the helicopter to ‘see’ the laser guidance beam, rather than looking for a laser spot reflected off the target. This makes it almost impossible to jam in flight and also cheaper than comparable traditional ATGMs. However, it also means that the Ka-52 cannot drift more than a few degrees per second to the left, right, up or down while guiding the missile in flight, or the laser beam from the helicopter will move outside the field of view of the seeker and guidance will fail. The result has been that Ukrainian troops have been able to shoot down Ka-52s using wire-guided Stugna anti-tank missiles on several occasions, when the helicopters were hovering almost stationary attempting to identify and guide their Vikhr missiles to targets near the frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Ka-52 airframes have also been recovered after being shot down in a condition that suggests poor maintenance and crew training are problems. Modern encrypted radio sets have been found without the encryption keys needed to use them, and in others the radar and other sensors have been found either in the stowed position or with pins or covers still fitted that prevent them from working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Russian attack helicopter fleet was initially used to conduct aggressive hunter-killer sorties behind Ukrainian frontlines, with penetration depths of up to 50 km relatively common. However, losses to MANPADS were heavy and so Russian tactics shifted during March, with penetrating sorties becoming less and less common; they were replaced by rocket ‘lofting’ attacks from a safe distance. Since April, Russian attack helicopters have been used extremely cautiously, with a heavy reliance on standoff rocket attacks rendering them little more than flying rocket artillery assets. Despite this cautious approach, they continue to be shot down regularly by Ukrainian frontline units using MANPADS, Javelin and, occasionally, ATGMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-russias-long-range-strike-campaign-cruise-missiles-ballistic-missiles-and-loitering-munitions&quot;&gt;III. Russia’s Long-Range Strike Campaign: Cruise Missiles, Ballistic Missiles and Loitering Munitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion began with a heavy cruise and ballistic missile barrage, the opening salvo in a sustained long-range precision-strike campaign which averaged around 24 missiles per day for the first three months of the war. From 24 February to the end of May, more than 2,000 3M-54 Kalibr, Kh-101, Kh-55, Kh-555 and other cruise missiles were fired into Ukraine, usually in salvos of 4–12 at once. The Kalibrs are fired from naval ships and submarines in the Black Sea, while the Kh-101, Kh-55 and Kh-555 are typically launched from Tu-95 strategic bombers from inside Russian airspace. Around 240 9M720 and 9M723 ballistic missiles were also fired from Iskander-M ground-based launchers at around 160 targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian land-attack cruise missiles and ballistic missiles have performed well throughout the conflict, with most impacting within 3–10 m of their intended aiming points, except when degraded by Ukrainian electronic warfare assets. Furthermore, during the initial strikes, Ukrainian air defences were themselves degraded by electronic warfare and most were relocating during the early salvos to avoid being destroyed so only succeeded in intercepting a small proportion of the incoming cruise missiles. Intercepting Russian Tochka-U and Iskander ballistic missiles has proven very difficult throughout the conflict due to a lack of suitable interceptor missiles and the short range of potential coverage for each system against such threats. Iskander 9M723 is especially problematic for Ukrainian air defences due to its quasi-ballistic manoeuvring capabilities and the fact that it launches six penetration aids to generate additional radar returns and electronic warfare effects during its terminal phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary Russian long-range strike objective during the first three days was to degrade and destroy Ukrainian air-defence capabilities. As such, Russian strikes overwhelmingly targeted air-defence sites including fixed radars, fixed S-125 (SA-3) SAM sites, command centres, airbases, ammunition storage sites and known long-range S-300 mobile SAM sites. Most of these represented fixed targets that Russia had been able to identify and integrate into a strike plan during the months leading up to the invasion. Conventional methods for locating targets included orbital reconnaissance and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT and SIGINT) aircraft such as Su-24MR ‘Fencer-E’ and Il-20 ‘Coot’ aircraft conducting standoff reconnaissance flights to map Ukraine’s defences. However, perhaps Russia’s most important source of targeting information for the opening and subsequent stages of its strike campaign remains human intelligence (HUMINT). The Russian ‘special services’ including the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Directorate of the General Staff (GU) run active teams and officers who control networks of recruited assets, including important regional and national politicians and military officers inside Ukraine. Controlling Ukraine has been one of Russia’s longest running foreign policy goals, and thorough penetration of its government and security apparatuses has been a task for the Russian special services ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union. As such, Russia has had access to detailed information about the workings of the Ukrainian state and military for decades, which provides a rich source of data for planning and targeting long-range strikes against fixed defence sites, bases and important infrastructure nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite detailed Russian target lists and heavy firepower, Ukrainian air defences were on alert on the 24 February and, after receiving urgent warnings from partner states, relocated most of their mobile air-defence systems shortly before their positions were struck by the first wave of Russian missiles. Consequently the losses among mobile assets were light, consisting of a number of S-300PS/PT SAM transporter erector launchers (TELs) that could not be moved in time due to insufficient warning and poor chassis serviceability. However, many static early warning radars were hit and at least temporarily knocked out. Several older static SA-3 SAM sites were destroyed. The Russian missile (and fixed-wing) strikes were most effective in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where warning times were lower than in Donbas or in the north and many units had older, less serviceable equipment. Strikes on Ukrainian Air Force airbases and ammunition stowage also caused limited damage due to timely dispersal of airworthy Ukrainian aircraft to smaller bases and relocation of most ammunition stocks in the hours prior to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mM4czEV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
▲ Penetration aid from a Russian 9M723 Iskander ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening salvos exhibit one of the clearest features of Russia’s long-range strike campaign against Ukrainian military targets during the war. The Russian military and intelligence services collectively demonstrated an ability to collect detailed information about Ukrainian air-defence target locations. This was then used by each Military District command centre to develop a coherent target list according to the overarching plan at the operational level, which was then used to assign targets to individual strike assets serving each of the four main operational directions. The missiles themselves generally hit the aiming points assigned to them with sufficient precision, and the opening salvo was well coordinated with electronic warfare effects to ensure almost all of them got through the largely blinded and suppressed Ukrainian air defences. However, in many cases the targets of each strike had moved by the time the missiles hit their designated aiming points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial salvos failed to destroy Ukrainian air-defence capability on 24 February, the Russian target detection, tracking and fire-mission assignment process was not fast enough to stay ahead of continued Ukrainian dispersal and shoot-and-scoot tactics. For example, HUMINT on a Ukrainian air-defence position located by GU assets would be passed into the ‘Akatsiya’ strategic command architecture in Moscow, then integrated into the next 24 hours strike plan at Military District command-centre level, and assigned to a strike asset. This process takes at least 48 hours and sometimes significantly longer to result in a strike. As such, when used against mobile targets the Russian long-range strike complex has consistently generated accurate strikes using expensive cruise and ballistic missiles (or long-range rocket artillery) on the exact positions long since vacated by Ukrainian systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having failed to achieve a quick military victory in the first few days, Russian long-range strike assets were re-tasked in early March from Ukrainian air-defence sites to infrastructure and government targets. These included transmission towers for Ukrainian television and radio in Kyiv, Vinnytsia and other cities, and attacks on internet and mobile phone infrastructure. These strikes were coupled with a significant increase in the already-intensive Russian offensive cyber campaign against Ukraine. There were also sporadic strikes on government buildings and symbolic civilian targets such as Kharkiv University, which caused many civilian casualties and increased refugee flows out of the country. The primary aim appears to have been to degrade Ukrainian government public messaging and coordination capacity in the hope that Ukrainian resistance and political unity might still fracture and allow a pro-Russian takeover. Targeting buildings with governmental, security and cultural importance in cities with large cruise and ballistic missile warheads also served to increase the pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian public by raising the spectre of massive damage and civilian casualties in besieged cities if fighting continued. Strikes were also directed at important Ukrainian defence industry factories to reduce the capacity to produce, maintain, modernise and repair domestically manufactured equipment, as well as targeting a training and assembly base for Western volunteer fighters in Lviv on 13 March. While significant damage was done, it did not have decisive results due to the scale of Western support, the volume of captured Russian military equipment, ammunition and spares available to Ukrainian forces, and the rapid dispersal of many previously centralised facilities to reduce their vulnerability to further attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weight of fire that Russia could sustain limited the overall effectiveness of this approach, since aside from large broadcast towers, physically destroying a critical mass of communications equipment in a country the size of Ukraine would require attacking a huge number of relatively small targets. By mid-March the VKS fixed-wing fleet was flying almost no penetrating sorties by day, and those that were being flown were exclusively low-level flights to drop unguided bombs on area targets in support of the ground forces. Large-scale cyber attacks also failed to have a decisive effect as Russia had been conducting sustained cyber warfare against Ukraine since 2014, so most key networks were heavily defended, with attention given to backing up critical data with help from allies. This left only Russia’s cruise and ballistic missile arsenals available to conduct deep strikes across most of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also relies heavily on its long-range precision-strike arsenal for conventional and tactical nuclear deterrent capability against NATO under the doctrine of non-contact warfare. With the Russian Army increasingly bogged down and overstretched in Ukraine, and a strategy of brinkmanship from President Vladimir Putin predicated on intimidating the West into abandoning or at least limiting its military assistance, Russia cannot afford to fire its entire stockpile. Therefore, Russia’s military leadership began to plan for a new set of targeting criteria that could deliver a greater strategic effect with the limited number of total missiles available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next major Russian bombardment strategy was instigated in June, with several weeks of daily strikes against Ukrainian fuel storage facilities, refineries and key railway infrastructure. This could potentially have had a very serious effect on the Ukrainian population and the war effort over time if it had been conducted on a large scale from the outset. However, two major factors conspired to reduce its impact to a manageable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Ukrainian air defences had, by this stage, been reorganised and redeployed to provide much more effective coverage against cruise missiles around key cities and facilities. Whereas during March and April interception rates had been around 20–30%, by mid-June they were roughly 50–60%. The SA-11 ‘Buk’ SAM systems provided the bulk of the anti-aircraft threat near the frontlines to keep Russian fast jets and helicopters flying low or further back behind Russian lines. The long-range S-300PS/PT and S-300V1 SAM systems are more capable against cruise missiles and Tochka-U ballistic missiles than SA-11, and provide coverage over a wider area. They are also more valuable and less mobile than SA-11 so it made less sense to risk having them destroyed by Russian SEAD/DEAD efforts by deploying them close to the frontlines. Therefore, Ukraine’s S-300 systems were primarily deployed to defend cities and infrastructure, and have proven highly effective against all types of Russian cruise missiles, especially when supplied with early warning information of launches from either Ukrainian sensors or partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6UYeU3S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
▲ Russian 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missile shot down in Kyiv oblast late October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia was already running uncomfortably low on missile stocks given its requirements to maintain a contingency stockpile to deter NATO and the heavy expenditure from February to June. Despite benefiting from an impressive degree of component modularity and commonality between different missile types, including between cruise missiles such as 3M-54 Kalibr and ballistic missiles such as 9M723, Russian industrial production capacity is very limited compared with the rate at which they have been expended. For example, the modernised 9M723 Iskander production line has a monthly output capacity of six missiles. Effective sanctions enforcement to complicate Russian acquisition of Western micro-electronics would make their sustainment problems considerably worse given the heavy reliance on US, Taiwanese and other Western chips in all their standoff missiles. As a result of these shortages, firing rates of Russia’s standard long-range land-attack missiles were lower from June to September than the 24 per day average in the first three months of the war. In combination with a revitalised Ukrainian air-defence capability, this lower rate of fire has hampered the ability of Russian long-range strikes to prevent Ukraine steadily gaining the initiative in the war during this period. However, during this period Russia’s stockpile limitations and inadequate production capacity for traditional cruise and ballistic missile types led to several significant actions on the part of the Russian military leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OjhCJlo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
▲ 9M723 Iskander ballistic missile remains with penetration aid (decoy) dispenser tubes visible. The R-77-1 air-to-air missile is also visible (left).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russian forces began firing large numbers of other long-range missile types in the land-attack role. Older Kh-22 ‘Kitchen’ anti-ship missiles have been fired into Ukraine throughout the conflict, but as early as mid-March Russia also began launching the relatively new, supersonic and hugely expensive P-800 ‘Oniks’ anti-ship missile from its ‘Bastion-P’ systems in Crimea. However, the radar-guided terminal-homing capabilities of anti-ship missiles are not optimised for attacking ground targets, and so offer not only reduced precision compared with dedicated land-attack weapons when used in that role, but can also sometimes home in on the wrong target once they go active. One likely case was the devastating attack on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk in July 2022 where a Kh-22 apparently missed its intended target nearby and instead homed in on the large radar reflection of the shopping centre’s flat metal walls and roof. Russia also began to regularly use its S-300V1 and S-300VM tracked long-range SAM systems in the land-attack role, especially in the south near Kherson. Both versions fire the 5V55 missile which was designed to have a secondary land-attack capability for self-defence of the S-300V1. In the land-attack role, it has a ballistic trajectory with a maximum range of 82 km. Its high supersonic speed makes it impossible to intercept with current Ukrainian air-defence systems and it delivers a large 130-kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead. However, it is a very inaccurate weapon, being purely ballistic with no terminal homing capabilities against ground targets, and so Russian forces generally use them as indiscriminate bombardment weapons against cities – especially Mykolaiv. Russian industry has also opened a new production facility to recondition and return old stocks of Tochka-U ballistic missiles to usable condition to supplement dwindling 9M720/723 Iskander-M stocks and production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second significant consequence of Russia’s ineffective (albeit very destructive) initial standoff missile campaigns and limited remaining stockpiles was a deal with Iran to supply large numbers of Shahed-136 loitering munitions and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) support to teach Russian units to assemble and use them. The first Shahed-136 (Russian name, ‘Geran-2’) attacks were recorded by Ukrainian air defenders in mid-September, with attacks against Odesa alongside Iranian-supplied armed Mohajer-6 UAVs. An IRGC training group protected by an FSB security detail was identified and monitored by Ukrainian intelligence services, and destroyed with a precision artillery strike in Kherson around this time. Unfortunately this did not end the Russian acceptance and ramp-up process for large-scale Shahed-136 use as a long-range strike weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shahed-136 itself is a propeller-powered missile with a warhead capacity of 20–40 kg, depending on fuel load, desired range and consequent centre of gravity limitations. It has a maximum range of well in excess of 1,000 km and typically cruises at around 150–170 km/h. Guidance is provided using a mixture of inertial navigation and civilian GPS receivers with some features to improve jamming resistance, allowing it to hit fixed aiming points, but not moving targets. The accuracy is sufficient to produce multiple hits on a single building, and the Shahed-136 can also bank to circle around a target upon arrival to perform a steep (&amp;gt;70-degree) terminal dive from a specific bearing programmed before launch. A modified version equipped with specialist seeker heads and datalinks can apparently hit moving targets if designated by a more sophisticated UAV such as the Orlan-10, although these modifications significantly increase the price and are not common. The basic Shahed-136/Geran-2 is a relatively simple, cheap and precise weapon for use against fixed targets for which Iran can supply components and Russia could license manufacture in very large quantities. This makes it an important medium- and long-term component in Russia’s current long-range strike strategy against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YkxguzD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
▲ Wing-tip section from a destroyed Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Russian strategy opened with a barrage of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles against targets in multiple Ukrainian cities, including in central Kyiv on 10 October. This time, cruise missiles were launched alongside tens of Shahed-136 loitering munitions. More than half the total incoming weapons were shot down by Ukrainian air defences, but those that got through still inflicted serious damage and multiple civilian casualties. Despite Putin claiming that the strikes in cities were a one-off retaliation for an explosion on the Kerch Bridge the previous week, the new strategy – to target electricity infrastructure – was already being prepared before the bridge was bombed. On 9 October a new commander of the Russian military campaign against Ukraine, General Segey Surovikin, was appointed. Notorious for the brutality of the campaign he ran in Syria in his previous role as the commander of the VKS, Surovikin was appointed to implement a strategy that many of the more extreme Russian political and media commentators have been urging for months – to deprive the Ukrainian civilian population of light and heating as winter approaches via large-scale strikes on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 10 October, Ukraine has seen multiple daily waves of Shahed-136s fired against electricity substations, infrastructure-control offices and facilities across most of the country. The relatively small warhead is less suitable than cruise missiles or ballistic missiles for destroying large or hardened targets. Therefore, the expensive Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles and 9M723 Iskander, drawn from increasingly depleted stocks, have been simultaneously used to hit power stations and other large electricity-related targets. Most of the Shahed-136s that are launched are being shot down by Ukrainian fighters, SAMs, MANPADS teams and anti-aircraft gunfire. However, they are being used in large enough numbers already – with more than 400 fired since mid-September – that they are draining Ukraine’s air-defence missile stocks in an alarming way, and still each day some get through to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Russia’s long-range missile campaign has gone through several phases. The opening salvoes targeted Ukrainian Air Force air-defence capabilities and stockpiles. Strikes subsequently focused on Ukrainian defence industry, communications infrastructure and small numbers of symbolic buildings in key cities. After the Russian ground campaign refocused on offensive operations in Donbas, fuel storage, refineries and railway infrastructure became primary targets for long-range strikes. However, in each of these cases Russia was unable to generate a critical concentration of strikes to have decisive effects on Ukraine’s ability to continue fighting. Under General Surovikin the strategy has changed again. Iranian-supplied loitering munitions and more expensive traditional precision-strike weapons are now being used in tandem to systemically target critical civilian electricity infrastructure. The multiple daily air-raid alarms disrupt work and sleep patterns and cause fear and anxiety for people who had hoped the threat to their homes was receding. More worryingly, temporary blackouts that grow more frequent each day across many of Ukraine’s key cities after just three weeks of this new strike campaign suggest that it poses a major threat to Ukraine’s ability to keep its people warm and safe during the coming winter months. It is unlikely to change Russia’s battlefield fortunes in Ukraine, but the latest iteration of Russia’s long-range strike efforts is causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defence equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-the-need-for-more-western-aid-to-improve-ukrainian-air-defence&quot;&gt;IV. The Need for More Western Aid to Improve Ukrainian Air Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the success of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv, its subsequent recapture of Lyman and continued pressure in Luhansk and Kherson, Russia is faced with the prospect of military defeat on the ground in 2023. Partial Russian mobilisation will take several months to produce even barely competent new troops to augment battered regular units, let alone entire new formations. The task will be especially difficult given that the instructors and experienced officers Russia would normally count on to train new conscripts are largely either stuck trying to hold the frontlines in Ukraine or have become casualties. In response to the lack of viable options on the ground, Russia’s leaders have turned to renewed long-range bombardment against civilian critical utilities. The plan is to cause enough civilian suffering that the Zelensky government is either forced to negotiate ceasefire terms or face major civil unrest that delays preparations for a renewed counter-offensive push to liberate the remaining occupied territories of Ukraine in spring 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s air and missile strike operations between February and August 2022 failed to produce decisive effects against Ukrainian target sets that ranged from air defences to communications, military industry, transport and fuel infrastructure. The failure of the VKS to mount an effective SEAD/DEAD campaign in the face of effective, dispersed Ukrainian Air Force GBAD operations cost it the ability to operate above very low altitude in Ukrainian airspace. This was critical in allowing the Ukrainian Air Force fighter and ground-attack fleets to survive and continue to contest control of the air and attack Russian ground forces, despite being completely outmatched at a technical level. Meanwhile, the large number of MANPADS provided to Ukrainian troops and later mobile air-defence teams near the frontlines meant that even very low altitude VKS fixed-wing penetrations proved prohibitively costly in March, and ceased by April 2022. In consequence, Russia has not been able to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing Su-34 ‘frontal bomber’ and multi-role fighter fleets by bombing Ukrainian strategic targets, except during the first few days of the invasion. Instead, Russia’s attempt at strategic air attack has been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. These barrages have nevertheless caused major damage and have killed many Ukrainian citizens. Fortunately, Russia’s limited stockpiles and production capacity of standoff missiles prevented adequate concentration or sustainment of effects against communications, transport or fuel infrastructure target sets. However, this should not lead to Western complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian adoption of the Iranian Shahed-136 as a cheap weapon able to conduct large-scale, sustained precision strikes on civilian infrastructure and other fixed, non-hardened targets marks a key change in the character of the air war. Ukrainian air defences are currently shooting down the majority of incoming Shahed-136s and around half of the cruise missiles fired by Russia using a combination of SAMs, fighters with R-73 air-to-air missiles, mobile MANPADS teams and anti-aircraft guns. However, most of these interceptions use munitions that are far more expensive and are available for Ukraine in more limited quantities than the Shahed-136 is likely to be for Russia. Western SAM systems that have been supplied so far have proven highly effective against incoming cruise missiles, including the stealthy Kh-101, but have been supplied with inadequate ammunition for Ukrainian usage rates even though they are not being used against Shahed-136. MANPADS are effective and relatively efficient against Shahed-136 and cruise missiles when they pass within range of mobile air-defence teams. However, the numbers required are large due to short range and the need to defend cities and infrastructure across Ukraine, in addition to protecting frontline troops from Russian attack aviation and UAVs. Due to its relatively small size, shape, low altitude flight and low speed, legacy Soviet and Russian self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs) such as Shilka and Tunguska also struggle to reliably shoot down the Shahed-136, although the German Gepard is highly effective. After two weeks of sustained Russian attacks on electrical infrastructure, new deliveries of equipment and systems specifically tailored to efficiently providing defence against Shahed-136 attacks are already one of Ukraine’s top priorities in terms of support from its international partners. The weapon is simple and not especially difficult to intercept, but most of the current means of doing so are too expensive or draw on unacceptable numbers of weapons required for other defence tasks to provide an adequate medium-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, therefore, Ukraine urgently requires deliveries of large numbers of additional MANPADS for mobile and static air-defence teams, and many modern SPAAGs such as the Gepard, LvKv 90 or Skyranger as possible. It also requires additional supplies of night-vision goggles to enable MANPADS teams to operate effectively at night. Additional ammunition and more launchers for the highly effective IRIS-T SLM and NASAMS systems are also critical to enable the Ukrainian Air Force to defend remaining electricity infrastructure and protect repair work from higher-end cruise missile attacks. With rolling blackouts already affecting much of the country and the weather already getting cold, the urgency of these requirements is hard to overstate. Neither MANPADS or SPAAGs should be considered politically sensitive as they are fundamentally defensive weapons needed to protect civilian infrastructure that do not require the absolute latest in cutting-edge technology to be effective. Rapidly gifting even small inventories of stored MANPADS and SPAAGs currently offers European states that wish to support Ukraine but face political difficulties in delivering longer-ranged offensive weapons or heavy armoured vehicles to make a real difference now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs a way to produce or at least procure and operate efficient defence systems against Shahed-136 and other UAVs at scale. Countries that have significant experience defending against multiple relatively slow loitering munitions and UAVs such as South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Israel would make sense in terms of potential sources of ideas and subsystems, even if politically they were unwilling to directly supply Ukrainian forces. In general, gun systems are preferred over missiles where possible due to the much lower cost per engagement and higher availability of ammunition compared with SAMs and MANPADS. A relatively simple new product that combined a small counter-UAV AESA radar with an attachable predictive aiming reticule sight is one option that, if possible, would offer a way to significantly enhance the capability of Ukraine’s many traditional anti-aircraft guns such as ZSU-2-23 and 14.5-mm/12.7-mm heavy machine guns against Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also needs a way to resupply its Soviet-made and domestically upgraded S-300 and SA-11 ‘Buk’ SAM systems in both the anti-missile and battlefield anti-aircraft/counter UAV role. Eight months of high-intensity combat have consumed unprecedented and unforeseen quantities of interceptor missiles, and Western allies have few ways to supply more directly or indirectly. Western militaries have invested very little in production of medium- and short-range GBAD systems since the end of the Cold War due to overwhelming air superiority in every conflict since then. This means that production is now having to ramp up from a very low level and existing inventories are too small to meet Ukraine’s needs. This will make it impossible to replace the large number of remaining S-300, SA-11, SA-15 ‘Tor’ and SA-8 ‘Osa’ systems operated by Ukraine directly in the medium term, let alone expand coverage. Therefore, it would seem sensible for Ukrainian industry to work with industrial partners in Western countries to set up new manufacturing lines as fast as possible for key SAM system ammunition such as the 5V55 missile for S-300PS/PT and S-300V1, and the 9M38 missile for the SA-11 ‘Buk’. This would have the side benefit of greatly improving Western familiarity with missile families that in various derivations are still in widespread use by adversaries including Russia, China and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukrainian SAMs are allowed to run out of ammunition, then not only will Ukrainian infrastructure and other key target sets become dramatically more vulnerable to Russian missile strikes, but the Russian VKS fixed-wing fleet would suddenly again be able to start penetrating deep into Ukrainian-controlled airspace at medium and high altitudes. Russian fighters retain the capability to dramatically overmatch Ukrainian ones if allowed to roam freely at high altitude, as has been shown by their lethality against Ukrainian Air Force jets conducting low-level operations against Russian positions in Kherson in recent weeks. In addition to the radar performance and missile range advantages that have always been a factor, the VKS Su-35S and Mig-31BM fleets can now draw on a lot of live air-to-air combat experience from conducting continuous CAPs close to Russia’s own borders. As such, the underwhelming VKS fighter performance during the first days of the invasion is unlikely to be repeated if Ukrainian SAMs are starved of ammunition to the point that they can no longer deter Russian fixed-wing incursions. Furthermore, despite the relatively poor operational-level coordination between different Russian fast-jet fleets, and limited close air support capabilities against organic battlefield targets in contested environments, the experience of rebel groups and the Islamic State in Syria should remind those quick to dismiss the VKS of how much firepower they can and regularly do apply to fixed targets if allowed to operate freely at medium altitudes. The inability of the Russian Air Force to coordinate large-scale complex SEAD/DEAD operations to neutralise Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence network has been the key factor that has prevented it from being one of the main threats to Ukraine’s war effort so far. It is vital that the West does not lose sight of the fact that it must help Ukraine to keep that air-defence network supplied and reinforce it, otherwise that situation could change fairly rapidly in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Air Force also urgently needs more Western weapons that can enhance the standoff lethality of its existing attack jet fleet in a similar manner as the AGM-88 HARM was integrated to allow SEAD strikes against Russian SAMs. Due to the very serious threat from Russian long-, medium- and short-range GBAD systems and Russian fighter patrols, Ukrainian attack aircraft must fly very low when anywhere near the frontlines and still regularly suffer losses. Very low-level approaches to target areas make detecting and designating for laser-guided weapons or achieving electro-optical or infra-red lock-on against targets almost impossible due to the very short period and range within which they appear within the pilots’ field of view. Clearly, the more standoff range can be offered, the more losses will be minimised. Candidate weapons must be able to be programmed with the release and target parameters before being loaded onto the jet, since Western smart munitions are unlikely to be able to exchange data directly with existing Ukrainian aircraft avionics. They would need to have sufficiently capable automated target detection and attack capabilities to reliably detect and destroy Russian ground vehicles themselves when delivered roughly to the right target area. Since these weapons would primarily be needed to counter Russian mass as mobilised formations appear on the frontlines in spring 2023, suitable munitions would also need to exist in Western stockpiles in large numbers. Such a demanding list of criteria leaves a very small number of potential options, with the American CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapon being one potential option worth exploring. If it could be released by Ukraine’s Su-24 bombers in a lofted profile from a fast low-altitude pop-up delivery, then guided to a more precise aim point by pre-programmed GPS coordinates, the multiple anti-armour homing skeet submunitions would be devastating against Russian vehicle concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs new fighter aircraft able to meet Russian fighters on more equal terms as soon as possible, especially if providing sufficient ammunition to maintain frontline SAM coverage proves difficult. The enduring threat from Russian long-range S-400 SAMs, especially when cued in by radars capable of tracking them at low altitudes from long ranges such as the 48Ya6 Podlet-K1, is likely to force Ukrainian fighters to operate at low level as part of standard tactics. The effective range of air-to-air missiles is inherently tied to launch altitude and speed of both the aircraft firing and its target. As such, any new fighter for the Ukrainian Air Force needs to come equipped with a missile capable of offering the greatest possible effective range under low-altitude, subsonic launch conditions. Electronic warfare capabilities to reduce the effectiveness of Russian radars at longer ranges would also be highly beneficial, as would a radar designed to be resilient against the Khibny jamming pods that Russian fighters typically fly with over Ukraine. Aside from improved air-to-air performance, the main Ukrainian operational priority is for an aircraft capable of operating from dispersed, relatively basic airbases to prevent them being located and rapidly destroyed by Russian long-range missile strikes. This entails an ability to be serviced with limited personnel and heavy equipment, and to operate from relatively rough and short runway surfaces. Anti-shipping capabilities are also required. Any new fighters also need to be able to generate high sortie rates from both an availability and affordability perspective, since the Ukrainian economy has been devastated by the Russian invasion and new fighters are competing with a huge range of other requirements. As a long-term plan, the Ukrainian Air Force wants to operate a split fleet of a single engine light multi-role fighter and a longer-ranged twin engine fighter for greater air-defence persistence. However, in the short term, even a tiny number of modern Western fighters would be a huge boost to Ukraine’s ability to continue deterring the VKS from penetrating its skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to supply a Western fighter would inherently be heavily influenced, and most likely ultimately decided, by political factors. In the long term, US-supplied aircraft are likely to form a large part of the Ukrainian Air Force inventory due to political, industrial and financial considerations. However, while Ukrainian airbases are still at high risk of Russian missile strikes, the long, high-quality runways and large hangers with extensive ground support equipment required to operate most US fighters would be difficult to build without being observed and hit. It is worth noting that of the currently available Western fighter aircraft that could possibly be suppled, the Swedish Saab Gripen C/D offers by far the most suitable candidate in terms of operational requirements. It was designed from the outset for ease of maintenance, and can be refuelled, re-armed and given basic maintenance by teams of just six ground crew using two vehicles on small airbases or highways in cold weather. Moreover, only one of each crew needs to be a highly trained maintainer; the rest can be conscripts or even troops. Conceptually, the Swedish Air Force has always emphasised low-level air superiority tactics from dispersed bases, in a similar manner to how the Ukrainian Air Force currently operates, and so the Gripen was designed with ground support equipment and maintenance requirements compatible with that approach. The electronic warfare suite on the Gripen C/D is also optimised specifically for countering Russian fighter and SAM radars. Other factors that make Gripen particularly suited to Ukrainian operational needs are that it can fire the very long-range European Meteor missile, which, thanks to its ramjet propulsion design, is less adversely affected by being launched from low and slow than traditional rocket-powered missiles such as R-27 or AIM-120 AMRAAM, and Gripen was also designed from the outset with an anti-ship capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since April, VKS pilots have been extremely reluctant to aggressively fight their way into Ukrainian airspace due to the losses taken during early attempts. The threat of Ukrainian SAM and MANPADS engagements has shaped the behaviour and constrained the effectiveness of Russian pilots significantly. Therefore, even a few modern Western fighters with long-range missiles able to meet the Russians on technically equal or even superior terms would likely have a disproportionate deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western military aid has quite rightly concentrated on equipping and supporting the Ukrainian ground forces until now. Ukraine has so far managed to hold its own in the air domain, largely using its own equipment. However, there is a real danger that this success leads to Western complacency about the threat that the VKS can still pose to Ukrainian forces, infrastructure and cities if given an opening. Ukraine now needs rapid deliveries of SAM launchers and missile ammunition, SPAAGs and ideally Western fighter aircraft to prevent a sustained strike campaign that could, if unopposed, thwart the dominant battlefield momentum that Ukrainian troops have fought so hard to win.&lt;/p&gt;

The question of our sovereignty and resilience in an interdependent world takes on a new twist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since 2017, France has chosen to reinvest in its armies, to deploy a French and European strategy of sovereignty in the face of an upheaval in global balances. The last two years have accelerated and intensified the transformations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fracturing of the world order brings with it challenges and risks that we must address if we are to retain our freedom. Faced with this phenomenon of globalised hybrid warfare, I therefore wanted a national approach in continuity with and in addition to the European Union’s strategic compass adopted under the French Presidency, and the NATO strategic concept launched at our request in 2019, which was also adopted this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our findings and conclusions from 2017 remain relevant. We were not mistaken, so there is continuity in our vision, but continuity does not mean inertia in the face of an history that is hardening and accelerating. The time has come for a more comprehensive mobilisation to better equip us in all respects for the historic challenges of a world where strategic competition and confrontation are merging. It is a question of refining our analyses in order to draw operative conclusions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By 2030, I want France to have consolidated its role as a balancing, united, radiant, influential power, a driving force for European autonomy and one that assumes its responsibilities by contributing, as a reliable and supportive partner, to the preservation of multilateral mechanisms based on international law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The conclusions of the National Strategic Review make it possible to increase the independence and strength of our Nation in the new strategic context in which we live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;assessment-of-the-strategic-environment&quot;&gt;Assessment of the strategic environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 represents a strategic shift. On the one hand, combined with other structural developments, it confirms the observation of changes in the threat assessment described in the 2017 national defence and security strategic review, updated in 2021. On the other, it calls for an adaptation of our strategic response to build up our moral strength and resilience, consolidate our alliances and accelerate the modernisation of our defence mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Confirmation. As described in the 2017 strategic review, increased strategic competition, the weakening of the tools of the collective security architecture, the effects of intimidation or aggressive strategies, combining military and non-military actions, manipulation of information, and even nuclear threats for the purpose of intimidation, have become apparent to the world, and particularly to our fellow citizens. The disinhibition of global and regional powers pursuing revisionist agendas and opportunistic military policies is combined with a growing trend towards isolationism or identity-based withdrawal. In addition, the consequences of proliferation, technological or otherwise, and the persistence of the terrorist threat also remain prevalent. Other major global challenges likely to cause significant imbalance must be added to this picture, such as the impact of climate change: access to water, food insecurity, migration, demography, pandemics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) This observation requires us to rapidly adapt our global response, to accelerate our efforts to promote the emergence of a common and shared conception of European defence, as well as of its strategic autonomy, to modernise our national defence mechanisms, and to boost our moral strength, resilience and alliances. The war in Ukraine further justifies the decision of the President of France, made in 2017, to modernise our defence mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Consolidation. We must continue the efforts made while also accelerating, adapting and completing our strategic posture in the face of threats that are changing in pace, nature and space. Without replacing terrorism or crisis-management threats, these threats are part of a framework that is increasingly marked by the high intensity of potential confrontation between conventional forces and so-called “hybrid” (cyber, digital and space attacks) or — access denial strategies that challenge our interests (exploitation of the vulnerabilities of logistics flows or infrastructure, air and sea spaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) By strengthening its resilience, by giving itself the means to move towards a war economy, by adapting the areas in which it is present according to its strategic interests and by pivoting towards conflict in new areas and of high intensity, France takes a global approach to entirely fulfil its role as a balancing power and to promote a stable international order based on the respect of the law and on multilateralism. It also intends to support the strengthening of the sovereignty of its partners in order to enhance the stability and security of the regions concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) This observation makes it all the more necessary to pursue our efforts to promote the emergence and implementation of a common and shared conception of European defence, as well as of its strategic autonomy, complementary to our active participation within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and our various partnerships, while guarding against the side effects of the sometimes changing strategic or geographical priorities of these allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Objectives. While they do not call into question the strategic analysis that has prevailed since 2017, the acceleration of the overall deterioration of our environment and the war in Ukraine nevertheless justify a reassessment of the current military programming law based adjusted and structuring strategic objectives (SO) described in this national strategic review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) First, the fundamentals remain: France is and will remain a power with a robust and credible nuclear deterrent [SO no. 1], a structural asset for strategic dialogue and for the protection of our vital interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) At the other end of the spectrum, what sustains our model and gives it credibility is our moral strength: that of the French people, namely, that of a united and resilient France [SO no. 2], that of an economy capable of turning itself into a war economy [SO no. 3], that of leading cyber resilience [SO no. 4], which are the conditions that underpin national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) However, our weight in the world cannot be based on the principle of sovereignty alone. The principle of solidarity is essential, all the more so in a deteriorated context. France wants to be an exemplary and demanding ally within the Euro-Atlantic area [SO no. 5] while also being one of the driving forces for European strategic autonomy [SO no. 6] and a reliable partner in its diplomatic defence relations and, a credible provider of security [SO no. 7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) Influence has been given a strategic function. This new function, now an essential part of the expression of power, is a key element of our ability to promote France’s interests and counter the actions of our competitors across the entire spectrum of hybridity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) Supporting deterrence and backed by our moral strength, in support of our alliances and partnerships, our military capabilities enable us to have an operational impact that benefits our defence. Our military capabilities are based on sovereign capabilities, autonomy of assessment and appreciation — an essential step that gives meaning to acts and intentions —, anticipation and decision-making [SO no. 8], a willingness and ability to act in hybrid fields in the face of increasingly aggressive strategies and the will to bypass our competitors [SO no. 9], as well as a proven ability to conduct high-intensity military operations in extensive areas of conflict [SO no. 10].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Perspectives. The strategic objectives thus described serve to structure a project, both political and military, for the development of the army model which will form part of the future programming law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) This national strategic review explains the underlying factors that guide the work on reassessing the military programming law that is currently in progress. It offers an action-oriented consideration of the changes necessary in terms of, for example, moral strength, the resilience of the Nation through National Service (SNU), the war economy and with regard to the future armed forces model. Finally, it enables the principles on which these changes will be transcribed into the next military programming law (2024-2030) to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-from-strategic-competition-to-strategic-confrontation&quot;&gt;1.1 FROM STRATEGIC COMPETITION TO STRATEGIC CONFRONTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) Identified in the 2017 national defence and security strategic review and then in the 2021 strategic update as a long-term trend, the renewal of the phenomenon of strategic competition is now taking place at both a global and a regional level, in configurations that expose us more visibly and are becoming more widespread. Revisionist ambitions have intensified, giving rise to numerous displays of uninhibited opportunism from the eastern Mediterranean to the Sahel and the Pacific. We are thus moving from latent competition to open confrontation on the part of Russia and, increasingly, to greater competition with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The pandemic, the climate crisis, the migration crises and the return of a high-intensity war on European soil remind us of the far-reaching interdependence between the national and international arenas, in the areas of politics, economics, energy and food. These crises illustrate how the fracturing of the world order can restrict our freedom of action. The 2022 national strategic review is therefore in line with and complementary to the European Union’s strategic compass and NATO’s strategic concept, which were adopted this year. It aims to apply these strategies while integrating our national characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) The practice of challenging and circumventing the international order, based on multilateralism and the rule of law, whether reflected in the United Nations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) or in the reactivation of territorial disputes, is becoming more commonplace and diverse, and follows in the footsteps of past breaches (Helsinki principles, INF and Open Skies treaties, Budapest Memorandum, etc.). The body of agreements and laws built since the end of the Cold War is crumbling and, although the causes are not recent, this phenomenon has accelerated sharply since 2014. By way of illustration, out of the agreements that until recently maintained a balance in the Euro-Atlantic area, only the New START Treaty remains; furthermore, it is due to expire in 2026 without a clear successor. Bypassed and hollowed out if not denounced head-on, this arms control architecture is now more necessary and more weakened than at any time in almost forty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-assumed-revisionist-ambitions&quot;&gt;Russia: assumed revisionist ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Russia is pursuing a strategy that seeks to undermine European security, of which the war against Ukraine, launched on 24 February 2022, is the most open and brutal manifestation. During the implementation of its ambition of power conceived as an opposition to what Russia calls “the collective West”, Moscow had for a long time privileged a more indirect approach, focusing on undermining the West on a politico-diplomatic level: information warfare and interference, types of action whose perpetrator is difficult to name, search for transatlantic division, etc. Without having disappeared, this strategy is now accompanied by a desire to engage in a direct military confrontation, materialised by the war of aggression against Ukraine. Rewriting history and the national narrative, the Russian government is increasingly open about its imperial ambitions based on a balance-of-power approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) The future of Russian military power after this ordeal will be an important issue for the Atlantic alliance and Europe over the coming decades, as the strategic concept adopted at the Madrid summit and the strategic compass adopted under the French presidency of the Council of the EU (FPCEU) strongly underline. Regardless of the outcome of the war, it will have seriously debilitated the human and material potential of the Russian forces. The need to regenerate this potential will come up against the effects of sanctions on the Russian economy and defence technological and industrial base (DTIB), but should continue to be financed to a large extent. The weakening of its conventional forces over the long term could lead Moscow to privilege more indirect modes of confrontation while boosting the role of its non-conventional weapons in its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) In light of the split caused by the war and the irreversibility of Russia’s strategic choices, it is necessary to anticipate a confrontation with Moscow based on the trio of competition, challenge and confrontation, taking place over a long period of time, in multiple regions and spaces. This move towards confrontation is already taking place in Africa, through offensive diplomatic manoeuvres combined with anti-Western information-based attacks and the use of mercenaries. Moscow sees in this globalised hybrid war substantial leverage in external theatres and in environments where new types of action are now being taken. Thus, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Baltic area, the Balkans, and the North Atlantic, but also Africa and the Middle East, offer the possibility of prolonged confrontation and the risk of incidents that could escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;peoples-republic-of-china-the-affirmation&quot;&gt;People’s Republic of China: the affirmation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) In addition to staying in power, the goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is still to supplant the United States as the world’s leading power. Considering American power and the Western model to be in decline, the Chinese regime believes that Western leadership of the international order has weakened and that it can weaken it further by using its new influence. The CCP is therefore banking on the passivity of a majority of non-Western countries over the war in Ukraine to fuel a discourse that portrays an opposition based on “the West against the rest”. However, beyond ideology and the war in Ukraine, such questioning irrigates fields which are political (propaganda on the decline of the West), economic and technological (predation, trade war), military (growth of the nuclear arsenal, modernisation of the PLA, areas of support abroad) and diplomatic (a more assertive attitude in international forums, recourse to a bilateral balance of power or to alternative multilateral formats, such as the 14+1 or the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) The modernisation of China’s military apparatus continues and enables the PLA to support an increasingly assertive strategy, including on the military front, whether in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly with regard to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, or in other regions of the world where Chinese diplomacy calls to clients, especially in Africa. The political nature of the PLA and the civil-military integration deployed in the technological, economic and information fields enable an unprecedented scope of hybrid actions. The latter is only constrained in practice and, at this stage, by the PRC’s decision to challenge the international security architecture from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) The growing strategic convergence between the PRC and Russia opens up the prospect of greater contestation within international bodies, directed against the expression of Western objectives and offering opportunities for political alignment against the West and the United States in particular. The common desire to set aside or silence differences in order to challenge Western influence, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine, gives rise to occasional forms of cooperation. This situation is primarily visible at the diplomatic level and in information warfare. On a structural level, the imbalance in China-Russia relations in favour of Beijing is set to grow with the Ukrainian crisis. The political, strategic and technological implications could be enormous for global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) Examining Western cohesion and the impact of sanctions against and embargoes on Russia over time will also provide the PRC with a valuable insight into the scope of economic coercion methods that could be used against it in a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-contested-and-weakened-democracies-in-the-battle-for-influence&quot;&gt;1.3 CONTESTED AND WEAKENED DEMOCRACIES IN THE BATTLE FOR INFLUENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) In a context of increasingly intense strategic competition and confrontation, the position of liberal democracies has been weakened because they defend an international order whose foundations (international law, multilateralism, values, etc.) are openly challenged by several states. This dynamic is sustained by resentment towards political legacies, sometimes colonial, and perceptions of unfair development, which dovetail with the consolidation of authoritarianism and illiberal regimes around the world. These dynamics make it more difficult to understand the changing environment of our operations and to anticipate crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) This situation manifests itself in the fields of influence and perception. Russian and Chinese operations in these areas seek to undermine our own political systems and national cohesion, while fuelling or even creating alignments against us, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates. Our opponents are counting on the discrediting of Western discourse based on humanist values, and asymmetry in the relationship with laws and in the respect for international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26) Our competitors use the law as a weapon against our interests to ensure their ascendancy. A tool of hybridity, the strategic use of laws (or lawfare) can be broken down into three major areas: the growing instrumentalisation by certain states of their own laws, in particular through extraterritoriality; the use, misuse or circumventing of international laws; and the exploitation of legal and judicial vulnerabilities resulting from our domestic laws or European commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;27) Finally, Western states must consider the inevitability of technological catch-up and dissemination, which are now taking place. This form of technological equalisation helps to make numbers important again. By sometimes taking a more agile approach and having larger volumes, our strategic competitors have the capacity to tip the regional balance, such as Iran in the ballistics field. At the same time, multilateral regimes that fight against dissemination have become less effective, undermined from the inside by Russia in most cases. GAFAM, or other private players, are emerging as non-state players whose active or passive contribution must be included as input data as from the challenge phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-conflict-between-the-return-of-nuclear-reality-high-intensity-and-hybridity&quot;&gt;1.4 CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RETURN OF NUCLEAR REALITY, HIGH INTENSITY AND HYBRIDITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28) Initial lessons from the war in Ukraine are characterised, in particular, by the threat of nuclear escalation and its trivialisation by a nuclear-weapon state. Combined with the collapse of arms control architecture and the persistence of proliferation crises, Russia’s use of nuclear rhetoric for offensive purposes in support of the invasion of Ukraine has the potential to undermine strategic balances and, in the longer term, to exacerbate proliferation. A successful coercive manoeuvre backed by nuclear weapons would set a dangerous precedent. Russian intimidation and threats of coercion under the shadow of nuclear weapons also undermine the efforts of the P5 states in the area of doctrinal transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29) The next-generation war waged by Russia is characterised by a return to an integral strategy combining far-reaching hybrid actions and high-intensity operations. The lessons of this major engagement under the nuclear umbrella of the aggressor underline the importance of perfect multi-domain operations, known as the multi-environment and multi-field manoeuvre (M2MC), as well as the need for joint action that is significant in terms of its mass and density. They also remind us of the need to create an international approach to strategic competition, allowing us to signal our determination, to prevent and channel the escalation options of competitors operating under different constraints and in different registers from our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30) Nuclear multipolarity that has been relatively contained until now, could take a more deregulated form. This is due, in particular, to the undermining of the international frameworks and security guarantees, the expansion pathways of already established nuclear powers and the emboldening of regional players. On the one hand, the quantitative and qualitative growth of China’s nuclear arsenal, combined with Russia’s actions, could jeopardise further efforts to preserve nuclear arms control agreements governing the arsenals of the main holders. On the other, aside from the cases of North Korea and Iran, the non-proliferation regime could be subject to renewed tension. The proliferation of their delivery systems (ballistic and cruise missiles, drones, etc.), a hardening of military postures and the development of access denial capabilities will provide many regional powers with greater capacity to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31) Hybrid strategies have shown their impact on multiple theatres. Their effects continue to spread in Africa, the central and eastern Mediterranean, and the Indo-Pacific region. These strategies exploit the difficulty for Western states to provide an effective response that is compatible with respect for the political commitments, treaties and principles that underpin the international order. Using a variety of levers, they are adapted to the geography of the interests of the players implementing them, enabling these players to affect France’s interests at the lowest possible cost, in mainland France and its overseas territories, and abroad. Common spaces (cyber, space, seabed and, air and sea) are now the subject of a renewed competition for power. The actions that have already been taken in these spaces reflect the appropriation by all states of an approach that is applied to these spaces on the basis of the entire trio of competition, challenge and confrontation. Their operational and geographic importance is growing while the common rules governing them are insufficient, weakened or contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32) In terms of hybridity, states are increasingly systematically using cyber as a weapon to defend their strategic interests or in the context of geopolitical tension. In addition to the development of offensive capabilities, sophisticated off-the-shelf, cyber-espionage weapons and tools are gradually being developed by private companies. This cyber-arms race increases the risk of escalation, the stages of which are not equally understood. Finally, cybercrime, a threat that has reached an unprecedented level of sophistication and disinhibition, constitutes a strategic challenge for our national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-crisis-areas-and-regional-opportunism&quot;&gt;1.5 CRISIS AREAS AND REGIONAL OPPORTUNISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;33) The refocusing of the United States on the strategic competition with the PRC is accompanied by a shake-up in the balance of power between regional powers. In the Near and Middle East, the diplomatic and military emboldening of certain regional powers is concomitant with the destabilisation of already fragile countries. The persistence of proliferation crises (Iran, North Korea, Syria in the case of chemical weapons) helps fuel these sources of regional destabilisation. These dynamics affect our strategic interests because they are accompanied by a rearrangement of intra-regional agreements, alliances and power relations. The distrust of the West and the laws it promotes provides the basis for Russia’s and the PRC’s policies of influence in Africa and the Near and Middle East. Within Europe itself, the Western Balkans are likely to be an area of fragility in the short term which these countries may seek to exploit to divide and weaken Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;34) The international jihadist movement will continue to spread and pose a security challenge for the next decade, both for the West and for the fragile countries of the Muslim world, from Africa to Southeast Asia. Exploiting favourable conditions (poor governance, endemic corruption, lack of social justice, strategic competition), it will help fuel areas of crisis and destabilisation in the Levant, North Africa, the Sahel and West Africa, for which a military response, in support of local partners, will continue to be sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35) The war in Ukraine is also a reminder of how regional crises and global challenges can interact and reinforce each other. Energy has once again become a key issue and a geostrategic lever. The — potentially changing — geography of producers and supply routes fuels energy rivalries that redraw the balance of power. The strategic nature of energy flows complicates the challenges of resource management as many terminals and pipelines (gas and oil) are located in areas of tension. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have highlighted the importance of food as a lever of influence and coercion for certain regimes. Food security has re-emerged as a domestic political stability imperative for many states. The acceleration of the effects of global warming, possibly coupled with a global food crisis, will exacerbate migration phenomena, manipulated or not, and create new areas of tension, likely to weigh on both Western cohesion and each country. Our overseas territories will be increasingly exposed to the security consequences of these underlying trends (increased predation, more violent and destructive natural disasters, migration pressure, etc.), which may require a greater commitment from the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;36) The war in Ukraine also poses the risk of a return to state terrorism. It may be assumed that given Russia’s uninhibited actions, weapons of all kinds are being recovered in the Ukrainian theatre to serve proxy or terrorist groups. These weapons could be used against our interests, alongside a disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-strategic-solidarity-faced-with-the-challenge-of-confrontation&quot;&gt;2. STRATEGIC SOLIDARITY FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF CONFRONTATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;37) The acceleration of the risk of conflict and the rapid expansion of the fields of confrontation confirm the need for strategic alliances and the principle of solidarity that structures them. This strategic solidarity must be assessed according to whether France is the beneficiary, the sole provider or one of its components, whether within the EU, NATO or ad hoc coalitions, for example against Daech or in the Sahel-Saharan strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;38) The deterioration of the international environment, the risk of opportunistic strategies in the face of the stretching of our interests and the diversity of areas of action highlight the immense difficulty for France to respond alone to all the challenges (Eastern and Northern Europe, Mediterranean-Red Sea, Near and Middle East, Indo-Pacific, Africa, Arctic, etc.). The robustness of our partnerships, the maintenance of a high level of interoperability with the United States, and our ability to build permanent or temporary strategic alignments in a changing environment will more surely condition our global influence and our weight in the development of a more stable environment. They will also allow us to anticipate — and thus prevent — potential side effects of competition, or even rivalry between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-europe-at-a-crossroads-to-become-a-strategic-player&quot;&gt;2.1 EUROPE AT A CROSSROADS TO BECOME A STRATEGIC PLAYER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;39) A great deal of progress has been made in recent years in the field of European defence, both in the area of capabilities — creation of the European Defence Fund (EDF), implementation of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), strengthening of the European Capability Development Plan — and in the operational area with the creation of the European Peace Facility, or in the social area with the handling of migratory crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40) The adoption of an ambitious strategic compass in March 2022 is a first step, symbolising a shared desire to strengthen coherence in defining and pursuing our strategic objectives. Its implementation will be key to strengthening the Union’s capacity to act by 2030, in particular in the operational area and in contested strategic spaces. Furthermore, the lifting of Denmark’s opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is a positive signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;41) The development of a real politico-military action capability for Europe in its immediate environment remains an objective. In terms of capabilities, the decisions taken at the Versailles summit (10 and 11 March 2022) have made it possible to launch a new effort, which must be pursued with all European partners. A great deal of work will have to be done to continue to develop a common strategic culture, which is essential for the emergence of a European defence. The joint declaration of 21 September 2021 on a European strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the adaptation of the European maritime system in the north-west Indian Ocean have the long-term objective of establishing the EU as a credible player and provider of maritime safety and security to the States of the region. This dynamic is already at work in the Arabian Gulf (EMASoH/AGENOR) and the Eastern Mediterranean (QUAD MEDOR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42) Deepening cooperation between the EU and NATO will be essential to further strengthen European strategic autonomy and the transatlantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;43) Finally, our cooperation efforts on a European scale have been intensified, by focusing on a wider range of partners with whom large-scale sectoral cooperation has been launched, whether in terms of capabilities, operations or through the establishment of strategic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-an-atlantic-alliance-strengthened-in-the-context&quot;&gt;2.2 AN ATLANTIC ALLIANCE STRENGTHENED IN THE CONTEXT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;44) NATO remains today the foundation and essential framework for Europe’s collective security. For the majority of our European partners, this observation is made with renewed force by the return of war to the continent and the open and lasting confrontation with Russia, as shown by Finland’s and Sweden’s applications for membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45) The period opened in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the maintenance of a conflict in the Donbass, tangible signals of growing Russian military aggression, which forced NATO to make a major effort to adapt. This collective awareness has manifested itself in increased investment, with a third of allies reaching or exceeding 2% of GDP in their defence budgets. This significant effort must be continued as part of a collective increase in power against opponents who unapologetically pursue their own interests. This development is beneficial in that it brings our European partners closer to our view that we must collectively take more responsibility for defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-the-american-pivot&quot;&gt;2.3 THE AMERICAN PIVOT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;46) For the United States, the PRC is the long-term strategic priority, with a fundamental shift starting in 2007. This focus permeates many areas of US policy, relations with traditional allies and its positioning in multilateral forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47) Washington is perceived as being in search of a formula that will allow it to reduce its involvement in regional theatres that it now considers secondary (Africa, Middle East), while strengthening the security of its partners. This objective involves, for example, an effort to promote more integrated Middle Eastern partners (Abraham Accords) and to formalise agreements in ad hoc formats around energy, political and military projects (e.g. Pacific Islands Forum). This repositioning is already prompting states in the region to invest in managing their own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;48) Through the war in Ukraine, the United States has again emerged as the main provider of European security, through the scale of its reassurance efforts and military support to Ukraine. A potential weakening of US investment in areas of European interest (Africa, Middle East), which are more exposed to the unilateral aims of middle powers and the rise of anti-Western views, could affect our ability to make a lasting contribution to the security and stability of these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-our-partnerships-to-be-reinvented&quot;&gt;2.4 OUR PARTNERSHIPS TO BE REINVENTED&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;49) France, a balanced power, refuses to be locked in bloc geopolitics. It is important to maintain this long-standing and authentic position in the search for a balanced relationship with our allies. France has a long history of establishing strategic partnerships in its areas of interest, in which our partners must find security, stability and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50) In Africa, we face major security and humanitarian challenges. The terrorist threat remains high in the Sahel-Saharan strip and is spreading towards the Gulf of Guinea. Russian actors, including the private military company Wagner, are carrying out actions that are contrary to our interests, while their involvement results in a deterioration of the security situation, the predation of economic resources, numerous abuses documented by the UN and the ever-greater fragility of the states that resort to them. The PRC has a stranglehold on infrastructure, the economy and debt, creating risks of dependency of our partners, as well as of espionage and restrictions on our operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;51) With the Latin American and Indo-Pacific regions, France can strengthen its cooperation and consolidate the relations of our overseas departments, regions and communities with their immediate environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;52) The ability of certain competitors to propose alternative models, most often based on a transactional approach and less governed by normative concerns, also has an impact, particularly on states under political, economic or food pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;reminder-of-national-security-interests-and-confirmation-of-strategic-functions&quot;&gt;Reminder of national security interests and confirmation of strategic functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;53) France’s interests include all factors that contribute to its security, prosperity and influence. In particular, a distinction should be made between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the protection of the national territory, including the overseas territories, and of French nationals against external threats and attempts at internal destabilisation, including the terrorist threat;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the security of the EU Member States and the euro-atlantic area under the treaties by which we are bound;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the stability of our neighbourhood, given the immediate repercussions that any crisis emerging there would have on our own territory, both metropolitan and overseas;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;freedom of access to common spaces (cyber, space, seabed, air-sea spaces, and the poles), which is now threatened by challenges to the rules-based international order and by approaches based on power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;54) Defending these interests is now more complex because of the more systematic use of force and intimidation by some of our strategic competitors, and because of an international context that has been permanently damaged by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;55) France’s main lever for achieving this remains the long-term maintenance of its autonomy of decision and sovereign action in the face of all the threats that arise. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the world’s seventh largest economy controlling the second largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a nuclear-weapon state, and a founding member and driver of European integration, France has essential tools to assert its interests on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;56) However, the increasing number of constraints on our interests makes it more necessary than ever to have robust and sustainable means of action, adapted to recent developments in the world. Our defence apparatus contributes to this on several levels, as the basis of our independence and freedom of action in the world in the face of threats of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;57) In this respect, the policies defined in 2013 and 2017 remain fully valid and their concrete implementation must be continued and accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;58) They establish that the defence of our security interests rests on three pillars: the strengthening of our strategic autonomy; the achievement of European sovereignty and the consolidation of our alliances; the preservation of a stable international order, based on respect for the law and multilateralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;59) In any case, it remains the ultimate responsibility of the President of the Republic to constantly assess the nature of our interests and the attacks that could be made on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-frances-security-priorities&quot;&gt;1. FRANCE’S SECURITY PRIORITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-strengthening-our-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;1.1 STRENGTHENING OUR STRATEGIC AUTONOMY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60) Strategic autonomy is the sine qua non condition for the protection of our fundamental interests. At its core are the capacities for autonomous assessment, decision making and action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;61) Our freedom of action and the protection of our fundamental interests are ensured first and foremost by the credibility of nuclear deterrence, the keystone of our defence strategy. The fundamental aim of deterrence is to prevent a major war that would threaten the survival of the nation by protecting France against any state-sponsored aggression against its vital interests and against any attempt at blackmail. In a more uncertain and complex world, where some countries are on a worrying trajectory of opacity and rapid growth of their nuclear arsenals, or even raise the spectre of using the weapon for intimidation or blackmail, maintaining the credibility of our deterrent over the long term remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;62) Our autonomy also depends on the strengthening of a credible, coherent and balanced armed forces model. This requires conventional forces whose size and equipment allow for a conventional-nuclear linkage that is sufficiently robust to preserve the President’s freedom of action and avoid a circumvention of deterrence from below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;63) Strategic autonomy is also based on other factors: national cohesion, economic and industrial independence, securing our supplies, and international influence, particularly through strong diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-the-achievement-of-european-sovereignty-and-the-consolidation-of-our-alliances&quot;&gt;1.2 THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR ALLIANCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;64) The protection and promotion of our fundamental interests cannot be limited to the national level. We must continue to contribute actively to the defence of European interests and our collective security. These objectives require the strengthening of our international cooperation, partnerships and alliances, first and foremost within the EU and NATO, where we are bound by certain security guarantees (Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 42-7 of the EU Treaty). Investing in ad hoc partnerships, already existing or to be created, will also allow us to forge common responses to certain challenges according to specific geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65) Beyond these commitments, our interests must be seen in light of the growing interweaving of the interests of European states, united in a common destiny. The return of approaches based on power and war to the European continent illustrates the importance of continuing and deepening integration among Europeans in order to foster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the development of a common strategic culture in all fields (extension of the work undertaken in the 2022 strategic plan);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the ability of Europeans to defend their security interests against potential aggression, in particular in their immediate neighbourhood, including through the development of common defence capabilities allowing for greater interoperability;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint European action in support of the international order based on law and multilateral management of global issues (United Nations, non-proliferation regimes, etc.);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the affirmation of the EU as a geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-the-defence-of-a-stable-international-order-based-on-the-rule-of-law-and-multilateralism&quot;&gt;1.3 THE DEFENCE OF A STABLE INTERNATIONAL ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND MULTILATERALISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;66) In addition to our commitments to our EU partners and NATO allies, our interests must also take into account the states in our neighbourhood and those to which we are linked by partnerships or defence agreements. This concerns areas of the world where states are engaging in increasingly aggressive strategic competition, and where non-state groups may be able to directly threaten our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;67) As a balancing power, France has a duty to contribute to the stability and security of these regions. The location of some of our territories in these areas requires us to maintain our presence in all areas and gives us a particular legitimacy to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-expansion-of-strategic-functions&quot;&gt;2. EXPANSION OF STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;68) The various strategic functions to which the armed forces contribute, identified in the 2008 White Paper, have seen their relevance confirmed as the strategic environment has evolved. They cover knowledge-appreciation-anticipation, deterrence, protection-resilience, prevention, intervention, and now influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;69) Influence, in all its dimensions — diplomatic, military, economic, cultural, sporting, linguistic, informational — is an area of dispute, which requires a coordinated response. It is a new strategic function in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70) Their proper structuring serves an integrated approach to respond to the evolving continuum of threats posed by our adversaries to our interests and values and those of our closest partners. In this respect, they remain dependent on our ability to ensure good coordination at both European and multilateral level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-knowledge--appreciation--anticipation&quot;&gt;2.1 KNOWLEDGE — APPRECIATION — ANTICIPATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;71) The knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function feeds into all the other strategic functions. The maintenance of an autonomous capacity for assessment is a guarantee of sovereign decision making. It contributes directly to understanding the intentions of our competitors. While being a condition for the operational effectiveness of the forces, it contributes to the economy of the resources used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;72) The five areas of this function are intelligence, knowledge of theatres of operation, diplomacy, foresight and anticipation, and information management. The recent crises and breakdowns as well as the extension of conflicts to new areas justify strengthening this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;73) The effort must focus on understanding the phenomena in order to anticipate and facilitate the reactivity of the decision. Faced with the pace of crises and escalation, but also with the saturation of irrelevant information or information manipulated by our competitors, collective effectiveness depends more and more on the ability to sort, prioritise and circulate intelligence as quickly as possible, in order to understand the phenomena it describes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;74) The knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function has a strong partnership dimension. In order to maintain an autonomous assessment of the situation on priority issues, France must also rely on the assessment of its partners in addition to its own resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-deterrence&quot;&gt;2.2 DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;75) Nuclear deterrence is based on its political, operational and technical credibility. In order to be solid, this credibility must continue to be based on an in-depth strategic culture, dynamic and cutting-edge scientific research, technical and operational know-how that is constantly maintained, strong industrial sovereignty, and understanding of the issues by our fellow citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76) The purpose of deterrence is to protect us from any state aggression against our vital interests, wherever it comes from and whatever its form, and it remains the ultimate guarantee of the Nation’s security, protection and independence. It ensures our autonomy of decision and freedom of action in the context of our international responsibilities at all times, including against attempts to blackmail us in the event of a crisis. By its existence, it contributes to the security of the Atlantic alliance and to that of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;77) The deterrence assets are being renewed while being maintained at a level of strict sufficiency. They must remain adapted to a wide variety of situations and continue to offer the Head of State a sufficiently wide range of mode of action. To achieve this, deterrence will continue to rely on the airborne and oceanic components. Bringing together three nuclear forces with their own characteristics, they allow, through their complementarity and their differentiated assets, a wide range of options and a high level of flexibility and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-protection--resilience&quot;&gt;2.3 PROTECTION — RESILIENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;78) The implementation of a strategic function dedicated to protection-resilience is now essential. The notions of protection and resilience complement each other, with resilience being an indispensable prerequisite for ensuring the protection of the French people and the national territory and guaranteeing the continuity of the essential functions of the Nation. This function requires enhanced cooperation with our allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;79) This protection function primarily concerns the national territory in metropolitan and overseas, as well as areas where French communities are heavily established or exposed abroad. This geographical dimension alone is no longer sufficient to respond to the nation’s vulnerabilities, given the dependence of our economy on strategic supplies and energy flows, as well as the hybrid strategies developed by France’s strategic competitors. The protection-resilience function must also include the new missions induced by the consequences of climate change and the degradation of biodiversity: food when used as a weapon, power and self-sufficiency, protection and security of value chains, assistance to our populations, securing territories and EEZ, considering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, manipulation of information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80) All state institutions contribute to the implementation of this function. For their part, the armed forces are permanently engaged on a daily basis to protect the national territory and the French people within the framework of their State action missions at sea or in the air, domestic missions and their own military operations. They ensure permanent air and maritime security postures (PASP and PMSP), which guarantee national sovereignty in air and maritime spaces, and help secure supply and communication routes. These day-to-day measures are reinforced according to the threat or particular events. The resurgence of unfriendly behaviour in our territorial approaches requires robust means of detection, remediation and response, including in space and in cyberspace. The capabilities of the armed forces thus need to be strengthened and structured as part of the overall state effort to deal with large-scale crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-prevention&quot;&gt;2.4 PREVENTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;81) Prevention concerns both the national territory and France’s action outside its borders. Its implementation includes both the development of national and international standards and the fight against trafficking and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, for disarmament and peace-building. Supporting the stabilisation of states in crisis contributes to conflict prevention and limits the cost of further intervention. The prevention function is based on a wide range of potential crisis or escalation scenarios, covering the top end of the spectrum and competition between great powers, as well as the manifestations of rapidly changing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;82) The pre-positioning of military forces plays a key role in the exercise of the prevention function, as it does for other strategic functions. The presence of French military forces in third countries, in agreement with them, contributes directly to this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;83) The security and defence cooperation mechanism is an indirect lever for preventing future crises. This cooperation takes the form of assistance to allied partner forces to provide them with the capabilities to assert their own sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;84) The prevention function must be articulated with the intervention function. This articulation is embodied in the capacity to signify determination, clarify intentions and discourage opponents — including in the field of perceptions — to “win the war before the war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;25-intervention&quot;&gt;2.5 INTERVENTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;85) The intervention function serves three purposes: to ensure the protection of our nationals abroad; to defend our priority interests and those of our partners and allies; and to live up to our international responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;86) It gives France’s security the strategic depth it needs, but also the broader credibility it needs to ensure the reliability of its alliances and its ability to train in coalitions as a framework nation. While French armies retain a capacity to act alone, the normal framework for their engagement outside the territory is that of collective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;87) In addition to the resources necessary for the protection of the national territory, the armed forces have the capacity to engage in priority areas for the defence and security of France: the European periphery, the area from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, part of Africa — from the Sahel to equatorial Africa — the Arabian Gulf and the Indo-Pacific. France must now resolve the issue of the strategic extension of its forces, and therefore the use of support points to which the pre-positioned forces, the overseas sovereignty forces and its strategic partnerships are attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88) The intervention function cannot be separated from the other functions, especially in a high-intensity engagement. Whether it is the knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function (anticipating and characterising threats to allow a wide range of options), prevention (the value of signalling our active deployments), protection-resilience (securing our supply chains) and deterrence (the concept of support between conventional posture and nuclear deterrence), the intervention function translates into multi-location and multi-field actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;26-influence&quot;&gt;2.6 INFLUENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;89) The strategic function of influence aims to promote and defend the interests and values of France. This is an essential part of the expression of power. In this respect, France has many assets. It has a major political weight due to its seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), its status as nuclear-weapon state and its overseas presence, a complete army model and troops deployed on many continents, its economic attractiveness, the French language spoken by 300 million people, a positive image due to our cultural influence, global projection supported by the universality of the diplomatic, cultural and educational network, our security partnerships, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;90) The new dimension given to the capacity to influence takes note of an acceleration and hardening of competition and contestation in all fields, particularly in that of perceptions. The aggressiveness shown by our competitors reminds us that nothing can be taken for granted: in addition to our diplomatic, economic and strategic interests, the new battles for influence involve our ability to maintain the French and European model and to ensure that France’s commitment on the international stage is understood and accepted. We therefore need to take on the balance of power more directly in this field to defend the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;91) Influence is first and foremost part of a long-term strategy. A global policy conducted and coordinated at the interministerial level, it relies on capacities that support and legitimise our positions and our action, which must be deployed in all possible fields (training of foreign military personnel and coordination of networks, contribution to university research, aid to economic development, etc.). It also requires knowledge of the levers of influence deployed by our partners, competitors and adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;92) Integral to the other strategic functions described in this review, the influence function must be embodied in a national influence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;93) Following on from the 2021 Roadmap for Influence, this national strategy will set the general framework for action by all the actors concerned, determine the intentions and provide guidance for the national sectoral and/or geographical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;94) This strategy will aim to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;defend France’s long-term interests as well as universal values, the application of international law, multilateralism and the preservation of common goods;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promote and enhance its commitments in all areas;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;respond or retaliate to manoeuvres or to attacks, particularly in the information field, against our interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-impacts-of-the-recent-context-on-frances-security-interests&quot;&gt;3. IMPACTS OF THE RECENT CONTEXT ON FRANCE’S SECURITY INTERESTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;95) The return of high intensity conflict, including on European territory, the increasingly unbridled expression of the desire for power on the part of our strategic competitors and the weakening of international regulatory frameworks constrain our choices and pose an unprecedented risk to France’s priority security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;96) The attacks on our strategic autonomy are increasing. Our strategic competitors seek to make use of our dependencies, and to undermine our sovereign judgement and national cohesion in order to shape our understanding of situations and constrain our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;97) The achievement of European sovereignty is essential to the defence of our interests, particularly in this period marked by a tendency towards inward-looking isolation that deeply affects the major players in the international community. Our partnerships and alliances are both one of France’s main assets on the international scene and one of the targets favoured by our strategic competitors to weaken us. The COVID-19 pandemic and then the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine have demonstrated the centrality of our partnerships and alliances in developing a common understanding of the challenges and providing appropriate responses. The Strategic Compass for the European Union and the update of NATO’s Strategic Concept set out clear roadmaps, which must now be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;98) The defence of a stable international order, based on the rule of law and multilateralism, has underpinned our security and prosperity since 1945. The activism of revisionist powers and the project they are carrying out, centred on the balance of power and the fait accompli, is not acceptable: our security interests require ensuring the continuity of our strategic supplies, our freedom of action in the common spaces and our sovereignty in the digital space, as well as an ambitious commitment to arms control and non-proliferation. These objectives must be based on collective and respected rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;general-ambition-for-2030&quot;&gt;General ambition for 2030&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;99) France affirms its ambition to be a balancing power on the international scene by 2030, having strengthened its influence in its areas of interest. It aims to be a driving force for European strategic autonomy in a Europe capable of facing crises and implementing solutions that guarantee its own security, in particular through a credible European defence that complements the Atlantic alliance. Finally, it fulfils its security responsibilities by aiming to preserve effective multilateral mechanisms based on international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100) This strategic ambition must be deployed through the prism of the fracturing of the world order, highlighted in particular by the war in Ukraine. This context calls into question the current French armed-forces model, which was designed according to a logic that was mainly expeditionary. This model in 2030 will have to provide France with the capacity to deal with the need for increased prevention and influence, a possible return to high-intensity interstate conflict, and the hybrid strategies deployed by our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;101) In 2030, France:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is capable of defending its metropolitan and overseas territory, and of protecting and involving its citizens. This permanent ambition is based on an independent, credible and coherent nuclear deterrent, the keystone of our defence policy, supported by robust conventional armed forces. Permanent security postures adapted to the threats and involving the internal security forces and a dynamic national resilience strategy also contribute to this;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;contributes to the defence of Europe and to stability in the Mediterranean by having the capability to engage in high-intensity conflict. It can assume the role of a framework nation within a NATO, EU or ad hoc coalition;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;acts in the framework of balanced partnerships, providing security, in an area stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to the Arabian Gulf, via the Horn of Africa. Together with its allies, it offers its partner armies a diversified and orchestrated range of courses and training. From a network of suitable support bases, it retains a capacity for intervention or coalition support;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;contributes through its influence and with its partners to the stability of the Indo-Pacific area. In it, it defends its sovereignty and respect for international law;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ensures its freedom of action in common spaces (cyber, space, seabed, air and sea) and the security of its supply routes, together with its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;102) To achieve this, France has set itself ten strategic objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a robust and credible nuclear deterrent;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a united and resilient France;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an economy that contributes to the spirit of defence;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;top-ranked cyber resilience;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, an exemplary ally in the Euro-Atlantic area;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, one of the drivers of European strategic autonomy;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, a partner of reliable sovereignty and credible security provider;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;guaranteed autonomy of assessment and decision-making sovereignty;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a capacity to defend and act in hybrid fields;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;freedom of action and the ability to conduct military operations, including high-intensity operations, autonomously or in coalition, in all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ten-strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Ten Strategic Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-1&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 1&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-robust-and-credible-nuclear-deterrent&quot;&gt;A robust and credible nuclear deterrent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;103) The effectiveness of French deterrence policy depends on its political, operational and technical credibility. This is reflected in a demanding posture and long-term capability commitments, but also in the ability, which has been widely demonstrated since its inception, to adapt both doctrine and resources to the strategic context and its potential changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;104) France’s deterrence policy must therefore take into account the global trends that are unfolding in the technological field as well as through hybrid forms of conflict: on the one hand, the capability developments of our competitors (air and missile defences, space, hypervelocity weapons, underwater surveillance, etc.) must constantly inform our thinking on deterrence; on the other hand, the modes of hybrid action, already at work in peacetime, are likely to affect the environment — political, normative, informational, etc. — within which deterrence is exercised and must be the subject of constant reflection on the means of countering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-european-dimension-of-the-french-deterrent&quot;&gt;1. THE EUROPEAN DIMENSION OF THE FRENCH DETERRENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;105) The conflict in Ukraine is an indication of the essential role our nuclear forces play in the security of the Euro-Atlantic area. It demonstrates the need to maintain a robust and credible nuclear deterrent to prevent a major war, guarantee France’s freedom of action and preserve its vital interests, which have a European dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-maintaining-an-effective-independent-and-sovereign-deterrent&quot;&gt;2. MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE, INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN DETERRENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;106) In this context, it is essential to maintain a credible deterrent, i.e. one that is legitimate, effective and independent, for the period to 2030 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;107) Part of the challenge of preserving the legitimacy of deterrence is to redouble efforts to strengthen the strategic and deterrence culture, both nationally and within the EU and the Alliance, by enabling a wider public to understand deterrence issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;108) At the same time, in accordance with the principle of strict sufficiency, France will continue its action in favour of arms control, non-proliferation and strategic risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;109) France has chosen to continue efforts to renew its two components and to ensure that the armed-forces model allows for a sufficiently robust mutual support of nuclear and conventional forces to preserve the freedom of action of the President of the Republic and to avoid circumventing deterrence from below. The war in Ukraine confirms the need to maintain a capacity to understand and constrain the risk of escalation. In addition, building national resilience to all threats will strengthen deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;110) Finally, the independence of the French deterrent must be perpetuated thanks to a reinforced monitoring of the fundamental and applied research teams, of the national industrial fabric linked to the deterrent and to a consolidation of the technical, industrial and operational know-how that is indispensable to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-2&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 2&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-united-and-resilient-france&quot;&gt;A united and resilient France&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;111) France must strengthen its resilience in the face of all the security challenges it is likely to face, whether military or non-traditional (information manipulation, climate change, resource predation, pandemics, etc.). This effort must be deployed in metropolitan and overseas France, particularly by promoting the spirit of defence and ensuring national cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-strengthen-frances-capacity-for-resilience-collectively-and-in-depth&quot;&gt;1. STRENGTHEN FRANCE’S CAPACITY FOR RESILIENCE, COLLECTIVELY AND IN DEPTH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;112) France is implementing its national resilience strategy (NRS). This aims to strengthen its ability to withstand any kind of damage to the normal life of the country. It allows for a precise and efficient connection with several mechanisms with similar objectives, adopted by both the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;113) The NRS defines three fundamental objectives: to prepare the State in depth for crises; to develop human resources and material capacities to deal with them, by including an overall study on the question of strategic stocks and the diversification of supply sources; and to adapt public communication to the challenges of resilience. This strategy must now be extended to local and regional authorities, companies, associations and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-promoting-a-sustainable-spirit-of-defence-in-society-and-the-state&quot;&gt;2. PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE SPIRIT OF DEFENCE IN SOCIETY AND THE STATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;114) The individual moral strengths of the citizen, especially our youth, are the foundation of collective resilience. They should be strengthened in the educational field, in order to increase the skills that strengthen the resilience of society (transmission of republican values, first aid, etc.). As part of the interministerial dynamic, the armed forces contribute to the promotion of remembrance and help to spread the spirit of defence among young people. The ministries concerned will mobilise to support the ramping up of the universal national service (UNS) to provide a national pool of resilience. Finally, the overhaul of the reserve system will be undertaken globally beyond the National Guard (army and internal security forces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;115) The attractiveness of the military must be strengthened, by supporting and compensating for the constraints of military life in order to consolidate the spirit of defence, forged as early as possible in the educational sphere, in concrete and rewarding approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;116) Military uniqueness, which is essential to enable the armed forces to prepare and ensure the defence of the homeland and the higher interests of the Nation, must be preserved, particularly from the increasing normative pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-develop-synergy-between-the-ministry-of-the-armed-forces-and-all-services-of-the-state&quot;&gt;3. DEVELOP SYNERGY BETWEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND ALL SERVICES OF THE STATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;117) The prospect of a major crisis or even a high-intensity confrontation involving France makes it necessary to raise the level of ambition in terms of national resilience, in particular by developing a better understanding of mutual resilience between the armed forces and the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;118) The armed forces are able to participate in the management of any major crisis with a high degree of responsiveness within the framework of a strengthened civil-military dialogue. The general economy of Operation Sentinel must be rethought in order to guarantee the freedom of action of the armed forces while responding to new security challenges. A renewal of the Operational Defence of the Territory (ODT) concept will also be undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;119) The commitment of the entire nation must be strengthened by increasing awareness of national defence and security issues among public officials, continuous training of crisis management actors, consolidation of the network of senior defence and security officials (SDSO), and the commitment of all ministries to ensure the support of armed forces engaged in a high intensity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;120) This synergy between a population imbued with the spirit of defence and public actors experienced in planning and crisis management will make it possible to strengthen national resilience in the fields of security, the economy, employment and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-3&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 3&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;an-economy-contributing-to-the-spirit-of-defence&quot;&gt;An economy contributing to the spirit of defence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;121) Setting up an economy that contributes to the spirit of defence requires knowing how to mobilise all the resources of the Nation, in order to transform into a war economy, i.e. to organise itself so that French industry can support a war effort in the long term, in case of necessity for the armed forces or for the benefit of a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-securing-critical-supplies-and-matching-stocks-to-production-capacity&quot;&gt;1. SECURING CRITICAL SUPPLIES AND MATCHING STOCKS TO PRODUCTION CAPACITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;122) To sustain a war effort over the long term (high consumption of ammunition, attrition, etc.) the best compromise is to be sought by acting on three main levers: the constitution of strategic stocks (complete equipment but also raw materials and critical components); the relocation of the most sensitive production lines; and the diversification of supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;123) In addition, joint stocks of components or raw materials could be set up on the initiative and under the responsibility of industry to support military industrial activities in the event of a conflict, or civilian activities in the event of an economic or health crisis. The development of recycling channels should also contribute to a circular economy, reducing the need for supply and contributing to sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;124) Securing the supply of critical resources could benefit from European initiatives such as the RePowerEU action plan and its variations on raw materials (Raw Material Act) and on components (Chips Act), while respecting French sovereign interests and environmental requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;125) In order to ensure the capacity of its government responsibilities, the State must be able to impose priorities or requisitions on the national market, depending on the evolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;126) Since security stability is a condition for the sustainability of our society, the defence technological and industrial base (DTIB) must be able to benefit from favourable financing tools, including in the context of the development of sustainable finance. Thus, future standards for taxonomy or environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria should not discourage investment in defence industry companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;127) Finally, the health crisis and the Ukrainian conflict have shown the importance of having secure and redundant sources of supply. Thus, the relocation of production and recycling facilities on European and national territory must be encouraged and supported in order to remedy the most critical dependence on materials, components, etc. This is the subject of in-depth work in the context of the work on the war economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-reducing-production-and-support-cycles-for-the-gradual-rise-of-the-war-economy&quot;&gt;2. REDUCING PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT CYCLES FOR THE GRADUAL RISE OF THE “WAR ECONOMY”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;128) In addition to the acquisition, over the next few years, of the most critical equipment necessary to face a high-intensity conflict or susceptible to rapid attrition, a war economy preparation plan is being developed in order to adapt the DTIB to the different geopolitical contexts in a gradual and adjustable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;129) Taking into account these geopolitical contexts must also be reflected in the EU and NATO defence capability tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-implementing-regulatory-normative-procurement-and-support-process-simplifications-from-a-point-of-view-of-risk-management&quot;&gt;3. IMPLEMENTING REGULATORY, NORMATIVE, PROCUREMENT AND SUPPORT PROCESS SIMPLIFICATIONS FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF RISK MANAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;130) The increasing and proactive use of innovation and value analysis in the work between the Defence procurement agency and the armed forces must enable the forces to be equipped with the most appropriate solutions while taking an acceptable risk in use and achieving the best balance between operational gains, financial gains and time gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-4&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 4&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;first-rate-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;First-rate cyber resilience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;131) In the face of strategic developments, the focus must be on improving our cyber resilience. There is no way to envisage a cyber shield that would thwart any cyber-attack on France, but strengthening its level of cyber security is essential to prepare the country for more threats. Similarly, the application of a deterrent approach in cyberspace that would force any attacker to restrain himself against France is illusory, but adopting response strategies that mobilise all the levers of the State, both European and international, makes it possible to make cyberattacks particularly costly for the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;132) This cyber resilience consists in having adapted and organised capacities, that can prevent or, if necessary, reduce the impact and duration of cyber-attacks against France, at least for the most critical functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-improving-frances-cyber-resilience-a-condition-of-sovereignty&quot;&gt;1. IMPROVING FRANCE’S CYBER RESILIENCE, A CONDITION OF SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;133) The efforts undertaken in the public and private sectors must be amplified. Notwithstanding the important work already undertaken, the State’s cybersecurity has significant room for improvement. In some critical sectors, large-scale attacks are still plausible, even if the investments made under the France Recovery plan have considerably improved the level of cyber security. As for the systemic role of certain digital actors, it is still insufficiently taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-consolidating-the-achievements-of-the-french-model&quot;&gt;2. CONSOLIDATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH MODEL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;134) The fundamental achievements of the French model, established in 2008 and regularly reinforced and adapted, must be consolidated. The governance of the State’s digital security has been renovated and can now be deployed. The national capacity to design and implement public policies is illustrated by the creation of regional incident response teams (CSIRT), the opening of the Cyber Campus and the emergence of a cyber defence ecosystem in Rennes. Finally, following its presidency of the Council of the European Union, France is recognised by its peers as exemplary on cybersecurity issues. The challenge now is to ensure that the EU directives for mass cybersecurity adopted under the FPEU are implemented as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-investing-over-the-long-term-to-reach-the-highest-level-of-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;3. INVESTING OVER THE LONG TERM TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CYBER RESILIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;135) The level of cybersecurity of all public services needs to be raised significantly. This will necessarily involve investments to consolidate a homogeneous and secure digital base for the State and to strengthen institutions and administrations that are still too fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;136) France’s action must be increased by relying on a dynamic public and private cyber ecosystem. The State cannot act alone on cybersecurity issues and must be able to mobilise all actors in the event of a major crisis. Particular attention will be paid to prevention and to assistance to all victims of malicious cyberattacks. Finally, this ecosystem must be based on a competitive national and European cyber defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;137) All actors in the digital world must be trained and made aware of the cyber risk. The aim is to mobilise the general public, systematically integrate it into educational curricula and strengthen the attractiveness of the professions in the sector. Efforts must also be made to ensure the accountability of digital service providers and the security of supply chains, particularly that of the State. Finally, France can support and encourage the emergence of robust and sovereign trustworthy offers at both national and European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;138) Lastly, France’s resilience depends on that of its European and international partners and on the security and stability of cyberspace as a whole. It is therefore necessary to contribute to raising the level of resilience of European and international institutions and of France’s partners, as well as to pursue the structuring of a European market for cybersecurity products and services. On the international scene, France must put forward proposals to control the trade and fight against the proliferation of cyber weapons, in particular through better use of export control tools for goods and technologies. In addition, a common standard for cyber crisis management, as well as cooperation and mutual assistance mechanisms, would enable states to avoid the risks of misunderstanding and uncontrolled escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-5&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 5&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;france-an-exemplary-ally-in-the-euro-atlantic-area&quot;&gt;France, an exemplary ally in the Euro-Atlantic area&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;139) NATO is a political and military alliance that plays a key role in European security through its main mission of collective defence and, in particular, the assistance clause in Article 5 of the 1949 Treaty. The transatlantic link remains essential for the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and consequently that of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-contributing-to-increasing-the-operational-added-value-of-the-alliance&quot;&gt;1. CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING THE OPERATIONAL ADDED VALUE OF THE ALLIANCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;140) France will continue to contribute fully to all the missions of the Atlantic Alliance, assuming its role within the military structures and operations, as it is doing in the context of the war in Ukraine, in the Baltic States and in Romania. It will contribute to their responsiveness and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;141) France wishes to confirm the Alliance’s key role in the defence of Europe. NATO strengthens the potential of armies and is the forum for addressing interoperability challenges as well as capability, technological and operational expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-enhance-the-key-and-unique-role-of-france-within-the-alliance&quot;&gt;2. ENHANCE THE KEY AND UNIQUE ROLE OF FRANCE WITHIN THE ALLIANCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;142) France intends to maintain a unique position within the Alliance. It has a demanding and visible position because of the specificity and independence of its defence policy, in particular because of its nuclear deterrent. On the strength of its operational credibility, its unique ability to act urgently at a high level and its financial contribution, which is among the largest in the Alliance, France intends to strengthen its influence and that of the European allies in order to weight with them on the major changes in NATO’s posture and the future of strategic stability in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;143) Concerned about the coherence and cohesion of the Alliance, France will continue to contribute in a proactive, realistic and sustainable way to the strengthening of the posture on the eastern flank — including as a framework nation — and to the adaptation of NATO’s command structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-driving-eu-nato-cooperation&quot;&gt;3. DRIVING EU-NATO COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;144) France is working to strengthen the European pillar of the Alliance in a pragmatic approach to its role, which excludes an extension to other geographical areas and in particular the Indo-Pacific. The guarantee provided by NATO’s collective defence mission remains the central pillar of security in the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;145) Defence investment, in line with the 2014 Wales Summit commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, must continue to increase in Europe. This level should be seen as a floor to match the strategic disruption caused by the war in Ukraine and the capabilities needed by the European allies to ensure their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;146) This collective effort also involves the creation, at EU level, of the necessary incentives for capability and industrial cooperation between European states. These contribute to the strengthening of the continent’s resilience, which is essential for the Alliance’s effectiveness, but also for the sustainability of a robust, agile European DTIB (EDTIB) capable of meeting the operational needs of European armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;147) France supports a modernisation, widening and deepening of the EU-NATO partnership, to take account of the new security challenges facing Europe and the forthcoming accession of Finland and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-6&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 6&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;france-one-of-the-driving-forces-behind-european-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;France, one of the driving forces behind European strategic autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;148) France and all European countries share the same security challenges. The adoption of an ambitious strategic compass in March 2022 and the major role played by the EU since the start of the war in Ukraine demonstrate both the power of our levers and the distance we still have to travel. It is necessary to bring about the emergence of a sovereign Europe, endowed with a common strategic culture, with a capacity for evaluation and autonomous action in the service of the shared interests of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-coming-together-around-a-european-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;1. COMING TOGETHER AROUND A EUROPEAN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;149) France plays a key role in strengthening European sovereignty, notably through its triple membership of the EU, NATO and the UNSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;150) France is first of all working towards a convergence of views in the assessment of situations between Europeans, all of whom have different strategic cultures or political priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;151) France then supports the renewal of the European partnership policy initiated with the adoption of the strategic compass. It goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the EU’s defence relations with countries in Africa and the Indo-Pacific and, in the case of the United States and the United Kingdom, with the implementation of balanced relations supported by regular and intensive defence and security dialogues. Increased, sustainable and durable EU-NATO complementarity must be sought. France must play a leading role in this, promoting closer cooperation in certain key areas, such as military mobility, cyber and hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;152) Finally, the EU’s cohesion in its support for Ukraine is a priority. It is imperative that Europeans remain united and proactive, both on sanctions and in support of the Ukrainian armed and security forces. The continuation of a high level of military assistance over time through the provision of equipment and appropriate training is crucial. This consistency is necessary for Europe to remain capable of influencing the resolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-bringing-european-defence-industrial-capabilities-to-the-fore&quot;&gt;2. BRINGING EUROPEAN DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL CAPABILITIES TO THE FORE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;153) The EU must continue on the path towards greater technological autonomy which goes hand in hand with the development of the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;154) European strategic autonomy depends on robust European defence industrial capabilities that meet its own needs. France supports the setting up of a short-term instrument for the joint acquisition of European equipment. It also supports the creation of a defence investment programme for the joint development and procurement of critical and innovative equipment. The central role of the European Defence Agency (EDA) must be reaffirmed and all existing instruments must be mobilised: the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Coordinated Annual Defence Review (CARD), Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the Hub for European Defence Innovation (HEDI). In addition, the provisions related to the social taxonomy must consider the specificity and needs of the EDTIB, which is a central component of European strategic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;155) These efforts must be accompanied by structural and decisive progress in common capability projects with the objective of an independent EDTIB and common choices among Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthening-the-eus-and-europeans-own-capacity-to-act&quot;&gt;3. STRENGTHENING THE EU’S AND EUROPEANS’ OWN CAPACITY TO ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;156) Europe must be supported in its role as a global player, a credible defender of free access to contested spaces (sea, space, cyber, air, seabed) in the face of the hybrid strategies of its competitors. With the right strategies and capabilities, it is able to protect the citizens of the Member States, to interact and, where necessary, to intervene on all continents in strict compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;157) The Union’s normative power must be exploited as a lever of influence in a more competitive environment, in order to guard against hybrid threats and other forms of foreign interference, be it “lawfare”, commodity blackmail or information manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;158) In this sense, France supports the instruments developed by the European institutions: hybrid toolbox, foreign information manipulation and interference — FIMI — toolbow, anti-economic coercion regulation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;159) France is contributing to the development of a genuine EU STRATCOM, capable of positioning Europe and European action in relation to its citizens, their representatives, our partners and also our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;160) The EU must continue to build up its rapid deployment capability. It needs to be able to respond quickly and more robustly in less permissive environments. To this end, France is promoting more flexible decision-making with Article 44 of the EU Treaty and renewed decision-making and control structures (C2), as well as global mandates to act on a broad spectrum: advice, training, equipment, combat support. The Union must have the capacity to mobilise ad hoc formats when necessary, as France has already done with Takuba or EMASoH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;161) France, given its geographical position, its industrial and military capabilities and its national know-how, contributes actively to the development of European airspace protection. Its deterrence is part of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;162) Finally, the European Intervention Initiative (EII) is the crucible for a common strategic culture and enhanced cooperation between its members. Launched in 2018, the format remains fully relevant today to support the increasing responsibility of Europeans in favour of their own security, resulting in operational commitments in which France can play the role of framework nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;163) France is defending an ambitious strategic offer that translates into lucid, balanced and prioritised solidarity with its partners. In a context of exacerbated polarisation and competition, France’s offer to its partners must continue to be distinguished by its high added value and enable it not to be forced into alignment or marginalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-developing-an-inclusive-strategy-in-europe-and-with-the-us&quot;&gt;1.1 DEVELOPING AN INCLUSIVE STRATEGY IN EUROPE AND WITH THE US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;164) In Europe, France must both recast its relations with its traditional partners and develop an inclusive strategy towards other countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with Germany, France must deepen its relationship in order to continue to build European defence in the light of Germany’s recently expressed ambitions and the strategic and capability needs we have identified;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italy and Spain are key partners, both in theatres of operation (Mediterranean, Middle East, Sahel) and in terms of capability cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with EU members, France must consolidate several of its strategic partnerships (Greece, Croatia) and, capability partnerships (Belgium) concluded recently, consolidate its links with certain partners (Quirinal Treaty with Italy, Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with Spain), and strengthen its operational cooperation on the basis of shared experiences in the Sahel and in Eastern Europe (countries involved in Operation Barkhane and Takuba TF);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with partners in the EU neighbourhood (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia), France must, preferably, contribute to their stability by capitalising on its economic aid and European programmes to support structural reforms;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with our allies, our space partnerships will be intensified;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;after Brexit, a constructive dialogue on the basis of the bilateral treaties must be quickly re-established with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;165) With the United States, our strategic partnership will remain fundamental, and must remain ambitious, lucid and pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-contributing-to-security-in-africa-through-balanced-partnerships&quot;&gt;1.2 CONTRIBUTING TO SECURITY IN AFRICA THROUGH BALANCED PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;166) Faced with the evolution of the terrorist threat and the growing influence of our strategic competitors across the continent, France wishes to forge renewed partnerships in Africa based on African partners’ requests and by integrating more civilian based cooperation along a security, defence, diplomacy and development continuum, as declared in the summer of 2017. They should contribute to a better understanding of security issues and build, in the long term, a stronger strategic proximity with African armies that wish to do so, particularly in view of the renegotiation of several major treaties. Coordination with our European and international partners will continue to be essential in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-adopting-an-ambitious-partnership-strategy-in-the-mediterranean-and-the-red-sea&quot;&gt;1.3 ADOPTING AN AMBITIOUS PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE RED SEA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;167) Given the increased competition and militarisation in the Mediterranean-Red Sea continuum, France needs to strengthen its reassurance measures, support EU and NATO missions and operations, and enhance the effectiveness and level of capability cooperation with all countries in the area. The densification of certain strategic or reference partnerships will also enable France to guarantee its freedom of manoeuvre, the continuity of its supply chains and regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-contributing-to-regional-stability-and-securing-flows-in-the-arabian-gulf&quot;&gt;1.4 CONTRIBUTING TO REGIONAL STABILITY AND SECURING FLOWS IN THE ARABIAN GULF&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;168) A revitalisation of France’s partnerships in the Gulf is necessary to cope with the structuring of new strategic agreements, American disengagement and the increase in regional rivalries. France must be able, with and through its partners, to hinder and counter the destabilising activities of certain regional actors and to secure its own footprint, in particular by signing security arrangements in the fields of counter-terrorism, intelligence and armaments. France must also continue to support defence and security equipment procurement projects while strengthening the fight against the diversion of war materials, the dissemination of conventional weapons and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-enhancing-our-ability-to-contribute-to-maintaining-strategic-stability-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;1.5 ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO MAINTAINING STRATEGIC STABILITY IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;169) France’s role as a balancing power in the Indo-Pacific must be reaffirmed. To this end, France is committed to building partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, notably India, Australia and Japan, as well as Indonesia and Singapore. It develops its capacities of anticipation and strategic signalling, vis-à-vis its competitors, reaffirms and strengthens its position in the politico-military multilateralism of the region, by increasing its training capacity and, if necessary, by promoting the emergence of ad hoc structures. France will also promote the implementation of the EU’s strategy for the region and its partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;170) France defends the centrality and credibility of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the sustainability of the four multilateral export control regimes covering chemical and biological, nuclear, ballistic and conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;171) It is continuing to invest in the intelligence needed to hinder illicit or destabilising flows, with a particular focus on intangibles, which are particularly vulnerable to cyber actions, while developing countermeasures to CBRN threats in order to promote resilience in the face of possible attacks against its forces, interests or territory. It also strengthens its capacity for action to counteract these illicit or destabilising flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;guaranteed-autonomy-of-judgement-and-decision-making-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Guaranteed autonomy of judgement and decision-making sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;172) In an increasingly competitive and complex international context, France must focus its efforts on raising its level of knowledge, understanding of competitors or adversaries, and anticipating their intentions. This performance requirement calls for developing the agile orientation of the intelligence services while preserving the universality and effectiveness of the diplomatic and consular network. It also requires continued investment in the technological capabilities to exploit the ever-increasing volume of data, in order to share relevant information with the decision-making and action levels in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-developing-agile-intelligence-and-surveillance-capabilities&quot;&gt;1. DEVELOPING AGILE INTELLIGENCE AND SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;173) Intelligence services have to monitor, analyse and understand an increasing number of geographical areas and issues. They must anticipate crises, technological and military capability disruptions, the terrorist threat, the CBRN threat, the defence and promotion of national economic and industrial interests, in particular DTIB companies, and the fight against hybrid or transversal threats. One of the decisive challenges is to articulate the continuation of their action in the fight against terrorism and in support of military operations, with reinvestment in areas of strategic rivalry, in particular continental Europe and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;174) The effectiveness and agility of the intelligence services depend on ambitious reforms, long-term investments and an acceleration of coordination and intelligence exchange loops, including with the armed forces in operations. The continuation of the in-depth transformations already underway — in particular the external security general directorate and the Military intelligence directorate, following the example of the international security general directorate — must be accompanied by an ambitious human resources policy in the intelligence professions, in order to attract, retain and develop a common culture and inter-service mobility. It is also essential to ensure the universality of the diplomatic network and to strengthen its means of analysis and anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-building-technical-capacity&quot;&gt;2. BUILDING TECHNICAL CAPACITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;175) The preservation of French sovereignty in the face of technological change requires new investments in capabilities. The growing diversity of tools and the acceleration of technological advances offer new opportunities, provided that the necessary investments are made, according to a logic of mutualisation when the missions allow it. The reactivity of the knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function must be amplified by increased interconnection around secure communication tools, ensuring technical interoperability with the main foreign partners on a case-by-case basis, particularly within the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;176) The new technical tools will have to use the potential of quantum computing and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-9&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 9&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-capacity-to-defend-and-act-in-hybrid-fields&quot;&gt;A capacity to defend and act in hybrid fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;177) France’s main strategic competitors use hybrid strategies, deliberately ambiguous combinations of direct and indirect, military and non-military, legal and illegal, and often difficult-to-attribute modes of action. These strategies can have important consequences for democracies as they aim to delegitimise them, weaken their moral strength and cohesion or reduce their economic and national defence potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;178) Faced with these threats and in order to defend its fundamental interests, France must perfect its organisation, be able to respond in all fields of hybridity and protect its most critical infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-improving-our-organisation&quot;&gt;1. IMPROVING OUR ORGANISATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;179) France must be capable of countering and controlling the effects of these hybrid aggressions, while respecting its principles and values. To achieve this, a more agile, responsive and integrated organisation will be adopted to identify, characterise, trigger appropriate protection mechanisms and develop responses in a more multi-sectoral approach. In line with the EU’s strategic compass and the NATO 2030 concept, France also relies on its allies and partners to benefit from leverage in its fight against hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;180) This organisation is based on a national strategy of influence which must include the actions carried out in a global approach and over time to enhance France’s commitments but also to respond or retaliate effectively to informational manoeuvres or attacks against its interests. It mobilises its public diplomacy, particularly in Africa. A strategic communication is developed in order to convey a coherent, credible and effective message to competitors, partners or allies and to national and international public opinion. It can be coordinated with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-act&quot;&gt;2. ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;181) In the field of the fight against information manipulation by foreign competitors, France must have a wide range of response options, beyond public attribution, as is the case in the cyber field. France is fighting against the use of law and norms as a strategic tool (lawfare) by its competitors. It supports the adoption of European tools to combat extraterritoriality. France is developing tools to fight back against private military companies, armed groups or militias used as intermediaries — proxies — by hostile powers in order to multiply their actions of contestation or competition, while maintaining plausible deniability. Dissemination of information, national or European sanctions, legal proceedings or even military actions may target these groups if they carry out activities detrimental to French interests or if they are responsible for human rights violations and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthening-the-protection-of-critical-infrastructure&quot;&gt;3. STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;182) In the face of hybrid threats, the protection of our critical infrastructures is a priority. Among them, underwater and space communication infrastructures require a special effort to develop the means of detection, characterisation, deterrence and even obstruction of malicious actions. Finally, France wishes to promote the development of leading French industrial players, world leaders in the field of submarine communication cables and space operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-10&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 10&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;freedom-of-action-and-ability-to-conduct-military-operations-including-high-intensity-operations-in-all-fields-multi-environment-and-multi-field&quot;&gt;Freedom of action and ability to conduct military operations, including high-intensity operations in all fields (multi-environment and multi-field)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;183) The freedom of action of the forces depends on the ability to anticipate, detect and appreciate the intentions of France’s adversaries. It underpins the national capacity to show determination, to discourage hostile action or prevent the imposition of a fait accompli, and to engage in confrontation if necessary. It allows for the robust backing of nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;184) It must be preserved from the competition phase onwards, in an ever-wider spectrum, because the strategies of France’s competitors and adversaries are expressed in a growing number of fields (outer space and cyber, seabed, electromagnetic and information fields).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;185) France must maintain and further develop its capacities to decide and command, to federate and mobilise, to act and last, to invest in common spaces and to face uninhibited competitors, taking into account its interests, its place on the international scene and its global ambition, but also its means. These capacities are necessarily differentiated according to the geographical areas and common spaces considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-deciding-and-ordering&quot;&gt;1. DECIDING AND ORDERING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;186) France enjoys a complete and autonomous capacity for assessment and understanding as required to support political and military decisions. The armed forces have trained and deployable command capabilities to plan, conduct and control multi-environment and multi-field operations in autonomy and in coalition when France is a framework nation at the operational level. A permanent and agile reorganized command structure controls the day-to-day and contingency operations that contribute to safeguarding its strategic interests, its metropolitan and overseas territories, its aerospace, air and sea and aeronautical approaches, and its energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-uniting-and-contributing&quot;&gt;2. UNITING AND CONTRIBUTING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;187) In Africa, the Near and Middle East, and the Indian Ocean, France is able to mobilise or accompany its partners, to constrain or discourage an aggressor by offering a command and support capability to the forces. It honours its commitments there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;188) In the Pacific zone, France has the means, in coordination with its partners, to discourage or hinder a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;189) In Central and South America, the Arctic and Antarctic, it preserves its freedom of action, the security of its flows and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;190) The armed forces are constantly working to develop and maintain interoperability with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-act-and-last&quot;&gt;3. ACT AND LAST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;191) The armed forces protect the French people against a dangerous world, participate in their daily protection and contribute to the preservation of national interests. In particular, they hold permanent positions of deterrence, air safety and maritime protection and take part in missions on national territory (including DROM-COM with sovereignty forces) in addition to or in support of internal security or civil security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;192) The armed forces are prepared for a major engagement and ready to engage in a high-intensity confrontation, particularly in the defence of the euro-atlantic area. They are able to deploy at short notice, able to enter first, with or without possible support from allied countries. They have the capabilities to protect themselves, to last and to cope with high attrition (air superiority and fire superiority). They are able to provide an allied country with the necessary support at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;193) They have diversified capabilities for deep strikes in the context of first entry, support to a coalition operation, retaliatory actions, or strategic warning. France is able to target and strike (kinetic or cyber) targets of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;194) Armies have the capacity to generate and aggregate effects in a networked approach from the competition phase onwards across the entire spectrum of conflict, with in particular military and civilian, public and private, institutional and individual, national or allied contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-investing-in-common-spaces&quot;&gt;4. INVESTING IN COMMON SPACES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;195) France is fully present and active in preserving its freedom of action and defending its interests in common spaces that are the object of power rivalries and renewed forms of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;196) Faced with strategic competitors, armies acquire and maintain their freedom of assessment and action in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;197) In space, France maintains its national strategic autonomy in terms of situation assessment, decision-making and the conduct of operations. It ensures its access to the space environment and to assert its interests in this environment, notably through the support of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;198) France has the capacity to autonomously monitor and understand actions on the seabed. By building on partnerships, it is able to discourage hostile action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-dealing-with-uninhibited-competitors&quot;&gt;5. DEALING WITH UNINHIBITED COMPETITORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;199) The armed forces have the means of prevention, reporting and coercion to influence the strategic calculations of France’s competitors and adversaries and to win the battle of perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>SGDSN</name></author><summary type="html">The last few years have brought tragedy back into our lives and questioned the destiny of our nation.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/Ypnu8Rt.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/Ypnu8Rt.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Iran’s Drones In Ukraine</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-10-31-irans-drones-in-ukraine.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Iran’s Drones In Ukraine" /><published>2022-10-31T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-10-31T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/irans-drones-in-ukraine</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-10-31-irans-drones-in-ukraine.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Russian military has attacked multiple Ukrainian cities with Iranian drones in recent weeks. The use of Iranian drones in Ukraine has sparked concern over the deepening Iranian-Russo ties and the maturity of Iran’s drone program. But for Iran, Ukraine serves as another battlefield to live-test its drone fleet against U.S.- and NATO-provided defensive systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tehran has placed itself firmly in the Kremlin’s camp since the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Part of that is driven by the punishing sanctions regime that weighs heavily on both economies and part by a shared interest in weakening the U.S. and NATO. But the nature of Iran’s support shifted when Tehran supplied drones and then began training Russian forces on their use. Reports of the deal surfaced in midsummer and by August, Iranian drones were in Ukraine. The precise terms remain unclear, but Iranian drones offset surveillance demands on the Russian air force and may backfill rapidly depleting missile stockpiles. For Iran, the deal generates cash or repays a debt — but more significantly places its drones in yet another theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones already provide Iranian forces and regional proxies with critical capabilities, including aerial surveillance and short- and long-range strikes. Their smaller size makes them hard to see on radar, and they are difficult to hit because they fly low and slow — exploiting a gap in defense systems. Some drones function as precision munitions such as the Shahed-136, which earned the moniker of a “kamikaze” drone. Though individual drones carry a relatively low payload, drone swarm technology, which the Iranian military showcased in late 2021, can combine their firepower. The Shahed-136’s mobile, truck-mounted launchers present similar challenges to detection as did Iraq’s Scud launchers in the first Gulf War. Moreover, Iran sources some drone components from commercially available engines and other dual-use technologies, complicating efforts to prevent parts procurement. Indeed, Tehran has called drones “the main pillar of wars of the future” and asserted they will play an increasingly prominent role in its military posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advancement in Iran’s drone threat should be no surprise. While Iranian military drills and reporting may inflate capabilities, Iranian drones have proved their worth in active conflicts. Yemen’s Houthis began using Iranian-sourced drones in 2016. They used a short-range drone to target Patriot air defense systems within the country, neutralizing them before firing missiles at the location. They also used these drones for cross-border attacks against Saudi military and oil infrastructure. Iran introduced longer-range designs that the Houthis tested against Saudi targets, and the first known Shahed-136 surfaced in Yemen by September 2020. Houthi-launched drones and missiles probe Saudi air defenses, primarily Patriot air defense systems, to reveal vulnerabilities that they can then exploit. Iranian drone performance in the Yemen conflict almost certainly has fed back into future development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback cycle makes Russia’s use of Iranian drone technology worrisome. The drones themselves are unlikely to yield strategic shifts in the Ukraine war. The Russian military is attacking civilian and infrastructure targets with drones to break the will of the Ukrainian people, but these attacks seem to have only further inured Ukrainians to Russian brutality. The Ukrainian military is shooting down more than 70 percent of the Shahed-136 drones, using anti-drone techniques developed on the fly. Defensive layers include radar to identify potential drone threats, fighter jet patrols, ground-fired anti-aircraft missiles and even machine-gun fire. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with anti-drone systems, including the mobile VAMPIRE system, to aid in defense against Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and NATO will reap the benefits of the Ukrainian military’s experience, so, too, will Iran. Iranians operating the drones from Crimea have front-row seats and can report back which drone attacks have penetrated which defenses, and where gaps in any defense systems may exist. Iran’s next generation of drones will be that much more difficult to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of ways in which the Ukrainian military has thwarted Russian drone attacks is a testament to the array of defenses at its disposal. But it also speaks to the ad hoc nature of the response, revealing vulnerabilities to increasingly sophisticated — and field-tested — Iranian technology, and it exposes an asymmetry in defending against the threat. Scrambling fighter jets to shoot down drones as the U.S. did in September is not a sustainable response. Nor, as the Saudis have learned, is firing million-dollar Patriot missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and NATO must commit to advancing their anti-drone capabilities and slowing Iran’s drone program. The Defense Department’s initial steps to develop a strategy and the technologies to support it are positive but remain insufficient as modern warfare moves faster than defense procurement cycles. Congress could help. Funding the military’s efforts to address this growing threat is one way. Another is focusing on the Iranian drone procurement network and those who operate the drones. Sanctioning entities within this network will make it harder for Iran to obtain necessary components. So, too, would ensuring the proper authorities to attack the production cycle through cyber or other means are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s drone threat is rising, and it’s only a matter of time until the U.S. military, not the Ukrainians, will need to defend against it.&lt;/p&gt;

State Grid is the world’s largest utility company, pursuing an international strategy of expansion that both implements and informs Beijing’s policy goals for global energy infrastructure. By investigating how State Grid acquired a stake in Greece’s national power grid operator, the Chinese financing and energy sector business deals that followed State Grid’s investment, and the constraints that limited State Grid’s later efforts to expand its control over Greece’s electric grid, this case study offers insight to the role of state-owned enterprises in the global reach of China’s state capitalist system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to further explore the “CCP Inc.” framework of Chinese state capitalism, this report examines the illustrative case of State Grid Corporation of China’s (State Grid; 国家电网) initial investment in Greece’s energy sector and its attempts to expand its reach in the country’s electric grid. State Grid’s entrance into the Greek power market — and more particularly, its causes and consequences — demonstrates the considerable power of the CCP Inc. ecosystem to promote Chinese interests in critical overseas markets, beyond what pure state planning could reasonably achieve. As this case study will illustrate, the CCP Inc. ecosystem can enable greater contributions to Chinese political and economic interests than central government directives alone — even as its blurring of the lines between private and state interests can also present political problems for Chinese businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” represents an evolution from the past “China Inc.” framework for examining China’s economic statecraft, which focused on the relatively clear lines between the global activities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and government planning directives, such as national five-year plans and foreign policy initiatives like the “Going Out” strategy to encourage outbound investment. Over the past decade, Chinese state capitalism has evolved into a more complex ecosystem of SOEs, private and hybrid-owned companies, Chinese policy banks, diplomatic actors, and state planners pursuing a mix of national and commercial interests. The CCP Inc. framework examines these added layers of political and commercial actors on top of analyses of the government initiatives, SOEs, and national champions that have traditionally been the central focuses in scholarship on China’s economic statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this complex CCP Inc. ecosystem, the interactions and motivations of Chinese state and commercial actors are not always easily observable. Therefore, this series of case studies examines the circumstances of certain international investments and business deals for insight into how CCP Inc. operates in practice. Some conduits of state influence are clear, such as in diplomatic support for business deals. In other cases, outside observers must rely on indirect evidence, such as suspiciously generous financial arrangements or actions by CCP Inc. actors that are not motivated by obvious economic considerations. In Greece, for example, State Grid was able to massively outbid its commercial opponents, while pursuing a national footprint that aligned both with its own business goals and with central government priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of State Grid’s investment in Greece is an important example of how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has enabled Chinese companies, regulators, banks, and officials to cooperate in pursuit of common commercial and economic goals. Contemporary Sino-Greek economic cooperation is anchored in Greece’s decades-long debt challenges. In the aftermath of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the Greek and Chinese governments began to accelerate the development of investment plans into Greece — and Chinese companies became a key source of financing. In 2016, State Grid took a 24 percent stake in the Greek national power grid operator, ADMIE (the shortened and anglicized version of the original Greek name for the firm, also known as IPTO). The investment was, at the time, the second-largest Chinese investment in Greece, with State Grid significantly outbidding competitors in early offerings for a stake in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key reason for State Grid’s interest in ADMIE was the Greek grid operator’s position in emergent interconnections between international power grids across the Mediterranean, which was aligned with the company’s vision for an interconnected global grid and was discussed in high-level meetings about the ADMIE stake. After State Grid’s initial investment, ADMIE formed new partnerships with Chinese banks, while other Chinese companies made major investments in the Greek energy sector and Chinese firms enjoyed strong diplomatic support for their ventures in Greece. However, State Grid ultimately fell short in its ambitions to expand its footprint in Mediterranean super grids, demonstrating how pushback against CCP Inc. can constrain major SOEs like State Grid. In fact, some features of CCP Inc. that serve to support Chinese companies — namely, state backing and connections to Chinese banks — can also become a liability by reinforcing perceptions of Chinese companies as offshoots of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study proceeds in three parts. Chapter 1 examines State Grid’s entry into the Greek power grid as a minority shareholder in the national grid operator, ADMIE. Chapter 2 expands the aperture to examine how private Chinese renewable energy companies followed State Grid into the Greek power sector. Finally, Chapter 3 reflects on what State Grid’s entry into the Greek market tells us about SOEs in the CCP Inc. framework, and how State Grid’s challenges in expanding its role in the Greek electric grid reflect the limitations of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-greek-debt-and-chinese-shipping-interests-anchored-chinas-economic-expansion-in-greece&quot;&gt;How Greek Debt and Chinese Shipping Interests Anchored China’s Economic Expansion in Greece&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Greek economic partnership grew rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s, driven chiefly by Greece’s desire for expanded economic partners amid financial troubles, along with the Chinese government’s recognition of the geostrategic opportunities accompanying commercial engagement with a nation that links Europe to the eastern Mediterranean and to the Eurasian continent. In 2008–2009, the global financial crisis caused severe economic stagnation, accelerating the country’s debt crisis by further constraining Greece’s already impaired ability to pay its debts. With the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) growing ever more wary of Greece’s ability to recover, the government needed additional partners. As a result, the Greek government was highly receptive to Chinese investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Chinese government had long sought further entry points into the European market. For China, Greece’s geographic and political position vis-à-vis the European Union created strong incentives for Chinese companies to gain a foothold in the country as a route through which to access the broader European market. Politically, tensions between Greece and the European Union during Greece’s period of financial crisis created openings for Chinese investments that might have been met with more pushback in other parts of the European Union. Geographically, Greece’s position at the crux of Euro-Asian Sea and land routes presented a critical pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years after the global financial crisis, the IMF, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission — collectively called the “troika” — required Greece to undergo a series of privatizations as a precondition for receiving bailout money. Among the most significant of these privatizations concerned the port of Piraeus, one of the fastest-growing seaports in Europe, which required external investment to achieve its economic potential and help restore Greece’s maritime economy. Ultimately, Piraeus found the needed funding through China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COSCO is one of China’s oldest and largest SOEs — indeed, it traces its institutional legacy directly to China’s original 53 core SOEs, dating back to the 1950s. It has, in its various incarnations, been one of the central government’s key tools for managing China’s trade since the Mao Zedong era. Throughout its history, COSCO has remained closely affiliated with central planners, including the State Council and the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) today — not merely in the official bureaucratic hierarchy, but in its regular planning and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, COSCO began a two-phase investment in the port of Piraeus, which would transfer majority ownership of the port to the SOE and would ultimately be labeled by Chinese and European commentators alike as China’s flagship investment in Greece. Under COSCO’s ownership, Piraeus has acted as a beachhead for further Chinese business to enter the Greek market. In 2018, Huawei won the contract to redesign the port’s network infrastructure, while in 2019, COSCO subsidiary OceanRail Logistics acquired Piraeus Europe Asia Rail Logistics (PEARL), and with it, access to run rail in Europe. Moreover, following COSCO’s success in Piraeus, a growing number of Chinese companies went on to offer investments across a range of sectors, including energy — a traditionally sensitive sector given the national security implications of foreign involvement in essential services, such as electricity provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following COSCO’s acquisition of Piraeus, the next major Chinese investment in Greece would come from another of China’s original 53 core SOEs: State Grid. Like COSCO, State Grid plays a critical role in China’s central economic planning and international economic statecraft; its acquisition of stakes in the Greek national grid operator served both Greek needs for financing and Chinese interests in gaining a foothold in a country at the center of an emerging international cluster of electric grid interconnections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-on-state-grid-and-its-role-in-chinas-international-electricity-strategy&quot;&gt;Background on State Grid and Its Role in China’s International Electricity Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid is a behemoth even among China’s central SOEs. By far the larger of China’s two main grid companies, it is the world’s largest utility company, managing power supply to roughly 88 percent of China and covering over 1.1 billion people across 26 provinces. With $613.8 billion (¥4.1 trillion) in total assets as of 2020 — including $46.9 billion (¥316.7 billion) in foreign assets — State Grid is one of the largest companies in the world. Internationally, it ranks as the world’s third-largest company by revenue, surpassed only by Amazon and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its staggering scale and resources — not to mention its central role in China’s economy — State Grid’s investment decisions are central drivers of China’s energy and industrial outlooks. Most recently, in January 2022, State Grid chairman Xin Bao’an confirmed that in 2022, the company would invest $85.9 billion (¥579.5 billion) domestically, of which $74.3 billion (¥501.2 billion) would go directly to domestic grid upgrades in pursuit of developing a “modern” (i.e., more stable, resilient, and efficient) grid. The amount, while massive, is well within State Grid’s financial means, as it saw $440.0 billion (¥3.0 trillion) in operating income and $7.5 billion (¥50.8 billion) of pure profit in 2021. These figures give just a small window into the SOE’s economic weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, State Grid has a long history of being able to leverage both its size and its core role in the economy for behind-the-scenes negotiations with officials in Beijing. Indeed, its sizable investments in grid upgrades strongly tend toward upgrades that will increase revenues, rather than those that will only advance Beijing’s goals. A notable demonstration of this fact is the contrast with its smaller counterpart, China Southern Power Grid (Southern Grid), which manages power supply to just under 12 percent of China’s territory, all in five southern provinces — notably including industrial powerhouse Guangdong. Despite powerful regional interests in coal-fired power, Southern Grid has demonstrated far greater clean energy ambitions than State Grid, both in terms of scale and in terms of timeline for clean energy substitutions. Perhaps most notably, Southern Grid plans for 60 percent of power generated in its service territory to come from non-fossil sources by 2025, compared to State Grid’s targets of 20 percent by 2025 and 25 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, State Grid has, both directly and indirectly, delayed efforts to decarbonize electricity generation — chiefly because these efforts depend critically on fundamental reforms to the current power market regime, a regime from which State Grid benefits massively. An example of State Grid’s dilatory effects on these reforms: One of the primary objectives of China’s 2002 power reforms was for grid companies to divest assets beyond their core business and provide for a clear assessment of the true costs of power transmission and distribution. In the 20 years since, contra Beijing’s reform agenda, State Grid has leveraged its enormous profits from monopolistic market control to systematically accrue new assets in areas such as real estate, media, and finance, making key elements of the 2002 reforms — including electricity pricing reforms — all but impossible. China’s 2015 power market reforms, meanwhile, aimed to introduce private companies into the electricity sales market as a means to increase competition and efficiency — a reform that would massively benefit renewables. But industry insiders have consistently argued that State Grid subsidiaries continue to enjoy unfair advantages, including exclusive data and capital access, to exclude other players from the market. Where the political importance of Xi’s dual carbon goals has forced compliance by virtually every power and resource company in China, State Grid stands alone in being able to meaningfully slow-walk or otherwise resist more substantive green transformation efforts. Central policymakers themselves maintain the same assessment, as demonstrated by their ongoing — and slow-going — attempts to gain greater control over State Grid since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to its independent nature, State Grid’s overseas expansion has largely been motivated by its economic interests, often buoyed — but generally not driven and rarely constrained — by Beijing’s political goals. State Grid’s primary interest in overseas investment has long stemmed from the fact that China’s relatively rigid electricity pricing system offers far lower returns than those available in countries with liberalized power markets. Multiple analyses in the late 2010s found that State Grid earned double-digit average return on equity (ROE) on foreign assets, which was estimated to be three to five times higher than the ROE on its domestic assets. Meanwhile, demonstrating why State Grid is so reticent to financially depend on its core business, in 2020 the company reportedly lost as much as $1.67 billion on its core domestic operations — but it still saw a nearly $193 million profit thanks to the massive profitability of its financial, industrial, and service-sector subsidiaries. State Grid has also historically used international investment to help build economies of scale it could apply in its home market; for example, the company’s strong international presence enabled it to build ultra-high voltage (UHV) power lines abroad, where pricing systems supported such development. This helped to drive down costs for its in-house UHV technologies, which it later employed in domestic projects once costs were sufficiently manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the political front, State Grid’s successful overseas investments have allowed it to portray itself as a world-class investor, grid operator, and international standard-setter. This reputation — particularly as Beijing promotes the “Going Out” strategy to encourage outbound investment and Chinese-led standard setting — has helped to significantly strengthen State Grid’s domestic bargaining position, both with other companies and with the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the government’s vantage point, State Grid remains — despite its outsized independent power — a highly valuable asset in promoting the state’s strategic interests. Most notable among these strategic interests is State Grid’s ability — and aligned goals — to promote international grid interconnections with Chinese firms and technologies, playing a central role in their construction and operation. Promoting Chinese involvement in global grid infrastructure directly aligns with Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as Beijing’s “Going Out” strategy — and aligns just as well with State Grid’s commercial aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-international-electricity-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s International Electricity Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, China’s grid development vision is largely encapsulated in Xi’s Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) initiative (全球能源互联网), first introduced to the United Nations in 2015. The GEI initiative aims to promote interconnection of the world’s power grids in multiple continents and to invest in clean energy supplies and energy efficiency. State Grid is closely connected to this initiative: from the GEI initiative, the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) was born — an organization that partners with the United Nations and other companies to promote the GEI initiative. State Grid itself is a lead sponsor of GEIDCO, and the organization’s chairman is former State Grid CEO Liu Zhenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting electric grids creates operational advantages and serves as an avenue for political power projection. A cross-border transmission line between different national or regional grids — an interconnector — can enhance electricity reliability and support a greener grid. In the continental United States, for example, many energy analysts advocate for interconnecting the three different grid regions across the country (currently, the western states, eastern states, and Texas are disconnected from each other). Though hardly a mainstream political issue, calls for grid interconnection are being amplified by the increased prevalence of extreme climate events; risks of severe blackouts, such as the February 2021 outages following winter storm Uri in Texas, can be mitigated by more robust grid interconnections, which provide backup sources of power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the interconnector debate is focused on increasing international interconnections as a key route to achieving energy and climate goals, and the European Union has set a target of 15 percent grid interconnection by 2030. Larger grids mitigate issues for intermittent renewables like wind and solar; if the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing in one part of the grid, other power sources can compensate. Given that electricity, unlike oil or gas, can travel through interconnectors almost instantaneously, larger grid connections provide more flexibility in dealing with supply issues and can create more efficiency in power distribution. Politically, connecting grid communities across nations can also build cross-border solidarity and help promote social and economic benefits. One of the key interconnectors discussed in this report seeks to connect Cyprus to the EU grid, promoting both integration with other EU countries and reliability of power on the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interconnecting grids also involves technical and political risks. International and interregional transmission lines, if damaged, can cause far-reaching disruptions. Related critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and telecommunications, can be brought down, giving significant political leverage to countries that have ownership over interconnectors. Given the critical role of power grids, integration in international grid projects is an avenue for a country like China to both expand economic ties and increase the strength of its position in dealing with other states. Along with Beijing’s promotion of international electricity infrastructure projects, China is also playing a central role in setting global electricity standards and has become the manufacturing base for key components in large-scale electricity transmission systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2022, State Grid holds stakes in companies in Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Oman, the Philippines, Australia, Singapore, Chile, Brazil, and Greece, and has invested in projects in nearly 40 countries (see Figure 1). State Grid has also expanded to include 20 representative and subsidiary overseas offices, including State Grid Europe, Ltd., the vehicle for the company’s engagement with Greece. The dual corporate and government strategy of promoting grid integration and interconnection, evident in State Grid’s efforts to expand around the globe, provides the backdrop for the company’s pursuit of engagement in the Greek electricity sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background of State Grid’s size, China’s international electricity strategy, and a baseline of deepening Sino-Greek ties is important context for viewing State Grid’s engagement in Greece. Even before the company gained a stake in Greece’s grid operator, a CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese actors was already deepening bilateral relations and promoting global energy interconnection, including COSCO, GEIDCO, and Chinese officials. State Grid’s remarkable size and influence within the Chinese political system later made the company a central player in the CCP Inc. ecosystem’s engagement with Greece’s energy sector, starting with its investment in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-grids-interests-in-greeces-power-sector&quot;&gt;State Grid’s Interests in Greece’s Power Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the power sector, a combination of Greece’s willingness to welcome Chinese shareholders and its position at the center of emerging European and Euro-Asian grid interconnectors provided more than ample reason for State Grid to explore potential investment opportunities. This exploration was given clear motive by the fact that State Grid’s profits in mainland China are tightly bound by regulations aiming to minimize electricity cost pass-throughs to end users, while profits in liberalized European markets would be sizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Greek islands also offer favorable environments for renewable energy generation through both solar and wind power, two industries in which private Chinese companies have significant advantages and interests in expanding overseas. The fact that the power grid for these islands is connected to themainland and the rest of Europe means that Chinese renewable energy investments will contribute to the European Union’s green goals, making it unlikely that they would become stranded assets once built — unlike investments in, say, coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece, like Portugal and Italy before it, was politically receptive to State Grid’s investment during a time of financial need. However, not all European countries were as willing to offer Chinese SOEs such direct inroads to enter their power grids. In Germany, for example, State Grid attempted to buy a 20 percent stake in regional transmission system operator 50Hertz in 2018, which elicited a rare intervention by the German government to prevent the sale due to concerns over Chinese control of key technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2016, State Grid beat out European competitors to purchase a minority stake in ADMIE, the Greek electric grid operator. State Grid secured a 24 percent stake in ADMIE and installed its own management team in the company, giving the SOE its first major foothold in Greece. ADMIE, in turn, soon gained access to needed financing through new deals with Chinese policy banks. State Grid has since attempted to further expand its role in the Greek electric grid — not under direct state guidance, but by and large for its own commercial interests, which it justifies at home by demonstrating alignment with broader state economic goals. However, State Grid later faced pushback in Greece over concerns about conflicts of interest and the company’s close ties to the Chinese government, underlining how scale and CCP Inc. connections can also constrain international expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-grids-entrance-to-greece-via-admie&quot;&gt;State Grid’s Entrance to Greece via ADMIE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was enabled both by its own vast resources and by its existing footprint in Europe. In October 2017, State Grid finalized its takeover of a minority stake in ADMIE for €320 million ($361.6 million). That sum, then the second-largest Chinese investment in Greece, reflected State Grid’s deep pockets and willingness to spend large sums on international projects. In a previous tender or a 66 percent stake in ADMIE — before Greek authorities lowered the stake offered to 24 percent — Greek media reported that State Grid was willing to pay well over €600 million ($796.8 million), while itsmain European competitor, Terna, could only bid around €300 million ($398.4 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing with State Grid for stakes in ADMIE was not the first time that Terna had encountered the Chinese SOE. State Grid’s bid in ADMIE came shortly after obtaining 25 percent of REN, a Portuguese grid operator, and 35 percent of CDP Reti, an Italian holding company with shares in two Italian energy companies, Snam and Terna. Greece was the next step in State Grid’s objective to build out a Mediterranean power network — and State Grid’s existing footprint in Europe also directly impacted its bid for a stake in ADMIE; the Chinese SOE only qualified for the bid in the first place because of its existing stake in European companies, a prerequisite for bidding, according to EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE reflected both the strengths of its regional corporate strategy and its alignment with Chinese state interests. At the time, its other investments in Europe opened doors for State Grid by allowing it to qualify for the ADMIE bid. Broader Chinese interests also helped secure the agreement. Ahead of the ADMIE investment, Greek newspapers reported that during one of Greek prime minister Alexis Tspiras’s visits to China, Chinese contacts had expressed interest in working with Greece to develop its renewable energy and to invest in Greece’s efforts at interconnecting the island’s power to the mainland’s power grid. During the same meeting, these unspecified “Chinese contacts” — unconfirmed but highly likely to have included State Grid representatives — also expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in Public Power Corporation (PPC), the Greek SOE charged with energy distribution and the 100 percent owner of ADMIE before State Grid’s investment.33 On top of this context of broader Chinese engagement, State Grid’s ability to so significantly outbid its rivals would have made it politically and financially all but impossible for ADMIE and the Greek government to turn down State Grid’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YbdLMGt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

Note: The arrow marking State Grid’s expression of interest in PPC is based on the assumption that State Grid was the “Chinese contact” discussed in a Greek media report about the matter, which is unconfirmed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a minority stakeholder, State Grid has been actively involved in ADMIE’s affairs. In addition to gaining seats on the ADMIE board of directors, State Grid has installed its own personnel in several key managerial positions, including a vice CEO and CFO. Through this arrangement, State Grid can participate in the daily operations of ADMIE, especially those pertaining to technology innovation and power grid development. The terms of its original purchase also gave State Grid the right of first offer for ADMIE’s future share offerings, prompting some suspicion by Greek media that State Grid’s minority stake was just a precursor to the company’s fuller control of ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was followed by a cascade of Chinese policy banks engaging with ADMIE and the broader Greek energy sector, underlining the connection between SOE deals and access to Chinese state-backed financing. In November 2017, ADMIE and China Development Bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the aim of giving “access to new financing lines” as part of the 2017–2019 Greece-China Action Plan. In May 2018, ADMIE signed a €199 million ($235.0 million) loan contract with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China, offering unspecified financing for ADMIE over a five-year period. Manousos Manousakis, chairman and CEO of ADMIE, described the 2018 loan as“a clear example of the benefits resulting from the presence of State Grid Corporation of China as a strategic investor in ADMIE [that] leads to an acceleration of big projects such as the interconnections of the Cyclades islands and Crete.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2020, several national Greek banks joined the China Development Bank to issue a €400 million ($456 million) loan to ADMIE. ADMIE highlighted the loan as the first example of cooperation between Greek and Chinese financial institutions in the Greek market. Along with State Grid’s willingness to offer a higher tender for a stake in ADMIE compared to European competitors, the succession of ADMIE deals with Chinese banks represents a benefit of accepting State Grid’s bid to become a shareholder. Without access to inside information, it is often impossible to verify whether access to policy bank financing is explicitly promised or offered in major deals with Chinese companies. Whether or not access to policy bank financing was part of the State Grid-ADMIE deal, ADMIE’s subsequent access to financing is a latent advantage of dealing with companies in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. International companies and governments, observing a pattern of business deals being followed by increased access to Chinese banks, may well bake in expectations of future access to financing when choosing their preferred partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage of State Grid’s involvement in Greece — namely, its successful acquisition of a stake in ADMIE — demonstrates multiple key benefits of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. First, State Grid built its market entry on a foundation of deepening bilateral ties and the flagship COSCO investment in Piraeus, expanding its corporate footprint in line with the broader trend of deepening Sino-Greek economic relations. Second, State Grid’s massive — and directly state-enabled — scale allowed the company to open further doors with existing European connections (via investments in Portugal and Italy), while its massive capital pool — which would be inconceivable for a company without its degree of domestic government support — enabled it to outbid erstwhile competitors. Finally, the support of other Chinese market players also helped facilitate State Grid’s acquisition. This support included the political connections that gave State Grid a platform to speak with a visiting Greek prime minister and the policy banks that opened financing for ADMIE after its deal with State Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, State Grid did not achieve all of its goals in Greece. In particular, the company was shut out of cross-Mediterranean interconnector projects and has not succeeded in increasing its shares in ADMIE. However, buoyed by CCP Inc., State Grid succeeded in its core goal of building itself a secure foothold in Greece’s electricity sector — and a foundation from which to pursue further European expansion. Moreover, that success has since fed back into the CCP Inc. ecosystem: following State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, other Chinese companies have also initiated major investments in the Greek energy sector. The next section will examine these other Chinese business developments in Greece’s energy sector, which — while not officially tied to State Grid — demonstrate how CCP Inc. has successfully broadened the scope of China’s energy engagement in Greece to a degree unlikely to have been possible without the network advantages of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broader-chinese-investments-in-the-greek-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Broader Chinese Investments in the Greek Energy Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. ecosystem extends beyond the relations of a single SOE to Chinese banks, policy initiatives, and diplomatic officials; a key element of CCP Inc. is the interconnectivity between Chinese firms, including those that are state-owned, those that are privately owned, and those that have “mixed ownership,” with both private and state capital. In the case of Greece’s energy industry, a number of other Chinese companies have invested in the sector, drawing on some of the same advantages of the CCP Inc. ecosystem evident in State Grid’s dealings with ADMIE. Though these business deals have yet to carry out the promises of initial announcements, the investments still demonstrate how different Chinese companies can benefit from the same CCP Inc. ecosystem, tying state bank financing and diplomatic support to commercial projects. Among the Chinese investments in Greece’s energy sector post-2016, two stand out: China’s first major investments in wind and solar power generation in Greece, which are explored in turn below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken individually, different Chinese investments in electric power generation could be seen as independent investments in a new market, unrelated to State Grid’s role in Greece’s electricity transmission system. Viewing the Greek electricity sector more comprehensively, however, reveals indirect connections between State Grid’s expansion and the energy generation ventures of other Chinese companies. Further, different Chinese business deals can be traced back to the same events in the diplomatic timeline of Sino-Greek engagement. In this context, Chinese companies have become increasingly ingrained in the business of both energy generation and energy transmission in Greece since 2016, even though State Grid has not significantly expanded its own footprint further beyond its 24 percent stake in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wind-power-cooperation-with-copelouzos-group&quot;&gt;Wind Power Cooperation with Copelouzos Group&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2017 — the year after State Grid won the tender for a 24 percent stake in ADMIE — the Chinese state-owned coal and power giant Shenhua Group (中国神华) purchased a 75 percent stake in four wind parks under development by the Greek Copelouzos Group (Copelouzos). The purchase came after Shenhua Group and Copelouzos signed an MoU in May 2017 for cooperation on green projects, involving a total investment of just over $3 billion. The MoU was arrived at during Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s visit to Beijing in May 2017, and the November purchase was settled as one of a number of deals signed between Chinese and Greek officials, as well as heads of major enterprises, under the 2017–2019 Greece-China Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of Shenhua Group’s purchase of the 75 percent stake in Copelouzos wind farms (via its subsidiary, Shenhua Renewables), the group was also planning to purchase further Copelouzos assets — though initial momentum ultimately fell short, similar to the case of State Grid. Shenhua Group had initially planned to join PPC (the state-owned Greek power company from which State Grid purchased its stake in ADMIE) and Copelouzos as a partner in their joint company, PPC Solar Solutions. The partnership of Shenhua Group would have brought a Chinese shareholder into another of PPC’s subsidiaries, alongside State Grid’s role in ADMIE. In September 2017, Shenhua Group signed an MoU with PPC for cooperation in power generation, renewable energy projects, research and development, gas infrastructure, and more. However, media reported in 2020 that PPC Solar Solutions had agreed to terminate its joint venture with Copelouzos. At the time, the venture was still 49 percent owned by PPC and 51 percent owned by Copelouzos, indicating that Shenhua Group had never gained a leadership stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teasing out Shenhua Group’s cooperation with Copelouzos is further complicated by the fact that in November 2017, Shenhua Group merged with the state-owned China Guodian Corporation (中国国电集团) to form a new company: China Energy Investment Corporation (国家能源集团, aka CHN Energy). In 2018, Copelouzos Group again signed a cooperation agreement with CHN Energy, which has taken over the 75 percent stake in four Copelouzos wind farms. Echoing statements around State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, Copelouzos Group president Dimitris Copelouzos stated at the time: “We are confident that this cooperation will act as a catalyst for the completion of major investment and promote the energy industry of Greece, in addition to the development of cooperation between Greek and Chinese companies in many sectors of the economy.” CHN Energy also expressed interest in acquiring lignite coal-fired power plants in Megalopoli in southern Greece and in Meliti in northern Greece; however, the sale ultimately did not go through. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s unexpected announcement in September 2019 that Greece would transition away from coal by 2028 further tamped down Chinese interest in investing in Greek coal mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developments of Shenhua Group’s — and then CHN Energy’s — collaboration with the Copelouzos Group provide additional data points in the larger story of Sino-Greek energy cooperation. Viewed as part of the same CCP Inc. ecosystem as State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, the business deals demonstrate a trend of broadening Chinese involvement in the Greek electric grid. However, Shenhua Group and CHN Energy’s cooperation with Copelouzos Group also featured more promises and statements of intent than actual concrete projects — another trend across recent Sino-Greek energy ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-first-greenfield-investment-in-greek-solar-power-the-minos-plant&quot;&gt;China’s First “Greenfield” Investment in Greek Solar Power: The MINOS Plant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further data points for the trend of expanding engagement in the energy sector can be found in China’s efforts to build solar power facilities in Greece, along with further instances of business agreements that have yet to translate into complete projects. In 2019, on the heels of Shenhua Group’s investment in Greek wind energy, several Chinese companies — including state-owned bank ICBC — undertook the financing, design, and construction of Greece’s first concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, the MINOS 50 MW plant on the island of Crete. The MINOS solar plant marked the first “greenfield” project undertaken by Chinese companies in Greece and was hailed by Chinese media as a model for the integration of finance and industry in China’s international investments. Cosin Solar (可胜技术), one of the Chinese companies contracted for the project, described MINOS as “the first CSP project whose whole life cycle is totally designed, manufactured, constructed, financed, and operated by Chinese companies in the international market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant is, in fact, a joint venture between UK-based Nur Energie and Greek oil and energy firm Motor Oil Hellas, with Greek firm Prenecon taking part in construction. However, a consortium of Chinese companies, led by China Energy Engineering Group (中国能建葛洲坝国际集团) and Cosin Solar, were selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractors for the project, while ICBC provided project financing. This consortium includes a mix of both state-owned firms (like China Energy Engineering Group) and privately owned firms (like Cosin Solar). In terms of political promotion, the MINOS solar plant was given prime billing, both as a result of the 17+1 China- Eastern Europe cooperation framework and as a model BRI project. In the highest possible sign of diplomatic support, the chairmen of ICBC, China Energy Engineering Group, Nur Energie, and the CEO of Prenecon signed the MINOS agreement in front of Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Mitsotakis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trend-of-diplomatic-support-for-chinese-projects-in-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;The Trend of Diplomatic Support for Chinese Projects in CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHN Energy’s wind power deals and the MINOS solar project, though yet to be completed, demonstrate several key elements of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The interplay of financing by state banks, the collaboration between public and private Chinese companies, and the provision of diplomatic support for the project all represent conduits of state support. In particular, the element of diplomatic support for specific industrial projects is prominent in Sino-Greek business relations, as outlined in Figure 3. The strong diplomatic attention to business deals is an important element of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, and often the most visible testament to state support for commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wMdlAAu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to CHN Energy-Copelouzos wind cooperation and the MINOS solar plant, a number of other Chinese companies have engaged in energy sector projects or cooperation agreements, including China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), CMEC subsidiary SUMEC Group, and China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG). Though these deals were not all tied directly to State Grid, they are important data points for understanding successes — and shortfalls — of overall engagement by Chinese companies in the Greek energy sector. The depth and breadth of Chinese companies’ engagement with Greece’s grid has risen significantly over the past decade with aid from the CCP Inc. ecosystem’s combination of state financing, diplomatic advocacy, and connectivity between Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Chinese investment in the Greek energy sector has also hit numerous stumbling blocks. Shenhua Group’s cooperation with the Copelouzos Group resulted in an important wind energy investment but has yet to live up to promises of broader joint projects, and a number of other deals involving Chinese companies in the Greek energy sector have failed to move forward. State Grid, too, has faced difficulties in expanding its role in Greece beyond its initial investment in ADMIE. These challenges illuminate how the CCP Inc. ecosystem can also generate constraints for the firms within it. The connections between diplomatic support, state financing, and SOEs and private Chinese companies evident in the Greek energy sector may have supported the projects’ development, but they also reinforced perceptions of disparate deals as interconnected and closely tied to the Chinese state. The third chapter of this report reflects on how these interrelated strengths and liabilities of CCP Inc. have impacted State Grid’s efforts to expand its footprint beyond its initial investment in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strengths-and-constraints-of-soes-in-the-ccp-inc-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The Strengths and Constraints of SOEs in the CCP Inc. Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;examining-soes-as-policymaking-actors-in-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Examining SOEs as Policymaking Actors in CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xi Jinping era has seen the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) increase its reach into the private sector, blurring lines between privately owned and state-owned companies; meanwhile, the CCP has also endeavored to tighten its control over SOEs (an effort State Grid continues to resist). On the other side of the equation, efforts by State Grid and other Chinese SOEs to gain footholds in the Greek electric grid underline the leading role that SOEs continue to play in China’s economic statecraft. Notably, China’s SOEs have been growing stronger over time thanks to a decades-long trend of consolidation, which has seen major Chinese SOEs merged into even more massive conglomerates — one such case being the merger of Shenhua Group and the Guodian Corporation, noted in Chapter 2. The result has been that China’s surviving SOEs are increasingly stable and well resourced, with the capability to undertake a range of global infrastructure, energy, and technology projects. Unlike either private multinationals that are beholden to shareholders and quarterly results cycles or foreign SOEs that are focused on national service provision (e.g., Amtrak), China’s SOEs can bring unparalleled scale to international projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s own involvement in the Greek energy sector reflects both state and commercial interests, shedding valuable insight on the interplay between SOEs and the government in the broader CCP Inc. ecosystem. First, State Grid’s international expansion strongly aligns with the Chinese government’s policy goals — a fact it has used to bolster its own domestic political position. Along with major national initiatives such as the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy, State Grid plays a leading role in carrying out Xi’s GEI initiative. But State Grid is far from merely a vehicle for implementing Beijing’s policies; as noted in Chapter 1, State Grid launched its European strategy in large part to pursue the higher profits offered by international projects. State Grid regularly discusses the profit motives of ensuring “stable income” from international assets in its corporate documents — in addition, of course, to comments on the need to support national foreign policy initiatives like the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its independent strength and ability to push back on certain domestic reform efforts, even State Grid remains subject to important conduits for Chinese state influence. Among the most important is, quite simply, Beijing’s ability to support State Grid’s pursuit of international business — particularly through the likes of diplomatic engagements and state policy bank financing. For such support to materialize, State Grid must play within certain political boundaries and ensure its efforts genuinely support Beijing’s goals. More broadly, Beijing directly incorporates SOEs into its national policy objectives, creating commercial incentives to feed into policymaking in Beijing and try to shape the policy landscape in favorable ways. While much China scholarship has characterized SOEs as politically passive entities under state control, scholars studying the pluralization of political decisionmaking in China advocate for greater attention to, and analysis of, SOEs’ role in policy planning and government decisionmaking. The case of State Grid and other Chinese companies’ entry into the Greek power sector strongly supports the need for more nuanced and detailed understanding of SOE-government feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that point: State Grid has a history of influencing policy debates within China. As outlined in Chapter 1, over the past 20 years, State Grid has expanded its assets contrary to government reform efforts, and over the past decade it has become a major obstacle to government efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the company has also injected its own interests into policy initiatives. For example, within China in 2000–2009, State Grid promoted UHV technology — at the time untested — to solve the policy issue of power shortages. UHV was a solution that made far more sense from a profit-making perspective than a public policy perspective: namely, State Grid could profit from becoming a standard-setter in a cutting-edge technology, though in practice UHV would serve as a distraction — and take finite financing and resources — from critical demand-side reforms that policymakers rightly saw as the most important solution at hand. State Grid pushed its UHV technology through government meetings, company investments, and company-funded research and feasibility studies, ultimately selling the solution to relevant policymakers at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), and the State Environmental Protection Administration (the predecessor of today’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment). Just as State Grid promoted its own interests into domestic UHV policy, the firm worked to influence foreign policy efforts in favor of its international interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the strong connection between State Grid and the GEI initiative provides a clear picture of the other side of the policy feedback loop connecting commercial and political incentives. In its own company reports, State Grid is explicit in stating that one of its main goals is to serve the CCP’s political and foreign policy agenda, particularly the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy, as well as to help other Chinese firms establish themselves in the international market. State Grid’s close association with the GEI initiative as the force behind GEIDCO also provides a conduit into a more specified policy initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GEI initiative serves China’s industrial policy both commercially, by promoting specific technologies that would benefit Chinese companies, and diplomatically, by offering an avenue for China to promote its climate leadership. While the GEI initiative provides a policy umbrella for State Grid’s international ventures — along with the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy — State Grid, in turn, plays an important role in promoting the initiative and guiding its specific goals. The GEI initiative, in turn, serves Chinese companies’ commercial interests by driving market interest in certain grid technologies, such as UHV transmission lines. As most of the world’s UHV lines are in China and were constructed by Chinese companies, China holds a key competitive advantage over the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its own words, State Grid states that “in implementing the national “going out” development strategy, [State Grid Corporation of China] has clearly defined the strategic goal of “going out” with UHV technology, and has striven to promote the global application of UHV transmission technology, specifications, and standards.” Given this synergy of commercial and policy interests, both the pursuit of business gains and the pursuit of CCP goals can credibly be called driving forces behind State Grid’s overseas investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was more than just an individual business deal; it built on years of Chinese efforts to make inroads into the Greek market, starting with COSCO’s investment in the port of Piraeus. The completion of the COSCO deal opened doors for State Grid representatives to meet with Greek officials in bilateral diplomatic events and allowed ADMIE to access Chinese bank financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the headwinds facing State Grid’s role in ADMIE illuminate how the SOE’s involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem also served as a constraint. The same connections to diplomatic support, financing, and other Chinese companies that advance Chinese business interests in the CCP Inc. ecosystem also reinforce overseas perceptions that all Chinese companies — even private ones — are tightly connected with each other and, most importantly, with the Chinese government. This, in turn, has at times piqued suspicions that Chinese companies’ business activities are simply extensions of political activities — catalyzing pushback against Chinese market actors and the projects they pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constraints-in-ccp-inc-state-grids-challenges-in-expanding-its-footprint-in-greece&quot;&gt;Constraints in CCP Inc.: State Grid’s Challenges in Expanding Its Footprint in Greece&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s acquisition of stakes in ADMIE, and ADMIE’s subsequent access to Chinese bank financing, initially indicated momentum for State Grid’s ambitions to expand its role in Greece’s electric grid. But over the longer term, ADMIE’s relationship with its minority shareholder became more complicated. While State Grid’s initial interest in ADMIE demonstrated a broader vision for investments in grid interconnectors and renewable energy, its ability to execute this vision has run up against Greek pushback to Chinese investments and conflict of interest concerns. Most notably, since 2017, State Grid has sought unsuccessfully to expand its share in ADMIE; been thwarted in efforts to gain additional stakes in ADMIE-related subsidiary companies; and ultimately lodged protests against ADMIE over the tenure of its current CEO. While the CCP Inc. ecosystem helped State Grid enter the Greek power market, it has since constrained its ability to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qqDJlHa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: PPC, ADMIE, and Their Subsidiaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout the report. The label for the PPC-HEDNO relationship is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/11/hedno/&quot;&gt;Philip Chrysopoulos, “Greece Sells 49% of Public Power Corporation HEDNO to Australian Company,” Greek Reporter, September 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Xi’s November 2019 visit to Greece, State Grid directly expressed interest in expanding the company’s stake in ADMIE. In 2020, however, the Covid-19 pandemic stalled talks between Beijing and Athens, and in the two years since, no sale of additional shares has been completed. In January 2021, Greece barred State Grid from participating in the prospective sale of a 49 percent stake in the Greek distribution network operator HEDNO (Greek: DEDDIE), another subsidiary of ADMIE parent company PPC, due to concerns over conflict of interest — concerns driven by the perception that connections between Chinese entities (the other party being undisclosed) were too strong, which prompted State Grid to lodge a formal complaint. In an instance of CCP Inc. connectivity backfiring on Chinese companies, another undisclosed Chinese company was also barred from participating in the HEDNO tender, an episode that European researchers have described as “precedent” for Chinese SOEs being treated as connected rather than separate entities. The perception of interconnection will remain a structural risk for Chinese companies’ investments abroad — particularly where these connections are perceived as posing not only market risks, but also political risks due to connections with, and influence by, the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, State Grid technically remains in contention to gain a stake in the ADMIE subsidiary Ariadne Interconnector, which is responsible for connecting the island of Crete to the grid of mainland Greece. The tender process has dragged on for years, ever since State Grid first expressed interest in the Ariadne Interconnector during Xi’s visit to Greece in November 2019. State Grid’s ability to participate in the Ariadne Interconnector so far is particularly significant due to the project’s links to the broader EuroAsia Interconnector, a planned linkage of Greece to the grids of Cyprus and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Greek media reporting ahead of the State Grid-ADMIE deal, an important aspect of State Grid’s interest in ADMIE ties to Greece’s planned position in new electric interconnector lines that would link international electric grids. The European Union has long worked toward improving cross-border electricity connection for a more secure, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply, and Greece itself has plans to connect the power grids across its islands. In 2017, State Grid had expressed its support for the EuroAsia Interconnector, a major electricity interconnector between Israel, Cyprus, Greece, and Europe — labeled an “electricity highway” — connecting the three countries’ grids. The project is aimed at remedying the isolation of Cyprus’s grid from the rest of the European Union, bolstering energy security for all three nations and as well as Europe’s ability to support a green grid, as discussed in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pxG6jyC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Proposed Route of the EuroAsia Interconnector.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://euroasia-interconnector.com/&quot;&gt;EuroAsia Interconnector homepage&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ariadne-interconnection.gr/en#exelixi&quot;&gt;Ariadne Interconnection homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, State Grid’s interest in the EuroAsia Interconnector has not still translated into a significant role in the project. In 2018, the section of the interconnector that ADMIE was involved in was ultimately spun off into a national project, the Ariadne Interconnector. The Ariadne Interconnector will connect the large island of Crete to mainland Greece and Europe in order to avert electricity shortages on Crete and take advantage of Crete’s favorable environment for renewable power sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though State Grid expressed interest as far back as 2019 in acquiring up to 20 percent of shares in Ariadne (a 100 percent subsidiary of ADMIE), at the time of this report‘s publication, the deal has yet to go through. In June 2022, the European Commission and the Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) approved the tender for the sale of a stake in Ariadne, after years of delays because State Grid’s involvement with ADMIE required Greece’s energy regulator to turn to the European Commission for a green light. Some media reports on the matter have described concerns from the European Commission about further Chinese involvement in strategic assets, but the full details behind the delays have not been publicly explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another instance of tension between State Grid and ADMIE, in February 2022, the tenure of the current president and managing director of ADMIE, Manousos Manousakis, was renewed, despite protests by State Grid. According to Greek media reports, State Grid’s complaints stem from displeasure with its lack of participation in Ariadne’s contractor agreements and the technical side of the project. The issue was even reportedly the subject of discussion during an April 2022 meeting between Chinese ambassador Xiao Juncheng and Greece’s minister of energy, Kostas Skekras. The Ariadne Interconnector is the largest electricity project that Greece has taken on; these reports suggest State Grid is dissatisfied with its small role in the project. However, given that media reports cite EU concerns about China’s control over Greece’s electric grid as one reason that Ariadne was spun off from the EuroAsia Interconnector in the first place, State Grid’s efforts to increase its control over the project could well prove counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reflection on CCP Inc. in Greece’s energy sector suggests that the source of the ecosystem’s strengths — namely, its interconnectedness — is also the source of considerable long-term risks and potential liabilities for its constituent enterprises. State Grid’s ties to the Chinese state and its prominent role within the CCP Inc. ecosystem make it subject to suspicions directed at the Chinese state capitalist apparatus more broadly. Wherever international perceptions of and policies toward the Chinese state continue to sour, it will become increasingly difficult for Chinese companies to balance the strengths and liabilities of their involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem — in which, at this stage, they have little choice but to be perceived as participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of Chinese companies’ involvement in the Greek energy sector underscores both the strengths and limitations of the CCP Inc. system. The case of Chinese investment into Greece’s energy sector, as well as COSCO’s preceding investments in Piraeus, shows how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has both supported and hindered the foreign business ventures of private, hybrid, and state-controlled Chinese companies. The specific case of State Grid provides insight into a critical type of actor in the CCP Inc. ecosystem: namely, a major SOE that both implements and informs policy, and thereby a key player in Chinese state capitalism’s ability to exercise global reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the greatest strengths of CCP Inc. is the capacity for state support to overcome geopolitical barriers that private firms would be hard-pressed to hurdle alone. From former prime minister Alexis Tpiras’s meetings with State Grid officials during visits to Beijing, to Xi Jinping’s flagship 2019 Greece visit, diplomatic support for Chinese commercial projects in Greece has been strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great strength of CCP Inc. is its capacity to leverage public funding for ventures that might struggle using private funding alone — and, at times, to open public funding opportunities that simply would not otherwise exist. For example, ADMIE’s ability to access Chinese policy bank financing in the wake of State Grid’s investment underlined the interplay between Chinese state financiers and enterprises. This advantage is also not mutually exclusive with other advantages, such as diplomatic support: as explored in Chapter 2, many Chinese companies — both state-owned and private — simultaneously benefited from diplomatic support, bank financing, and their connections with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for State Grid itself, the company’s original capacity to win a stake in ADMIE was enabled by both its existing footprint in Europe and its deep pockets, bolstered by access to cheap government policy bank funding. As a massive and complex SOE, State Grid can both draw on the support of the Chinese state and simultaneously lobby to embed its own commercial interests in official policy. The company’s own corporate strategy underlines that it is an enterprise with global ambitions and — with the backing of CCP Inc. — the state-empowered scale to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the case of the Greek energy sector also reveals constraints on State Grid and other CCP Inc. actors. Misgivings about Chinese control over critical electricity infrastructure ultimately limited State Grid’s ability to embed itself in critical international electricity interconnectors. In other words, the very same strong state support that helped propel State Grid’s initial investment in ADMIE, as well as the many other Chinese investments in the Greek energy sector, became a liability by making commercial Chinese actors difficult to distinguish, politically, from the Chinese state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key mission of the CCP Inc. project is to examine how the United States and market economy allies can effectively respond to new challenges posed by China’s evolving state capitalist system. The case of Greece — a market economy with a democratic system — provides insight into how concerns over the risks of CCP Inc. can limit its reach. European misgivings about China’s role in critical electricity infrastructure appear to have played a key role in preventing State Grid from expanding its stake in ADMIE and gaining involvement in the EuroAsia Interconnector, though neither Greek officials nor corporate documents state it so directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Greece’s energy sector was able to genuinely benefit from Chinese investments in renewable energy at a time of national financial difficulty. China’s leading position in renewable energy technologies puts it in a position to play a key role in proliferating much-needed clean energy infrastructure. As countries around the world pursue a transition to clean energy, both the CCP Inc. ecosystem and the comparative advantages of Chinese firms in various clean energy technologies put China in a highly competitive market position. Understanding how actors within the CCP Inc. ecosystem interact and play off of — and into — Chinese government policy will be critical for countries that turn to China for the technology and infrastructure necessary for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

A series of recent polls suggests that the war has actually increased the Ukrainian people’s trust in their local and national government and largely want the international community to empower them and their government to rebuild their shattered country rather than to do it for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine confronted the Russian invasion on an already-weak footing. Economic challenges exacerbated by COVID held Ukrainians’ attention more than the Russian occupation of Crimea and Donbas or even the threat of Russian invasion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/July%202021%20_bi-annual%20survey%20-%20public.pdf&quot;&gt;a July-August 2021 National Democratic Institute poll&lt;/a&gt;. Respondents had somewhat more trust in local government than in national government and its agencies, but little confidence in any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A September 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/ukraine-resilience-monitor&quot;&gt;Ipsos survey shows&lt;/a&gt; some of the ways in which Ukrainians have suffered from the invasion. Unemployment has risen across the country and especially in frontline cities. Ukrainians who have not been displaced have suffered significant income loss. Residents of cities at or near the frontlines suffer from serious degradation of essential services, including access to safe drinking water, hot water, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N774fre.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Employment has plummeted in frontline cities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;▲ Frontline cities have experienced the sharpest job loss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ukraine has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a Russian attack that has deliberately targeted economic and infrastructure facilities throughout the country and not only near the front lines. The Ipsos poll shows that the majority of employed Ukrainians in major unoccupied cities surveyed are still receiving their salaries on time and, for those that are delayed, the delays are usually less than two weeks. These data suggest that Ukrainians have managed to maintain a largely functional economic and financial system despite their pre-war challenges and the ravages of a brutal invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SOgpefN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Most of Mykolaiv’s residence don’t have access to safe drinking water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also managed to avoid nationalizing or seriously unbalancing its economy even as it has mobilized for war. Nearly 65% of employed respondents work in private enterprises, with 48% either self-employed or employed at small or medium-sized businesses. The survey naturally does not capture the proportion of Ukrainians currently serving with the armed forces, but the results clearly show that a private economy providing normal services continues to operate despite the horror of war and the rigors of mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians are also finding ways to keep essential services functional in key frontline cities despite constant Russian attacks. Over 99% of respondents had access to electricity, including 100% in Kharkiv. Fewer than 7% had lost access to gas. Over 90% had internet access and over 98% had mobile phone service. Over 80% of residents of Lviv, Kyiv, Dnipro, and Kharkiv reported that they had access to safe drinking water, although only 26% of Mykolayiv inhabitants said the same. The figure for Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is remarkable. Russian forces remained within artillery range of Kharkiv until September and have constantly attacked it with artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket systems, and long-range precision munitions since February. Russian attacks regularly damage key infrastructure nodes especially in frontline cities, but Ukrainians are managing to repair and keep their systems operating remarkably well despite these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vi0H9Vx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Whether they are on the frontlines or in the rear cities, most people are getting their salaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bYGVXAk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;If people do experience a delay in their salary, it mostly comes within a week or two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important and promising fact emerging from this survey is that Ukrainians are doing this. The international aid and donor communities are providing aid now and studying Ukraine’s needs in preparation to help with post-war reconstruction but have not taken over operation or repair of major infrastructure. Ukrainians are doing that for the most part by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians expect to keep doing it themselves, moreover, empowered by the international community but not replaced by it. Asked whether their own local or national government, their own civil society, or international organizations should be responsible for reconstruction large majorities preferred Ukrainian local or national government. That finding is remarkable considering the apparently waning trust in governmental institutions that had characterized pre-war Ukraine. It suggests that Ukrainians want to rebuild a self-sufficient functioning state and do not want to become wards of the international community. It suggests that they want to believe that their government can serve them despite its present and historical challenges and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s challenges remain immense and must be confronted with clear eyes and no illusions. The indications that Ukrainians want their government to work do not mean that it can or will, or even that they think it will. Unemployment remains far too high, and Ukraine will require large infusions of cash and reconstruction aid in the coming months and years to rebuild what the Russians have destroyed. Success is by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is reason for hope in a very dark time. Ukrainians have fought the Russian army and are driving it back with Western weapons and cash, but no Western soldiers. They are keeping their economy alive with Western money but their own expertise and ingenuity. Ukraine has shown in this terrible trial by fire its determination to make itself free and functional. That is an effort worth investing in.&lt;/p&gt;

The resulting range of scenarios point toward an urgent need to develop new escalation management frameworks supporting the new integrated deterrence strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-the-future---&quot;&gt;In the future . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be a new escalation ladder more oriented to air, maritime, cyber, and space dynamics than the Cold War confrontations. Beijing will seek alternatives to full-scale invasion to compel Taiwan that involve a calibrated mix of threats and limited military operations to pressure the island and deter foreign involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An isolated China will not necessarily be a more peaceful China. Even if Taiwan and its international partners can avoid a major war, the result will likely be major economic dislocation as well as new escalation risks and policy dilemmas associated with supporting Taipei without triggering a regional conflict. Businesses and governments will hedge against losses, creating sustained price pressures and a decoupling of Western firms from the Chinese market. Understanding these risks requires an entirely new type of crisis simulation integrated with multitrack diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military pressure absent dialogue could prove to be a recipe for disaster. The United States can help the world avoid a major war in Taiwan by highlighting different escalation risks and working with a broad coalition of actors — including the private sector and Chinese government — to explore different scenarios and create a new escalation management framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of war in East Asia has reached a fever pitch. The August 2022 visit by U.S. speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and two separate congressional delegations in May and August 2022 capped a year that has seen an increase in large, complex Chinese military exercises. These exercises continue to demonstrate China’s ability to isolate Taiwan and set the conditions for larger military operations. The use of military force to signal adversaries is consistent with Chinese writings on war control, strategic deterrence, and creating a war atmosphere as part of crisis bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale exercises are not a precursor to war but an effort to coerce while setting conditions for future response options. In fact, Chinese writing on strategic deterrence states that “through exercises, we can demonstrate our military’s combat capabilities to the opponent, but also cause the opponent to doubt our intentions, cause psychological panic and produce a deterrent effect.” At a higher escalation level, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) calls for “restrictive military operations” that use “forcible control measures in a certain area to squeeze the opponent’s operating space and restrict opponents’ movement” through the use of exclusion areas and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of the On Future War series uses historical case studies of militarized crises to extrapolate alternative future scenarios concerning Taiwan. The scenarios illustrate a menu of coercive options short of a major war that China could employ over the next 10 years. Each possible future in turn maps the escalation dynamics and dilemmas national security leaders in Beijing, Taipei, Washington, and corporate boardrooms may confront.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because no one can see the future, we invite readers to a broader dialogue about the prospects for future crises in the Taiwan Strait. Each scenario allows readers to anonymously respond via a short survey. Tell us about the inherent escalation risks, the probability of the crisis scenario, or alternatives you see on the horizon. Based on the results, the On Future War team at CSIS will develop a wargame and invite respondents to participate.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in this light, China is not planning an immediate invasion of Taiwan. Rather, the PLA is refining its ability to coerce and compel Taipei’s political leadership while testing international resolve, a strategy consistent with what Thomas Schelling called the diplomacy of violence. Chinese strategy writing even calls for “leading a crisis” and “taking advantage of seizing the opportunities and conditions created by the crisis situation, making the best of the situation, taking advantage of the situation, and solving problems that are difficult to solve and break through under normal circumstances.” U.S., allied, and partner strategy in East Asia should therefore expand from a narrow focus on war planning to developing flexible response options to counter the wider menu of coercive options Beijing could opt for after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, scheduled for October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on the worst-case scenario (i.e., the most dangerous course of action) is both an organizational reflex built into planning processes and a mechanism to analyze force modernization. The U.S. national security community has increasingly opted to use a Taiwan scenario to test new concepts and prioritize capability investments. These scenarios tend to assume a large-scale conventional invasion, usually short of nuclear use. For example, in October 2021, the Joint Staff tested the new joint warfighting concept against a Taiwan scenario, finding that the United States struggled to establish information dominance and that traditional approaches to receipt, staging, and onward integration made air and naval forces deploying into theater vulnerable to attack. In 2020 and 2021, U.S. Air Force capability integration games showed that autonomous drone swarms and fielding a distributed targeting system, similar to how Uber uses GPS technology to locate and assign drivers to customers, were key to denying PLA objectives. These findings are consistent with the mosaic warfare concept and show a national security community actively experimenting and using wargames not just to educate but to explore competing hypotheses about the future of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most games focus on large-scale military operations associated with an amphibious assault of Taiwan, there is a growing effort to look at alternatives. In a 2021 wargame, the Center for a New American Security explored response options in the event China conducted a fait accompli and seized outlying Taiwanese islands (e.g., Pratas and Dongsha) in the South China Sea. Separately, through a series of tabletop exercises focused on Taiwan in early 2022, CSIS explored gray zone options and how they created new escalation risks. Contrary to large-scale invasion games, these efforts explore what Schelling referred to as “salami tactics.” In other studies on gray zone campaigns, this approach is referred to as a gradualist campaign that sacrifices a decisive outcome and escalation risks for a series of interrelated, smaller activities designed to compel the target state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment of On Future War continues this exploration of alternatives to a large-scale invasion and considers the rungs of the escalation ladder China could ascend to compel Taiwan into submission short of a major, protracted war and occupying the island. The study looks back to look ahead and uses historical cases to imagine alternative futures. No single scenario is predictive, but examining many scenarios illustrates tendency and potential. Seeing a range of futures supports strategy, military planning, and operational design as defense officials refine concepts, capabilities, and budgets in an increasingly uncertain and risk-prone security environment. The sections below offer six historical cases that illustrate a coercive option short of full-scale invasion. Each case is consistent with a demonstration scenario design pioneered by Herman Kahn. In each alternative future, the authors extrapolate and describe what a future crisis would look like if Beijing adopted an approach similar to the historical episode. From this vantage point, the research team considers how likely the alternative future is as well as the consequences, key indicators, and critical decisions almost certain to confront leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using historical cases to create a range of alternative future scenarios complements ongoing CSIS efforts to reimagine strategic analysis by combining gaming, foresight, red teaming, and best practices from social science, including empirical and experimental approaches. The security problems on the horizon in the twenty-first century cannot be solved by the thinking that produced them nor outdated methods that focus more on admiring problems than exploring and testing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-one-political-warfare&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario One: Political Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned with China’s “Three Warfares” concept, Beijing could conduct a political warfare campaign against Taiwan optimized for the Information Age similar to U.S. covert action during the 1948 Italian election. The purpose would be to disrupt Taiwan’s democratic system of governance and shape Taiwan public opinion to support the gradual reintegration of Taiwan into China. The principal method would be the use of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare to weaken public confidence in Taiwan’s government as well as key international partners (i.e., the United States and Japan) and coerce Taiwan into adopting a pro-Beijing political stance. The desired condition would be to persuade the Taiwanese public to either support Beijing or dimmish their confidence in their democracy, allowing China to use other forms of national power to reintegrate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;us-political-warfare-in-italian-elections-1948&quot;&gt;U.S. Political Warfare in Italian Elections (1948)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1940s, the United States used overt and covert psychological warfare, economic measures, and political alliances to influence the 1948 Italian parliamentary general election. The technique, defined by George Kennan as “political warfare,” saw the United States leverage a combination of economic, political, and informational initiatives to influence the Italian public to prevent a communist party victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, U.S. operatives sponsored anti-communist movements and political parties to ensure they gained influence over Italian society and won a majority of votes during the 1948 election. The U.S. government supported the political victory of anti-communist politicians by covertly funding the campaign costs of two non-communist parties — the Christian Democracy Party and the Italian Socialist Workers Party. In addition, the United States also covertly financed non-communist labor movements to weaken pro-communist ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, U.S. operatives delegitimized the Italian Communist Party (PCI) by influencing the Italian public through “white” and “black” propaganda campaigns. White propaganda, or overt psychological warfare efforts, included positive messaging of U.S. aid programs to the Italian public, the use of American media to promote anti-communist messaging (e.g., Voice of America and radio broadcasts involving celebrities), and diplomatic messaging from the U.S. embassy. Black propaganda, or covert psychological warfare efforts, aimed to secretly discredit the PCI and involved the United States enabling local actors, such as Luigi Gedda’s Civic Committees, to create and spread anti-communist messaging. Later codified in a 1951 psychological warfare campaign plan, these efforts focused on destroying the respectability of the PCI, compromising communists in public office, discrediting communist resistance efforts in World War II, and publicizing scandals of communist party leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These combined lines of effort helped the Christian Democracy Party gain 48.5 percent of the vote in the election and led to a worse than expected showing by the PCI. To capitalize on this success, the United States expanded its psychological warfare operations and funded anti-communist organizations. It also worked through the Italian government to implement a campaign of legislative and administrative harassment (i.e., legal warfare) designed to discriminate against communist individuals and groups and promote divisions within the PCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-chinese-political-warfare-campaign-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Chinese “Political Warfare” Campaign Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. Following the rise of tensions after the fourth Taiwan Strait crisis, senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials covertly sanction a campaign to undermine the upcoming Taiwan presidential and legislative elections and influence the Taiwanese people to support reintegration by 2049. This consists of two strategic initiatives: black propaganda and public opinion warfare. With only months before the election, political divisions within Taiwan over the issue of statehood have reached a boiling point, with protests turning into violent confrontations in Taipei. Following the latest protest, involving over 100,000 people, a U.S. cybersecurity company releases a report stating that it has identified over 300,000 inauthentic Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok posts that specifically targeted Taiwan. The company concludes that PLA Unit 61716 had engaged in a multiyear black propaganda campaign to discredit political parties and politicians who support Taiwan’s statehood. This campaign is seen as the origin of political tensions prior to the election. Following this report, international media outlets are reporting on a massive leak of classified U.S. documents following a cyberattack against the U.S. Department of Defense. Among the largely falsified documents appear to be classified briefings between bipartisan members of the executive and legislative branches stating that the United States has no intention of supporting Taiwan in armed conflict with China and will use Taiwan as a “bargaining chip” to prevent a regional war. Although only a small fraction of the documents are deemed to be authentic, the claim that the United States would abandon Taiwan is immediately disputed by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months prior to the election, the U.S. intelligence community declassifies an intelligence finding outlining how the CCP has covertly sent campaign donations through third-party donors to political parties who support unification. This includes nonprofit organizations and think tanks to recruit respected regional and Taiwanese political and military leaders to publicly promote or privately lobby for Taiwan’s reintegration with China under the “one country, two systems” approach. The finding also states that Beijing secretly used bribery and compromising information to influence key business leaders, politicians, and academics to promote a pro-Beijing agenda during the campaign season. Multiple high-profile, pro-independence members of Taiwan’s political elite are caught up in scandals, many of which include the use of deepfakes and overt blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the CCP’s campaign is successful. Pro-independence officials fail to increase their hold on the government, and the entire rhetoric about independence appears to be shifting. In a show of support for a “new harmonious path,” the newly elected Taiwanese president flies to Beijing in an unprecedented meeting with President Xi Jinping to discuss formally extending the “one country, two systems” governance model to Taiwan over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the success of Chinese propaganda and coercive efforts in the past and existence of formal organizations to conduct political warfare, the “Three Warfares” campaign is very likely and need not be executed as a standalone effort. If this scenario were to occur, key indicators would include increases in white or black propaganda in cyberspace, licit or illicit Chinese funding of political parties, coercion of key Taiwan and regional leaders, and China-sponsored lobbying organizations. The consequences would be long-term political divisions within Taiwan, erosion of Taiwan’s democratic system, and strained relations with the United States and regional allies. U.S. and allied policymakers will face a decision about whether they should employ a political warfare campaign to counter malign CCP influence or use more overt, defensive efforts designed to counter misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM). The open question would be whether or not Taiwan and its network of democratic partners could sufficiently counter MDM before it starts to affect public opinion. In addition to the efficacy of MDM programs, there is a larger question about generational change and attitudes toward social media. Even if Beijing’s political warfare campaign successfully captures the airwaves and cyberspace, the Taiwanese public still might opt to reject all official media as well as trolls disseminating MDM. Rather than winning hearts and minds or creating space for a political solution favorable to Beijing, a political warfare campaign could also produce widespread apathy and distrust of all official parties and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-two-nuclear-blackmail&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Two: Nuclear Blackmail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a dramatic shift of its nuclear policy, China could conduct a nuclear weapons test during a fabricated crisis, just as the Soviet Union did during the 1961 Note Crisis. The purpose would be to signal the risks of external intervention while communicating the potential costs to Taiwan of non-compliance with China’s demands. The principal method would be nuclear blackmail combined with political warfare. China’s information warfare and cyber operations would disrupt network traffic while circulating themes and messages suggesting the West was pulling Taiwan into a dangerous crisis and risking war. In addition, China would use a nuclear weapons test to create a war atmosphere without committing large-scale military force. The desired outcome for Beijing would be an alteration of the political calculus of Taiwan’s political parties, pushing both the Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang away from openly discussing diplomatic and military engagement with foreign states. In other words, the coercive campaign would seek to stifle Taiwan’s democratic progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-note-crisis-1961&quot;&gt;The Note Crisis (1961)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical parallel for this scenario is the 1961 Note Crisis, when the Soviet Union combined diplomatic threats with a large-scale nuclear test to coerce Finnish political leaders to ensure the country remained diplomatically isolated and neutral. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets broke a moratorium on atmospheric nuclear testing and demonstrated the capabilities of the Tsar Bomb in the most powerful nuclear test in history. Moscow simultaneously sent a note to Finland requesting that it consult with the Soviet Union on the defense of both countries given the threat from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as provided for in the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948. Finland feared the Soviet Union would use the crisis to justify its annexation. However, cooperating with the Soviet Union would fracture Finland’s policy of neutrality and severely damage its relationship with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive campaign changed the political calculus for Finland domestically and internationally. In the weeks following the arrival of the note, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen attempted to appease both sides. On November 20, Kekkonen received a letter from President John F. Kennedy that reinforced the United States’ desire for Finland to remain neutral. In response, Kekkonen reassured the United States that he did not want to discuss military cooperation with the Soviets. Four days later, Kekkonen traveled to Serbia for a day-long discussion with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, who decided to “postpone” the military discussions. With tensions diffused, Kekkonen returned home to Helsinki a hero, and his success in defusing the Note Crisis won him re-election in 1962 over an anti-Soviet opponent. Although Kekkonen preserved Finland’s interests, his victory, attributed to his role in the Note Crisis, ultimately served Soviet interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-nuclear-blackmail-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would Nuclear Blackmail Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. Approaches to cross-strait relations continue to divide Taiwanese political parties, with both sides proposing a different approach to managing Beijing and integrating with the West. Prior to Taiwan’s presidential election, Beijing sends Taipei a secret note outlining a “one country, two systems” compromise (similar to Hong Kong and Macau) as the only option preventing Taiwan from destruction in a larger regional war with the United States. In the note, Beijing argues that a close relationship between the United States and Taiwan would pose a tremendous threat to mainland China, making their joint security paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that Taiwan receives the secret note, news headlines around the world show unprecedented pictures of a Chinese atmospheric nuclear weapons test. Hours later, Xi Jinping announces that the nuclear test conducted was a necessary response to pro-independence talks in Taiwan as well as corruption of the region by the West and the “unhinged” U.S. administration. Xi states that he will take further action to protect the region from the control of “dangerous Western forces, from both inside and out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching from across the Pacific, the U.S. response is swift. The U.S. Armed Forces are put on DEFCON 3, and the president gives a nationally televised speech condemning the escalation and promising intervention should China act unilaterally against Taiwan or any of its neighbors. Leaders in Japan, Australia, and across Europe echo this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s political leaders face a Hobson’s choice. Rejecting China’s request outright risks validating Beijing’s claims of Western influence on the island and spurring unilateral action, perhaps even invasion. Accepting the note risks eroding decades of democratic progress. To complicate matters further, rumors of the note are amplified by campaign rhetoric injected into the presidential election by bots likely linked to Chinese cyber operations. Taiwan’s public grows increasingly concerned about becoming a victim of a larger war and, for the first time in years, wants a compromise. Reports leak of a Taiwanese delegation meeting with Chinese leaders in Singapore to defuse the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more likely than a full-scale conventional invasion, nuclear blackmail is unlikely in the near future. Although China has increased its nuclear arsenal in recent years, conducting an atmospheric nuclear test would represent a serious escalation toward nuclear war unseen in the world since the peak of the Cold War. The more likely outcome from this scenario is the manufacturing of a crisis by Beijing to provide the pretense for escalating its military pressure on Taiwan. Just as the Soviet Union did with Finland during the Note Crisis, it is possible to imagine a scenario in which China argues that an exaggerated threat from the West is disrupting the status quo and corrupting Taiwan with pro-independence sentiment, as well as that the broader protection of the region is in the strategic interest of China. Overall, Taiwan’s relationship with China today is far more contentious and mistrusting than Finland’s was with the Soviet Union in the early 1960s. As such, the ruse that China would be acting in the interest of Taiwan would be far more transparent. Accordingly, the net outcome from such a scenario may in fact be greater frustration among the leadership and public of Taiwan toward China, and therefore a pro-independence shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-three-quarantine&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Three: Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than incurring the risk of a large-scale invasion, Beijing could opt for a pressure campaign similar to the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948. The purpose of the operation would be to test Western resolve to defend Taiwan and alter Taiwan’s domestic political calculus. This method would involve a modern blockade, combining a mix of traditional naval measures but also expanded air defense identification areas, electronic interference, fiber-optic cable severing, cyber intrusions, and threats in space. These measures would also include “Three Warfares” activities that would focus on framing the blockade as a quarantine for legal reasons, complicating external intervention. The campaign would include MDM to create domestic divisions inside the external states most likely to support Taipei. The desired condition would be a politically and economically isolated Taiwan that China can absorb over time while setting conditions for future military operations, to include invasion. A blockade is a positional strategy that gives China options to either offramp or escalate a crisis while gaining a key position of military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;berlin-airlift-19481949&quot;&gt;Berlin Airlift (1948–1949)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1948, coordination between the Soviet, British, French, and U.S. occupying forces was breaking down. The Soviet Union maintained large, mechanized formations as part of its occupation of the eastern zone in Germany, while Allied forces had drawn down large numbers of forces. In June 1948, Britain, France, and the United States engaged in a series of political and economic moves the Soviets viewed as subverting their ability to control the future of Germany. In response, the Soviets stopped routine meetings with the Western powers after they discovered a secret plan to create a new German state out of the western occupied zones. They then began high-level preparations to exert military pressure in support of a blockade at a level sufficient to reduce the risk of a counterattack against Moscow. These measures included internal propaganda designed to bolster political and ideological cohesion among Soviet forces against former allies, which subsequent interviews found to be ineffective. The efforts set the conditions for the Soviets to sever all land and water connections between non-Soviet-occupied Germany and Berlin, leaving only airspace open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States responded with Operation Vittles and opened an air corridor into Berlin. In addition to flying supplies in, the United States repositioned nuclear-capable B-29 bombers to the United Kingdom. The military balance was complex. The Soviets maintained an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces in and around Berlin, while the United States had a nuclear monopoly. The combination of these different military balances is what many historians see as a key reason why World War III did not begin in 1948. Historians still debate how effective the blockade was in terms of its immediate tactical and operational objectives. At the strategic level, it served to mobilize Western support for confronting the Soviets. It also illustrated that the United States could sustain a counterblockade operation for almost a year, eventually wearing down the Soviets, and find indirect ways of using military force under the Truman Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-quarantine-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Quarantine Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. As part of an escalating political and economic dispute between Beijing and Taipei, China announces that all air and naval traffic to Taiwan must first be routed through mainland ports and airfields in China. They also demand that all digital traffic to the island flow through servers on the mainland. To support the blockade, the PLA, through the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), deploys a mix of aircraft and naval ships to demonstrate its ability to isolate Taiwan and test international resolve. Simultaneously, the PLA begins to conduct large-scale maritime and air exercises near Taiwan. China also launches operations in the information, space, and cyber domains to achieve information dominance surrounding the island and complicate the operating picture for both Taiwan and international observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan refrains from attacking China’s military despite growing food and fuel shortages and massive disruptions to global supply chains. The United States and Japan respond, alongside a coalition of democratic nations, by challenging the de facto blockade with an air bridge while repositioning multiple carrier strike groups and partially executing time-phased force deployments linked to contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the graduated blockade scenario is more likely than a major war, it is unlikely in the short term. China can use military exercises and shows of force short of causing significant economic disruption to, in the words of the Science of Military Strategy, “lead” a future crisis and develop opportunities for coercing Taipei. If Beijing opted to pursue a blockade, the economic consequences would be immediate and global, hitting everything from shipping insurance premiums to semiconductor prices, something China would struggle to absorb during its current economic downturn. As a result, Beijing would need to take steps to prepare for economic warfare and survive a counter-blockade and the severe economic downturn likely to emerge as a result of isolating Taiwan. At the same time, a quarantine is appealing to China’s leadership as a low-cost, low-risk means of coercing Taiwan into political concessions in comparison to a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key decisions in a blockade scenario would be linked to the rules of engagement on each side and if and how each side opted to delegate decisions to use military force. A single spark would likely start a fire and lead to a rapid escalation spiral. Key indicators associated with a graduated blockade scenario would be evident in training and exercise of the PLAAF and PLAN as well as efforts by the CCP to create mechanisms to avoid the economic pain almost certain to accompany a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-four-exclusion-zones&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Four: Exclusion Zones&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an escalation beyond the quarantine scenario, China could impose a series of exclusion zones and periodically interdict air and maritime traffic to enforce the isolation of Taiwan, similar to the 1980 Tanker War. By declaring a series of exclusion zones and using a combination of irregular and military forces, such as the PLAAF and PLAN, as well as the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PLAMM), China may attempt to assert control rapidly over maritime and air access to the island without a large-scale maritime battle. In this scenario, China’s goal is not to immediately limit cargo or supplies from reaching the island but to demonstrate its coercive leverage over Taiwan. The desired outcome for China is to apply sufficient pressure to Taiwan’s leadership such that they capitulate to political demands, but also to avoid violent confrontation that invites the United States and other international parties into the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tanker-war-19841988&quot;&gt;The Tanker War (1984–1988)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Iran-Iraq War, hundreds of ships owned or associated with either side were attacked in a series of anti-shipping operations collectively known as the Tanker War. Unlike the outbreak of fighting on land, the conflict at sea escalated in incremental steps. At the outset of the war, both sides declared maritime exclusion zones. Iran closed the Shatt al-Arab — a key inland river whose southern end constitutes the Iran-Iraq border and feeds directly into the Persian Gulf — to all maritime craft and warned that all coastal waters were battle areas. In response, Iraq declared the Gulf north of 29 degrees 30 minutes north latitude a prohibited war zone. As a bloody stalemate on land began to unfold between 1981 and 1984, the Iranian navy and air force targeted key military ports along Iraq’s small coastline. In retaliation, Iraq attacked Iranian shipping in the northern Gulf using hit-and-run tactics. International vessels occasionally found themselves entangled in the conflict, with the Turkish oil tanker Atlas 1 damaged by an Iraqi strike while loading Iranian oil at Kharg Island in May 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Iraq began intensifying its anti-shipping attacks and strikes against Iranian oil export infrastructure. In response, Iran finally retaliated by attacking ships linked to Iraq, including those belonging to Gulf states and other internationally flagged vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq’s decision to escalate its anti-shipping operations in 1984 coincided with fading hopes in Baghdad of a swift victory in the broader war. In addition to limiting Iran’s oil exports and applying economic pressure on Tehran, escalating the anti-shipping component of the conflict was an effort to increase the likelihood of international intervention. If Iraq could provoke Iran to retaliate with extreme measures, such as attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz (through which approximately 30 percent of the world’s oil passed at the time), international parties would have almost no choice but to get involved. Wary of such intervention, Iran limited its response to attacking ships attempting to transport supplies, war matériel, and Iraqi oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, amid growing fears that Iran might still lash out by closing the Strait of Hormuz and concerned of the very real possibility that Iraq may lose the broader war, direct international intervention finally came in 1987. During U.S. Operation Earnest Will, Kuwaiti tankers reflagged as American vessels and were provided escort up and down the Gulf by the U.S. Navy. U.S. intervention did not go unopposed by Tehran, and a series of confrontations occurred over the following 14 months. For example, a Silkworm antiship missile struck one of the reflagged tankers in October 1987. The U.S. Navy responded by shelling two Iranian bases in the Rostam oil field. Ultimately, American intervention in the Tanker War successfully suppressed Iranian anti-shipping activities, protected international shipping in the Gulf, and increased pressure on Iran to seek an end to the war in August 1988. In total, between 1981 and 1988, Iran conducted 282 anti-shipping attacks and Iraq conducted 208.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-an-exclusion-zone-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would an Exclusion Zone Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. After years of unsuccessful military pressure campaigns short of war and multiples crises, President Xi Jinping announces that China has declared an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the island of Taiwan. During the same speech, he outlines the risk of “rogue political elements” in Taiwan that must be contained. Immediately after the speech, China releases details of new plans to periodically stop and inspect cargo traffic heading to Taiwan suspected of carrying material aid for these unspecified rogue elements. Behind the scenes, China assures major international firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited that their facilities will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys PLAMM and CCG to clutter sea lines of communication around Taiwan while patrolling the skies with mixed-combat air patrols equipped with antiship cruise missiles, air-to-air weapons, and electronic attack capabilities. Electronic and cyber interference disrupt commercial ship navigation systems. The net effect is a series of escalating interdiction opportunities. Any ship China deems to be carrying material support for the unspecified rogue elements is first swarmed by maritime militia ships that ram and obstruct the vessel. If the ship proceeds, the CCG officially declares its intention to board and inspect. If the ship still continues or is declared hostile, aircraft fire antiship cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing fires two antiship cruise missiles against a commercial cargo ship it claims refuses inspection, sinking a Turkish-flagged vessel and causing a spike in insurance premiums globally. While the ship owner claims there were no weapons or material military support, Chinese social media circulates falsified images of missiles on the ship. As a result, Beijing promises to increase the number of ships it is boarding and to directly attack any ship deemed at risk of carrying military support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Taiwan requests the United States, Japan, and Australia escort commercial ships to the island. Although food and other supplies have been largely allowed to enter the island after inspection, there is growing concern about Taiwan’s dependence on imported natural gas and its limited strategic reserves of energy resources. Wary of China’s ability to suffocate the island should it decide to cut off the import of energy supplies, food, or other crucial resources, the United States is compelled to act. The U.S. president orders the 7th Fleet to escort commercial oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) tankers to the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China tests international resolve by firing on an LNG cargo ship escorted by two U.S. guided-missile destroyers (DDGs). The destroyers successfully interdict four cruise missiles fired at the ship, but two Taiwanese F-16 fighters in the vicinity are shot down by long-range air-to-air missiles (e.g., PL-15s). The DDGs report significant electronic attacks on their systems and even laser dazzling interfering with navigation and key systems. Over the next three months, the world is on edge as the pattern repeats itself. Taiwan’s imports and exports are affected but not shut off, as different commercial firms assess the risk of trade. Of 2,000 ships that enter the exclusion zone over the 90-day period, only 100 are harassed and inspected and another 50 are attacked. Of the 50, 5 are sunk, and the U.S. Navy launches countermeasures to defend its DDGs three times, despite China’s claims that U.S. ships were not targeted. Taiwan loses another 10 aircraft and 4 surface combatants, mostly smaller attack platforms, as China avoids targeting larger frigates and destroyers. There is no major war, but a peace in the region seems beyond repair. The global economy is also in a recession, while each side blames the other for the escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would be more likely to opt for a series of escalating exclusion zones than incur the immediate global fallout from a large blockade. The use of exclusion zones preserves the ability to escalate or de-escalate the crisis depending on how the international community reacts. Similar to the Tanker War, the pivotal decision is whether external powers, such as the United States, will escort commercial traffic. Unlike the Tanker War, however, the threshold for what will provoke U.S. engagement is vastly different. By the time the United States came to Kuwait’s aid in 1987, Iran and Iraq had been engaged in a brutal war for nearly seven years. By comparison, the threshold for what may provoke U.S. assistance to Taiwan in a future Indo-Pacific scenario is expected to be much lower, with the United States repeatedly signaling in recent years a growing intent to assist Taiwan should China take any military action against the island. Accordingly, the extent to which China resorts to violence, either intentionally or accidentally, will likely have significant impact on the severity and speed of any U.S. response. Moreover, as during the Tanker War, it may not take China wholly cutting off access to resources for the United States to respond. The fear alone that Beijing could order the interception of food or fuel at any time may be enough to push the United States into testing Beijing’s resolve using similar strategies that proved successful decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-five-air-and-missile-campaign&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Five: Air and Missile Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next level of escalation, Beijing could opt to test the resolve of Taiwan’s population and political leadership through a series of air and missile strikes similar to NATO’s strikes in Kosovo and Serbia in 1999. The purpose of the operation would be to alter Taiwan’s domestic political calculus, but through a more direct application of military force alongside high-stakes diplomacy. The campaign would also test the resolve of the West while achieving intermediate military objectives linked to destroying Taiwan’s air force, major command and control facilities, and surface-to-surface and antiship cruise missile capability. Unlike Kosovo, the operation would take advantage of Chinese concepts and capabilities to wage a firepower strike campaign in lieu of a traditional air campaign. The campaign would also involve a firepower blitz and efforts to integrate electronic attack, cyber, and conventional fires to destroy key targets and paralyze Taiwan. The desired condition would be graduated military pressure on Taiwanese leaders sufficient to force them to accept Beijing’s political demands. The strategic approach would rely on shock and surprise to gain a position of advantage, narrowing the offramp options available in a blockade or exclusion scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operation-allied-force-1999&quot;&gt;Operation Allied Force (1999)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 1999, NATO launched a campaign to degrade Serbia’s ability to prosecute its war in Kosovo. The campaign would last only 78 days and see extensive use of precision-strike capabilities alongside diplomatic pressure to force concessions by the Serbs. According to General Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme allied commander during the effort, the campaign was designed to “coerce, not to seize.” In addition to striking strategic targets, including infrastructure, and degrading military capacity, the campaign’s coercive effects were amplified by the looming threat of a ground invasion, risk of further political fracturing inside Serbia, and Belgrade’s inability to hold NATO aircraft at risk. In other words, Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was on the horns of a dilemma. He had no way of changing the military balance and reducing strikes. The longer the war lasted, the larger the risk of domestic unrest. Commentators both in the West and in China saw the air power campaign as an ideal type for effects-based operations, elements of which survive in PLA planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-an-air-and-missile-raid-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would an Air and Missile Raid Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. After years of unsuccessful efforts to undermine Taiwan’s independence and sovereignty, Beijing opts for a limited air and missile campaign designed to shock leaders in Taipei and abroad while demonstrating its ability to execute a firepower strike system. The campaign begins with a fire blitz in which a mix of ballistic and cruise missiles hit Taiwanese military targets and political institutions while electronic attack and cyber operations paralyze command and control systems. Beijing moves to broadcast its own images and narratives in the immediate aftermath, effectively hijacking the airwaves and social media. China also continues to strike high-value targets including airfields, ammunition depots, and air defenses from distances that limit Taiwan’s options to counterattack by fire. There is no physical blockade of Taiwan, and there has only been a partial mobilization of key ground armies in China’s Eastern Theater Command since the campaign seeks to “coerce and destroy, not seize” ground in Taiwan. Beijing warns Washington and other nations through diplomatic channels that they risk being targeted if they enter a newly declared exclusion zone around Taipei, which China says is meant to protect commercial entities from being targeted. China openly pushes for commerce to continue, even going as far as offering additional insurance guarantees to firms to continue trading while they conclude their limited campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an air and missile campaign is more likely than a major war, it is less likely than a political warfare campaign, escalating exclusion zones, or a blockade. Despite its bellicose rhetoric and continued double-digit increases in its defense budget, Beijing has limited its use of military force to date to military exercises and restrictive military operations similar to the crisis in August 2022 and the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. These operations are designed to isolate the island and signal capability and resolve. Moving up the escalation ladder to a limited air and missile raid would be a significant departure from the status quo and risk a Ukraine-like situation in which democratic nations flood Taiwan with military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. For this reason, an air and missile raid would likely be proceeded by escalating exclusion zones or a quarantine to deter foreign military intervention, even if indirect and limited to supplying weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key decisions in this campaign for Beijing will be timing and target selection, finding the optimal window of opportunity, and balancing target-selection criteria with weapons inventory in the event Taiwan holds out for over 60 days. For Taipei, the key decision will be whether to risk a larger military confrontation by counterattacking launch platforms on mainland China. For the United States and its allies, the key decision is not if, but how to intervene in a manner that balances providing Taiwan the means to defend itself with an almost certain risk of Beijing responding with a warning strike against the U.S. military or even bases in Japan. Given Beijing’s current inventories of ballistic and cruise missiles, there would be limited warning of an air and missile strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-six-decapitation-raid&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Six: Decapitation Raid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to its strategy of system destruction warfare, China could launch a special operations raid on Taiwan akin to the 1968 Blue House Raid in South Korea. The purpose would be to destabilize the Taiwan government by assassinating Taiwan’s political and military leaders. The principal method would be an infiltration of special operations forces (SOF) by air or sea to raid political and military targets. SOF teams would work alongside the PLA Strategic Support Forces to sabotage Taiwan communications and military defenses to disrupt crisis response by the Taiwan government. The desired condition would be to paralyze Taiwan’s political and military decisionmaking so that it loses the will and ability to resist a larger military operation or accept a political offramp to the crisis. In effect, these strikes and raids would disrupt the flow of information within Taiwan’s military, destroy critical functions within Taiwan’s government, and frustrate efforts to mount an effective defense while signaling the costs of resisting Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;blue-house-raid-1968&quot;&gt;Blue House Raid (1968)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1960s, Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers’ Party’s leadership feared that an increase in South Korean domestic political stability, increasing partnerships with the United States and its allies, and a U.S. military shift to South Korea would make reunification impossible. Due to the strong economic policies of President Park Chung-hee and his Democratic Republican Party, support for domestic opposition parties decreased, and North Korea believed its ability to exploit internal divisions to destabilize South Korea’s government was shrinking. Increasing political, economic, and military ties with the United States and its allies also presented an inflection point where a conventional war to reunify the Korean Peninsula would result in a regional, rather than a local war. Lastly, concerns that North Vietnam would seek a negotiated settlement with the United States prompted fears that the United States would shift military forces to South Korea and take military actions against North Korea. Ultimately, South Korea’s strong domestic and international relations, as well as fears of the United States implementing an aggressive military strategy in the Korean Peninsula, prompted Kim Il-sung to order the assassination of President Park. With President Park’s death, South Korea would be destabilized, presenting future opportunities for reunification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 1968, 31 members of North Korean SOF infiltrated South Korea en route to the South Korean presidential residence, the Blue House. The group took 48 hours to successfully penetrate the defense sector of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and move into position around Seoul. Radio intercepts of South Korean army patrols enabled these soldiers to prevent capture. On January 20, 1968, the SOF platoon moved within a few hundred meters of the Blue House, with the objective of assassinating President Park and a follow-on mission of destroying the U.S. Embassy. However, the SOF unit was discovered, failed to reach the Blue House to complete the assassination, and was pursued for several days until the soldiers were killed or captured. Their capture was in large part due to their discovery by two South Korean citizens, who reported the incursion to local police and mobilized counterguerrilla operations that resulted in their discovery. Although this raid narrowly failed, it signaled a serious weakness in South Korean defenses against irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-decapitation-raid-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Decapitation Raid Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. The relationship between the United States and Taiwan continues to strengthen, resulting in more official and frequent U.S.-Taiwan military exercises and routine visits by bipartisan congressional delegations to Taipei. Senior CCP officials close to Xi Jinping insist that peaceful reunification is no longer feasible. They believe that Congress will ease the United States’ “One China Policy” in new legislation and transform Taiwan into a military outpost to counter China, which will result in strong political support in Taiwan for declaring independence. These fears prompt calls for destabilizing Taiwan’s government to prevent these domestic and international barriers to reunification. The CCP decides that conflict with Taiwan is inevitable and launches a special operations fait accompli to shock Taipei elites and set conditions should they need to launch a broader military invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA mobilizes one SOF brigade in the Southern Theater Command and the PLAN Marine Corps’ Sea Dragons Brigade to conduct the decapitation strike. The PLA begins by conducting electronic warfare and deception operations days prior to the deployment of SOF forces to create uncertainty for the Taiwan military over PLA intentions and disable radar systems to create air corridors for SOF infiltration. In addition, a PLA SOF company deploys to Taiwan 48 hours prior to the infiltration to conduct reconnaissance and advance targeting of key political, military, and command and control targets. On the day of the infiltration, PLA SOF units conduct air and sea insertions to seize airfields and seaports, raid key government and military buildings in Taipei, and sabotage command and control nodes around Formosa. PLA SOF units also employ cyber and information warfare capabilities to disrupt Taiwan communications on official government websites, social media, and in the news. These initial hours result in the successful assassination of key Taiwan government and military officials. Taiwan’s government is effectively paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an intimidating scenario, a special operations fait accompli is very unlikely, owing to the difficulty of inserting and exfiltrating forces in a highly urbanized island. It is tempting to view recent statements from the Chinese government as indicative of a willingness to use force to reunify with Taiwan. However, it is more likely that China will continue to remain at a stalemate with Taiwan or use gray zone aggression to slowly encroach and reintegrate Taiwan into China. If this scenario did occur, key indicators would be capture or infiltration of Chinese SOF units, indicators of compromise within Taiwan’s cyber networks, increasing intensity of deception operations, and electronic warfare operations to degrade radar capabilities. The consequences would include prolonged land and naval conflict between China and Taiwan, international condemnation and strong sanctions against Beijing, and mobilization of the United States and its allies. It is hard to imagine Taiwan not responding with force if its political leaders are assassinated by uniformed Chinese combatants. A key decision to be made by Western leadership in this crisis would be whether to employ military force or use other instruments of national power to assist Taiwan in responding to the decapitation raid. This consideration is essentially a balance seen today with the war in Ukraine — how can the West adequately support an invaded nation while limiting the risks of horizontal and vertical escalation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-back-to-look-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Back to Look Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no single scenario is predictive, looking across the historical cases helps policymakers visualize and describe the dilemmas likely to confront key stakeholders in Taiwan over the next 10 years. History offers a set of plausible examples of crisis dynamics. China has coercive alternatives it can exhaust before incurring the costs and risks of a large-scale amphibious invasion and prolonged occupation of Taiwan. Unlike earlier crises, these alternatives will almost certainly involve unexplored domain dynamics, and private sector firms will be forced to create means for coordination across different actors as the world seeks to avoid war without conceding to threats from Beijing. In this multistakeholder, competitive environment, the United States can best deter war by creating focal points for coordination and using international standards to signal all parties. This new escalation management framework provides a blueprint for realizing the promises of integrated deterrence. This logic produces five key recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a series of interagency, multistakeholder crisis simulations to develop a new escalation management framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the strategic level, the U.S. government, likely through the National Security Council, needs to launch a series of interagency, multistakeholder crisis simulations to develop a new escalation management framework. The historical cases reviewed here show that confrontation and conflict can take place short of war and involve a diverse set of actors. Understanding how private sector firms, partner nations, and even different agencies in the U.S. government respond to complex threats is therefore a key information gap. At the same time, integrated deterrence calls for better synchronizing different instruments of power and international partners while increasing joint all-domain interoperability. The theory is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. While likely true, there is a maze of bureaucratic obstacles and policies that make interagency, much less multilateral, coordination difficult. Without a better understanding of these obstacles, legacy bureaucratic structures could limit the potential of integrated deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These information gaps create a need for an entirely new approach to wargaming and crisis simulation. Traditionally, these activities have been closed, classified events that favor secrecy over transparency and hypothesis testing. They also tend to take place in sponsor stovepipes, with individual services or narrow elements of the defense establishment running games and holding on to the results to gain an information advantage in the budgeting process or in advancing their preferred plans. The opposite is true when trying to address coordination challenges, which require a broader set of players to identify where and how cooperation and coordination can break down. Imagine a blockade game in which representatives from the private sector — whether chambers of commerce or corporate representatives from individual firms — sit alongside non-official delegations from the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. Even more radical, but no less important, imagine a multitrack diplomatic exchange in which U.S., Chinese, and private sector officials discuss how economic and military instruments of power collide in an escalating crisis alongside challenges associated with limiting escalation in space and cyberspace. States can share an understanding of risk without compromising privileged information about their intentions and plans. In doing so, the resulting transparency helps calibrate cost, benefit, and restraint calculations at the heart of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This logic means that the United States should explore multitrack diplomacy with China that involves crisis simulations that help each side — from Washington and Beijing to business leaders — understand how all parties might react in a future crisis. The transparency serves a purpose. It helps businesses better assess risk while reminding Beijing of the economic costs of a significant escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a new escalation management framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The net result of these multistakeholder crisis games should be a new escalation management framework. Policymakers need a clear list of flexible response and deterrent options they can use in an unfolding crisis that has been stress-tested and analyzed through a mix of red teaming and gaming. The list of options should be validated annually and subject to congressional scrutiny. While there certainly will be classified annexes, an unclassified list will help encourage broader crosstalk with the private sector and partners as well as in executive-level communication with Beijing critical to managing a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsor a series of counter-blockade games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the U.S. military should sponsor a series of counter-blockade games that include counterspace vignettes alongside complex misinformation campaigns and the employment of limited air and missile engagements. These games will help Taiwan determine how best to posture their forces to make it more costly for Beijing to blockade the island for a prolonged period. The 1948 Italian election, Berlin Airlift, and Tanker War show the enduring importance of the information environment alongside the air and maritime domains. Taiwan is a globally connected island, amplifying the likelihood that China will use space, cyber, air, and naval means to isolate the island. The open question is how likely cross-domain escalation is to occur and the extent to which Beijing can achieve its objectives through other domains short of occupying Taiwan. The first step toward tailoring a deterrent strategy to a Taiwan contingency is therefore to map these domain-specific dynamics across a diverse set of stakeholders. The findings from these analytical games could be used by the Biden administration to inform foreign military sales as well as defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatch interagency teams to help Taiwan refine continuity of the presidency and government planning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States and its partners should dispatch interagency teams to help Taiwan refine continuity of the presidency and government planning. The Blue House case shows the importance of preparing for the possibility a hostile foreign state targets political leaders to create a crisis it can exploit. Unlike the Blue House case, the information environment would play a key role, with MDM activities exploiting the chaos to shape public opinion. As a result, it is not just Secret Service, FBI, or select military teams that are required to help key partners such as Taiwan develop the force protection and continuity of government protocols. Partners such as Taiwan — including civil society organizations — also need support from Western nonprofits and government agencies to combat MDM campaigns as well as complex cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, a Kosovo-type scenario in Taiwan would also include steps to neutralize Taiwan’s political leaders. As a result, continuity of the presidency and government planning needs to include helping Taiwan figure out how best to alert and protect leaders without disrupting their ability to command and control military operations. This planning must include variable timelines that help Taiwan and the international community better assess how long Taiwan could hold out against a sustained series of air and missile strikes, especially if they occurred alongside a blockade. That type of planning works best when private sector logistical expertise is brought in to help discuss topics ranging from port operations to warehouse management. There is precedent for involving a diverse set of stakeholders to analyze continuity planning, such as the Continuity of Government Commission, funded by the private sector and nonprofits, following the September 11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiate a major new nuclear arms control regime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, nuclear weapons played a significant role in two of the six explored historical cases. In the Berlin Airlift, the movement of nuclear-capable bombers to bases in the United Kingdom limited the Soviet response options. In the Note Crisis, nuclear tests played a key role in a larger coercive diplomatic campaign. While China has not signaled it will change its nuclear policy, it is increasing its capabilities and could decide to alter its policies in the future. Therefore, the United States needs to initiate a major new nuclear arms control regime involving Beijing and other nuclear states. The world cannot afford a multipolar nuclear competition, which would almost certainly involve more risk than the bipolar Cold War. It should be a top priority to use formal treaties and regimes to mitigate proliferation risk and to limit incentives to use nuclear blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these recommendations share is an emphasis on using transparency and international standards to reduce uncertainty and adding credible communication channels to international crises. Creating, testing, and communicating clear international standards around maritime law and boarding ships, as well as working with the private sector to create playbooks for identifying and countering misinformation campaigns, denies China, as well as other actors, the ability to support coercive campaigns. If China decides to take military action against Taiwan, it can. Beijing has a favorable correlation of forces, and the status of Taiwan is a salient issue for the CCP. While no one can stop Beijing from making the decision to use force, they can be sure that China’s leaders do so with a clear understanding of the real costs associated with taking a military path to victory. The clearer these costs and the more uncertain operational objectives and timelines become, the more likely Beijing is to avoid crossing the line.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet crucial questions remain about the dynamics shaping the Taiwan Strait. What is China’s approach to Taiwan and how long is Beijing willing to wait for Taiwan’s unification? Will China use significant military force against Taiwan, and when? How does Beijing view the potential of U.S. intervention in a Taiwan contingency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To shed light on these questions, ChinaPower polled 64 leading experts on the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and cross-Strait relations. The experts polled include 28 former high-level U.S. government (USG) officials from both Democrat and Republican administrations, as well as 23 former USG policy and intelligence analysts and 13 top experts from academia and think tanks. Responses were collected from August 10–September 8, 2022, amid the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis. Key takeaways from the survey are shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-strategy-for-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Strategy for Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, China’s overall approach to Taiwan hinges on two main questions: does China have a clear strategy to achieve unification and how patiently is it willing to wait? The experts polled by our survey broadly believe that Beijing does not have a strategy and that it is willing to wait to achieve unification — but not forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Beijing has “a coherent internal strategy and roadmap, with concrete stages and actionable next steps,” 80 percent of respondents said “no.” There was no significant difference in responses to this question based on the identity of the respondents: former senior USG officials and other respondents broadly agree on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MJnHB61.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China lacks a coherent strategy for Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Does Beijing have a coherent internal strategy and roadmap, with concrete stages and actionable next steps, to achieve peaceful unification with Taiwan?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general assessment that China lacks a coherent strategy is a reflection of public opinion polls in Taiwan, which consistently show that Taiwan’s citizens are not interested in unification with China. Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taipei has also rejected China’s proposed “one country, two systems” offer and watched as Beijing cracked down on Hong Kong and reversed promises of autonomy for the Chinese special administrative region. China’s inability to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwan government and people has led Beijing to increasingly leverage coercive tools against the island, including threats to use significant military force. These dynamics raise serious questions as to whether China has a coherent strategy for peaceful unification with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked to China’s overall strategy are Beijing’s assessments of the necessary conditions for unification with the island. Only 10 percent of respondents think Beijing’s approach is to push for unification “at the earliest possible opportunity.” The overwhelming majority (84 percent) of respondents say “Beijing is willing to wait for unification but will not accept the status quo permanently.” For this group, there is likely an assessment that Beijing is willing to wait because the conditions — political, economic, or military — are not yet optimal for China to achieve peaceful or forceful unification. Only 6 percent believe Beijing is willing to permanently accept the status quo — wherein Taiwan is self-governed but Taipei has not declared independence — and none of the 64 respondents think that China would ever accept Taiwan independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JKLw5BA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing is willing to wait for Taiwan’s unification, but not forever.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “For Beijing, is there any other acceptable outcome for Taiwan aside from unification?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-timeline-for-unification&quot;&gt;China’s Timeline for Unification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most hotly debated questions revolve around China’s timeline for unification. These questions are crucial, since a desire by Beijing to stick to a certain timeline could compel China to ramp up coercive measures or even military attacks to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if Beijing has set a “hard internal deadline for resolving the Taiwan issue,” 44 percent of respondents said Beijing has set a hard deadline to achieve unification by 2049. This is not an arbitrary year. Authoritative Chinese sources, including the 2022 white paper on Taiwan, have closely linked Taiwan’s unification with the concept of “national rejuvenation” — a nebulous goal that Chinese leaders aim to achieve by 2049 to mark the centennial of the PRC’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe that 2049 is only a soft benchmark for China and not a hard deadline. As a result, some selected 2072 as the hard deadline for China to achieve unification, believing that 50 years from 2022 is the longest time China could give itself. Others (42 percent) selected the option that Beijing is willing to wait indefinitely as long as it still sees unification as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TyMvLMO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Divided views on China’s deadlines for unifying Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Has Beijing set a hard internal deadline for resolving the Taiwan issue?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since experts do not formulate their assessments in a vacuum, the poll sought to gauge whether China’s recent unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan reflect changes in Beijing’s timelines. A large majority (80 percent) believe that the recent exercises do not indicate that China is accelerating its timeline for using large-scale military force against Taiwan. Notably, however, 29 percent of former senior USG officials believe the exercises do indicate a timeline shift while only 14 percent of other respondents hold that view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r6nemOH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China’s August 2022 military exercises do not indicate an acceleration of plans to use force.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Do China’s unprecedented August 2022 military exercises against Taiwan indicate that Beijing is accelerating its timeline for using large-scale military force (i.e., a blockade or invasion) against the island?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;xi-jinpings-third-term&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping’s Third Term&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach toward Taiwan over the next five years will be heavily shaped by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He is China’s most powerful leader in generations, and he has abolished the two term limit on his power. Xi is set to begin his third five-year term in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi, China has significantly ramped up pressure on Taiwan. There has been U.S. and international media speculation that the year 2027 — which will mark the end of Xi’s third term and also the centennial of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) — is a likely time period by which Xi will decide to use force against Taiwan to achieve unification. Xi’s own statements have also been interpreted by some as an indication that he seeks to resolve the Taiwan issue under his watch. In 2013 and 2019, Xi commented that the Taiwan issue should not be passed down from generation to generation. Yet he has been careful to not explicitly and publicly specify a date by which China needs to unify with Taiwan or use force against the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts polled by our survey broadly rejected the idea that China must act against Taiwan by 2027. About 83 percent of respondents assess that China does not plan to use significant kinetic military force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7gNiVcH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Few expect China to use significant force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “There has been speculation by the media and some analysts that China plans to use significant kinetic military force against Taiwan by 2027. Do you believe this is true?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lack of a plan to use significant military force against Taiwan does not mean that Beijing will sit idly by. Indeed, 79 percent of respondents assess that Xi will move beyond a more passive focus on deterring perceived Taiwan independence and instead prioritize making progress toward peaceful unification during his third term. This means that Beijing will need to be much more active — and likely more coercive — toward Taiwan to create the conditions for unification. This could involve more unilateral moves on Beijing’s end to impose its sovereignty and control over the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 9 percent of respondents believe that Xi feels China has exhausted all peaceful options and will feel compelled in his third term to unify Taiwan through coercive measures or military force. This corresponds closely to the 9 percent that believe Beijing will seek unification at the earliest possible opportunity (See above in the section on “China’s Strategy for Taiwan”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5jurd3P.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping will prioritize making progress on peaceful unification.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “What do you assess as Xi Jinping’s main priority for Taiwan after the 20th Party Congress, during his next term (2022-2027)?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risk-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;The Risk of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cross-Strait tensions have flared in recent years, so has the likelihood of a military conflict or accident. Three of the survey’s questions sought to gauge experts’ assessments about the risks of various military contingencies in the next ten years. Their responses indicate a belief that a full amphibious invasion of Taiwan is possible — but more unlikely than not — while a more limited Chinese use of force and a military accident are fairly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked how likely it is that China will engage in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan in the next ten years, 63 percent of experts responded that it is possible. Another 27 percent feel an invasion is unlikely. Only 8 percent think an invasion is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on responses to other questions in the survey, these results indicate that most experts do not believe China proactively seeks to invade Taiwan in the next ten years. Instead, Beijing could feel compelled to do so if China views Taiwan or the United States as crossing unacceptable redlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HZy3VaM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;An amphibious invasion of Taiwan is possible in the next 10 years.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Within the next ten years, how likely is it that China will engage in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan with the goal of gaining control of Taipei?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While experts were unsure about the likelihood of an amphibious invasion, they were much more willing to believe that in the next 10 years China would “deliberately escalate its use of force short of invasion,” for example by blockading Taiwan. A slight majority believe that such a scenario is either likely (30 percent) or very likely (22 percent). However, a plurality (44 percent) still view this as possible. Only 5 percent believe it is unlikely and no experts believe it is not at all likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were even more likely to think that an “unintended military accident or collision will take place in or near the Taiwan Strait.” While a plurality (39 percent) still believe an accident or collision is possible, 34 percent believe such a scenario is likely and 22 percent believe it is very likely. Only 5 percent believe it is unlikely and no experts believe it is not at all likely. Notably, there were not major differences in views between former senior officials and other respondents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gwd3A2Y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Other Taiwan contingencies are more likely than an invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Within the next 10 years, how likely is it that ____ ?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-chinese-responses-to-us-and-taiwan-actions&quot;&gt;Potential Chinese Responses to U.S. and Taiwan Actions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also important to China’s plans for Taiwan is how China might respond to potential U.S. and Taiwan actions. Beijing could feel that it must respond by using military force. Respondents largely agree that China would invade if Taiwan declared independence and that Beijing would respond strongly and negatively if Washington dropped its long-held approach of strategic ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Beijing has repeatedly made known its objection to Taiwan independence. The PLA’s unprecedented August 2022 exercises were targeted at deterring “separatist activities” on the island, and Beijing has taken other measures such as sanctioning Taiwan officials that it has labeled “independence diehards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents appear to take Beijing’s concerns seriously. More than three-quarters of the experts polled said that China would invade Taiwan immediately (within six months) if Taipei declared independence. There was little variation in this belief among different groups of respondents. Compared to other respondents, former senior USG officials were only slightly more likely to say China would invade (79 percent versus 75 percent). Even among the 23 percent that do not believe China would invade Taiwan immediately, some still believe that China could use significant force against Taiwan. This could involve launching a blockade or engaging in unprecedented, large military exercises targeting Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANabW1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China would invade Taiwan immediately if Taipei declared independence.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “If Taipei declared independence, would Beijing invade Taiwan immediately (within the next six months)?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were somewhat more sanguine about how Beijing would respond to a decision by Washington to end its long-held policy of strategic ambiguity — a policy wherein the United States does not say whether or not it would come to Taiwan’s defense. None of the polled experts believe China would respond to an end of strategic ambiguity by immediately invading Taiwan. Instead, 64 percent of polled experts expect that China would “respond negatively and significantly, provoking a U.S.-China or China-Taiwan crisis.” An additional 31 percent say that China would instead “respond negatively in a more limited way,” mainly lodging diplomatic protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two respondents believe that an official U.S. policy shift to defend Taiwan would deter China from using force against Taiwan, and only one respondent assesses that China would not respond to the U.S. policy change. As shown in the next section, most experts do not believe ending U.S. strategic ambiguity would deter China from using force against Taiwan because Beijing already assumes that the U.S. military would come to Taiwan’s defense. Instead, Beijing is likely to view a change in U.S. policy as further provocation and as an effort to support Taiwan independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dPwlfgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China would provoke a crisis if the United States ends strategic ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “How would Beijing respond if the United States ended its policy of strategic ambiguity in favor of strategic clarity to defend Taiwan?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-thinking-on-us-resolve&quot;&gt;Chinese Thinking on U.S. Resolve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts polled in this survey think Beijing already assumes the United States will intervene militarily to defend Taiwan. Many also believe that Chinese leaders fear the U.S. still has a military advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey participants were asked to assess how far Beijing expects the United States would be willing to go to defend Taiwan in the event of an unprovoked Chinese invasion of Taiwan. They were given multiple options ranging from providing no support for Taiwan to bearing any military costs to defend the island. None of the experts assess that China believes Washington will provide no support or simply stop at political and economic aid. All respondents think China believes the United States would be willing to also deploy troops in Taiwan’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts diverge, however, on how far the United States would be willing to go to defend Taiwan. About 30 percent believe China assesses the United States is willing to deploy troops to defend Taiwan but is not willing to bear significant costs. Most respondents (66 percent) think Beijing has assessed that the United States is willing to go further by bearing substantial costs but will seek to contain the military conflict to the Indo-Pacific region. The remaining 5 percent think China sees the U.S. as willing to risk any cost, including a global war and attacks on the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0QK1acg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing expects U.S. military intervention in a conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Respondents unanimously believe Beijing expects the United States is willing to provide political and economic support and deploy forces to defend Taiwan, but they differ over what the United States is willing to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these responses were specifically about a scenario in which the PLA launches an “unprovoked” invasion. If Taiwan were to provoke a Chinese attack by unilaterally declaring independence or by escalating through a preemptive military strike, Washington may be far less willing to come to Taiwan’s aid. Beijing is aware of this, and a different scenario would therefore likely be interpreted differently by Chinese leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread belief that China anticipates a U.S. military response is notable given that most respondents also think Beijing is uncertain about its capabilities vis-à-vis the United States. In the context of a Chinese amphibious invasion scenario in the next five years, about 41 percent believe Beijing is uncertain about U.S. capabilities but think Beijing “has confidence in its growing military capabilities.” This reflects the fact that China has invested significant resources to train and modernize the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h3GoOMb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing is uncertain about its military capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “If China invaded Taiwan between now and 2027, does Beijing believe the United States has the military capability to defend Taipei and prevent China from executing a successful amphibious invasion?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the PLA has not engaged in a major conventional conflict since the China-Vietnam war in 1979 and an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would amount to an extremely complex and difficult military operation. Most respondents (55 percent) consequently think that Beijing believes the United States still has a military advantage, indicating a belief that the United States and its allies could mount a considerable defense of Taiwan. Only 2 percent say that Beijing believes the United States could not repel a Chinese invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this survey offer valuable insights into the thinking of many of the leading experts on cross-Strait dynamics and Indo-Pacific security issues — including those who have shaped not only public discourse but also U.S. government policy. Taken together, their views suggest a consensus along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is determined to unify with Taiwan, but Beijing does not have a coherent strategy. Experts in the poll unanimously agree that Beijing will not accept Taiwan’s independence. At the same time, most experts assess that China does not have a coherent strategy for unification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is willing to wait to unify with Taiwan, and the August 2022 exercises are not an indicator of accelerated PRC timelines. Most respondents believe Beijing is willing to wait decades — or even indefinitely — to achieve its goals. Experts are split nearly evenly over whether China has set a hard deadline to achieve unification by 2049 or whether it is willing to wait indefinitely. Only a small share of experts believe China has a hard deadline to unify Taiwan in the next 15 years or less. Most do not view China’s unprecedented military exercise in August 2022 as an indicator that China has accelerated its timeline to use force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping feels there are still avenues to peaceful unification. A large majority of experts believe Xi will prioritize making progress on peaceful unification during his third term (2022–2027). Few experts — and no former senior U.S. government officials — believe Xi has concluded that China has exhausted all peaceful options. Most respondents reject speculation that Xi intends to use force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential for a military crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is very real. While very few think a full amphibious invasion of Taiwan is likely in the next ten years, a majority say it is possible. Other scenarios short of an invasion — such as a blockade or a military accident or collision — are likelier than not in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China would immediately invade if Taiwan declared independence. Experts were largely in agreement that a declaration of independence would provoke an invasion. China would respond more limitedly — but still negatively and strongly — to an ending of U.S. strategic ambiguity, likely by provoking a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China assumes that the United States would intervene in a Taiwan conflict. Experts in the survey unanimously agree that Beijing assumes the U.S. military would deploy forces to intervene and defend Taiwan in a conflict, and a slight majority of experts think Beijing still worries that the United States has a military edge. Accordingly, almost no respondents believe that ending the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity would deter China from using force against Taiwan, since Beijing already assumes Washington will intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin likely intends annexation to freeze the war along the current frontlines and allow time for Russian mobilization to reconstitute Russian forces. The annexation of parts of four Ukrainian oblasts does not signify that Putin has abandoned his stated objective of destroying the Ukrainian state for a lesser goal. As ISW assessed in May, if Putin’s annexation of occupied Ukraine stabilizes the conflict along new front lines, “the Kremlin could reconstitute its forces and renew its invasion of Ukraine in the coming years, this time from a position of greater strength and territorial advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s annexation speech made several general references to nuclear use that are consistent with his past language on the subject, avoiding making the direct threats that would be highly likely to precede nuclear use. Putin alluded to Russia’s willingness to use “all available means” to defend claimed Russian territory, a common Kremlin talking point. Putin stated that “the US is the only country in the world that twice used nuclear weapons, destroying the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Incidentally, they created a precedent.” Putin stretched his historical allusions, stating that the United States and the United Kingdom demonstratively and without a military need destroyed many German cities during World War II with the “sole goal, just like in the case of nuclear bombardments in Japan, to scare our country and the entire world,” attempting to portray Western states as the true aggressor. Putin did not directly articulate any new red lines or overtly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Ukraine if Ukrainian counteroffensives continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is attempting to force Kyiv to the negotiating table by annexing Russian-occupied territory and threatening nuclear use. He is following the trajectory that ISW forecasted he might on May 13. As ISW wrote at the time: “A Russian annexation would seek to present Kyiv with a fait accompli that precludes negotiations on territorial boundaries even for a ceasefire by asserting that Russia will not discuss the status of (illegally annexed through military conquest) Russian territory — the argument the Kremlin has used regarding Crimea since 2014.” Predictably, Putin demanded that Ukraine return to negotiations in his September 30 speech announcing annexation and precluded any discussion of returning illegally annexed Ukrainian territory to Kyiv’s control: “We call on the Kyiv regime to immediately cease all fire and hostilities and end the war it initiated in 2014 and return to the negotiations table. We are ready for it and have said that several times. But the decision of the people in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson we will not negotiate. This choice has been made and Russia will not betray it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s call for negotiations and implicit nuclear threats are aimed at both Ukraine and the West; he likely incorrectly assesses that his nuclear brinksmanship will lead the United States and its allies to pressure Ukraine to negotiate. As ISW wrote in May: “The Kremlin could threaten to use nuclear weapons against a Ukrainian counteroffensive into annexed territory to deter the ongoing Western military aid that would enable such a counteroffensive.” However, Ukraine and its international backers have made clear that they will not accept negotiations at gunpoint and will not renounce Ukraine’s sovereign right to its territories. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on September 20, “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.” Where does this leave Putin, then, and what are the actual prospects for the Russian use of nuclear weapons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISW cannot forecast the point at which Putin would decide to use nuclear weapons. Such a decision would be inherently personal, but Putin’s stated red lines for nuclear weapon use have already been crossed in this war several times over without any Russian nuclear escalation. Reported Ukrainian cross-border raids into Belgorod Oblast and strikes against Russian-occupied Crimea could arguably meet the stated Russian nuclear use threshold of “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.” Putin framed Ukraine as posing an existential threat to Russian sovereignty repeatedly at the start of his full-scale invasion — a phrase that meets that stated threshold: “For our country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation. … It is not only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions,” he said on February 24. Formal Russian nuclear doctrine is evidently not a deciding factor for Putin, who has reportedly been micromanaging this war down to the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has set in motion two major means short of nuclear use through which he will try to achieve his objectives: partial mobilization to replace Russian losses, and wintertime energy pressures on Europe to deter European support. He likely intends Russia’s ongoing mobilization to stabilize Russian positions and enable the temporary freezing of the conflict. He is unlikely to succeed; rushing thousands of untrained and unmotivated Russian men to the front will not meaningfully increase Russian combat power, particularly in places like western Luhansk oblast where the Ukrainian counteroffensives are making significant progress. Putin intends his second approach, curtailing natural gas exports to Europe, to fracture the Western consensus around supporting Ukraine and limit Western military aid to Ukrainian forces. This too is unlikely to succeed; Europe is in for a cold and difficult winter, yet the leaders of NATO and non-NATO European states have not faltered in their support for Ukrainian sovereignty and may increase that support in light of Russia’s illegal annexation even in the face of economic costs. European states are actively finding alternatives to Russian energy and will likely be far more prepared by winter 2023. It is difficult to assess what indicators Putin will use to evaluate the success of either effort. But both will take considerable time to bear fruit or to demonstrably fail, time Putin will likely take before considering a nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin would likely need to use multiple tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve his desired operational effect — freezing the front lines and halting Ukrainian counteroffensives. But the operational effect would need to outweigh the potentially very high costs of possible NATO retaliation. Putin might try a nuclear terror attack against one or more major Ukrainian population centers or critical infrastructure in hopes of shocking Ukraine into surrender or the West into cutting off aid to Ukraine. Such attacks would be highly unlikely to force Ukraine or the West to surrender, however, and would be tremendous gambles of the sort that Putin has historically refused to take. Ukraine’s government and people have repeatedly demonstrated their will to continue fighting, and the West would find it very challenging simply to surrender in the face of such horrific acts because of the precedent such surrender would set. Putin is therefore far more likely to use nuclear weapons to change the operational environment, if he uses them at all. We assess Putin has two main tactical nuclear weapon use options: striking key Ukrainian ground lines of communication nodes and command centers to paralyze Ukrainian offensive operations, and/or striking major Ukrainian force concentrations near the line of contact. A single nuclear weapon would not be decisive against either of these target sets. Putin would likely need to use several tactical nuclear weapons across Ukraine to achieve significant effects and disrupt Ukraine’s ability to conduct counteroffensives. The scale of nuclear use likely required would raise the risks of Western retaliation, likely increasing the potential costs Putin would have to weigh against the likely temporary benefits the strikes themselves might provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian nuclear use would therefore be a massive gamble for limited gains that would not achieve Putin’s stated war aims. At best, Russian nuclear use would freeze the front lines in their current positions and enable the Kremlin to preserve its currently occupied territory in Ukraine. Russian nuclear use would not enable Russian offensives to capture the entirety of Ukraine (the Kremlin’s original objective for their February 2022 invasion). Russian military doctrine calls for the Russian Armed Forces to be able to effectively fight on a nuclear battlefield, and the “correct” doctrinal use of tactical nuclear weapons would involve tactical nuclear strikes to punch holes in Ukrainian lines, enabling Russian mechanized units to conduct an immediate attack through the targeted area and drive deep into Ukrainian rear areas. The degraded, hodgepodge Russian forces currently operating in Ukraine cannot currently conduct effective offensive operations even in a non-nuclear environment. They will be flatly unable to operate on a nuclear battlefield. DNR/LNR proxy units, Wagner Group fighters, BARS reservist units, and the depleted remnants of the Russian conventional units that actually exercised fighting on a nuclear battlefield in annual exercises — not to mention newly mobilized replacements shipped to the front lines with less than a week of training — will not have the equipment, training, and morale necessary to conduct offensive operations following nuclear use. NATO is additionally likely to respond to Russian nuclear weapon use in Ukraine with conventional strikes on Russian positions there. Russian use of multiple weapons (which would be required to achieve decisive operational effects) would only increase the likelihood and scale of a Western conventional response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more confident Putin is that nuclear use will not achieve decisive effects but will draw direct Western conventional military intervention in the conflict, the less likely he is to conduct a nuclear attack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mason Clark, Katherine Lawlor, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">Putin did not threaten an immediate nuclear attack to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensives into Russian-occupied Ukraine during his speech claiming Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/t3l4t5Q.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/t3l4t5Q.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mass, Mobl. &amp;amp; Reserve Forces</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-30-mass-mobl-reserve-forces.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mass, Mobl. &amp;amp; Reserve Forces" /><published>2022-09-30T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-30T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/mass-mobl-reserve-forces</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-30-mass-mobl-reserve-forces.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of mass. Quantity has a quality all of its own, but regular soldiers are expensive. Most of the Ukrainians fighting in the current war are not regular soldiers, and reserve units like the valiant Azov battalion, who held Mariupol for so long, have played a critical role.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our European allies have grown, or are growing, volunteer reserves to constitute a large component of an affordable peacetime framework that can deliver capacity in the event of war. As an island nation whose armed forces have an expeditionary focus, our best comparators are our Anglophone counterparts in the Five Eyes pact – countries that share an expeditionary focus and a tradition of voluntarism rather than conscription. They too have a much greater emphasis on reserves than does the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons ranging from the First World War to Operation Herrick suggest that citizen soldiers can perform strongly – sometimes truly remarkably – when they have trained and played together and when they deploy with the right, volunteer, leadership. In contrast, repeated use of UK reserves to provide individual augmentees for regular units at the end of operations in Afghanistan disenfranchised the reserve officer cadre, and it has taken years to partially recover. To rebuild UK armed forces for mass, we need to focus on proven principles for the volunteer reserves, while bringing in the latest technologies and ideas from the civilian world. Reserve forces have done this very often in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Army element of the Integrated Review, Future Soldier, proposes a structure which both wrecks the ‘offer’ to officers and strikes at the heart of unit spirit by reducing unit size below viability for realistic training; it includes a 10% cut in reserve establishments and strips the infantry of most of its anti-tank weapons and mortars, destroying their credibility as formed units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of these detrimental proposals is compounded by several other factors: a recruiting apparatus wholly controlled by regular officers turned off efforts for much of last year to concentrate on regulars; a whole series of mobilisation experiments have ended in muddle because of an absence of reserve expertise in the departments concerned; and the pipeline for special-to-arm training is uneven in quality, with much of it delivering a sluggish, repetitive experience for soldiers who are required to have a higher educational standard than their regular counterparts. Not surprisingly, reserve numbers are falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a more fundamental level, all our major Five Eyes partners have their reserves grouped in regional brigades (as Britain used to do), and in their case such brigades are commanded by reservists. Instead, for a generation, our reserves have been woven into the UK’s byzantine regular brigade structure, with units answering to different commanders in different parts of the country for operations, on the one hand, and for recruiting and administration on the other. The introduction of regional brigades recommended in this paper would solve the problem of split authorities and remove the geographic- and command-span complexities of the current model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming reshaping under the auspices of the Integrated Review, and the prospect of more resources for defence, offer an opportunity to reconsider the shape and use of the reserves. A target should be to expand the Army Reserve from roughly one-third to approximately 80% the size of the Regular Army, in line with the average of the UK’s Anglophone sister countries. This should include substantially increasing the current shrunken establishment of units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural reforms are also needed. Some of these are in governance at the Defence level. Reserve budgets should be separately identified and ringfenced to prevent them becoming the first port of call for cuts, and a new three-star reserve post should be introduced with direct access to ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements to recruiting are needed, with a much greater focus on attracting students and driving down the long delays in the process. Training should be more modularised and more often delivered by units themselves or regionally by (reserve-led) Army Training Units. Those arms schools where progress in distribution and modularisation lags behind should be required to introduce ‘competency-based’ training whereby individuals can take rigorous tests without taking the course, introducing competition into training. Reserve units should be restored to regional brigades, and those should be commanded by part-time reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass is back in the news as we watch a whole nation mobilised and fighting in Ukraine. Technology is more important than ever, and reservists come from the civilian world, where technology use is more advanced – as can be seen in the astonishingly fast development of the Lewes bomb by the (citizen-led) SAS in the Second World War or in the innovations reservists have recently provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Britain needs more fighting power delivered through reserves as an affordable route to mass, and reservists must have a greater role in leading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague commented in The Times on 2 May 2022: ‘Higher spending needs to go into the necessities of large-scale and lengthy warfare … [including] the ability to mobilise a far larger, trained reserve within our own populations. Britain … needs many more reservists.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s 2021 Integrated Review (published before Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine) and NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept highlight Russia as the most acute threat to European security. These publications, and the Chief of the General Staff in his address at the RUSI Land Warfare Conference, refocus attention on the need to prepare the British Armed Forces for state conflict against a peer adversary in Europe. This marks a significant change in emphasis for forces that have become optimised for operations further afield, beyond the core NATO area. Force design choices need to respond to this shift in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for Ukraine has shifted the military spotlight back to the critical issue of army mass, in several dimensions: numbers of deployable manoeuvre formations; the quantities of infantry (thickened with anti-armour and anti-air components) required to protect long lines of communications for deployed formations; and the number of engineers needed to keep these lines open. There are also the challenging manpower requirements for guarding vulnerable civilian populations and assets far from the fighting. The Ukraine conflict reminds us of the endless manpower required in urban warfare to rotate exhausted troops. In the air, superior numbers of Russian aircraft have had an impact, but neither side has managed to establish air superiority, enabling drones to disrupt the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has prepared for this war since 2014, having to balance the cost of developing effective defence forces with the need to grow the country’s economy. This has meant a small but highly capable regular army, with reserve forces providing both ground-holding mass – including in Mariupol, where a National Guard unit, the Azov Regiment, was the last force standing – and a second echelon for most force types, including infantry and artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Russia has emphasised greater professionalisation, de-emphasising its reserves and conscripts, and has focused on modernising its equipment. Russia’s combat formations have shrunk into small but complex and unwieldy battalion tactical groups so understaffed that they have been unable to train or fight as they should; its fleet does not dare close with the Ukrainian coast, and its air force often operates in tactically unsound single sorties. Initially, President Vladimir Putin was reluctant to mobilise and deploy many of his 2 million mostly ex-conscript reservists (almost his only source of fresh personnel), including as replacements for officers, who have died in considerable numbers. This left a tired army with no means of rotating fought-out units, although Putin has announced plans to increase the size of the Russian armed forces, including 137,000 additional combat troops. He has, however, now acknowledged the challenges his army faces and agreed to a partial mobilisation. Whether this will be enough to replace his losses and allow exhausted units some relief and the opportunity to reconstitute remains to be seen. The public reaction, as losses continue, will be an important factor in determining his confidence in mobilising further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Armed Forces have been reduced in size since 1990 and are now substantially smaller than those that faced a threatening Soviet Union during the Cold War. The reduction in the regular forces has been accompanied by a commitment to the Army Reserve, including in the Integrated Review. A major study, the Reserve Forces Review 2030 (RF30), was commissioned as an opportunity to address some of the issues with the Reserve as the geo-strategic environment moved from expeditionary operations – addressed in a previous report entitled Future Reserves 2020 (FR20) – to a focus on state-based threats within an era of ‘great power competition’. While providing a helpful framing of what the Reserve could do, and highlighting critical personnel, operational and cultural matters, RF30 was written before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and thus does not provide a full blueprint for resetting the Reserve component in light of the current threat. So far it has not attracted a formal response from the UK government, which we must hope is because the lessons from the illegal invasion of Ukraine are being evaluated and will lead to clearer direction for the Reserve. The lack of a response may, however, be because the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is unable to properly direct and hold the single services to account on capability matters – almost all of the military advisers to ministers are regular officers, and regular staff may, consciously or unconsciously, seek to protect their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Future Soldier’, the British Army’s published blueprint on the future of its forces, outlines an expanded role for the Army Reserve, although the Reserve’s shape is still under consideration and, worryingly, the blueprint includes a 10% reduction in its trained strength. The government has, however, stated that ‘[t]hese figures are subject to change pending any potential future TLB [top-level budget] review’. The RAF has announced an intention to double its (albeit small) reserves to 5,000, but firm plans for delivering on this are not yet available. Strategic Command is looking to expand its use of reservists, not least in cyber. The Royal Navy’s plans for the Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Marines Reserve, which are also small, have not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Churchill’s observation that ‘[t]he farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see’, this paper examines lessons from history and recent operations on how large-scale mobilisation has operated, using reserves and other means to achieve mass, and does so in comparison with the UK’s closest allies. There are important issues across all the services, but this paper aims to illustrate the limitations of the current approach to the Army Reserve and suggests improvements through comparison with the UK’s principal Five Eyes partners – the US, Australia and Canada – and reference to historical examples. Reserves exist primarily to provide mass in war while being affordable in peacetime, but they have two other roles: maintaining links between the regular armed forces and wider society; and access to specialist skills from civilian life, from medical training to emergent technologies. Ukraine reminds us that whole nations fight successful wars at scale, not just professional armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main factors which make the UK’s three principal Five Eyes partners the most relevant comparators. First, all four countries share an expeditionary model; in contrast, the proximity of many of the UK’s Northern and Eastern European allies on Russia leads them to focus on the direct threat of invasion. For example, Finland and Norway both have reserve forces much larger than their regular forces, and many Eastern European countries are expanding their reserves (though their position is clearly different). Second, the UK’s nearest neighbour and comparator, France (along with Italy), has a large-scale Gendarmerie, cross-trained as soldiers, including light armoured special forces and other specialist elements. These are full-time police officers, but in war and homeland emergencies they supplement the regular armed forces. The UK is unlikely to adopt this approach. Third, most of the UK’s continental allies used conscription a generation ago, and some, including Germany (which has nevertheless indicated an intention to substantially expand its volunteer reserves), used conscription much more recently. In contrast, apart from comparatively short periods of National Service in the UK after the Second World War and in the US during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, none of the Five Eyes countries has operated conscription at scale outside the envelope of a world war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is evidence-based. It has drawn heavily on the author’s experience as a reservist and as a minister, and on his extensive visits to reserve units in the UK, in the Five Eyes countries and on operations over many years. It is confined to the British Army volunteer reserves; the case for updating arrangements for individual ex-regular reservists is well made elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of three chapters. Chapter I offers an evaluation of the current state of the British Army Reserve, citing comparisons with relevant international partners. Chapter II provides an analysis of a series of campaigns, examining how structures in peacetime, when resources were necessarily limited, enabled – or otherwise – large-scale expansion in war and how successful were the non-regular forces concerned, especially in the crucial early stages of war. The focus on early stages reflects the fact that during major wars of significant duration the elements blur, but pre-existing reserve structures help to determine what mass is available, and at what standard. The paper also argues that some characteristics of reserve soldiering, if carried on during such wars, can help to promote esprit de corps. Chapter III proposes a model for the British Army Reserve that responds to the current threat and to historical lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size-and-laydown&quot;&gt;Size and Laydown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of the British Army Reserve is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n7pzJDb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: British Army Reserve as at 1 January 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-2022/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-1-january-2022#future-reserves-2020-fr20-programme-monitoring&quot;&gt;MoD, ‘Quarterly Service Personnel Statistics 1 January 2022’, 2 September 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trained strength figure in Table 1 includes those who have completed initial basic (Phase 1) training but not their initial trade (Phase 2) training. It also includes many soldiers who have not trained for a year, partly as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. It is difficult to get a completely accurate picture of the readiness of the Army Reserve, as measures of individual readiness are not regularly published. When not mobilised, Army Reserve forces (including the costs of equipment, infrastructure, training, etc.) cost roughly one-fifth as much as their regular counterparts, making them an attractive option for providing mass in war, and more affordable in peacetime. Despite this, one of the most obvious differences between the reserve forces of the major Five Eyes countries today is in proportionate size, as illustrated in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZoJDmee.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second difference between the UK and its sister countries relates to laydown. Most reserve units in the US, Canada and Australia are in geographically concentrated brigades, whereas in the UK brigades are often scattered around the country, with even individual units sometimes spread across regions. The UK also has a complicated split between operational and regional command, creating a ‘warlords and landlords’ scenario. All this generates time-consuming complexity when, in reserve matters, time is already stretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-progress&quot;&gt;Areas of Progress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been useful progress in five areas since the FR20 report painted its dismal picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officer recruitment: By 2011, the smallest reserve course at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) had only seven officers, and none of the courses had more than about 30. Recently, summer courses have typically attracted 100 (the maximum). Nevertheless, the number of young officers remains a serious problem across many units, but quantifying this is difficult as the MoD has stopped counting reserve officers separately in its quarterly statistics – although it continues to do so for regulars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Representation: Genuine reservists – that is, people who have extensive experience combining a civilian job with reserve service – are better represented in the upper echelons of the service. When the FR20 survey was commissioned, the only reserve two-star post was the tri-service post of assistant chief of the defence staff (reserves and cadets). Today there is a major general on the Army Board and a second one as deputy commander field army, and the number of reserve brigadiers has doubled, although senior reserve representation in the crucial area of RMAS has been diminished and the total count is still proportionately smaller than that of the other Five Eyes countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terms and conditions: Terms and conditions of service have improved, with pensions introduced and provision for physiotherapy for those suffering injuries during training. There is room for improvement, notably in relation to wider medical access, but the situation is less dire than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognition: The establishment of the Armed Forces Covenant and gold, silver and bronze awards for employers has made many organisations more reserve-friendly, although in some cases the policy has not trickled down to the working level. Sadly, advances in this area do not seem to be matched by MoD understanding of employers’ reasonable needs on mobilisation, as we shall see below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration: The unit pairing mechanism has enabled better relationships and mutual support between regular and reserve components. Pairing is reliant on personalities, reasonable proximity geographically, and on having a high commonality of role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many other respects, however, the picture is bleak, and the emerging outline plans do not seem to be based on a comprehensive understanding of the Army Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruitment&quot;&gt;Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic hit the Reserve hard, but this was exacerbated by the Army abandoning reserve recruiting and cancelling many induction weekends in 2021 to allow it to focus on regulars. The breakdown in the online recruiting system (the Defence Recruitment System) and the inadequacies of the paper alternative are widely known, but they came on top of a situation in which delays of up to a whole year were not uncommon. It takes a highly motivated recruit to continue to wait. This has been compounded by the decision, taken in order to reduce risk, to slow the pace of Phase 1 training for the Reserve, which has led, anecdotal evidence suggests, to a substantial increase in wastage – although official figures are not available. The modest attempt in autumn 2021 to relaunch reserve recruitment was, astonishingly, carried out without any coordination with units themselves or the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Associations (RFCA), which provides links to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new contract is being let for Army recruiting – a sensible move after all the failures of the current system. The previous contract was established with little regard for reservists, yet recruiting of reserves was handed over at the same time, and it took years to adjust it to operate even passably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unit-structure&quot;&gt;Unit Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build and maintain a healthy volunteer unit, a vicious circle has to be broken. Soldiers are motivated by challenging training, but to deliver interesting collective training, numbers are needed. The vital ground in this is ‘critical mass’ – getting enough soldiers together in a particular training period for realistic training to become viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, reserve units were large enough to provide this ability to train en masse, but nowadays reserve units are much smaller. Although regular units have also shrunk, a reserve unit’s establishment includes soldiers who have not passed Phase 2 training and so cannot participate in all activities. To take an example, a reserve infantry battalion’s establishment has in recent times largely mirrored a regular one, at 440 people, with rifle companies at nominally 100. But even when up to strength (and, post-COVID, few are), reservists’ other commitments mean that turnout on any one weekend will never be 100%. Moreover, soldiers who have not completed their Phase 2 training cannot fully participate but are still included in the total. The result can swiftly become a cycle of small turnouts leading to an inability to conduct realistic training, in turn leading to fewer people attending training and ultimately to falling retention levels (and readiness and operational capability). Despite this, a new proposal calls for further cuts in reserve unit establishments to meet the 10% cut in overall Army Reserve numbers. Worse, in the case of the infantry the bulk of the cuts (if confirmed) are in support weapons, including two-thirds of anti-tank weapons and mortars – ironically one of the few areas in which the reserves are well equipped. The last time the main threat stemmed from Russia, the Territorial Army (TA) provided potent and validated blocking units equipped with anti-tank missiles (more difficult to operate than today’s, which can be trained quickly), and mortars that have not physically changed in decades. The US, Canada and Australia all have a full suite of mortars and anti-tank weapons within their reserve orders of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new proposal – set against the background of the Ukraine war – sends a message to reserve infantry units that they are not taken seriously for warfighting, except to backfill regular units. The focus on backfilling regular units has had a devastating impact on the reserve officer corps, which is discussed later in the section on Afghanistan. The proposal threatens to take the Army Reserve back to the position it was in at the time of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review that resulted in a need to reset the approach under the FR20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consideration has been given to creating further hybrid units in specialist areas comprising both regular and reserve soldiers. This is unwise: earlier experiments with hybrid brigades in the 1990s were unsuccessful. In Australia, regulars made up 20% of the 7 th Brigade in Brisbane, while in Canada, regulars comprised 10% of the Reserve Brigade in British Columbia. The UK has had more recent hybrid arrangements, including amalgamating regular and reserve Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiments into two hybrid regiments. Australia and Canada have ‘de-hybridised’, and the UK has largely done the same. The US National Guard eschews hybrid units except for a few small, specialist pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why hybrid units have failed are various. Regular soldiers with busy military commitments, who are often away from their families, were expected to work evenings and weekends with reservists. For the Reserve, there was a collapse in officer numbers stemming from a lack of understanding of how the volunteer leadership ethos fits around civilian jobs – although good regular commanding officers can make a bad system work for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;individual-training&quot;&gt;Individual Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most individual training was delivered within units, but this function has recently become much more centralised. This can ensure uniform standards and allows access to equipment that is too expensive to be available across many locations, but taking soldiers away from their units works against critical mass and undermines unit cohesion. This is particularly noticeable in basic training. The organisations which deliver Phase 1 training seem to regard training itself as the sole aim, ignoring the importance of building ties of comradeship. Many follow the practice of mixing soldiers from different units across platoons so that precious formative experiences are not shared with future comrades. (In the US National Guard, units can specify that their recruits are kept together.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friendships and fellow feeling do much to bring a soldier in on a parade night after a hard week at work – and it was the ties of comradeship that built British soldiers’ spirit in earlier conflicts. Because regular soldiers live and work in their units, they seldom understand how much harder it is to develop comradeship in a reserve unit. The very few units which do carry out their own basic training, principally the Honourable Artillery Company and 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, are strong on retaining those who complete the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wider problem with UK training, which is a theme in the RF30 report and has repeatedly been raised by the CRFCA External Scrutiny Team (EST): failing to optimise the time of soldiers with busy day jobs, rather than simply defaulting to sending them on regular courses, matching civilian working hours at distant establishments. After all, reservists are required to have higher educational attainment than regulars precisely to allow accelerated learning, which would suit both their capacity and their available time. The temptation to demand that a reservist must achieve full regular equivalence in order to be regarded as safe or competent has proven difficult to resist for some. Given the limited time that a reservist can devote to the Army, for those in areas for which there is no civilian comparator, such as infantry, this runs the risk of them doing a little of everything and being good at nothing. It is better to narrow the aperture and be good at a subset of activities, and to have a predetermined plan for how to train for the rest on mobilisation. That training must not only fit within the time available, but must also be engaging. It should be demanding and hard if it is to be rewarding and retain the right soldiers, not pedestrian and box-ticking, which it can be today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the Army understand this. The EST notes that some arms schools, notably Chatham and Larkhill, have found ways of modularising training and devolving elements to units on an accredited basis. Distance learning has expanded. Unfortunately, some corps remain behind the curve, with Bovington and Leconfield notorious for making civilians duplicate, at a snail’s pace, driving skills that they already – at least in part – possess (two weeks for a reservist with a driving licence to drive a Land Rover). Given the effort that the Army has spent on accrediting its courses to allow regular personnel to achieve civilian qualifications, it is surprising that it does not always see the value in directly recognising civilian qualifications and offering shorter military conversion courses where necessary. This would maximise the potential in the reserves that is currently untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Australians use competency-based training in some areas, cutting through the above issues of decentralisation and civilian skill recognition. The principle is that, where appropriate, the soldier can take the test without doing the course. This allows an impartial assessment of their skills, whether learned at the military school, in the unit or in civilian life. Competency-based training is not a universal panacea, and it still requires military schools to modularise so that reservists can take the test at the appropriate stage. The Canadian approach is simply to modularise and allow a higher proportion of courses to be delivered in-unit, accredited by training schools. Time at the arms schools is critical in establishing the ethos of the corps concerned, but this does not mean that all parts of the courses should be delivered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;officer-training&quot;&gt;Officer Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMAS has a good system, with four two-week packages that can be delivered either as one eight-week period (ideal for students), or separately. The first two are also available in University Officers’ Training Corps (UOTCs). After that, however, the UK’s officer training lags behind that of its comparators. The quality and shape of Phase 2 training varies across the arms schools, with Chatham and Larkhill arguably performing best for officers as well, but no other Anglophone country spends so little time on officer Phase 2 training. This partly reflects the higher proportion of students recruited as officers and other ranks in the UK’s sister countries. Many US states fund generous fee waivers to encourage students to join the National Guard, but, while published figures are hard to find, visits by the author to Australian and Canadian reserves found large numbers of students across a range of units and ranks, without any such incentives. Students are ‘time rich and cash poor’, but in the UK, Phase 2 training often occurs during term time, failing to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On promotion to major, regular officers attend the Intermediate Command and Staff Course (Land Reserves) before fulfilling sub-unit command or staff roles, learning about fighting formations, UK resilience, and command and staff skills, with some global context and management of the Army. For reservists, the 26-week Regular course is pared down to a series of weekends and a fortnight’s residential module, and reservists often complete it while fulfilling their Reserve appointment. This very short course, combined with a demanding role commanding a sub-unit, often intersects with the attendee having both a young family and a busy civilian career, leading to heavy pressure on the individual and – arguably – a poor template for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On promotion to lieutenant colonel, Army reservists join their Air and Maritime colleagues on the Advanced Command and Staff Course (Reserves) (ACSC(R)). This delivers a taste of the Regular ACSC (which lasts an academic year) in a single fortnight, with a preparatory weekend and some additional learning in between. It supposedly involves developing an intellectual edge and an understanding of military, political and international issues for a reserve cohort that will almost exclusively spend the rest of their careers in single services roles. As a reservist should in any event be bringing alternative perspectives and critical thinking from their civilian career, this may not be an optimal use of their time. No Staff College reserve directing staff teaching posts exist; instead, reserve staff courses rely on ad hoc arrangements to borrow staff. Besides raising quality issues, this means the Reserve has no opportunity to use the ACSC to develop its rising stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, all three of the UK’s comparators offer the ‘extended period out’ approach for staff college training, although the arrangements vary (as do those for their regular officers). For example, a Canadian regular or reserve officer can do a distance learning alternative to the 10-month residential Joint Command and Staff Programme in two one-year modules, using weekends, remote work and an annual fortnight; this can cover the whole regular course or just the first module, which itself provides a valuable experience. This seems a much better approach, offering concentrated, rigorous learning without compromising unit service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilisation&quot;&gt;Mobilisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RF30 quotes an Army Reserve commanding officer as saying, ‘I have found mobilisation to be poorly understood by almost ‘everybody… Readiness is largely a paperwork exercise’. The report goes on to make extensive recommendations to improve mobilisation arrangements, noting that Exercise Agile Stance is designed to address mobilisation problems. The EST observed in its last two reports that mobilisation arrangements did not work well for pandemic support (Operation Rescript), attributing this to ‘limited expertise or corporate memory in the MOD (Security Policy and Operations (SPO)) – the MOD’s operations cell – Standing Joint Command (SJC) HQ and Land Operations Centre (LOC)’. It is not yet clear whether Agile Stance will address this deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many reservists came forward to volunteer under Operation Rescript, soldiers were often stood up and stood down again, creating issues for reserves with their families and civilian employers. Liaison with employers, whose attitudes were mostly generous, was weak, despite the Defence Relationship Management staff (operating under the wing of the RFCAs) working hard to bolster goodwill with awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units can only be credible if they have the right equipment. Take armour as an example. The armoured brigades in the US National Guard have the same scale as their regular counterparts. In Canada and Australia, reserves have only armoured recce, but both have the number of light armoured vehicles they need to train effectively: Textron Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicles in Canada, Bushmasters in Australia. The UK has a single regiment to provide reserve Challenger tank crews, which is reliant on its regular counterparts for borrowing armour. Proximity allows this to work reasonably well, but the UK’s three reserve armoured reconnaissance regiments are each equipped only with eight well-used Jackal vehicles each, averaging less than two vehicles per squadron. The squadrons are a long way apart and, lacking a budget for low-loaders, vehicles can only be concentrated for squadron training by further wearing them out on long journeys – and misemploying busy staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is compounded by an issue which applies across the Army Reserve. A decade ago, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers detachments were withdrawn and concentrated. The CRFCA EST has repeatedly reported on the damaging effect that this has had on vehicle maintenance and availability. The Army has not restored the arrangement, despite the impact on Army Reserve capability (and the absence of obvious cost implications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal equipment is also important to both quality of training and morale. In the 1980s, a TA soldier in combat dress was indistinguishable from a regular. Today, the former is more likely to have older pattern webbing, body armour and weapon modification standards, giving the impression that reserves are not valued. Similarly, a reservist working on an overseas exercise will not usually be eligible for the same allowances for deployment as a regular, nor even the same protections in case of injury. While perhaps small in absolute terms, the impact is significant and profound for volunteers who join in the hope of ‘belonging’ to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;buildings&quot;&gt;Buildings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reserve units to thrive, they need to operate from good-quality buildings that are practical, secure and provide an atmosphere conducive to training and social events. Some units have such facilities, but some sites are in a terrible state. This has recently been compounded by the failure of the Army to replace caretakers as they retire. Furthermore, whereas in the past the RFCAs had great independence in managing the sites, they do not enjoy the same delegated powers as the Army has for – usually far more expensive – regular sites. Given that the RFCAs can often draw on a wide range of pro-bono expertise in areas from estate management to accountancy, marketing and law, the disenfranchising of the RFCAs is depriving Defence of the value they can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress since the FR20 report, serious challenges remain if the value of the Army Reserve is to be harnessed to greatest effect, and if the Reserve is to be able to respond to the heightened threats that the UK currently faces. These challenges include how the reserves are configured, recruited, regulated, rewarded and supported. History offers some lessons for how these issues might be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-mobilisation-and-reserves-in-history-and-recent-operations&quot;&gt;II. Mobilisation and Reserves in History and Recent Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the UK and its major Five Eyes allies offers some important lessons into how the Army Reserve can be used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-world-war-reserve-cohesion&quot;&gt;First World War: Reserve Cohesion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1908, Richard (later Lord) Haldane introduced the plan laying the foundations for Britain’s subsequent war effort. It envisaged six regular divisions, backed by 14 territorial ones. When war broke out, the then newly appointed secretary of state for war, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, announced that he ‘could take no account of any but regular soldiers’ and started raising general service divisions known as ‘Kitchener divisions’. Parliament effectively overruled him, and the Territorial Force was called out, with six territorial divisions following the six regular ones to France and Belgium. More territorial formations were sent to various overseas locations (including Egypt and India) early in the war, in order to release regular forces, and several territorial divisions fought at Gallipoli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Territorials were raised locally, and the ‘Pledge’ – that those raised and trained together would be kept together – was applied for most of the war, despite a series of attempts to undermine it by the War Office. In practice, heavily influenced by Parliament and the county associations, many of the Kitchener divisions developed in a similar fashion. A key ‘characteristic of the New Armies [was] their social cohesion, which gave them their own distinctive esprit de corps. This was partly the result of the [regional] manner in which they were raised, from which many units derived a powerful sense of local identity … [T]he men ate, slept and worked in the sections and platoons in which they were to fight in France and elsewhere’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, asserted that ‘without the assistance which the Territorials afforded between October 1914 and June 1915, it would have been impossible to hold the line in France and Belgium’. As Kitchener divisions came up to speed, the three elements of the Army – Regular, Territorial and General Service – operated in parallel. Dominic Graham comments: ‘That [the British Army] fought as well as it did in 1915 and 1916, when its regular cadre had been virtually destroyed in the opening months of the war, is remarkable. That it ended the war in 1918 as the most effective force on the Western Front is astonishing.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominions – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa – had tiny regular forces at the outbreak of the war, but substantial citizen forces. These were deployed under a range of different models, but each was locally raised, and they stressed unit cohesion. In the final breakout for the Hundred Days Offensive, at the Battle of Amiens, of the three infantry corps in the Army selected to lead the attack, one was Canadian and another Australian. 50 The Canadian corps was commanded by Sir Arthur Currie, an estate agent, and the Australian corps by Sir John Monash, a civil engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-world-war-understanding-the-reserves&quot;&gt;Second World War: Understanding the Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the First World War it was agreed that the Territorial Army (as it was now known) should take the full role of providing follow-on formations in any future conflict. Despite this, the Territorials were reduced in number and so poorly resourced that, for many, training virtually ceased. In early 1939 the decision was taken to double the size of the TA, but this was implemented in a haphazard fashion. Instead of allowing existing units to prepare for war and then reallocating their training staff to build up the next tier, in many cases units were simply broken in half and backfilled with – often unwilling – conscripts, presumably in the belief that this would be quicker. The Pledge on unit integrity was abandoned, and overall effectiveness suffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, eight of the 13 British Expeditionary Force divisions deployed to France were reserve divisions – and three of them were selected for the final stand on the Dunkirk perimeter as the rest of the Army evacuated. One, the 46th Division, only deployed with light weapons for pioneer duties, yet that perimeter held. The early defence of Calais was conducted by a single Rifle territorial battalion until its two regular sister battalions arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for the first half of the war the UK’s armies were driven back in every campaign around the world, sometimes, as in North Africa and Malaya, by smaller enemy forces. The Narvik campaign provides an illustration of how the ‘pick-and-mix’ muddle in manning – in contrast to the careful honing of unit cohesion and spirit in the First World War – undermined performance. Some units had barely even paraded together before getting on the ships, let alone honed the links of comradeship over years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the First World War, each dominion’s model for its citizen forces was different, but they retained the same broad approach, with an emphasis on units with strong cohesion based on local links. And the strong performance of the dominion reserve units is illustrated by the fact that the division which stopped Rommel’s Africa Korps as he swept the 8th Army eastward in 1941 was the Australian 9th Division, commanded by schoolteacher Major General Leslie Morshead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most successful theatre commanders, Montgomery and Slim, despite sharply contrasting characters, both recognised the differences in style and approach needed for leadership of citizen soldiers. Slim, whose astonishing achievements in Burma are widely recognised, was a pre-First World War territorial who did his officer training at Birmingham UOTC. Montgomery commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Britain goes to war the ranks of her armed forces are filled with men from civil life who are not soldiers, sailors, or airmen by profession: and who never wanted to be … [The citizen soldier] can think, he can appreciate, and he is definitely prepared to criticise. He wants to know what is going on, and what you want him to do – and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characteristically, Montgomery claimed this as his own (and modern) insight. In fact, George Washington’s inspector of his eclectic civilian army commented in a letter to a fellow professional two centuries earlier: ‘You say to your soldier “Do this[”,] and he doeth it … ; but I am obliged to say [to the American citizen soldier]: “This is the reason why you ought to do that[”,] and then he does it.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of Montgomery’s divisions showed early excellence. The Australian 9th Division near Tobruk was an inexperienced citizen formation that was commanded by Morshead. It had arrived only two weeks earlier, without heavy weapons, and had equipped itself from a captured Italian armoury. Despite these unpromising circumstances, the Australians held the Africa Korps at Tobruk. The 51st Highland Division was grouped with the 9th and the New Zealand Division, spearheading the breakout at El Alamein. Its (regular) commander General Douglas Wimberley had gone to extraordinary lengths to emphasise divisional identity – he ‘made every single one of them believe that he was a Highlander, whatever his birth certificate said to the contrary’. However, unit performance declined sharply when he handed over to a successor less interested in unit identity. The transfer occurred against a background of lingering resentment from the Salerno mutiny, which occurred when dozens of the unit’s soldiers were posted to other divisions after recovering from wounds. The importance of unit cohesion is clear. In the Second World War the dominions seemed to be better at understanding citizen soldiers – almost all their senior commanders in both world wars were from their militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF’s reserves make an interesting comparison to those of the Army, with the former showing consistent excellence even from the beginning of the war. Unlike many in the interwar Army, the RAF’s Lord Trenchard was a passionate believer in the importance of civilian volunteer units. He established the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) in 1925, ‘as a corps d’elite … Esprit de corps was to be the dominating force in the squadrons and each, therefore was to have a well-equipped HQ, mess and life of its own’. AAF squadrons shot down the first German bombers of the war, provided 14 squadrons in the Battle of Britain and accounted for the first V1 kill. An AAF squadron was also selected to be the first to fly jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Britain, the US had a long tradition of the militia providing a large element of the fighting capability in all its wars, including the American Revolution, the Mexican War, the Civil War and the Spanish War. The US started the Second World War with a National Guard 18 divisions strong, which provided a large part of the US Army’s initial deployed strength (its regular army was much smaller). However, the National Guard suffered from some of the same problems as its UK counterpart, feeling less favoured for resourcing in interwar years and being backfilled with conscripts on mobilisation. Nevertheless, these were forces whose original members had trained together and shared geographic roots. Some of the US Army’s greatest achievements were by National Guard units, including many of the valiant defenders of the Bataan peninsula at the beginning of the Pacific War and, later, one of the two regimental combat teams that secured Omaha Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One element of the US Army with a strong sense of unit integrity were the airborne forces, which were overwhelmingly composed of wartime citizen volunteers. The ‘Band of Brothers’ concept was rigorously enforced, with soldiers always serving alongside those they had trained with. As with the British TA, the National Guard was not allowed to train recruits separately once the war had started, and the casualty re-posting policy (which theoretically did apply to all US soldiers) was more rigorously applied in the airborne forces, where recovered casualties were always restored to their own units. Elite, all-volunteer units can be expected to perform highly, but the astonishing events during the Battle of the Bulge provide another stark comparison of the two approaches. US paratroopers, without heavy weapons or winter clothing, advanced through lines of fleeing US soldiers, picking up the kit that the latter had abandoned, and went on to halt Hitler’s last major western offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further interesting case study is the extraordinary performance of the US Marine Corps in the Second World War. It is widely noted that the Marine Corps expanded more than 30-fold during the war, from 15,000 active duty members to nearly half a million, while remaining an exceptionally high-quality force. These figures, however, disguise the efforts of successive commandants from 1925 onward to build capability and mass in their reserves, despite pitifully low funding. The Reserve was greatly expanded by the 1938 Naval Reserve Act (still two years ahead of funding and mobilisation measures across the US Armed Forces); 70% of all US Marines serving in the Second World War came through the Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vietnam-a-breach-between-the-armed-forces-and-society&quot;&gt;Vietnam: A Breach Between the Armed Forces and Society&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnam War was the first and only time in US history that the country’s armed forces fought at scale with no substantial militia element. As the war developed, the National Guard Association lobbied the president to keep the Guard out of it, on the basis that there was insufficient popular support to justify sending citizen soldiers. Instead of seeing this as a serious problem, the Pentagon acquiesced, brushing aside the civilian, political and social fabric into which the militia was woven and mobilised by conscription into the active Army. The forces deployed had an entirely regular spine, with every senior and middle-ranking army officer a regular, as there was no alternative pathway. Serving under these officers was a mass of conscript manpower, thrust in with no respect for geography, who were trained centrally and typically deployed as individuals – a toxic combination even before considering the deeply felt political and popular opposition to the war. Once it became apparent that the National Guard would not be called upon, it became a haven to avoid conscription, compounding the collapse in domestic support for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this experience came the Abrams Doctrine – the foundation for rebuilding the relationship between the US Armed Forces and the people, with the National Guard and Reserves at its heart. ‘They are not taking us to war again without calling up reserves’ became a key lesson. The object was not merely efficiency but forging and maintaining a bond with the American people. We see the obverse of this in Russia, where Putin’s need to maintain his popular base made him reluctant for so long to call out reserves for his so-called ‘special operation’ in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wider point applies here. British officers often comment enviously on the better relationship between the US Armed Forces and the civilian public than exists in the UK. Yet, after Vietnam, that relationship had become so toxic that many universities had closed down their Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and banned uniforms on their campuses. The current relationship was painfully rebuilt, and the National Guard – with its presence in every major population centre and its very public state-based role in disaster relief – was at the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iraq-200311-mobilisation-problems-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Iraq 2003–11: Mobilisation Problems in the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War, the US used reserves extensively, with regulars providing the bulk of the manoeuvre forces and the National Guard holding ground. The National and Air Guard alone provided over a quarter of a million deployed soldiers and airmen, while simultaneously deploying to Afghanistan and handling domestic crises including Hurricane Katrina. This was a remarkable example of all three main purposes of reserves: the availability of affordable mass; the tying in of public opinion through citizen-led deployments (unlike in Vietnam); and the usefulness of many of the specialist skills brought by the National Guard from civilian life – farmers, local government officials and police officers were able to assist in rebuilding the shattered local economy and social fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the US reserves were roughly two-fifths of the country’s armed forces, the UK’s were only around one-fifth, yet a huge mobilisation effort was mounted in the latter country too. Former Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Inge, commented: ‘In conclusion, I pay a huge tribute to the Territorial Army for what it has done and achieved … [T]he equivalent of 19 or 20 infantry battalions deployed on operations is a huge achievement and speaks volumes for their ability, commitment and dedication.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This included formed bodies ranging from a yeomanry unit in a CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) defence role to 131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, who made the front page of The Times, getting tanks across the Al-Faw peninsula under fire on D-Day of Operation Telic 1. From the infantry, large numbers of formed companies deployed for force protection duties. The whole of the Royal Naval Reserve Air Branch was mobilised for several months; it was used mostly to release regulars for the frontline, but members of the Air Branch went on to serve there and in Afghanistan. Large numbers of individuals were mobilised across all three services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the reserves had served the UK well, they had been treated shabbily in return. The previous large post-National Service mobilisation – Kosovo – had also been successful in terms of people volunteering, but had also led to widespread criticisms of the MoD’s handling of mobilisation, including notice periods of only a few days, soldiers being mailshotted without their units being informed, soldiers being called out and immediately stood down, and pay sometimes being months in arrears. One major improvement that had taken place between the two campaigns was the introduction of a mobilisation centre at Chilwell (now Bassingbourn), which copes with everything from work-up training for theatre to medical and dental screening. This purpose-designed facility was well run, but the unreasonably short notice periods for many called out for Iraq caused friction even between those most ready to serve and the best employers – a relationship that a reserve has to manage and which is not required of their regular counterpart. Over 200 call-out notices for Iraq were issued at under one week’s notice. Pay problems also continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;afghanistan-200121-the-importance-of-formed-bodies&quot;&gt;Afghanistan 2001–21: The Importance of Formed Bodies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the sacrifices and mobilisation mishaps in Iraq, the UK’s reserves responded well to the call to serve in Afghanistan as the two operations overlapped, heavily stretching the country’s regular forces. A range of formed sub-units was deployed. Brigadier (now Lieutenant General Sir) John Lorimer commented on a company of the Londons that was sent to him for force protection, but which – seeing their quality – he decided to feed into the fighting: ‘Somme Company was an outstanding body of men: well trained, highly motivated and exceptionally well led.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-units also deployed from Special Forces, the Yeomanry, the Intelligence Corps and the RAF Regiment, with one unit, 21 Special Air Service (Artists) (Reserve), winning three Military Crosses in a single deployment and a subsequent Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. Yet in 2008 it was decided that subsequent deployments should be by individual augmentees only. This approach, siphoning off junior ranks and leaving officers and non-commissioned officers behind (or offering them administrative jobs), broke the TA’s officer corps. As noted in the FR20 report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The shortfalls in Junior Officer … manning are particularly acute, hampered by under-resourced recruiting and lack of clarity over the TA’s purpose. Satisfaction has been affected by failures to deliver the Reservist Proposition for officers. In particular, the current emphasis on mobilising junior soldier individual augmentees has reduced both command and deployment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasted with the successful use of reserves by the Americans. As in Iraq, they formed a major component of the Army, Marine and Air Force presence. The National Guard deployed in brigades but was usually tasked in smaller groups. For example, an infantry regiment which the author visited had most of its platoons defending Provincial Reconstruction Teams along the border with Pakistan, while its HQ and remaining soldiers were responsible for security in US barracks. Overall, the US National Guard and (also part-time volunteer) US Army Reserve made up 45% of all deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australians and Canadians had smaller forces in theatre than the UK, but Australia deployed a formed commando squadron three times and the Canadian force included formed infantry platoons. Canada also had a different approach to augmentation. Reservist junior officers sometimes commanded augmented regular platoons and reserve sergeants commanded gun detachments. This appeared to reinforce the command structure, unlike the impact of a policy of using the reserves in augmentation roles for regular units under regular command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK and allied history is replete with examples of the successful – and unsuccessful – use of reserves in wars and campaigns as a route to mass which is affordable in peacetime. Some of the key lessons we can deduce are: the value of unit cohesion and use in formed bodies both to sustain fighting spirit and to attract quality officers; the importance of commanders understanding the different approach needed to lead citizen soldiers, often best handled by reservist commanders themselves; and the importance of those who organise mobilisation understanding reserves. More widely, we should recognise the value that reserves bring through their civilian skills and their critical role in connecting society more strongly with those who do its defending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-rebuilding-the-army-reserve-for-the-21st-century&quot;&gt;III. Rebuilding the Army Reserve for the 21st Century&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat landscape in the UK has shifted from a broadly defined global one to a much greater focus on Russia, although the (Army) ‘expeditionary concept’ was, for almost all of Britain’s history before 1990, focused on Europe. Even as an imperial power, planning for and mounting large-scale armies was aimed at the continent, except in the brief interval from the Seven Years War to the American Revolution. The UK needs mass again, as it did in the Cold War, and in land forces at least the extreme cost of regular personnel points to holding contingent mass in the reserve forces as the only affordable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars make their own demands. Peer-to-peer warfare brings the need to arrive fast and hard with a proportion of the force and then expand and sustain operations better than the adversary. Financial pragmatism and a desire to give the British people a good standard of living means that the UK will probably always have a small regular force, and its island status points to naval (and air) priority. That regular force must be capable of delivering the first strike largely on its own, thus buying time to bring up the supporting elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build mass and sustain combat, reserves are best placed to either deploy rapidly into defined roles – such as anti-tank defence, as practised in the Cold War – or, with a slight delay for training, into wider use to provide follow-on formations as regular ones are degraded or exhausted. The pledge of more money for Defence in the wake of Liz Truss’s arrival as prime minister should, in the Army’s case, be focused on upgrading equipment across land forces and expanding the reserves. A few thousand extra regulars will not alone provide the mass for the follow-on formations that may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the budget for reserves was absorbed into that of their regular counterparts a generation ago, as part of abandoning the Haldane model, regular officers have been able to raid reserve budgets, often seeing reserves simply as competitors for resources rather than as their own framework for expansion. The decision to cut reserve numbers at the same time as a cut in regular numbers seems to confirm this. The latest EST report has suggested ringfenced funding for mobilising reserves. The case for going further is that the two most successful structures for long-term governance for reserves – the Haldane model and the arrangements for the US National Guard – both stress differentiation as the key to a successful reserve component, from separate funding arrangements to separate sites. This is in sharp contrast to those who argue today that we should even assimilate the governing legislation. Yet the National Guard is arguably the best-integrated reserve in the Anglophone world, working – in formed bodies – alongside regular counterparts worldwide. It is therefore proposed that the UK restore a separate budget to the Army Reserve, with the director of Army reserves as budget holder. This budget should include provision for equipment and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparisons given in Chapter I and the historical and more recent assessments in Chapter II have illustrated that the organisation of reserves in peacetime is critical to their performance in the early stages of war. When committed to operations, the aims for reserve forces must reflect those of their regular counterparts, but the worst way to integrate two very different components towards those shared goals is to pretend that both components are the same. The UK needs to provide structures, training and processes that lead to civilians serving in formations with the spirit that comes from hard-won unit cohesion – and with a leadership ethos which respects the fact that reservists’ main focus is on their civilian jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again and again, though, we have seen that where the structures and processes are driven by regular staffs they are unable to accommodate the differences between regulars and reserves; a historic example is the contrast between the rapid deployment of highly effective fighting divisions in the First World War – recruited, managed and even funded through County Associations – and the muddle and confusion of the process in 1939 – organised almost exclusively by regular staffs. The latter surely contributed to the subsequent defeats almost everywhere on land in the first half of the Second World War. The higher performance of some of the dominion divisions in the Second World War (recruited, shaped and commanded by reserve officers, as highlighted above) underlines this point. A more recent example is the persistent failings of even small-scale mobilisation processes in the UK, from Kosovo to the coronavirus pandemic, reported by the House of Commons Defence Committee, RF30 and the CRFCA EST. These contrast with the slick, efficient American arrangements for Iraq and Afghanistan. Another example is the poor quality and slowness of many British reserve training courses, compared with the imaginative approaches framing reserve courses in Australia and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has also abandoned the regional basis for reserve forces which used to be at the heart of the old TA, while all our cousins remain firmly committed to it. The UK likes to think that it invented the regimental system based around regional loyalties, but it is now the only major Five Eyes country that has been forced to confuse and dislocate regional ties in its reserves; fragmented brigades whose units are run by separate ‘warlords’ and ‘landlords’ – the units answer to the former for operational matters and the latter for administrative ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership needs to be delivered by reservists with a range of quality civilian careers developing a shared culture which connects and exchanges ideas from the civilian world, both regionally and nationally. The envelope for reserve peacetime activity must work for people with challenging civilian jobs and should not merely be a string of auxiliary tasks keeping the underemployed busy. This means that unless governance is addressed, the outlook for reserves is likely to remain precarious – a tri-service point, but worth addressing here. As well as the need for separate identifiable budgets ringfenced for reserves referred to above, the reserves should have a three-star officer in the MoD to act as their champion. This individual would have access to ministers and would be appointed by ministers in the way that the current heads of the regular services are, but they would not control either the reserve forces or their budgets – this function would be vested in the single service reserve directors. The holder would provide reserve expertise beyond the People Function (currently provided by the assistant chief of the defence staff (reserves and cadets)) and ensure that the Reserve’s voice is heard in operational, capability planning and resourcing debates. They should also sit on the boards which appoint the single service heads of reserves to ensure that those appointments are held by candidates who genuinely represent the volunteer reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case in the US, separating the budgets would need to be underpinned by legislation. A crucial element would be ensuring that the key post-holders in the MoD hierarchy and the reserves are genuine reservists, with a part-time record and civilian career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above considerations point towards the following broad recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose-and-use&quot;&gt;Purpose and Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current Army Reserve was developed (sensibly) to support smaller-scale expeditionary operations outside the NATO area, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. With the return to state competition with Russia and potential conflict in Europe, there is a need to restore the centrality of reserve units and formations to provide follow-on forces and mass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given their local knowledge, reserves have a critical role to play in home defence (for example, against enemy special forces) and resilience work, but availability for these roles comes as a bonus with good-quality units. Making resilience the main focus does not attract talent, whereas warfighting roles in formed bodies, and the realistic training which accompanies them, does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;numbers-and-shape&quot;&gt;Numbers and Shape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK should increase the size of its Army Reserve towards the Anglophone average of approximately 80% of the size of the regular Army, ideally reversing the planned cut to current regular Army numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regular Army should focus on providing higher-readiness units and formations, with reserves providing much of the next wave. A few reserve units should also have high-readiness responsibilities, as the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment does now, although there should be a greater emphasis on the ability to deploy as formed units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The doctrine of promoting unit cohesion should permeate all aspects of the reserves, including operational deployments. Units should be larger so that they can be deployed as units in general war. Consequently, their establishments should be increased, including adequate administrative support. Support weapons, and platoons with their own officers and permanent staff (so they can train independently) are at the heart of the credibility of reserve infantry units. Forming extra sub-units inside existing combat, combat support and command support reserve units is highly cost-effective too, as it saves on expensive overheads and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement of the reforming of a reserve brigade (the 19th Brigade) under a reservist should be welcome news, but the decision to include units from every corner of the country runs against all successful practice in the UK’s Anglophone sister countries and makes life almost impossible for any commander with a proper civilian job. A span of command of nearly a dozen units is also probably unworkable. Instead, the UK should imitate other Anglophone countries (and its own past) by restoring territorially based brigades: initially three, with one in each of southern England, northern England and Scotland, each with one of the yeomanry recce units (properly equipped) and some infantry battalions, and with combat support and combat service support. This would be a step towards rekindling the regional and regimental spirit that has particular value for the reserves in recruiting, building comradeship and delivering local support in times of mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruitment-1&quot;&gt;Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recruitment needs to be streamlined, both to increase the number of applicants and to reduce delays in the system. Reserves must be separately and properly catered for in the new Armed Forces recruiting programme contract currently being negotiated. Recruitment should aim to attract many more students (as other ranks, not just officers), who should be directly recruited on social media, not just via the UOTCs. A significant reduction in delays needs to be achieved through a number of iterative improvements, including changing data laws so that the MoD can directly access the NHS medical documents of applicants (cutting out delays and risk), reducing the number of applicants whose places on courses are cancelled, holding officers controlling the courses directly accountable, and incentivising the new contractor so that speed is a key indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that officer recruiting and manning is prioritised. The extraordinary (tri-service) decision to downgrade reserve officers in the quarterly manning statistics so they are no longer shown separately from other ranks should be reversed, bringing them back in line with their regular counterparts and allowing proper scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment-1&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reserve units should be equipped and trained for war, but with identified readiness deltas below regulars, and greater specialisation of role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipment, which is in desperate need of upgrading across much of the Army Reserve, should be prioritised. While this applies to parts of the regular Army too, the very small sums needed to at least bring personal scales of equipment up to scratch in the Army Reserve and key deficiencies, such as more light armour for yeomanry units, would have a significant impact, and is essential to underpin the ability to deploy reserves as units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The staffs responsible for devising capability should contain reservists so that opportunities and limitations for reserves are part of the process for equipment development. The UK could specify the need for equipment to be ‘trainable’ in a reserve context during the acquisition process and then see the benefits of innovation driven by commercial competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers detachments should be restored to reserve units, as repeatedly recommended by the CRFCA EST. This broadly cost-neutral measure would bring greater benefits by improving training, reducing administration, raising morale and improving retention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;representation&quot;&gt;Representation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the overarching point on governance made above, reserve officers should also be appointed to the branches identified by the CRFCA EST as failing in the mobilisation process, in both the MoD and the single services, in order to help ensure that the call-out process is appropriate to reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deputy military secretary (reserves) should be given greater powers to control the annual Reserve Service Day ‘ask’ for all reserve posts on behalf of the director of reserves (Army), who is the Army Reserve ‘sponsor’. Currently organisations undermine their own best interests by asking for a time commitment which rules out the best candidates – and when the selected individuals underperform, anti-reserve prejudices are reinforced. Zoom makes a wider set of options possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training-and-retention&quot;&gt;Training and Retention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reserve needs more championship within officer training. At RMAS, the post of deputy commandant (reserves) should be restored to one-star rank and given command of the UOTCs, through which the majority of reserve officers pass. Recruiting a much higher proportion of students – so that applicants are younger and have more time – should facilitate an expansion of Phase 2 training to make officers more credible to their regular peers, providing it is offered during university vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff training should be reformed in line with best practice from the UK’s sister countries to afford reservists the same opportunity that, with modern blended learning, could easily see them do a ‘reserve academic year’, trebling their study and training time without competing with a simultaneous reserve job or putting undue strain on civilian life. The added benefit of creating a stronger bond between the members of this leadership cohort should not be underestimated, nor should the ability to better talent-spot the rising stars. To support this, the Defence Academy needs greater senior reserve representation and designated reserve directing staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army training courses should be adjusted in line with Anglophone best practice too – they need to be modular courses, with a greater proportion delivered in soldiers’ own units, but with arms school certification. There should be greater emphasis on recognising civilian skills already present to eliminate wasted time. Competency-based training should be introduced in a range of areas, starting with driving, allowing soldiers to take tests without doing the corresponding course. In line with the principle of unit cohesion, but to ensure standardisation and reduce travelling time, a more regional approach to training is needed, with each region having its own Army Training Unit (ATU), commanded by a reservist. The provision of more courses to train reserve instructors for both ATUs and units themselves is a priority. The Army Training Units should ideally be separate from regular facilities, but, where regular facilities are used, support contracts need to enable weekend training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The counterpart of the above point on recognition of civilian skills by the military is that progress in getting civil recognition of military skills is good for a soldier’s relationship with their civilian employer. Reform of the mobilisation process will also help. More must be done in all parts of government, especially those buying goods and services, to incentivise companies employing reservists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The progress that Defence Relationship Management has made in developing the Armed Forces Covenant and in building a resource of thousands of gold, silver and bronze award winners must be built on, both to improve retention in peacetime and to assist in gaining employer support on mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collective training assurance should be introduced by measuring and recording the readiness of reserve units, using technology, including simulation, as is proposed in RF30. This can only be credible if we have larger – not smaller – units, especially in the infantry, as assessments cannot be credible without critical mass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue of loss of appetite for taking appropriate risk needs addressing across Defence, but specific provision needs to be made for ensuring that staffs who make decisions on health and safety have reserve representation. The project of detecting and rooting out the disproportionate damage done to reserve training by overzealous rules and application should be given to a named responsible officer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of mass and reminded us of how reserves can provide an affordable framework in peacetime to deliver capacity in war. As an island nation whose armed forces have an expeditionary focus, the UK’s best comparators are its major Anglophone counterparts in the Five Eyes pact – countries which share that expeditionary focus and a tradition of voluntarism rather than conscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons from the First World War to Afghanistan suggest that citizen soldiers can perform strongly – sometimes truly remarkably – when they have trained and played together and deploy with the right, volunteer, leadership. In contrast, repeated use of UK reserves to provide individual augmentees at the end of Operation Herrick disenfranchised the reserve officer cadre, and it has taken years to partially recover. To rebuild its Armed Forces for mass, the UK needs to focus on proven principles for the volunteer reserves while bringing in the latest technologies and ideas from the civilian world. Reserve forces have done this very often in the past, and Ukrainian reservists are doing it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of cutting the Army Reserve by 10% and eroding the credibility of its infantry battalions by removing most of their support weapons, its size should be increased. A target should be to expand the Reserve from roughly one-third to approximately 80% of the size of the regular Army, in line with the average of the UK’s Anglophone sister countries. This should include substantially increasing the current shrunken establishment of units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural reforms are also needed – some of these are in governance at the defence level. The UK needs improvements to recruiting, with a much greater focus on attracting students and driving down the long delays in the process. Training should be more modularised and more often delivered by units themselves, or regionally by (regional) Army Training Units. A greater emphasis should be placed on grouping people with members of their own units on basic training, in order to work with the grain of comradeship. Those arms schools where progress in distribution and modularisation lags behind should be required to introduce competency-based training whereby individuals can take rigorous tests without taking the course, starting with driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has focused on the Army Reserve, but similar work is needed on the other two services. How is it, for example, that at a time of extreme shortage of fast jet fighter pilots – and sharp competition across a range of aviation skills – there is so little scope for getting a second bang for the buck from ex-regulars serving part time, when the US has whole fast jet squadrons in its Air Guard? Why has the Navy been allowed to refuse to recognise civilian watchkeeping qualifications, ruining opportunities for seagoing Royal Naval Reserve officers? Why does the Royal Marines Reserve, despite heavy overheads, attract almost no young officers, preventing it from providing a route to mass, as its US counterpart did in the Second World War and more recently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass is back in the news, as we see a nation mobilised in Ukraine. Technology is more important than ever, and reservists come from the civilian world, which is usually ahead of the armed forces – operational examples range from the astonishingly fast development of the Lewes bomb by the (citizen-led) SAS in the Second World War to the innovations that reservists have recently provided during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve budgets should be separately identified and ringfenced to prevent them becoming the first port of call for cuts, and a new three-star reserve post should be introduced, with direct access to ministers. Above all, the UK needs more fighting power delivered through the Reserve, as an affordable route to mass, and reservists must have a greater role in leading it.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the mobilisation indicates a willingness to continue the war and challenge Western states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin announced the long-awaited mobilisation of Russian society to fight the war in Ukraine on 21 September. His speech, and the decree released at the same time, set in motion a series of actions across Russia’s military, and notionally its economy too, to prepare the country for war. However, there is a lot to understand about Russia’s system of mobilisation and how it has changed in the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific conditions set forth in Putin’s decree cover those with former military experience, especially in desired areas such as drivers, gunners and artillerymen. It established clear grounds for those that would not be involved in the mobilisation, as well as the vague promise of quotas per region. It is worth noting that the decree is likely to disproportionately affect Russia’s poorer regions. The Russian armed forces are seen as one of the primary careers for young men from Dagestan, for example. This means that there will be more people in Dagestan liable for mobilisation than will be the case in other more affluent areas of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-soviet-hangover&quot;&gt;A Soviet Hangover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the Soviet Union acknowledged the importance of massed forces in a potential clash with NATO. It understood that without significant reserves of manpower and equipment, it would be unlikely to win in a prolonged conflict with the West. Because of this, the Soviet Union invested vast resources in a mass mobilisation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is likely that the Russian armed forces will be able to ameliorate some of their major shortcomings through tactics, techniques and procedures, and the use of artillery&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many of the cadres responsible for maintaining the equipment and knowledge were disbanded after 2008, leading to a loss of equipment and capability. In their place, the Russian armed forces began experimenting with an operational reserve, which initially set out to maintain some form of mass reserve and a smaller operational reserve that could be used more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bars&quot;&gt;BARS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decree was signed in 2014 announcing the formation of a voluntary military reserve. It was essentially re-announcing decrees issued in 2012 and 2013 but did lead to a small reserve system being explored experimentally in several regions. From 2016, reservists started participating in all major Russian exercises, although their role in those exercises is not clear. By 2018, Izvestia was reporting on the ‘full-scale formation of a mobilisation reserve’. Former service personnel were able to sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defence. In return they would receive a small salary, and be required to attend monthly classes along with annual exercises lasting 20–30 days. For comparison, the reserves encompassed by Putin’s mobilisation order are most likely part of the inactive mobilisation reserve, otherwise known as the ‘mobilisation human resource’. The voluntary reservists could be called up at any time, whether it be to alleviate a shortage of personnel in military units, for a ‘special or threatened period’, or in the event of major exercises and emergencies. The reserves were allocated to a Mobilisation Deployment Support Centre, which featured in exercises in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2021, the Russian armed forces and Russian news outlets were referring to the Special Combat Army Reserve (BARS), which carried many characteristics of the 2018 reserve system, indicating an element of continuity between 2015 and the BARS. Zvezda Weekly confidently proclaimed in September 2021 that 38,000 BARS reservists would be recruited in the Southern Military District (SMD) alone, although it was expected to take three years for the reserve to be completed. Nonetheless, the SMD commander, General Aleksandr Dvornikov, proudly reported the participation of BARS reservists in battalion- and regimental-level tactical exercises alongside regular forces that year, as well as the training of 30,000 reservists. Dvornikov appears to have been keen on employing modern military practices with the units under his command, which may in part explain why the SMD units have performed better than those from Russia’s other districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial rewards are understood to be a key form of motivation for many reservists, which are referred to as partisans by regular Russian soldiers and civilians – a reference to the Second World War reservists, who were prone to behaving more like partisans than soldiers. It is possible that the rushed effort to establish the BARS in the SMD and Central Military District (CMD) was actually in preparation for the war in Ukraine as there were exercises announced in Siberia in January, and others in the SMD at around the same time. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that 9,000 BARS contracts had been signed with citizens in the CMD. However, one Telegram account and other sources following troop deployments indicate that BARS personnel have already deployed to Ukraine; it is therefore difficult to assess whether Dvornikov’s efforts in 2021 will yield any significant contribution to the Russian armed forces at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is an enormous challenge for any military; however, it is difficult to assess how the Russian system will cope with the sudden influx of up to the 300,000 personnel promised by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. In theory, Russia maintains 11 higher education facilities responsible for training officers in frontline combat roles. Officers are very important to the Russian military system as they provide not only leadership but most training for the recruits and other ranks under their command. It is not clear how well staffed the officer training facilities are, but the Moscow Higher Combined Arms School indicates that it can support four battalions of officer cadets. Nonetheless, some instructors have reportedly been taken to form the command structures of new units already fighting in Ukraine. Because of this, the quantity of instructors left at Russia’s universities is unlikely to be sufficient to properly support a mass mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s technological reserve has deteriorated significantly since 1991&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, an alternative route for the training of mobilised reservists, which we call the Chechnya Model. For deployment to Chechnya, Russian forces realised that a much higher level of experience was required to fully utilise the effects of modern weaponry. As a result, pre-deployment training focused significant effort on improving weapon skills and knowledge. The second element was conducted in Chechnya by arriving units, who received specific training on the style of combat encountered at the time before conducting some live-fire drills. Typically, critical roles for combat, such as machine gunners and RPG operators, were assigned to those with the most experience, whereas those newly arrived in the combat zone became riflemen. It follows that the training model pursued for Russia’s mobilised forces might assume a number of these characteristics – the forces might not be optimal or as capable as their Ukrainian counterparts, but it is likely that the Russian armed forces will be able to ameliorate some of their major shortcomings through tactics, techniques and procedures, and the use of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-grandfathers-tank&quot;&gt;My Grandfather’s Tank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s technological reserve has deteriorated significantly since 1991. It is now possible to observe vast tank graveyards using the satellite feature on Google Maps. It is therefore unhelpful to consider the total number of tanks and armoured vehicles produced by the Soviet Union as an indicator of Russian stocks. Nonetheless, it is possible to draw some assessments from what is known about Russia’s maintenance facilities and procedures. In 2018, Russia maintained 40 bases ‘for the storage and repair of military equipment [BHiRVT]’, 14 of them for motorised rifle regiments. Each BHiRVT stores and maintains all the equipment necessary to equip a complete formation – such as a motorised rifle regiment. Reserves were notionally required to report to these bases in times of mobilisation, but one Russian defence expert noted in 2018 that few had been maintained with the adequate number of staff. Nonetheless, they may remain a significant reserve of equipment; there were as many as 400 towed guns at the 591st artillery warehouse in the Novgorod Region in 2018. By 2020, there were at least four tank storage bases, which provided shelter for legacy tank designs such as the T-55, T-62, T-64 and T-80. The number of tanks held at these sites is not known but could extend into the thousands. However, some – such as the T-64s – have been removed from storage to equip the separatist forces in Ukraine as well as allies in Syria and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is possible, and even likely, that Russia maintains sufficient reserves of equipment to arm large quantities of new units. Alexander Golts and Michael Kofman have suggested that the ground forces would require 60 reserve brigades to be mobilised to reach their wartime strength. It is unlikely that the 40 BHiRVT bases mentioned by Izvestia would meet this need. Irrespective of the number of brigades mobilised, some will be operating tanks that entered service when their grandfathers were conscripts, but this may not be the case across the entirety of the mobilised forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage conditions also vary, and the Russian Ministry of Defence differentiates between four different types of storage: (1) Light – a heated room; (2) Medium – a closed unheated room; (3) Hard – outside, under a canopy; and (4) Very hard – in the open air or under a canopy in a maritime environment. Within this framework there is long- and short-term storage. Short-term is for high-readiness units with the equipment held in a state where it could be made ready to fight within hours. This includes regular maintenance of batteries and spare parts, convenient placement of weapon sights and even ammunition. Long-term storage requires periodic maintenance and repair that is supposed to be carried out by the manufacturer and the Russian armed forces. Removing equipment from long-term storage occurs in stages; the vehicles are depressurised and ‘depreserved’ before they are checked to ensure that they function as intended. This check can be carried out at the storage site or at the place of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artillery available to the mobilised Russian forces is likely to make the greatest difference to their contribution. Russia has been able to make its advances thanks in large part to its use of massed artillery barrages that Ukraine has struggled to answer until recently. Tank combat does occur in Ukraine, and in those cases where it does, Ukraine’s T-64s would likely outmatch T-62s and T-55s, as well as any older T-72s. However, in those cases where Ukrainian infantry might face T-62s or other armoured fighting vehicles, without their own armour, or anti-armour weapons, they will be at a distinct disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-will-it-take&quot;&gt;How Long Will It Take?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-readiness section of Russia’s reserve system has been exploited to generate the initial force that invaded Ukraine; this force is therefore unlikely to provide a rapid change to the war. The massed mobilisation will take some time, although it is unlikely that the Russian armed forces will be allowed the months that they would require to turn this force into something truly useful. Instead, Russia’s history of rushing forces into combat is likely to gain a new grizzly chapter as former servicemen are pushed into Ukraine in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Centralized JADC2 guidance will be most useful to beat the drum for acquisition innovation, to drive interoperability among service programs and manage the seams between joint and service capabilities, to develop a management approach to ensure synchronization between existing and new elements as they are added in the future, to develop an experimentation agenda to reveal data sharing challenges to focus improvement efforts, and to serve as an entry point to C2 issues for partners and allies and to address issues of international data sharing. Along with these tasks, the JADC2 Cross Functional Team — or whatever ultimate central management function is instantiated — needs to focus on developing a common understanding and managing the architecture of the innovation ecosystem to achieve the Joint Force C2 vision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of military command and control (C2) will be enabled by revolutions in information technology (IT). Step changes in computing power, almost unlimited cloud-enabled data storage, and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened up new opportunities for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the joint force. The capabilities enabled by this technological revolution have been a powerful motivator for new service-level programs working to enhance the capabilities available to military commanders. That said, the future fight demands that service capabilities work together seamlessly to ensure coherent multidomain warfighting strategies, meaning service-level C2 and targeting programs need to work together as a coherent whole. Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) is the DoD’s concept to connect sensors and communications from all of the military services — Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space Force — into a single network. As laid out in the JADC2 strategy, the goal is to ensure that the joint force commander has “the capabilities needed to command the Joint Force across all warfighting domains and throughout the electromagnetic spectrum to deter, and, if necessary, defeat any adversary at any time and in any place around the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), the Navy’s Project Overmatch, and the Army’s Project Convergence are the three main efforts for advancing C2 at the service level. These programs seek cutting-edge targeting networks that match the right sensors to the right effectors to make forces more capable. Despite this unifying vision, these programs vary in approach, due to the different capabilities of each service. Project Convergence, the Army’s effort, focuses far more on exercises and experimentation as opposed to engineering enablers for existing capabilities. Project Overmatch and ABMS have a strong engineering emphasis with a focus on technology development, although there are fewer publicly available specifics on Project Overmatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this activity, the question remains as to how to best ensure that progress toward enhanced C2 is not impeded by predictable challenges. The history of efforts on both service and joint IT-related programs suggests that the pathway to developing JADC2 is filled with potential risks and pitfalls. The problem set features rapid technological change, the necessity of interoperability with existing systems and with new systems across the services, integration with allies and partners, new and non-traditional contractors, and novel acquisition approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief examines challenges in taking the next steps for enhanced C2 and targeting infrastructure and makes recommendations to help the U.S. military as it operates as a joint force and deploys with allies and partners. These recommendations are informed by the literature, by almost 20 non-attribution discussions with military and civilian experts from across the services (including current and retired personnel, up to the senior executive service (SES) civilian and general officer level) and defense contractors, and by participation at conferences and workshops, including one held at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This work strove to identify strategic level challenges and relevant recommendations. In particular, the conversations with experts focused on enduring challenges that the interviewees did not think were being adequately addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research structured the discussions around four broad topics: (1) getting warfighters the C2 and targeting capabilities they need at the tactical edge, (2) integrating existing and new C2 technologies to support this goal, (3) management of the overall enterprise, and (4) the involvement of partners and allies. Asking these questions revealed challenges that, while difficult, the DoD has processes and procedures to address, such as the acquisition of complex technologies. It also revealed new concerns that will require both thoughtful recognition by leadership and creative solutions to address. Before examining each of these challenges in detail, this brief begins by exploring key observations about C2 and the implementation of JADC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;c2-is-a-fractal-challenge&quot;&gt;C2 is a fractal challenge.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective C2 at the “tactical edge” in a contested environment shares similar challenges whether the frame of reference is within a service, at the joint level, or when working with allies and partners. Within services, there are challenges accessing, maintaining, transmitting, securing, and using the necessary data at the speed of the warfighter requirements. Additionally, sharing data across service components, for example across Naval aviation, surface ships, and submarines, requires thoughtful management. Ensuring an effective command structure is an enduring necessity. These challenges are replicated at the joint level as combatant commands (CCMDs) pull together service capabilities and prepare to fight. Finally, when the United States is working with partners and allies, the same challenges emerge again. This implies that effective C2 is a fractal challenge — any part of the enterprise has many of the same patterns and issues to address. This observation does not in and of itself yield solutions to any challenges, but it does mean that solutions to challenges that work at one level may be able to be repurposed and updated to help improve other levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jadc2-exists-in-an-unusually-complex-ecosystem&quot;&gt;JADC2 exists in an unusually complex ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy aimed at developing a complex integrated capability must reflect an understanding of the equities, incentives, and constraints of the participants in the relevant ecosystems. The JADC2 strategy exists in a notably complex ecosystem driven by the military services as they engage in their Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train, and equip as other stakeholders in the national security apparatus are working to meet their own missions. The military services are not monolithic, and the incentives for operators and those for acquisition personnel are different, driving complexity. The C2 ecosystem includes the Joint Force itself, with combatant commanders making decisions and relying on effective connections across warfighting domains. The ecosystem includes the partners and allies alongside whom the United States may go to war. At all levels, warfighters need data, and the data must be shared with them and back to others. Other U.S. government agencies and the intelligence community set standards and provide actionable information. Finally, the ecosystem includes the contractors who provide the capabilities that support the JADC2 concept — and who are leading the innovation effort for some of these capabilities, which often have commercial roots. Other supporting and gap-filler capabilities, such as DARPA’s System-of-systems Technology Integration Tool Chain for Heterogeneous Electronic Systems (STITCHES) program, may rely on multiple DoD offices for funding as they scale. The complexity inherent in the JADC2 concept is not completely new, and past attempts at a network-centric systems faced many of these challenges. That history is associated with prominent failures, even when constrained to a single service, such as the Army’s Future Combat System. Those past programs offer caution for the JADC2 enterprise and support the approach of building up from service efforts and supporting and expanding on local successes rather than imposing and enforcing a top-down acquisition effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jadc2-faces-a-highly-challenging-problem-set&quot;&gt;JADC2 faces a highly challenging problem set.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation underpinning the JADC2 concept is that future conflict will be taking place in an environment that is contested in all domains by a highly capable state actor. This assumption fits with the vision laid out in the National Defense Strategy and the general consensus that the pacing threat for the U.S. military is a resurgent China. This strategic context guides any serious analysis of JADC2 toward the hardest problems in command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR): the denied, or at the very least contested environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military has been effective at conducting C4ISR in permissive environments. Throughout operations in the Middle East since 9/11, the military has been able to control forces, share data, and cause kinetic effects. All of these capabilities have been possible in spite of a fractured C4ISR system, which the military has been able to use to support missions and effectively prosecute targets. The need for improved joint solutions such as JADC2 becomes necessary when planning for future conflicts in contested environments facing peer threats, which will necessitate rapid decision making and need to leverage data in new ways. Future conflict with a highly capable adversary, such as China, could be contested in all domains and take place across enormous operational theaters, all while the adversary has the advantage of operating near their borders. Nodes of the network may be attacked through cyber, electronic, or conventional means. A robust network should have multiple pathways for information, which means that connections with other services or with infrastructure managed by partner nations can be useful tools in building a more resilient network. If JADC2 is to add value to the capabilities of the joint force, its components must be able to function in that contested environment and manage significant distances between units, while taking advantage of the opportunities inherent in a networked concept. Understanding its operational environment is critical to understanding the context of the challenges faced by the JADC2 ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Future conflict with a highly capable adversary, such as China, could be contested in all domains and take place across enormous operational theaters, all while the adversary has the advantage of operating near their borders.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-models-may-not-be-adequate-for-acquiring-new-capabilities&quot;&gt;Existing models may not be adequate for acquiring new capabilities.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective C2 is a not a new challenge but one that has endured throughout the history of warfighting as commanders have sought to communicate with distributed fighters and with one another. JADC2 represents the latest overarching effort to tie capabilities together effectively for the Joint Force. The unspoken but obvious implication here is that there will be some future effort aimed at solving the same challenge. Thus, JADC2 should not be understood as an endpoint or suite of capabilities with known end states but rather as several steps on the path toward greater interoperability across all domains in order to achieve joint effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language from policymakers, including some in Congress, suggests that the vision for JADC2 is a definable finite set of capabilities that DOD is seeking to acquire. In the fiscal year 2023 defense authorization bill, the House Armed Services Committee included a requirement that the secretary of defense deliver a report inventorying “JADC2-related development efforts with descriptions of performance objects, costs and schedules and a list of potential JADC2 capability gaps along with how DoD plans to address and fund those gaps.” That language suggests that the capabilities are finite and that the JADC2 acquisition effort has a notional end date when all of those discrete enablers are acquired and integrated. This is how the military traditionally understands and designs acquisition programs, with program managers evaluated on cost, schedule, and performance. To get a new capability under this traditional process-focused model, the DoD develops a formal requirement, holds a competition, and buys a solution which it then operates and maintains until it is time for an upgraded or replacement capability. This generational approach ensures that capabilities are delivered and slowly updated, that program managers are working toward a destination, and that Congress is funding an end product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing JADC2 into that model is a mistake. Many of the technologies in the JADC2 family of systems are evolving on a rapid commercial timeline. Even the more traditional defense hardware-oriented aspects of JADC2 have software that will need to be regularly updated to retain connectivity and address adversary threats. Planning for some notional end-state when JADC2 is “done” and delivered suggests that there is a static goal for C2. Instead of a fixed goal, JADC2 should be thought of as a long-term journey of improvement to suites of interconnected capabilities. The steps along this journey will not all be incremental–developing data architectures and standards may require time-intensive consultative processes and significant investments. Even these larger leaps are not an end point, but instead will need to further evolve and be integrated into a wider set of systems. This insight has been reflected in the creation of a JADC2 cross-functional team approach which focuses on merging efforts through working groups rather than enacting acquisition on its own. The majority of JADC2-specific solutions connect service-acquired capabilities. JADC2 may include a relatively small set of joint capabilities tying together more robust service-procured capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Instead of a fixed goal, JADC2 should be thought of as a long-term journey of improvement to suites of interconnected capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development concepts like DevSecOps do incorporate an iterative approach where experience from operators feeds back into updates in a continuous flow, so the idea that IT-related capabilities need to be continually updated is not a new one. The DevSecOps approach could be a starting point for a JADC2 continuous development process, broadened out to include the interconnections between different families of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-challenge-is-managing-the-inevitable-seams-between-joint-and-service-acquisition-for-capabilities-designed-for-the-joint-force&quot;&gt;One challenge is managing the inevitable seams between joint and service acquisition for capabilities designed for the joint force.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As currently envisioned, the JADC2 strategy ties together service C2 programs and thus includes both service-level and joint acquisition challenges. Each service program brings together multiple capabilities to create a coherent intraservice C2 system. Pulling service programs together for joint operations in support of the JADC2 concept requires an additional level of coordination to ensure that service programs can communicate with each other and operate together. These connections should also be managed over time — as subcomponents of the systems are updated, those joint connections must remain robust to ensure JADC2’s continued effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are alternative approaches to acquiring a joint capability, all of which have benefits and challenges. The expert discussions during this research revealed that these trade-offs remain a matter of concern, even as the DoD proceeds with service programs focused on joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The status quo approach involves each service developing its own C4ISR capabilities that could be tied together to meet the operational requirements of the JADC2 concept in a joint operation. In interviews, experts from a nontraditional defense contractor and a major prime contractor cited positive moves on data governance and standardization in recent months, but the overall inclination of first prioritizing intraservice connections remains. This is tempered by the role played by the JADC2 cross-functional team approach and other coordination goals laid out in the JADC2 strategy, as well as the attention paid to making data “visible, accessible, understandable, linked, trustworthy, interoperable, and secure” across the DoD, as outlined in the Five Data Decrees memo put forward by Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks. Service led models would ensure that programs are designed to meet simpler, smaller goals, which could then be tied together — avoiding what one interviewee described as an operational vision “on the scale of solving world hunger” — and achieve results at the speed of relevance. Service-level models also ensure clear operational focus and allow the services to balance priorities through the budgeting process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Joint Program Executive Offices (JPEOs) could serve as a function to centralize management of JADC2 procurement and ensure data standardization, interoperability, a common approach to cybersecurity, and international coordination. The F-35 joint program office was offered, with some hesitation, as an example of a centralized organization generally with a focus on its functions rather than its acquisition outcomes, for example, as a place to locate foreign partner representatives. In public statements, Lieutenant General Dennis Crall, the director of the DoD’s J6, has argued for a degree of centralization but pushed back against the idea of a single JPEO taking on the management of the service programs. A JPEO may enhance interoperability but could result in services getting suboptimal solutions and also lead to delays due to increased coordination needs. Even with these flaws, for those dissatisfied with decentralized implementation, a JPEO was often the starting point when considering other options — and one interviewee offered that this model can help ensure accountability by offering a “forehead Congress can thump” should there be performance challenges such as interoperability failures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; An independent agency could be used to acquire JADC2 capabilities and manage the enterprise. If the DoD decides to utilize a subordinate agency, it could either stand up a new agency or use an existing one such as the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to manage procurement and be a touch point for international partners. This approach did not get much attention in the expert discussions. (Other research has identified uncertainty over what role DISA will play given that “JADC2 will fundamentally reshape DISA’s traditional mission and set the future path for its existing capabilities.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead Military Service:&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD could designate a lead service for JADC2 development and procurement. CCMDs, agencies, and the other services would be directed by the lead service and have to work to make sure that each service is meeting their requirements. The challenge is that service C2 needs are driven by different domains with distinct operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead CCMD:&lt;/strong&gt; DoD could designate 1 of the 11 unified CCMDs, which are inherently joint and warfighter-focused, to lead the JADC2 effort. The DoD could designate a functional command, such as Cyber Command, or geographic combatant command, such as Indo-Pacific Command. Experts did not propose a single lead CCMD but repeatedly discussed the potential benefits of the CCMDs playing a larger role, given that geographic commands are a natural choice for identifying operators’ immediate needs in a region. That said, one expert cautioned that interoperability investments have not been high on CCMD priority lists in the past. Another, while not suggesting a particular structure, argued that the critical thing missing was achieving something “truly joint that’s attached to joint operational commanders.” That said, any joint approach will need to ensure that service-specific sensor to shooter kill chains are not made less effective in the search for commonality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the structure of the acquisition organization came up in almost every interview suggests expert interest in ensuring that the acquisition strategy recognizes the risks inherent in a service-centered approach, even one with a coordination function as laid out in the JADC2 strategy document. Here and elsewhere, ensuring the joint warfighter perspective is captured in service-led acquisition is an abiding concern — and that is one of the important process contributions that a joint function can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the concerns of experts, JADC2 acquisition should include the services doing a significant portion of the acquisition work and a joint function to ensure interoperability and to develop and manage an overarching technical architecture. Fortunately, services have been the traditional venue for acquisition, and so their challenges will be heavily focused on capturing new vendors and developing contract approaches for IT-driven systems. More challenging will be the joint component of the acquisition program. Currently the DoD Chief Information Officer and the J6 perform oversight of the JADC2 enterprise, and that has limited inherent problems from a process perspective. However, if this approach, or any centralized approach, begins to falter, there are several critical warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Here and elsewhere, ensuring the joint warfighter perspective is captured in service-led acquisition is an abiding concern — and that is one of the important process contributions that a joint function can provide.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of operational interoperability, which will beevident through joint experimentation, exercises, or real-world responses to crises&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A failure to make iterative progress on Services goals due to ambitious central goals that do not deliver near-term benefits&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of a single touch point for congressional oversight and accountability&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of a single touch point for partners and allies as they seek to integrate and understand U.S. systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraints generated by the services that limit the use of data standards and open systems and interfaces even when technically viable&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited or no common understanding of the threat picture and the most urgent challenges that need to be solved&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of meaningful joint testing and unclear evidence that the services are using the results of experimentation (although this is something of a lagging indicator since lessons from testing may come too late in program planning to generate change)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with ensuring that acquisition interests are balanced, the JADC2 ecosystem will need to manage these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-key-task-will-be-ensuring-innovation-survives-acquisition&quot;&gt;A key task will be ensuring innovation survives acquisition.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iwvxSqb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Number of Vendors in the Defense Electronics, Comms, and Sensors Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology development for DoD systems can be driven either by the DoD through the requirements and acquisition processes or by commercial industry as it works to develop products that will be successful in the relevant marketplace. In the aviation context, for example, fighter aircraft have no analogy in the commercial world in terms of performance requirements, so government investments have driven necessary innovations such as stealth. Engines for transport and tanker aircraft are often entirely or mostly commercial, and innovation is driven by the commercial market. The business model for airlines has led to reliability and efficiency improvements in these engines, which the DoD has benefited from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT-driven military C2 programs may have originally been driven by the DoD’s needs, but over the last several decades, the expansion of commercial IT applications has meant that the DoD follows and benefits from IT development and innovation rather than leading it. Within the context of JADC2, the DoD will have to pursue development and procurement across both avenues while working on synchronizing its efforts with the pace of commercial innovation. Figure 1 shows the number of vendors supplying electronics, communications technologies, and sensors to the DoD and is based on Federal Procurement Data Systems (FPDS) information on government spending. CSIS’s analysis of the FPDS data reveals that there has been a steady decline in the total number of companies in this sector in the last 15 years, dropping by 37 percent. The absolute number of new entrants was higher 15 years ago and then declined along with the total number of vendors. It has more recently bumped up by over 300 vendors, returning to the pre-sequestration count — but as a percentage of the total vendors, new vendors have increased even more to 9.7 percent, a higher rate than other portfolios such as land vehicles, ships and submarines, or facilities and construction. If sustained, this higher rate of new entrants would be a sign that focused outreach to the commercial IT industry is beginning to produce industrial base dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the technologies enabling the JADC2 concept — those closest to the goal of more rapid closing of kill chains — will have no general commercial equivalent. The DoD will need to drive innovation for these as it has for many systems in the past. In others, such as data storage and data processing, the DoD will have to follow the lead of — and benefit from investments by — the commercial market to capture innovations at the speed of operation relevance. One commercial industry expert also raised a middle case — software-defined networks — where the DoD may need to rely on an approach developed outside the DoD that nonetheless has somewhat niche commercial market adoption but addresses key operational needs. While both ends of the spectrum have their own trade-offs and acquisition risks, a bigger challenge may be synchronizing commercial- and DoD-led capabilities into a coherent whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge is that Silicon Valley’s products for commercial customers are not designed to be operated in a risky combat environment at the tactical edge; the DoD will need to drive solutions for low bandwidth-contested environments. When it comes to managing the acquisition of equipment for communication in a contested environment, the DoD is postured and has process tools to be able to acquire the capabilities the warfighter demands. What makes this segment of the JADC2 problem easier to navigate (if difficult to achieve because of the technical complexity of the components) is that it closely follows acquisition models set up by the DoD. The DoD generally has monopsony power (i.e., it is the only buyer) in the market for complex defense systems and has decades of experience working with its traditional contractor base to develop solutions for defense-specific problems. Communications platforms for contested environments fall well within that category because there is not significant civilian demand for jam-resistant communications systems, for example. While the DoD may be more accustomed to this problem, it should not close the door to outside innovation. Innovation in this communications problem could very well come from new vendors that are developing novel technologies such as laser-based communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One challenge is that Silicon Valley’s products for commercial customers are not designed to be operated in a risky combat environment at the tactical edge; the DoD will need to drive solutions for low bandwidth-contested environments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has had a long history of struggling to capture commercial innovations. What makes JADC2 an especially difficult problem for acquisition officials is they will not be fielding a single, steady-state capability. Approaches to exploring include “as-a-service” acquisition and working with nontraditional vendors, along with expertise in managing multiple pathways in the Adaptive Acquisition Framework. For any of these approaches, new systems will have to employ open architectures that are tied to evolving JADC2 structure and standards and that are accessible to all qualified vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As-a-service contracting is promising because of the speed of innovation in the private sector and how quickly technologies will have to be upgraded to stay on the cutting edge. Traditional government requirements set strict guidelines for suppliers and take place within an often slow acquisition process. If the DoD can embrace as-a-service contracting for components of JADC2 (likely non-denied cloud and AI/ML), then it will be better able to iterate technology at the speed of technological relevance and deliver capability to the warfighter at the speed of operational relevance. By building requirements around capabilities and not technical requirements, the DoD, along with a trusted contractor, can develop and deploy systems faster than would be possible with a traditional contracting approach. As service contracting combines well with software-defined systems to allow systems to keep pace with evolving C2 needs, although there could also be a hardware module update aspects to such arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of capturing the technical innovation needed to make JADC2 work is bringing in technologies from outside the DoD’s traditional vendor ecosystem. The DoD has traditionally relied on a relatively small group of prime contractors that often specialize in the defense market. For technologies where the commercial market is driving innovation, including cloud computing and AI/ML, the DoD should engage outside of its traditional vendor base. Nontraditional companies have experience with cutting-edge technologies and expert workforces and thus may be positioned to adapt their technology to defense applications at the speed of relevance. The challenge is that nontraditional companies generally use capabilities like utilizing communications, networking, and cloud infrastructures that were not designed for use in an expeditionary or contested environment. The need thus is to identify where commercial companies currently offer technologies usable in contested environments, where they could with a reasonable amount of additional investment, and where it would be infeasible or not worthwhile for them to participate in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge of bringing nontraditional contractors into the defense ecosystem is also not a new one and not limited to the JADC2 problem set. Part of the challenge is that the people and organizations responsible for the acquisition of JADC2-related capabilities acquisition are not the same people or organizations involved in acquisition process improvement efforts. Evolving acquisition approaches to facilitate acquisition of JADC2 capabilities may benefit from a direct connection between the two efforts, with acquisition streamlining and improvement efforts deliberately using JADC2 capabilities as the test case for change. By working on synchronizing the DoD’s efforts to the commercial ecosystem, the department may be able to develop technologies that maintain pace with the commercial world or at least reduce the current delay in fielding cutting-edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JADC2 will require an approach to testing and experimentation that links to its structure as an evolving set of interoperable systems (which again will require open architectures and increasing use of software-defined capabilities). Aiming at a point where development or testing is “complete” will mean that the framework for the program does not include the consistent onboarding of new capabilities. Testing will need to be an ongoing part of the program rather than a step to complete along the way, of which testing interoperability of service-based systems as they evolve is a significant driver. The sheer scale and complexity of the systems will further complicate testing. While live testing is necessary to unpack challenges, a JADC2-focused virtual test environment would facilitate more continuous testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;along-with-improving-coordination-inside-dod-effective-employment-of-jadc2-in-the-future-fight-will-require-bridging-the-gap-with-allies&quot;&gt;Along with improving coordination inside DoD, effective employment of JADC2 in the future fight will require bridging the gap with allies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of working with allies and partners was stressed in nearly every one of the expert discussions. That the United States will not fight alone in the future is a truism, and JADC2 is in part designed to facilitate integration with allies and partners, although there are still many areas needing further definition. Furthermore, there is evidence that JADC2 programs are engaged in developing the necessary relationships now to ensure that they will be practiced in case of a future fight. The Army’s 2022 Project Convergence exercises, for example, were designed to include international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of these and other efforts underway, interviewees frequently raised the concern that many aspects of this cooperation have not been worked out. Specifically, while this coordination challenge is well known, efforts to resolve it have not gotten to the level of detail necessary to develop confidence in the exchange of critical information in advance of a fight. In particular, C2 cooperation with allies was highlighted as making interoperability more difficult to achieve. Part of the challenge is the profusion and heterogeneity of systems both within the United States at various levels of classification and across U.S. partners. Multiple experts raised the concern that the capability for handling classified materials has to be baked in from the start; iteration from an open system does not have a straightforward path for evolution to handle higher levels of classification later. That said, this can be solved through the acquisition of systems that can be accessed by multiple partners at different levels of classification — so this is a problem that has an acquisition solution, no matter how complicated that solution may be in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger challenge comes from what will actually happen during a fight. In every contingency, the force generating the data will need to determine what information it does and does not want to share with its allies (and they will naturally do the same). Furthermore, the levels of data sharing and information access may vary over the course of the battle. Some questions to address include: What are the triggers for data sharing? What might trigger data sharing at different levels of classification? Who is responsible for identifying when allies and partners need more data, and who is in charge of getting it to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of technology and infrastructure need to be in place in advance of the fight to facilitate data sharing? These are the kinds of questions that interviewees were more concerned about than the specifics of the networks over which information will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions will likely differ in every engagement, but none of the interviewees raised technical challenges as the main concern. Rather, they were focused on the process for identifying key questions and the approach for developing answers — and recommended doing this in advance. Allied defense organizations may often be willing to scale up data sharing in a crisis, but without advanced preparations, willingness will not translate into effective coordination. One strong recommendation throughout the interviews and in the literature was to not wait until any future engagement starts to begin the process of integrating partners and practicing the information exchange. Experimentation can help identify the political barriers to working with other nations. One interviewee suggested the necessity of working with allies and partners begins with setting requirements and highlighted the preferability of doing so from the beginning rather than in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied defense organizations may often be willing to scale up data sharing in a crisis, but without advanced preparations, willingness will not translate into effective coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with following the Five Data Decrees, additional solutions to the challenge of working with partners include open interfaces so that a variety of systems can plug into a common backbone and exchange information. A second is involving the contractor base in experiments to allow for early insight into data-sharing sticking points and evolve requirements along the way. Regardless of the approach, it is clear that experimentation and exercising with allies is critical if JADC2 is to be interoperable with allies and partners. The future is uncertain, and even if experiments are wrong, specific lessons drawn from exercises will help with understanding what decisions need to be made and how to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts-moving-from-admiring-the-challenges-to-focusing-on-solutions&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts: Moving from Admiring the Challenges to Focusing on Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theme resonated throughout the expert interviews. Rather than focus on JADC2 as a distinct set of capabilities and enablers and as an endpoint to a set of acquisition programs, it should be understood as a guidepost for an effort across the defense enterprise to advance C4ISR capabilities to meet the challenges of future conflict against a peer adversary. Understanding JADC2 as a process will help the DoD focus on innovation instead of acquisition. The mission, the threat landscape, and perhaps even the pacing threat will change over time, and the technology will need to change and evolve in parallel. The very nature of C2, with its interconnected set of capabilities, advocates for an open-system approach where new innovations can seamlessly plug into existing architectures. This framework for understanding JADC2 will enable the DoD to take more incremental steps to improving its capabilities, including C4ISR, as opposed to attempting to take a generational leap. This will almost certainly help control costs while driving up fielded performance. Some aspects of this problem, such as developing a successor to the Link 16 architectures, evolving data standards, or providing a joint commercial cloud, may benefit from more centralized approaches, but these mission sets should be tightly defined and take on no more complexity than necessary. This requires the recognition that aspects of the programs that rely on interconnected software, especially commercial derivative technology, may never be “complete” in the sense of a static delivered capability. The DoD should treat the JADC2 concept as a guiding North Star for managing innovation rather than as a set of procurement programs with a final delivery endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring progress toward the JADC2 vision will be difficult in an environment where the requirements and capabilities for these technologies are constantly evolving. The DoD will likely never be able to meet the goal of connecting every sensor with every effector, especially on a battlefield becoming increasingly sensor saturated and complex. That does not mean the DoD should simply surrender. Instead, the DoD should develop meaningful metrics and goals for improvement towards the goal of the technology. Measuring progress toward meaningful goals will be difficult in a space where the goal posts themselves will continue to change, but doing so could help secure funding, attention, and results for the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tension to consider is that attempting revolutionary change can reduce attention to current problems. Generational changes like JADC2 tend to focus on time and resource-intensive steps with the potential for enormous payoffs in the longer term — but at the potential expense of putting off important challenges that could be addressed in the near term but have characteristics that the present system is not incentivized to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For C2, the acquisition system is making slow but steady progress on intraservice capabilities but lags on progress on joint and international cooperation. Waiting until JADC2 capabilities are delivered to address these current challenges could mean that solutions are not adequately incorporated during development, and that gaps remain in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the challenges and opportunities for JADC2 are necessary but not sufficient to address the thorny problems inherent in such a complex effort. The JADC2 CFT — as the organization assigned by DoD leadership to execute the JADC2 strategy (or whatever ultimate central management function is instantiated) — needs to go beyond the management of “the plans of actions, milestones, and resourcing requirements” toward the development of a common understanding and management of the architecture of the innovation ecosystem to achieve the Joint Force C2 vision.&lt;/p&gt;

Moscow’s effort was likely unsuccessful due to a fundamental misalignment of interests between the Kremlin and Viktor Gushan, the most powerful player in Transnistria.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Kremlin’s failure to coerce Transnistrian leadership could be part of the dynamic, along with recent Ukrainian battlefield successes, driving Moscow to annex occupied territory in Ukraine. This failure also demonstrates the extent to which Moscow’s proxies and allies are hesitant to join the Kremlin’s faltering invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5:00 p.m. on April 25, a series of explosions rocked the Ministry of State Security (MGB) headquarters in Transnistria, a Russian-backed breakaway republic in Moldova. Transnistria’s president quickly went on air and spoke live to the nation, blaming Ukraine for these “terrorist attacks” and demanding that Kyiv crack down on rogue militant groups within its borders. Russian officials began commenting on the explosions the next day and warned of the dangers of “Ukraine’s attacks” in Transnistria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of events alarmed many international observers. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was stalling at the time. Some experts feared that Moscow would attempt to open an additional front by invading Ukraine through Transnistria, which the bombings looked like the perfect pretense for. The Critical Threats Project assesses that the bombings were likely an attempt by Moscow to involve Transnistria in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More remarkable than the explosions was what came after them — nothing. There was no significant reaction from the Transnistrian breakaway state. This lack of reaction suggests that Moscow failed to strong-arm Transnistria. While it is unclear what exactly the Kremlin wanted from Transnistrian leadership, it is clear that it wanted them to do something. This failure to coerce is an instructive case on the limits of the Kremlin’s power at a time when Moscow is considering what to do with its proxies in Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine. Understanding this failure may predict the Kremlin’s future course of action with its Ukrainian proxies. The Kremlin may also continue to pressure Transnistria even if success is unlikely. It is important to understand the Transnistrian breakaway state structure to understand what went wrong for the Kremlin in Transnistria and the limits of this case’s predictive power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-transnistria&quot;&gt;What Is Transnistria?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transnistria is an unrecognized breakaway republic on the left bank of the Dniester River in Moldova. The region declared its independence in 1990 amid the breakup of the Soviet Union and achieved de facto independence from Moldova in 1992 after Russian troops intervened in fighting between Transnistrian and Moldovan forces, killing 700 troops. The region has remained in this de facto independent state since 1992. Roughly 1,500 Russian troops are still stationed there. The vast majority of people in Transnistria speak Russian, and the region has retained many Soviet-era symbols and practices. The Kremlin maintains significant influence in Transnistria as its primary international sponsor. Moscow values this influence because Transnistria’s de facto independence prevents Moldova from joining Western alliance structures and keeps it in Russia’s sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-structure-of-transnistria&quot;&gt;Formal Structure of Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transnistria is officially a presidential republic. The president is head of the executive branch and appoints a prime minister with little authority. The Supreme Council is the sole legislative body, with the Renewal Party currently occupying 29 of its 33 seats. Transnistria’s president is a member of the Renewal Party, giving it total control over the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian aid to Transnistria is crucial to Transnistrian government operations and solidifies a strategic partnership. Russia effectively supplies the region with natural gas free of charge, delaying indefinitely the $7 billion that it owes Moscow for gas. This free natural gas is the key pillar of Transnistria’s economy, as “separatist authorities relied on income from natural gas–derived products for 53% of their budgetary spending in 2019 and for 40% in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian platforms also serve as essential middlemen between Transnistria and the global economy. For example, Transnistria’s state bank uses Russian Sberbank to execute all international transactions, because global corporations will not operate with it directly. Transnistrian authorities repay this Russian support by emphasizing their close ties with Moscow. Transnistria’s current president Vadim Krasnoselsky in 2018 affirmed his commitment to ensuring that Transnistria eventually becomes part of Russia. Transnistria’s head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said in 2019 that Transnistria “remains an outpost of the Russian world in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;informal-structure-of-transnistria&quot;&gt;Informal Structure of Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main players in Transnistria whose power overshadows that of the territory’s official governing structures: Sheriff Enterprises, a company owned by ex-KGB agent Viktor Gushan, and the Ministry of State Security (MGB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gushan-and-sheriff&quot;&gt;Gushan and Sheriff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informally, Transnistria is a mafia state ruled by ex-KGB agent Gushan, who owns a company called Sheriff Enterprises. Sheriff-affiliated companies receive one-third of Transnistria’s government spending and control 60 percent of the region’s economy. Sheriff also sponsors the Renewal Party. President Krasnoselsky is a member of the Renewal Party and worked as an adviser to the head of a Gushan-owned company from 2012 to 2015 before becoming president in 2016. This stranglehold means that Sheriff, and Gushan by extension, effectively controls Transnistria’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan and business partner Ilya Kazmaly founded Sheriff in 1993 in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The business venture started out as a cigarette smuggling operation. Gushan leveraged his border-control contacts to ensure his goods crossed the long Ukraine-Transnistria border unimpeded. Gushan then again leveraged his old KGB contacts to outmaneuver his competition in buying up formerly state-owned enterprises in Transnistria. Sheriff’s business ventures now include supermarkets, gas stations, and internet providers and companies in the telecommunications, textile production, broadcast and cable television, auto sales, publishing, cognac production, light manufacturing, and advertising industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mgb&quot;&gt;The MGB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only significantly powerful organization outside of Gushan’s control in Transnistria is the Russian-dominated MGB. There is likely competition between the MGB and Sheriff for influence in Transnistria, despite the lack of clear evidence of infighting in open source media. The MGB is commonly understood to be a “department of the Russian FSB (Federal Security Service)” and likely takes orders directly from Moscow. MGB heads almost always come from the ranks of the Russian security apparatus. Transnistria’s first MGB head, Vladimir Antyufeev, worked in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Riga, Latvia under the Soviet Union. Antyufeev led a coup that failed to keep Latvia from leaving the Soviet bloc in 1991 during his tenure in Riga. Antyufeev also claims to have later traveled to Crimea and helped set conditions for Russia’s absorption of Crimea in 2014. He was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Donetsk People’s Republic after his time in Crimea. The current head of the MGB, Valery Gebos, served in the Soviet border guards from 1984-1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MGB’s responsibilities and long tenure indicate the organization’s influence. The MGB’s most important, and lucrative, responsibility is border control. Regulating the inflow and outflow of goods allows the MGB to extract rents on both legal and illegal goods. This responsibility likely gives the MGB significant resources to command. Heads of the MGB tend to serve long tenures and are not often rotated. These long tenures allow MGB heads to establish significant human networks, entrench themselves in their positions, and accrue influence. MGB heads tend to serve the entire length of the president’s tenure. For example, Transnistria’s first MGB head, Vladimir Antyufeev, held his post during the entire 20-year tenure of President Igor Smirnov. Likewise, the current MGB head, Valery Gebos, has been in office for six years as President Krasnoselsky nears the midpoint of his second term in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interest-misalignment-between-transnistria-and-the-kremlin&quot;&gt;Interest Misalignment Between Transnistria and the Kremlin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attempt to draw Transnistria into the war in Ukraine likely failed because Gushan’s Sheriff Enterprises and the Russian-dominated MGB have fundamentally different interests. Sheriff’s primary interests are economic, while Russia’s are political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan benefits from the current status quo of receiving Russian subsidies while selling products on European markets. Sheriff’s exports to the EU currently dwarf its exports to the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union. Sheriff’s pivot toward Western trade began in 2014 when the Moldovan government signed a trade deal with the EU that guaranteed tariff-free access to EU markets. Transnistrian businesses were included in this tariff exemption as long as they were registered in Transnistria and submitted to customs checks by Moldovan officials. A “massive swing” in trade took place shortly thereafter, as 58 percent of all exports from Transnistria went to the EU in the first three months of 2016. In contrast, just 6 percent of all exports went to the Eurasian Economic Union. By comparison, only 27 percent of Transnistrian exports went to the EU in 2015. These Western-oriented exports incentivize Gushan to maintain economic contacts with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan also has a vested interest in reestablishing cordial relations with neighboring Ukraine. Transnistria imported and exported most of its goods through Ukraine’s Black Sea ports until Russia invaded and Ukraine closed its border with Transnistria for the first time in 30 years. This border closure means that Transnistria’s only way to import and export goods to the global market is through Moldova, which is an uncomfortable arrangement for the breakaway republic. Gushan is likely economically motivated to normalize relations with Ukraine enough to reopen the border. He is unlikely to accept permanent reliance on Moldova to remain economically solvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s main goal with the MGB was to strong-arm Transnistria into supporting Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, which ultimately failed. The MGB’s goals contradict Sheriff’s goals because overtly supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would likely imperil Sheriff’s lucrative business ties with the West. Transnistria’s refusal to support Moscow’s campaign suggests that Gushan won the power struggle for control over Transnistria and stands as the strongest player in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-defeats-in-ukraine-have-likely-devalued-the-kremlins-coercive-power-over-transnistria&quot;&gt;Russian Defeats in Ukraine Have Likely Devalued the Kremlin’s Coercive Power over Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s faltering invasion of Ukraine has likely devalued its military coercive power over Transnistria. The Kremlin’s military presence in Transnistria is weak. There are currently approximately 1,500 Russian troops stationed in Transnistria. Only 50–100 of these are Russian soldiers dispatched from Russia. The remaining 1,400 troops are Transnistrian locals who have been given Russian passports and serve as Russian soldiers. Two units make up this 1,500-strong contingent: the peacekeeping force (MC) and the Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MC is the smaller of the two and is responsible for patrolling security zones between Transnistria and Moldova. The OGRF is stationed without any agreement from Moldova and guards a large ammunition depot that remains from the Soviet Union. These troops engage in regular military exercises, but they are very poorly equipped. The poor performance level of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine suggests that the troops in Transnistria would perform poorly in combat. Furthermore, their overwhelming status as native Transnistrians means they offer little coercive power over the Transnistrian government itself, since they are unlikely motivated to attack their homeland to enforce Russian demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine also decreases the likelihood that Moscow will airdrop troops into Transnistria or otherwise use the territory as a springboard for operations into Ukraine. The Kremlin has lost significant numbers of troops since the invasion began and is struggling to make even incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is unlikely to have the spare manpower to open a new front in the west, pushing on Odessa. The Kremlin has little ability to militarily coerce Transnistria without the threat of the arrival of additional trained Russian forces. The Kremlin’s failure to coerce Transnistria may affect its decision-making regarding the degree of control it chooses to exert over occupied territories in Ukraine. This experience may also have several implications for the decision-making of other Kremlin proxies and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s failure to coerce Transnistria into joining its invasion of Ukraine has implications for how the Kremlin interacts with its proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A caveat.&lt;/strong&gt; Transnistria is an outlier among the Kremlin’s proxies. Gushan has assembled significantly more economic and political power in Transnistria than any local actor has assembled in the Kremlin’s other proxies. The predictive power of Transnistria’s case is therefore limited. This case nevertheless offers valuable information about the limits of the Kremlin’s coercive power and offers hints as to how the Kremlin may act with its proxies in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin will likely attempt to directly absorb into the Russian Federation the territory it captured in Ukraine rather than turning it into a Transnistria-style client state.&lt;/strong&gt; The huge amount of political, economic, and diplomatic capital the Kremlin has invested in its Ukraine invasion means it cannot afford to lose control over annexed territory. Moscow will therefore likely attempt to avoid the headache of managing a client state by directly absorbing the captured Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation, which would give the Kremlin direct control over it. Russia’s absorption of these territories would not likely carry any additional political cost, because Western leaders are unlikely to decrease sanctions pressure on Russia in the short to medium term, no matter what the Kremlin does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin likely has insufficient bandwidth and capital to increase its control over Transnistria in the short to medium term.&lt;/strong&gt; Moscow’s security services are likely using all of their operational bandwidth on securing territory it has captured in Ukraine. The security services likely do not have the time or resources to invest in the MGB to increase the ministry’s influence in Transnistria. Transnistria will therefore likely continue to balance between the West and Russia to maintain its access to Western markets and free Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian military’s poor performance in Ukraine likely played a role in deterring Transnistria from participating in its invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s forces have become bogged down in eastern Ukraine over the first seven months of the war. This poor performance made joining the operation an unattractive proposition. Transnistrian leadership likely calculated that joining the invasion or offering significant assistance would net only marginal returns. Conversely, aiding the invasion would significantly damage lucrative economic ties with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian military’s poor performance has likely deterred and will continue to deter Belarus from directly participating in the invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is likely conducting the same cost-benefit analysis that Transnistria’s leaders conducted — and reaching a similar conclusion. Minsk has so far refrained from sending troops into Ukraine, despite its willingness to allow the Russian military to launch missiles from Belarus and use it as a staging ground for the invasion. Lukashenko likely correctly assesses that directly joining the invasion would lead to significantly increased Western pressure and threaten his hold on power. Minsk will consequently likely continue to refrain from directly participating in the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Will Baumgardner</name></author><summary type="html">The series of bombings in Transnistria in late April was likely a false flag operation executed by the Kremlin intended to draw Transnistria into its invasion of Ukraine.

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western media reported that the health of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has declined rapidly, driving speculation that he may soon die. The most likely scenario after his death is that a hardline cleric succeeds him. This successor will likely have the same worldview as Khamenei and may adopt an even more aggressive stance towards the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khamenei has ruled Iran for over three decades since becoming supreme leader in 1989 and shaped the modern Iranian state as we know it. He has enabled and supported the regime’s aggressive and authoritarian policies. He has empowered the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) to become a dominant economic, political, security, and socio-cultural force within the country. His passing will be truly epochal in Iran and likely the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hardline cleric becomes supreme leader through a peaceful and quick transition of power.&lt;/strong&gt; Hardline frontrunners for succession include President Ebrahim Raisi and Mojtaba Khamenei — the son of Ali Khamenei. The supreme leader, his inner circle, and the IRGC have indicated support for both candidates, but it is unclear which they prefer. They are likely already trying to influence the succession process to install their preferred candidate and may succeed. This scenario is currently the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raisi and Mojtaba are both hardline clerics just as radical as Ali Khamenei if not more so.&lt;/strong&gt; Raisi and Mojtaba are old enough to remember the 1979 Iranian Revolution and either fought in or lost family and friends in the Iran-Iraq War — both crucible experiences that have unified Iranian leaders for decades. Raisi was a prosecutor in the judiciary during the war and played a prominent role in persecuting political dissent and consolidating the regime’s power. Mojtaba fought in the Habib ibn Mazahir Battalion in the war and remains close to those with whom he served. They both came of age and have come to power in the context of constant conflict with the US and an expanding military struggle against Israel. These dynamics make them more likely to pursue similar — if not more aggressive policies — to those of Ali Khamenei. Raisi or Mojtaba would almost certainly remain committed to pursuing the same grand strategic objectives as Khamenei, which include attaining regional hegemony, destroying the Israeli state, and expelling America from the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new hardline supreme leader like Raisi or Mojtaba would still face immediate challenges in asserting his authority and controlling the regime, however.&lt;/strong&gt; Any successor at the start of his tenure will initially be weaker than Khamenei at the end of his and could struggle to control and mediate between the often-fractious regime power centers. Ali Khamenei was similarly weak when first becoming supreme leader in 1989 and had to consolidate his power in the subsequent decades. He did so in part by building up the IRGC as a major force within the Islamic Republic. He enabled the IRGC to expand its dominance over the economy and involvement in politics. His successor will have to reckon with the IRGC’s force without having Khamenei’s gravitas and history in creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC has become one of the most powerful actors within the regime under Khamenei and will likely continue influencing regime behavior after Khamenei dies. A weaker supreme leader may struggle to command or constrain an IRGC trying to preserve its dominant role in a post-Khamenei Iran. A new supreme leader who chose to wrestle with the IRGC rather than yielding to its demands might instead disrupt decision-making processes and the development and implementation of Iranian defense and foreign policies, although this course of action is less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raisi could install a close ally as president to consolidate his power if he became supreme leader. The Iranian constitution dictates that Raisi’s first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, would become president if Raisi resigned to become supreme leader. The constitution leaves the supreme leader the flexibility to appoint a different president if the first vice president dies or cannot otherwise perform his duties. Supreme Leader Raisi could easily exploit this authority to install whichever political ally he wants as president considering the broad latitude Khamenei has reserved to himself and the Guardian Council to decide whether candidates for office or officeholders are able to perform their duties using ideological criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raisi and Mojtaba would likely be unpopular domestically, further challenging their authority and power.&lt;/strong&gt; They both have enforced and supported repressive policies for decades. Mojtaba has the added challenge of having to justify a dynastic succession. The 1979 revolution overturned the Pahlavi dynastic monarchy and dynastic succession remains fundamentally incompatible with the regime’s revolutionary ideology. Ali Khamenei has previously criticized hereditary succession, complicating Mojtaba’s hopes of succeeding his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-prolonged-intra-regime-negotiation&quot;&gt;2. Prolonged, intra-regime negotiation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime fails to agree on a new supreme leader, triggering a protracted but peaceful intra-regime negotiation for weeks, months, or years.&lt;/strong&gt; Iran could enter a period of political deadlock if the Assembly of Experts — the body designated with selecting the supreme leader — or other regime power centers cannot agree on a supreme leader. This scenario is the second most likely after scenario one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime could form an interim leadership council to execute the basic responsibilities of the supreme leader in this scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; The Iranian constitution dictates that the regime will temporarily form such a council consisting of the president, judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council if the supreme leader dies or is incapacitated until the regime selects a new one. The Guardian Council is a 12-person body responsible for vetting and approving electoral candidates and includes six clerics appointed by the supreme leader and six elected by Parliament. Ongoing deadlock over the succession could keep a leadership council in power for months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A leadership council would likely face similar challenges to a hardline supreme leader described above in trying to decisively lead the regime and mediate between its power centers.&lt;/strong&gt; This council would be inherently weak as councils almost always are and lack the legitimacy of a supreme leader to rule. The council would need to manage the extraordinarily influential IRGC and could struggle to command and constrain its military leadership, potentially giving the IRGC more latitude to pursue foreign adventurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-infighting-and-violence&quot;&gt;3. Infighting and violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime fails to agree on a new supreme leader, triggering infighting and violence.&lt;/strong&gt; Different actors such as the IRGC or a moderate-reformist bloc could mobilize supporters against one another and trigger protests, driving further instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is similar to the second scenario in that it posits that the regime could not agree on the next supreme leader but includes possibly violent clashes between regime power centers. This scenario is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-a-moderate-or-reformist-cleric-succeeds-khamenei&quot;&gt;4. A moderate or reformist cleric succeeds Khamenei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist cleric becomes supreme leader through a peaceful and quick transition of power.&lt;/strong&gt; Such moderates and reformists include former President Hassan Rouhani and Hassan Khomeini — the grandson of the first supreme leader of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini. This scenario is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist cleric such as Rouhani or Khomeini would likely preserve the fundamental structure and orientation of the regime but diverge in some key areas.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the primary divisions between hardliners and the moderate-reformist crowd is that the latter has historically promoted greater albeit still limited personal liberties and more relaxed censorship than hardliners. Most moderates and many reformists diverge from their hardliner counterparts much less on foreign policy and national security policy. Neither Rouhani nor Khomeini is likely to revise the Islamic Republic’s grand strategic objectives fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist supreme leader would face greater challenges than a hardline supreme leader in trying to cohere and unify the regime.&lt;/strong&gt; Moderates and reformists like Rouhani have a more adversarial relationship with the IRGC, which could challenge the IRGC’s entrenched influence within the regime. The IRGC waged a brutal if largely clandestine political struggle against Rouhani during Rouhani’s two presidential terms, periodically requiring Khamenei to intervene to stop the attacks. There is no reason to imagine that the IRGC’s dislike of Rouhani and his policies would abate just because Rouhani succeeded Khamenei. The IRGC’s hostility to Rouhani, personally, and to many of the policies that Khomeini has supported is one of the factors, indeed, that makes the prospect of either succeeding Khamenei remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-regime-change&quot;&gt;5. Regime Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread protests erupt and collapse the regime.&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario is distinct from scenario three in that it assumes that the regime elite remain relatively unified but face widespread popular unrest that they cannot control. Popular, anti-regime protests have grown in Iran since late 2017. Protests could reignite during a succession crisis and catalyze the collapse of the regime. This scenario is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali Khamenei’s death or removal as supreme leader is unlikely to meaningfully change the regime’s adversarial relationship with the US and its allies. A new supreme leader might even adopt a more aggressive stance towards the US, particularly if a hardliner succeeds Khamenei, which is the likeliest scenario. Supreme leader succession is unlikely to alter the Islamic Republic’s grand strategic objectives, but it will fundamentally change intra regime dynamics, presenting opportunities for new and existing power centers to usurp and consolidate influence in a post-Khamenei Islamic Republic. These dynamics will be worth observing as a new supreme leader attempts to preserve and expand on Khamenei’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nicholas Carl and Kitaneh Fitzpatrick</name></author><summary type="html">This report presents five different scenarios that could emerge in a post-Khamenei Iran.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/CRBYx5j.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/CRBYx5j.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Renewing American Regime</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-12-renewing-american-regime.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Renewing American Regime" /><published>2022-09-12T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-12T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/renewing-american-regime</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-12-renewing-american-regime.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An insight of the broad sweep of America’s grand strategy in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggests that policymakers must remain committed to preserving U.S. hegemony in order to “shape evolving trends to its advantage.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine represents a painful blow to the international order. That a major power is seeking to change through the naked use of force what is a settled border guaranteed by previous interstate agreements and eviscerate an independent country threatens a return to the disorder that marked European history for centuries. It also represents a blatant challenge to the “liberal international order” that the United States has constructed since the end of World War II. This order represents an American regime insofar as it is grounded on Washington’s power, upon which the larger set of global rules, institutions, and patterned interactions survive. That power, in turn, is produced by an American regime at home: built upon strong individual rights, liberal democratic institutions, a sense of community, and free markets, the United States has furnished an example of how freedom and prosperity can be intimately intertwined to produce the material capabilities that are necessary to maintain a global order, which even as it serves American interests produces more benefits for others than any conceivable alternative. The external and internal faces of the American regime are, accordingly, mutually reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energetic U.S.-led pushback against Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine is therefore essential both to protect the ordering superstructure that safeguards American security and to defend myriad concrete interests: assisting Ukraine’s defense represents a direct investment in protecting Europe — a core interest of the United States — especially when Putin’s ambitions to retrieve the lost Soviet empire portend further threats to U.S. allies. Simultaneously, it also signals Washington’s resolution to protect other critical interests in the face of the growing Chinese threats in Asia. These include the dangers posed to Taiwan — a state which, like Ukraine, is also viewed as having a problematic entitative status by its assailants — as well as to other U.S. allies and partners in the wider Indo-Pacific region. By thus protecting Europe and the Asian Rimland, the United States defends itself at a distance and thereby enables its own domestic regime to thrive within a secure geographic sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the same, the threats to the United States are legion. That they emerge concurrently from declining powers such as Russia and rising powers such as China confirms the expectation that, even when physical dangers are not at issue, U.S. hegemony is, and will be, threatened by multiple challenges. These encompass the perils posed by aggressive or reckless states, America’s relative decline in the face of diffusing power internationally, the spread of new technologies (including those that embody either new coercive potential or the promise of driving new economic revolutions within U.S. competitors), and the attacks on liberal ideas as ordering principles in national and international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, the United States cannot jettison its hegemonic role because doing so would deny it the freedom to shape evolving trends to its advantage. Nor can it settle for a strategy of selective disinterest because to do so would create opportunities for America’s rivals to exploit any abandonment of particular regions, institutions, or issue areas to Washington’s detriment. Consequently, the United States must reinvest in protecting its hegemony: it should strive to remain the largest single concentration of material power in the international system; it should protect its position as the most fecund center of technological innovation worldwide; it should retain the globe-girding military capabilities that underwrite its command of the commons and mark its superiority over its rivals; it should preserve its ideational and exemplary attractiveness because of their intrinsic merits, because they facilitate the production of material power, and because they enhance American influence abroad; and it should pursue a prudent strategic course that avoids squandering blood and treasure on causes that are peripheral to the maintenance of its power and influence and not overly injurious to the health of the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when U.S.-China competition is certain to dominate international politics for at least the next few decades, sustaining American hegemony promises to be the most effective strategy for coming out ahead in comparison to all the other alternatives, such as retreating to isolationism, fostering multipolarity, or hoping for the emergence of collective security arrangements. It also offers the best hope of limiting the dangers posed by the bipolarity that could emerge as a result of China’s rise. Nonetheless, it might seem odd that the preservation of American hegemony is defended here as a viable goal despite the larger realities of the country’s relative decline. After all, the U.S. share of the global economy has nearly halved since 1960 and today subsists at roughly a quarter of the world’s product in nominal terms. Although there is nothing in economic theory that suggests that the United States is perpetually locked into this fraction — after all, U.S. relative decline has in fact been slow, uneven, and caused mainly by developing countries growing faster (because they are much farther away from the global production-possibility frontier than the United States) — the goal of protecting American hegemony is nonetheless tenable despite its smaller share of the global product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At a time when U.S.-China competition is certain to dominate international politics for at least the next few decades, sustaining American hegemony promises to be the most effective strategy for coming out ahead in comparison to all the other alternatives, such as retreating to isolationism, fostering multipolarity, or hoping for the emergence of collective security arrangements.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the annual output of the United States undeniably constitutes the foundations of its influence in the international system, the sources of its power extend beyond its economic capabilities. They include its unique geopolitical assets (such as alliances that add to U.S. capabilities while often freeing Washington to apply its own resources toward advancing its own particular interests); striking institutional dominance (which reflects a form of “structural power” that often and silently “decides outcomes — both positive and negative — much more than relational power does”); remarkable ideational attractiveness (which, as expressed through its political values, national culture, and global engagement, still remains extraordinarily appealing, despite recent battering); and, finally, unparalleled military capabilities (that permit the United States to enforce its will when necessary over the entire globe in a manner that no other state currently can). For all its relative decline, an outcome that has actually been fostered significantly by the success of the American regime abroad, the United States alone possesses — to use a Chinese term of art — “comprehensive national power.” When power is thus assessed in its multidimensionality, no other rival yet comes close, thus permitting the United States to viably maintain its hegemony should it so choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character of American hegemony only makes this goal plausible. American hegemony, at least in the first instance, does not require Washington to enforce its control over the sovereignty of other states but rather to preserve an international order that fundamentally serves its core interests. This burden entails three different but complementary tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it involves preserving liberal democracy at home and abroad and promoting it as a universal ideal both because of its intrinsic value and because the expansion of the liberal democratic universe — with all its myriad associated regional and functional international institutions — protects American security and prosperity better than other alternative political orderings. This ambition is best advanced by exemplary conduct at home, though it must be supplemented by political engagement abroad. Whatever the means employed, the costs of supporting the entrenchment and the spread of liberal democracy and its associated institutions are modest and should rarely, if ever, require the use of deadly force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it involves upholding the open international economic order because ever-freer trade between states, when complemented by free and efficient markets at home, remains the best means of increasing universal (including American) prosperity. The United States has made unique contributions to creating such a global system in the postwar era. Continuing to sustain this order, again, requires primarily political engagement, which is not particularly costly in any pecuniary sense. To the degree that meaningful costs are entailed, these arise mainly in the distribution of relative gains between the United States and its trading partners, and Washington should not be shy about demanding greater reciprocity in its trade agreements, including by regulating access to its large and wealthy market as a means of securing enhanced market access in other countries. Negotiating these arrangements, however, does not impose any significant burdens on the U.S. Treasury, and because the United States is still largely a self-sufficient economy, the country can even bear significant trade losses, when necessary, with greater equanimity compared to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and finally, it involves protecting the physical security of the United States and its many allies and partners around the world through a variety of instruments, not least of which is the military. This is the costliest of the three tasks, yet it remains the foundation on which the previous two responsibilities are discharged. Although fielding the military capabilities required to defend American interests — which also includes upholding the rules and institutions pertaining to international behavior — is expensive in absolute terms, the specific costs of defense and foreign policy lie well within the capacity of the American economy. The unnecessary frittering away of national resources on elective “wars of choice,” however, contributes more toward provoking domestic (and international) opposition to the American regime abroad than the responsible exercise of hegemony itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told then, the United States must preserve its hegemony in the international system — meaning its leadership of the liberal order that flows from its unique concatenation of national and international power — simply because this positional ordering and the activities associated with sustaining this ordering best preserve its security, prosperity, and interests while also protecting its allies and friends worldwide. Because it is also affordable, the case for holding on to hegemony, rightly exercised, is all the more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liberal international order created by American hegemony, undoubtedly, has universal aspirations. These hopes find reflection in the many international institutions that even non-liberal states find useful to participate in, even when they do not share the fundamental values animating these bodies. Despite such successes, the liberal international order, when conceived of as a Kantian “pacific union” of democratic states, is not yet (and may never become) a political macrocosm that is coterminous with the world itself. Consequently, it will remain under threat from without and, as recent Western experiences have illustrated, possibly also from within. The United States, accordingly, has to strengthen both the liberal foundations of its own polity, thus protecting the American regime at home, even as its partners work toward strengthening liberal democracy within their own countries. Simultaneously, the United States must reinvest — albeit in concert with its allies and friends — in indurating its own hegemony abroad because only American power can protect the existing liberal international order — the face of the American regime outside its borders — in exceptional ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the most significant threat to this order is posed by China’s ascendency. This danger is far more consequential than even Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because it triply targets the universalist claims of liberal democracy, often exploits unfairly the opportunities afforded by the open trading system, and threatens the security of key American partners directly in the Indo-Pacific and, more indirectly, in Europe. Even more to the point, these dangers arise fundamentally from Beijing’s superior power and its still growing strength. While the United States must, therefore, defeat the Russian invasion of Ukraine in order to preserve good order both locally and internationally, it must concurrently gird its loins to meet the dangers posed by China, which will persist for many decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores what responding to the Chinese challenge entails in terms of the imperatives, opportunities, and risks facing the United States. Consistent with Andrew Marshall’s injunction to avoid the obvious and the immediate, the discussion that follows embeds the challenge of U.S.-China competition in a larger set of structural issues that must be engaged for success before turning to the more practical current problems that are associated with this rivalry. A discussion of these structural problems cannot be avoided because, although they seem far from the current war in Ukraine, they bear on the fundamental strategic challenges facing the United States, problems that have not been erased by Russia’s wanton aggression in any consequential ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-the-american-regime-abroad&quot;&gt;PROTECTING THE AMERICAN REGIME ABROAD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preserving American hegemony entails preserving the liberal international order. The relationship between the two is dialectical. Without a powerful United States, the open international order cannot survive. Not only is no other nation capable or committed enough to substitute for the United States in preserving the liberal regime globally, but that order (despite its limitations) also cannot be maintained merely because other states also have a vested interest in its endurance. Although many states benefit from the liberal international order, the costs of preserving that order often exceed the gains accruing to any given state, thereby ensuring that weaker countries will not contribute enough to preserving the system that they most profit from — thus ensuring its enervation and eventually its demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only an enormously well-endowed state, what Mancur Olson famously called in another context a “privileged” provider, can bear these “uncovered” costs of system maintenance, and the United States has done so since the end of World War II because a liberal international order is fundamentally in American self-interest. A flourishing liberal order, fundamentally grounded in a Kantian “respect for persons,” diminishes the threats that could arise against the United States; it spawns allies whose interests are served by bandwagoning with a powerful protector (while concurrently providing national contributions) against those perils that may threaten the liberal coalition (as the Soviet Union once did during the Cold War); and it creates opportunities for increasing prosperity both within the United States and among its liberal partners insofar as it expands the opportunities for deeper specialization that arises from free trade. For all these reasons, the open international order contributes toward enhancing American security and affluence, and to the degree that it cements a coalition of capable and reliable partners who share both interests and values, it also congeals American hegemony and bolsters its capacity to deal with diverse threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upholding the liberal order to protect U.S. interests, however, requires consistent attention by Washington because hegemonic stability is not automatically self-sustaining. It requires investments and attention on the part of the hegemon if the outcomes of peace and stability are to obtain. Equally, it requires statesmanship, that is, the virtue of possessing a “comprehensive or ‘architectonic’ perspective” so that the wisest course of action, invariably rooted in moderation, may be discerned in order to keep “an oft-times rattled humanity from seeking, sometimes with the encouragement of very great thinkers, the (false) comfort of various extremes.” Therefore, protecting the liberal order — and even more so the quest to enlarge it — perpetually requires prudent statecraft that is sensitive to the costs and benefits of various political choices when considered against the widest “stream of contingencies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Upholding the liberal order to protect U.S. interests, however, requires consistent attention by Washington because hegemonic stability is not automatically self-sustaining.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the last two decades have not witnessed this kind of statesmanship consistently, and as a result, American hegemony has faltered at great cost both to the United States and to the credibility of its international order. The arrival of the unipolar moment after the end of the Cold War should have been a golden opportunity for the consolidation of American global hegemony. And in the 1990s, it seemed as if this objective might have been within reach because U.S. power seemed unrivaled and its international stature unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that slowly changed after the new millennium began. The hopes for a liberal democratic Russia gradually dissolved amid the rise of a revanchist Putin regime. Believing that “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” Putin set out to retrieve whatever remnants of the erstwhile Soviet empire he could through a combination of “gray-zone” aggression or simple usurpation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about the same time, China emerged on the international scene as a new great power. Thanks to its deep integration within the global trading system — while resolutely remaining a model of state capitalism — China gradually became “the new workshop of the world” and used its growing economic power to steadily build a formidable military machine. The advent of Xi Jinping energized the ambition of restoring China’s historical greatness, which engendered the goal of transforming Beijing’s military capabilities into “world-class forces” by mid-century. As part of this “rejuvenation,” Xi — although more subtly than Putin — also began to implement a new assertive foreign policy that included renewed confrontations with China’s neighbors, increased territorial aggrandizement, and bold demands for a “new type of great-power relationship” that entailed Washington’s recognition of China’s parity with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States failed to mount an adequate response to these challenges. Although the George W. Bush administration had perceived China’s emergence as a great-power rival clearly, it was misled by Putin and, worse, was distracted by the militarized global war on terror that ensued after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The two-decade-long campaign in Afghanistan that followed ultimately failed because Washington pursued a flawed, and visibly self-defeating, strategy. But even this setback paled in comparison to the financial, human, and reputational losses ensuing from the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which arguably will be judged by history not merely as a colossal political misjudgment but also as an utterly expensive and unnecessary one. It cast a shadow over Bush’s other achievements and, more corrosively, sapped the nation’s appetite for undertaking those hegemonic responsibilities that might legitimately require the use of force. It also fueled the calls for “restraint” that now mark the unholy marriage of the American right and the American left on the core question of grand strategy, namely, how should the United States conduct itself in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressures for retrenchment were exacerbated by the global financial crisis that originated in the United States and consumed Barack Obama’s first term in office. Disenchanted with Bush’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and facing a severe economic crisis, Obama sought to exit both conflicts in order to “reinvest at home.” He also sought to negotiate with adversaries (even if it meant alienating friends) while seeking to minimize any external activism that would require the use of force. Accordingly, he risked discrediting U.S. hegemonic stability when he reneged on his threat to bomb Syria after Bashar al-Assad had crossed his own “redline” against using chemical weapons, when he settled on a “too slow and too incremental” response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and when he failed to confront Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea. On all these counts, Obama’s reluctance was largely shaped by the apparent economic and political constraints facing the United States, but it did not reflect a desire to simply abjure either traditional U.S. internationalism or U.S. global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His successor, Donald Trump, however, seemed to have little interest in either. Radically departing from Washington’s postwar commitment to uphold the American regime, Trump declared his fealty to protecting U.S. interests narrowly conceived and nothing beyond. On the strength of a populist nationalism at home, Trump promised to safeguard American security but was opposed to the burdens of defending its allies; he sought increased prosperity but despised the multilateral trading system as the means to that end; and he had little time for defending liberal values either at home or abroad. Although Trump did the nation and the international system a favor by calling China out as a strategic competitor — which his predecessors had studiously avoided — his presidency marked the most serious crisis facing the American regime not just because he reneged on diverse U.S. international commitments but because he disavowed these obligations as a matter of principle even as he was busy destroying American democracy at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspicion that the United States might be losing its liberal credentials thus intensified, but from the perspective of the international system, the fear that it might be tiring — and might actually be incapable — of bearing the burdens of global leadership further solidified. That American democracy survived despite Trump’s bruising is ultimately a testament to the resilience of its political mores. And that the United States continued to maintain the international order in the face of Trump’s disinterest, if not animosity, is partly a function of path dependency and equally a tribute to some of his officials who fought rearguard actions internally to prevent a comprehensive retrenchment that would have destroyed it irreparably. Without these guardrails, the consequences of his convulsive term in office might have been even greater. His successor, Joe Biden, promises a return to traditional American internationalism and hegemonic leadership, but it will require many years of success to prove that the United States has the capacity and will to discharge these responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two decades have thus been marked by dramatic oscillations in regard to American efforts at protecting the liberal international order. From the high point of Bush’s energetic, though sometimes misdirected, and often costly activism, the pendulum has progressively swung since in the opposite direction, with Trump’s term representing the nadir as far as the acceptance of hegemonic responsibilities is concerned. For all the pressures to retreat, however, it is not obvious that the United States will enhance its security, increase its prosperity, or strengthen the international order against its adversaries by pursuing such a course. One close reading of the larger postwar historical record in fact notes that although retrenchment has been a regular antidote to U.S. foreign policy excesses, only the “maximalist” exercise of U.S. leadership has “kept American adversaries permanently under pressure and on the defensive, limited their influence, challenged their legitimacy, and tipped the balance of power in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this implies that the United States should behave like a bull in a china shop, but a committed and judicious hegemony that applies American power appropriately to a prioritized set of critical objectives promises greater benefits for American interests than a restraint that assumes that the international system will provide gains for the United States equally well without Washington’s consistent management. The onset of real multipolarity will not make things any better because the threat of constantly revolving coalitions only increases the likelihood of buck passing, and collective security arrangements that are not underwritten by a single hegemonic power or by a small group of powerful states that share both interests and values are simply likely to be stillborn. Only a concerted effort to protect American hegemony can in fact ward off the emergent arrival of bipolarity, but even if that is not possible, the investments made toward that end remain the best guarantee that the bipolarity arising with China’s arrival as a superpower will not fundamentally undermine the American international regime in ways that threaten the interests of the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A committed and judicious hegemony that applies American power appropriately to a prioritized set of critical objectives promises greater benefits for American interests than a restraint that assumes that the international system will provide gains for the United States equally well without Washington’s consistent management.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-the-american-regime-at-home&quot;&gt;PROTECTING THE AMERICAN REGIME AT HOME&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If preserving the liberal international order requires American hegemony for its success and vice versa, protecting American hegemony requires attention equally to matters at home. The relationship between the successful exercise of hegemony abroad and the condition of America’s domestic polity is not anchored merely in exemplary considerations. It is widely appreciated that a vibrant American democracy validates U.S. credentials when promoting liberal values abroad; it serves as an important instrument of American soft power; and it functions as proof that countries do not need authoritarian regimes in order to nurture economic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the success of the American democratic experiment — the internal face of the American regime — is equally essential for more substantive reasons. If there is anything that the Trump years taught the international community about the United States, it is that all claims about the American commitment to sustain its hegemonic responsibilities will always be suspect if they are not corroborated by evidence that the populace supports this role. Even today, Biden’s assurances that “America is back,” though welcomed by U.S. allies, are still met with skepticism because of the uncertainties surrounding their strength and durability. After all, as long as there remains a non-trivial possibility that Trump might return to office as quickly as two years from now, and the striking divisions in American politics exist plainly for all to see, the fears that domestic developments will undermine Washington’s capacity to play its traditional hegemonic role corrosively threaten confidence in the stability of the American regime abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preserving the success of the liberal international order, therefore, requires attending to the health of American domestic politics along three dimensions: overcoming the extant polarization; addressing slowing domestic social mobility; and reimagining the American experiment as a pursuit of the common good. These tasks are enormous and involve fundamental transformations that transcend the life of any single administration. Moreover, they are not easily susceptible to quick success through discrete policies. Yet engaging them is essential, if the United States is to avoid the danger of losing its hegemony, not because of weakening capabilities but because its domestic preferences about protecting the American regime abroad may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the polarization that currently ails American democracy is a fearsome challenge for a polity that is marked by “a deep divide between two dominant visions for the country, one progressive and the other conservative.” No easy exits appear in sight, but the element that matters importantly for the U.S. ability to uphold the hegemonic order concerns the breakdown in the domestic coalitions that traditionally supported an activist U.S. international role. While American internationalists can be counted on to support the exercise of U.S. hegemonic responsibilities (even if there are differences on specific policies), the critical swing constituency remain the nationalists (if truly diehard isolationists are excluded). In general, the nationalists are willing to make great sacrifices to directly protect U.S. security but are less persuaded of the need to uphold the American world order as a means to that end. Partly because the benefits of that order have never been as transparently clear as its costs, partly because many citizens have lost out economically as a result of the globalization engendered by American hegemony, and partly because key electorally important constituencies find themselves culturally alienated from their internationalist peers, reenlisting the broad support of the citizenry for Washington’s exercise of hegemony remains a critical element of maintaining the American regime abroad. Overcoming the current fragmentation (and sometimes alienation) is equally critical to protect liberal democracy at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task was simpler when the Soviet Union threatened the United States and its diverse allies directly with military instruments. The threats posed by China are often more subtle and the issues that dominate the competition with the United States will frequently be more rarified, which makes the task of mobilizing a strong, resilient, and unified domestic base of support more challenging but nonetheless just as critical as it was during the Cold War. At a time when the temptation for many Americans to support isolationism is real — because the domestic problems are not insignificant — doubling down on the effort to persuade them that American security is intimately linked not merely to the absence of direct threats but rather to the viability of its primacy itself is both necessary and urgent. Because of the failures of the last two decades, this task will be challenging, but it can be achieved. In part, this is because the burdens of exercising American hegemony routinely are actually quite modest and largely involve sunk costs. Moreover, the body politic at large is usually content to defer to elites on the broad direction of national strategy, and as long as the chosen course does not precipitate costly and unsuccessful wars, whose aims are hard to discern when matched against popular understandings of the national interest, American citizens are content to support (or at least are not opposed to) the international leadership that is exercised on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the same, making the case for the benefits of continued American hegemony remains an important responsibility for holders of public office. Despite the deep divides on many issues of national politics, it is possible to construct a minimal bipartisan consensus on the importance of preserving U.S. leadership, especially when the dangers that appear far away today could quickly come home to threaten the United States if not confronted. Communicating this reality obviously requires statesmanship, deliberation, and thoughtful communication, and both the executive and legislative branches have important roles to play in this regard. Because it is likely, as past history suggests, that problems not averted often precipitate national overreactions that prove far more costly in retrospect, it is necessary to persuade the polity that steady U.S. global leadership is a much more responsible and economical way of protecting its interests. To the degree that material deprivation contributes toward the alienation of some citizens, amelioration by concerted state intervention also becomes indispensable to remedy the immiseration and thereby bolster support for broader U.S. international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because competitive international politics is an elite rather than a mass interest, it may appear as if working to buttress the domestic foundations of support for U.S. hegemony is not particularly important. After all, Trump was able to pursue contradictory policies — disrupting the international order while cozying up to Russia and China before he eventually confronted the latter — with nary a peep from his populist base. The danger, however, is less that a mass upsurge will force changes in U.S. external obligations from below. Rather, an unpersuaded populace could easily validate a future decision by an idiosyncratic president or an irresponsible legislature to walk away from protecting the American regime abroad at great long-term cost to the nation. Strengthening the domestic consensus to overcome polarization on at least this count offers the hope that the United States will be able to consistently protect the liberal international order that serves its interests — while conveying that resolve credibly to friends, adversaries, and bystanders alike. If the country can at the same time stay reliably liberal and democratic as well, these commitments will only enjoy greater confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of securing broad domestic support for a grand strategy centered on preserving the American regime abroad will not succeed if that order does not provide sufficient material benefits for the populace, especially to those constituencies whose political support is necessary to uphold it. The open international economic system engendered by U.S. power fostered a productive wave of globalization that increased aggregate U.S. growth as well as the growth of many other countries, including U.S. competitors such as China. What globalization failed to do, however, was to ensure equitable growth within national boundaries — as indeed it naturally cannot. That responsibility falls upon national governments. The United States is particularly susceptible on this count because it lacks the strong social safety nets found within its G7 partners and because its culture of “social Spencerism” often prevents the state from undertaking extensive corrective economic remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The aim of securing broad domestic support for a grand strategy centered on preserving the American regime abroad will not succeed if that order does not provide suff icient material benef its for the populace, especially to those constituencies whose political support is necessary to uphold it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the United States has avoided acute societal instability in part because of the remarkable absence of social envy despite sharp economic inequalities, which are among the highest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) network. The elevated levels of economic freedom in the United States have in fact ensured that the popular “attitudes towards the rich are . . . more positive.” In other words, even poorer Americans, far from despising the wealthy, actually seek to emulate their achievements. This outlook is grounded in the conviction that wealth is invariably a reward for hard work and that social mobility awaits those who make the necessary effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence, however, refutes this mythology. The United States actually offers less social mobility than many of its European peers, Australia, and Japan, subsisting below the OECD average. In the United States, as in other peers with restricted mobility, the quality of one’s parents’ education, their socio-economic status, and in general one’s economic endowments at birth still seems to bear heavily on the reproduction of inequality and stunted mobility. This means that many poorer Americans are unlikely to enjoy as much social mobility as the American dream implies because their parents’ lower earnings and lower education often combine with constrained occupational status and sometimes substandard health to prevent them from climbing the social ladder as their wealthier peers, who profit from the increased embeddedness of the United States in the globalized world, can more easily do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because spreading economic opportunity more widely remains a necessary — even if not a sufficient — instrument for securing mass support for a policy of hegemonic leadership, U.S. internationalists must first pursue sensible macroeconomic policies at home. As part of this endeavor, Washington must focus on investing more in human capital, increasing retraining and employment mobility, rectifying the tax system, and providing expanded and more efficient public services. Absent such investments, the incentives for ordinary Americans to consistently support a grand strategy centered on the maintenance of U.S. primacy will be weak or precarious. To its credit, the Biden administration has begun to move in this direction, but its work here is far from complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, renewing the American regime at home by recentering its political life on the pursuit of the common good is long overdue for both instrumental and substantive reasons. The challenges here cannot be overstated. The Founding Fathers created a constitutional system that was competitive by design and characterized by divided government, which served as a perpetual “invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing . . . policy.” The domestic economy was similarly structured as a competitive system where utility- and profit-maximizing entities jostled in the marketplace and thereby helped to create the most productive system witnessed in history. For all of its failures regarding equitable distribution and the production of collective goods, the free market system has provided an effective solution to scarcity because the impersonal bargains struck among numerous interacting agents generate effective cooperation out of competitive maximizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political marketplace, in contrast, appears to be dreadfully battered because the rise of absolutist “winner take all” politics in recent years has undermined the fundamental necessity of deliberation and compromise while corroding the overarching idea of community that is essential to limit and regulate what otherwise becomes destructive rivalry. The reasons for this turn of events are multitudinous: the capture of the primary system by ideologues, the diminishing ideational diversity within political parties, the vehemently adversarial competition between Democrats and Republicans, the corrupting role of money in electoral competition, the paralyzing effects of divided government, and the rise of a highly partisan and combative media — not to mention technological innovations that permit the rapid dissemination and amplification of falsehoods — have all been identified as reasons for the growing crisis of governability. Compounding these factors is a more dangerous trend toward reimagining the meaning of citizenship itself away from the sworn commitment to the Constitution and its obligations to something grounded more on a racial or cultural inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these forces have bolstered a politics where the ambitions of a part have overwhelmed the good of the whole. The relentless competition between different social constituencies, as reflected in contemporary party politics, is no longer anchored in a desire to promote “the happiness or flourishing of the community, the well-ordered life in the polis” but merely the private benefits accruing to certain constituencies. As a result, when neither party enjoys complete dominance over the legislative and executive branches, it is difficult to pass any legislation that advances the national interest. And if one party comes to possess such dominance episodically, the legitimacy of the laws enacted during that time is continually challenged to the detriment of the country as a whole. The collapse of bipartisanship, which can only survive if there is a commitment to the common good, thus does not augur well for the coming competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this challenge at the simplest level requires the American polity to rediscover the meaning of those “three fateful words: We the people.” But as Willian Galston has argued correctly, internalizing this vision presumes that “the people who form it [this community] must want to live together as a unity, and they must think of themselves as sharing a common fate.” If this quest is not to end in a voluntarist or psychological morass, perhaps the only way forward is to consider structural changes that would allow citizens to convey their preferences more accurately and to increase the possibilities of compromise. Toward these ends, institutional reforms that could help a rediscovery of the common good might include the use of ranked-choice voting; the prevention of gerrymandering to create more competitive election districts; changes to the structure of primary elections; election finance reform to minimize reliance on opaque soft money provided by special interests; and better intraparty processes for choosing presidential nominees. None of these solutions guarantees that the United States will recover its founding vision of building a united political community, but absent such structural changes, the quest for the common good will perpetually remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to dismiss such concerns on the ground that issues of foreign policy and national defense invariably summon cooperation across the aisle and across different branches of government. But such successes are insufficient. The ongoing rivalry with China will be a long and extended contestation that plays out not over years but decades. Unlike the Soviet Union, China promises to emerge as a genuine peer competitor with broad economic, technological, and military strengths rivaling that of the United States. This Sino-American face-off, accordingly, will not involve merely competitive decisions pertaining to foreign policy and national defense but rather the entire gamut of societal and state power. In such circumstances, it will be poor consolation if the cross-party solidarity that might be manifested currently on strategic issues does not extend to strengthening the American polity as a whole: making the right social, economic, and political decisions that enable the entire citizenry — and not just some faction — to realize its highest potential — the common good — and thereby contribute toward generating the requisite levels of national power that permit Washington to comfortably maintain the American regime at home and abroad despite the myriad emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It will be poor consolation if the cross-party solidarity that might be manifested currently on strategic issues does not extend to strengthening the American polity as a whole.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-for-us-china-competition-today&quot;&gt;PREPARING FOR U.S.-CHINA COMPETITION TODAY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a painful reminder that the use of force is well and alive in international politics. Yet because China, unlike Russia, is certain to emerge as a much more dangerous rival than the Soviet Union ever was, the United States has to prepare for this competition by preserving the advantages it currently enjoys — the management of an international system that reflects its interests, the possession of a highly productive economy, its preeminence in innovation and technology, and its formidable military forces — while correcting those weaknesses that are visible both at home and abroad. There are three activities that are especially relevant in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilizing-coalitions-to-meet-the-chinese-challenge&quot;&gt;MOBILIZING COALITIONS TO MEET THE CHINESE CHALLENGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has had a remarkably good record of managing hegemony in comparison to previous great powers, the doubts that have arisen in recent years about its capacity and commitment to responsible global leadership need to be allayed. For starters, this requires recognizing that global leadership means leading not just on issues that matter narrowly to Washington, which understandably will receive priority, but on all major concerns that affect the larger international community as a whole. Taking the lead to solve global collective action problems, such as climate change, the threat of pandemics, the organization of global trade, and the protection of the commons, permits the United States to address problems that matter to its own security and prosperity while simultaneously building a variety of coalitions that will also matter on the narrower issues of U.S.-China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond collective action problems, the demands of global leadership do not imply that all parts of the world require equal or coordinate importance. In fact, prioritizing where the United States allocates resources toward solving the problems of high politics will be essential for success in an environment where both material capabilities and leadership attention are obviously limited in comparison to the demand for them. Moreover, the choice of instruments is equally pertinent: military forces are the most precious resources that must be husbanded for dealing with threats that cannot be neutralized by other means. Utilizing diplomacy, international institutions, and economic instruments are invariably to be preferred whenever possible over the employment of force — and especially in parts of the world where the United States has only secondary interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When American interests are assessed across the globe, there are three areas of critical priority: the American homeland and the wider Western Hemisphere, the Indo-Pacific region, and the European continent are intrinsically valuable to the United States; the Middle East is extrinsically valuable and U.S. interests there consist mainly of preventing competitors from controlling the energy reserves and subverting the stability and security of the regional states. Again, even in these vital theaters, diplomacy must be the instrument of first resort, albeit backed up by effective military capabilities. While the United States will remain engaged in other parts of the world, they do not justify any extraordinary expenditure of U.S. resources, though Washington should, and will, work with other allies to address challenges as they arise in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where U.S.-China competition is concerned, the obligations of global leadership translate into two specific and challenging projects: encouraging greater European responsibility for their own defense while integrating their support toward addressing the China challenge; and sustaining a capable coalition of Asian states to effectively balance against Beijing. Recognizing that globalization — however, weakened since the global financial crisis — is not disappearing and will not disappear short of systemic war because the forces of international capitalism cannot be constrained except by serious great-power conflict implies that China will remain enmeshed in dense economic ties both with the United States and with its allies in Europe and Asia (and with many other countries worldwide). Despite that fact, Washington has to mobilize coalitions of partners that are capable and willing to resist Chinese assertiveness and confront it with military instruments if that proves to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already has a network of allies that constitutes the nucleus of such a response. But this network is neither mature nor flexible enough to respond to the possible challenges posed by China. Of all the alliance agreements that the United States has entered into during the postwar period, only the Rio Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty (which established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]) are collective defense agreements: they commit all members to come to the defense of each other if one of them is attacked. The other agreements, such as bilateral treaties with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand (ANZUS), either bind the United States to come to the defense of its allies (without reciprocity necessarily) or trigger a collective response only if aggression occurs within certain specified geographic areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that any Chinese aggression will materialize in the coming decade in the Western Hemisphere in ways that justify collective defense under the Rio Treaty. But a major war over Taiwan could occur in Asia during this timeframe, one that could implicate NATO automatically while pressuring at least Japan, South Korea, and Australia. The problem for NATO, however, is that although an attack on the United States or U.S. forces in Asia could trigger the alliance’s collective defense obligations, NATO’s European members are neither militarily threatened by China nor are their armed forces configured to deal with the geographically distant Chinese threat in a way that the United States already is on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the first task for the United States is to aid NATO in operationalizing an effective response to the “systemic challenges” posed by China to the alliance, even if the latter cannot be expected to make countering China its principal responsibility. In fact, NATO’s European constituents could make a significant contribution to U.S. security in Asia by doing what they can do best: assuming primary responsibility for protecting their continent’s and its immediate environs’ security in order to enable Washington to free up military resources currently earmarked for Europe to support potential operations in Asia. This does not involve any strategic decoupling between the United States and Europe: the collective defense obligations of both would remain intact, but there would be a better division of labor, with the European allies taking point for European defense and the United States offering backup, while the United States takes point in Asia with NATO providing backup as necessary. Implementing this vision will require greater European investments in defense, a promise that has surfaced (even if not yet fructified) in the aftermath of Russia’s Ukraine invasion. And it will also require a more resolute European commitment to take high politics seriously — as Joseph Borrell put it, to “relearn the language of power” — in contrast to past practices where Europe busied itself with profitable low politics while leaving the United States to bear the disproportionate burden for ensuring its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NATO’s European constituents could make a signif icant contribution to U.S. security in Asia by doing what they can do best: assuming primary responsibility for protecting their continent’s and its immediate environs’ security in order to enable Washington to free up military resources currently earmarked for Europe to support potential operations in Asia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the new division of labor, however, the European allies can make an equally significant contribution by pressing back on the dangers now posed by China. Beijing today is more than just a systemic challenger to NATO: it is already a tacit threat. Consequently, Washington needs to work with NATO, the European Union, and European capitals to encourage greater European investments not just in military modernization but especially in monitoring and mitigating the risks arising from Chinese investment, technology, and the threats to intellectual property; increasing the resilience of European defense supply chains; improving cybersecurity assurance in the face of dangers to critical infrastructure; and increasing transatlantic cooperation to protect the global commons. The remarkable Chinese intimidation of Lithuania already previews what will be Europe’s future — even as Beijing continues to lure and divide European societies and nations by access to its markets and the benefits of its outward investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformations in the West need to be complemented by greater attention to the East. For the foreseeable future, China will remain the most significant challenger to U.S. hegemony globally and especially in Asia. This does not imply that Washington must focus on Asia to the neglect of the rest of the world, but it does require keeping developments in Asia at the front and center of U.S. strategic consciousness. The Asian continent already hosts the most troublesome states for U.S. interests — China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — but the problems that will be posed by China along the Asian Rimland are in a class by themselves. In fact, if Washington can adequately meet this challenge, the other contingencies will devolve into “lesser included cases” subsumed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second task, then, consists of deepening and even transforming America’s key Asian alliances to confront the wider regional challenges posed by China’s assertiveness. Washington in recent years has sensibly doubled down on investing in a coalitional strategy, and its investments in resurrecting the Quad are a good step in this direction. But the Quad is likely to be most effective mainly in diplomatic coordination and delivering public goods within the region and elsewhere. It is unlikely to be involved qua Quad in any military defense against Chinese aggression. Only the U.S. alliances with Japan and Australia will probably be relevant here. While both these alliance partners enjoy close security cooperation with the United States, neither is automatically obliged to come to U.S. aid if they are not attacked in crisis (although both will probably be involved in U.S. military operations out of choice, depending on the character of the contingency).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has worked with each partner individually — as each has with the others — to deepen strategic cooperation, but what is still missing is a unified mesh architecture that binds all three nations in the service of cooperative defense. Moreover, Japan and Australia still have significant shortfalls in military capabilities that prevent them from assisting the United States in ways that would be necessary in the event of any conflict with China. In any event, even if a formal collective defense obligation between the three nations is beyond reach during this decade, there is compelling necessity for all three states to initiate collaborative defense planning at the strategic and operational levels, develop mutual access arrangements, conduct rotational deployments at each other’s facilities, and pursue cooperation in logistics, communications, force interoperability, and weapons development and acquisitions. Such structured collaboration would provide the United States as well as its partners greater opportunities to express the political solidarity necessary to signal resolve in peacetime while ensuring the generation, posturing, and operationalization of capabilities that are essential during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities are most likely to be tested in a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan — a possibility that is increasingly realistic because Beijing does not seem content to live with the current status quo indefinitely. Given this change in Chinese attitude under Xi Jinping, Washington needs to urgently assess the merits of persisting with its current policy of strategic ambiguity. This approach made sense when the United States sought to deter both the Chinese use of force and the possibility of provocative Taiwanese actions toward independence simultaneously. Today, when the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has evolved decisively in favor of China, Taipei is unlikely to aggravate China in ways that were previously feared (and this danger can be minimized in any case by private admonitions to Taipei about the limits of U.S. commitment in the face of any destabilizing Taiwanese behaviors). If the current separation of Taiwan from China is judged to be in U.S. interest — and there are persuasive arguments for this conclusion — then Washington ought to shift toward a policy of strategic clarity, namely, transparently conveying that any Chinese use of force against Taiwan would be met by a U.S. military response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan remains the most pressing strategic danger in East Asia, then preventing this outcome demands a clear commitment that the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in a crisis. Obviously, it also requires Washington — and Taipei — to build up the necessary military capabilities to make such a commitment viable. What should be corrected, therefore, is the current course, which has taken the United States in the direction of aiding Taiwan through arms transfers, joint training, and diplomatic support but without any clear-cut assurance of defending it in the event of a Chinese attack. The lessons of Ukraine are instructive here: NATO’s commitment at the Bucharest summit to consider Ukrainian membership eventually proved provocative enough for Russia to attack Ukraine with the aim of erasing its political existence and thereby stalling its integration with the West. The growing U.S. assistance to Taiwan could prove to be a similar affront if it persuades Xi Jinping that the bolstering of de facto Taiwanese independence must be forcibly arrested before it is too late. Averting this cataclysm in the context of growing U.S.-China rivalry increasingly suggests that Washington should strengthen deterrence not simply by assisting Taiwan — as it is already doing — but by clearly signaling to China that any aggression against the island would be resisted by U.S. military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan remains the most pressing strategic danger in East Asia, then preventing this outcome demands a clear commitment that the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in a crisis.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pursuing-sensible-external-economic-engagement&quot;&gt;PURSUING SENSIBLE EXTERNAL ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While course corrections at the geopolitical level are essential for success in the evolving U.S.-China competition, similar shifts must occur in regard to fortifying the nation’s productive base, a task that is fundamentally under Washington’s own control and not dependent on the choices made by other countries. Because the issues involved here have been discussed at length elsewhere, the following discussion will concentrate only on the nation’s trade strategies, which have unfortunately become more controversial in recent years than they should be. The adjustments in the U.S. approach to trade should be pursued not merely because they bear on American prosperity — which is clearly an intrinsic good — but equally because they affect Washington’s ability to compete with Beijing: a sensible trade policy increases U.S. national power, contributes toward the maintenance of U.S. leadership in the international system, and shapes the calculations of other nations who rely on trade more than the United States does and whose partnership will be necessary for American success in the ongoing rivalry with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues of trade strategy, ordinarily, should not be big concerns for the United States because its large and open domestic economy is less trade sensitive for its growth. Even so, Washington has, since the beginning of the postwar era, invested heavily in building and maintaining an ever more open international trading system in order to enlarge global prosperity and reduce international instability. Ever since China’s entry into this regime, however, the costs of asymmetrical U.S. economic openness have weighed heavily on American policymakers. These concerns peaked during the Trump administration when the president, who was antagonistic toward multilateral trade long before he entered office, sought to gut the global trading system through the imposition of widespread tariffs on allies and adversaries alike. This approach, which was supposed to correct the failures of the global trading system, was quixotic because the evolution of cross-border supply chains rendered any strategy centered on engineering bilateral trade agreements as a substitute hopelessly inappropriate. It had the effect of not only undermining the traditional U.S. leadership in multilateral trade but also strengthening global perceptions of American unreliability, especially in Asia and Europe, where trade is a critical driver of growth, while permitting China to pose as a more constructive and often more valuable partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has corrected some of Trump’s excesses, but it appears to share many of his fears about the deleterious consequences of trade on American prosperity. One scholar, in fact, described “Biden’s trade policy to be Trump’s without the tweets.” Achieving success in the U.S.-China competition requires the United States to make multiple course corrections on trade issues. For starters, Washington needs to renew its support for the World Trade Organization (WTO) by at the very least permitting the appointment of new judges to its Appellate Body. Global trade reform through the WTO is invariably painful, but as the latest ministerial in Geneva proved, incremental progress is possible despite the agony, and, at any rate, there are no alternatives to the WTO where regulating global trade is concerned. The United States obviously benefits directly from the existence of a robust multilateral trading system, but even if the rewards to itself are more modest — because U.S. trade-to-GDP ratios are much lower than the global average — its support for the WTO represents an example of enlightened hegemony insofar as U.S. leadership here provides gains for others that could pay back in terms of strengthened geopolitical cooperation. Neither political party in the United States today, however, seems committed to expanding international trade. Yet disregarding trade is a good way to lose friends and influence at a time when China has become the primary trading partner of the largest number of countries globally and has exploited that connectivity to shape both their economic and strategic choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Achieving success in the U.S.-China competition requires the United States to make multiple course corrections on trade issues&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. disenchantment with trade is obviously shaped by multiple concerns: trade losses suffered by important domestic constituencies, constrained market access abroad, and relative gains advantages accruing to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade losses suffered either sectorally or regionally as a result of “the China shock” obviously have serious implications in U.S. domestic politics, but such outcomes are bound to occur as a natural consequence of international trade itself. Less efficient producers go out of business as a consequence of exchange across borders, yet this outcome is compensated by the increased aggregate benefit to society as a whole. Mitigating these losses requires private producers to invest in increasing competitiveness and the state to assist these efforts through broader macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programs, thereby enabling those populations affected by trade losses to survive in the face of the dislocations. The United States, unfortunately, failed in regard to supporting adjustment in recent decades, but refusing to expand trade because of these shortcomings amounts to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Moreover, if U.S. trade losses are caused by unfair trade practices, then these problems must be addressed by state action either bilaterally or preferably multilaterally — and this is where the U.S. dismay with the WTO Appellate Body has only contributed toward further weakening the global trading system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems of constrained market access abroad also have to be remedied by national negotiations either bilaterally or multilaterally. The WTO has proved irritatingly slow on this count, but the current U.S. circumspection in considering any more bilateral trade agreements has unfortunately cut off the other avenue by which the United States could gain new markets. Because the U.S. economy is already more open than most, bilateral trading agreements are especially beneficial for the United States. The fear that new trade agreements may be bad politics domestically, however, has resulted in constraining this option right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of relative gains also has to be addressed in different ways. The biggest problem for the United States presently on this count is China. Most of China’s trade gains in the last several decades, however, have accrued through cost advantages — the benefits of being a cheap, yet high-quality, manufacturer. These are entirely legitimate gains. The extent of the illegitimate gains is harder to quantify: these arise from the theft of intellectual property or its coercive extraction in exchange for market access, significant governmental subsidies provided to private or public enterprises, the manipulation of exchange rates, unfair practices such as dumping, or state-driven strategies focused on cornering market share by eliminating foreign competitors. Washington historically has been reluctant to confront Beijing about these behaviors in part because U.S. businesses were afraid that any confrontation with China would make life difficult for their own commercial operations within the country. The Trump administration finally changed course in this regard, but its solutions — increased tariffs to stimulate greater Chinese purchases of American goods — were hardly appropriate to the larger problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerted action to address these issues has still proven to be elusive in Washington, but the one solution that the United States slowly gravitated toward — creating partial free trade agreements (PFTAs) centered on high standards among a small group of partners — is also in limbo. The Trump administration walked out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the most important PFTA negotiated in recent years, although by the time Trump did so, the Democratic Party also had soured on this accord. The benefit of PFTAs, such as the TPP, is that they would have allowed the United States and its partners to enjoy heightened trade gains among themselves, thereby offsetting some of the losses suffered as a result of trade with China, while institutionalizing new, higher-standard trade rules that would have reduced the cost benefits accruing to countries such as China because of their weaker labor and environmental standards. U.S. domestic politics, however, has prevented the Biden administration from considering rejoining the TPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this matters for two critical reasons. First, the U.S. absence from the TPP, which represents enhanced trade integration in Asia, coincides with the heightened Chinese interest in binding other Asian states more deeply into its own economy, an ambition signaled both by its own lower-quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement — today, the world’s biggest trade deal — and now its new interest in joining the TPP at a time when the United States itself seems content to stay out. At a time when U.S.-China competition is intensifying, the failure of the United States to lead in rule setting and to bind itself to countries that are important Chinese economic partners presages an avoidable loss of influence that could prove costly in times of crises or conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. abandonment of the TPP implies that Washington is willing to forego the enhanced trade gains that would derive from its participation in a high-quality agreement when even incremental increases in U.S. GDP only promise benefits for the competition with China. Because many TPP partners still possess relatively protected economies, U.S. participation in this agreement would pry open their hitherto closed markets and, by institutionalizing new and higher standards, limit China’s advantages in global trade.40 Consequently, the United States — to put it bluntly — should reenter the TPP at the earliest opportunity. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework now proposed by the Biden administration seems like thin gruel in contrast. To the degree that the administration seeks to vitalize its trade pillar by using the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement as a model, it will only end up recreating a simulacrum of the TPP. It should save itself the trouble and go for the real thing instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger issue of improving the relative gains enjoyed by the United States in the competition with China matters significantly for success in the U.S.-China competition because at the end of the day the nation with a larger and more efficient economy enjoys major advantages in any geopolitical face-off. That Beijing has been able to often exploit the international trading system unfairly over the last several decades has sometimes encouraged the idea that the United States would be better off without a trading partner like China. This erroneous notion, which surfaced during the Trump years, was encapsulated in the president’s belief that “Trade is Bad,” an idea that underlay his protectionist impulses and his inchoate ideas about decoupling from China. In the era prior to globalization, cutting off economic ties with China might have been a debatable solution for reducing Chinese relative gains and, by implication, the resources available to Beijing for power-political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interdependent international system, however, the idea is harebrained. It is in fact one of the paradoxes of security competition under interdependence that trade with one’s rivals is valuable precisely because it provides the additional resources necessary to sustain the competition with them, especially when foregoing trade with one’s competitors is meaningless when they have many other trading partners to choose from in a multi-actor environment. Any relative gains advantages that accrue to rivals in such circumstances should be mitigated by both better macroeconomic policies at home and creating supplementary — higher-standard — trading networks that exclude them. But desisting from trade with competitors, particularly when other partners cannot be denied to them, is rarely a good way to realize the relative gains necessary to secure advantages in the larger geopolitical contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, undoubtedly, has to minimize its vulnerabilities to Chinese coercion, especially in an environment where China dominates global manufacturing. The solution to this problem consists of accepting the loss of some efficiency gains by promoting the purposeful diversification of supply. This requires assessing critical vulnerabilities in the supply chain, which matter most where national defense, information and communication technologies and platforms, and possibly public health are concerned — because constrained access here could have devastating consequences in times of conflict. Depending on the salience of other issue areas, alternative solutions such as stockpiling should be considered either as supplements or as substitutes to diversification. Because the United States must preserve its advantages in the arena of high technology, Washington should purposefully limit Beijing’s access to the critical tangible and intangible elements in this arena, but such defensive strategies must not degenerate into an indiscriminate attack on trade with China itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, therefore, is a deceptively simple one: U.S. power in the international system ultimately derives from America’s capacity to dominate the cycles of innovation globally. It is the ability to perpetually foment technological revolutions faster than any other state that nourishes U.S. global hegemony. Maintaining this dominance is intimately linked to the openness of American society, as embodied in its political, economic, and social institutions, as well as its openness to world, which is manifested in its hospitality to foreign goods, capital, ideas, and people. Any drift toward autarky that weakens these foundations undermines American power and, to that degree, impedes its capacity to prevail in the long-term rivalry with China more easily. Fortunately, most of the choices that bear on America’s capacity to out-innovate its rivals lie within its own control — and, hence, deserve as much attention as the threats posed by its competitors. In the long cycle of international politics, the United States will do better if it concentrates on staying ahead of its adversaries rather than obsessing about what might be required to pull them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restoring-us-military-power&quot;&gt;RESTORING U.S. MILITARY POWER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building the appropriate international coalitions and strengthening American economic power, including through trade and innovation, are the foundations for success in the long-term competition with China, fielding effective military power is also indispensable. The success of the liberal international order, in fact, ultimately derives from the capacity of the United States to protect its members by force of arms when necessary. This requires Washington not merely to field capable military forces but rather superior ones relative to its adversaries because only functional dominance will allow the nation to win its wars at the lowest possible cost. The United States already deploys the world’s most formidable military capabilities, but they are unfortunately not necessarily appropriate for meeting the challenges posed by China today and in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the long cycle of international politics, the United States will do better if it concentrates on staying ahead of its adversaries rather than obsessing about what might be required to pull them down.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is largely because Washington was consumed during the last two decades with prosecuting multiple military operations against terrorist groups and insurgencies. This focus prevented the United States from making the investments necessary to deal with the new threats posed by great powers, even as it wore down the combat capabilities that were continuously involved in these misnamed “low-intensity” operations. Even when conflicts with distant state actors materialized, the United States enjoyed the advantage of being able to move forces into the theater without these arriving components being targeted en route to their deployment areas or in the rear, a luxury that is unlikely to be replicated in any future war with China. The U.S. military, therefore, for all its strengths, still requires significant recapitalization to equip it to deal with the threats posed by major state rivals, along with the appropriate changes in posture. Much has already been written on this subject before and, therefore, does not need repeating here. The following themes, however, are worth emphasizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core capability that the United States must recover is effective power projection. The capacity to deploy powerful military forces across the globe, sustain them at a distance from the homeland for extended periods of time, and permit them to win wars even against significant local opponents is what makes the United States a genuine superpower with no peers. Effective power projection thus requires potent combat elements — the sharpened spearpoint — as well as the larger command of the commons — to enable them to reach the relevant fronts and sustain their effectiveness when deployed forward. These capabilities matter a fortiori in Asia because rivalry with China entails the necessity of defending distant allies across the vast Pacific, allies that are located on China’s periphery and in close proximity to its vast military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing such a challenge is not altogether new for the United States. During the Cold War, Washington had to defend European allies that were closer in proximity to the Soviet Union than they were to the United States. Moreover, these partners were situated on a common landmass shared with Soviet power, which also had the advantage of being battle hardened and highly proficient at the operational level of war. In contrast, most U.S. allies in Asia (with the exception of South Korea and Thailand, which are thankfully unlikely to be threatened by Chinese land power) enjoy the benefits of “the stopping power of water.” And although they face a more multidimensionally capable China than the Soviet Union ever was, they are also advantaged by China’s lack of experience in prosecuting major combat operations involving the air and sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. strategy for coping with the threat posed by China to its allies conforms to the same pattern established during the Cold War: maintaining a combination of forward-deployed and forward-operating forces in proximity to China backed up by expeditionary components arriving from different parts of the world when necessary off the Asian Rimland. If war becomes inevitable, China’s “best” strategy for military success in the face of such a posture, then, arguably consists of quickly overwhelming its local adversaries before the United States can come to their assistance, while holding out the threat of interdicting all U.S. reinforcements that may be committed to their liberation if Washington chooses to resist the Chinese aggression. The corresponding “best” strategy for the United States, accordingly, is to deny China the ability to achieve these aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of restoring U.S. military power must, however, be anchored first in a clear declaratory policy aimed at strengthening deterrence. Because preventing war is preferable even to winning it — even if winning in the first instance consists only of denying Beijing its immediate war aims — the United States must signal clearly to China that any attacks on its allies — to include Taiwan, if Washington is committed to defending it — will entail high costs that the United States is willing to bear despite the risks of escalation. Obviously, the costs of any nuclear escalation will be exorbitant, and the modernization of U.S. nuclear forces, which is already underway, will hopefully serve to prevent any Chinese use of nuclear weapons even in an intense crisis. The most pressing issue with respect to deterrence, however, is less likely to be nuclear but conventional: how far can the United States go with respect to the use of conventional military instruments in deterring China from using force against its allies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because preventing war is preferable even to winning it, the United States must signal clearly to China that any attacks on its allies will entail high costs that the United States is willing to bear despite the risks of escalation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the most important restraint on the use of U.S. conventional capabilities would be targeting Chinese nuclear reserves, which should be avoided simply in order to minimize the risks of escalation. As China’s nuclear transformation proceeds, these risks actually diminish because it is unlikely that Beijing would ever find itself faced by “use or lose” pressures when it deploys a large, diversified, and survivable nuclear force. The hard question, consequently, pertains to conventional attacks on China’s conventional military assets on its homeland. In this context, Washington should consider the merits of signaling to Beijing that Chinese territory cannot be preserved as a sanctuary that is immune to U.S. conventional operations if China attacks American allies in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the degree possible, the U.S. military ought to invest in options to defend the allies that do not require any attacks on Chinese soil, but this may turn out to be either operationally difficult or politically untenable if China attacks allied homelands or U.S. bases in Asia. Consequently, there is good reason to shore up deterrence by communicating to China prior to any conflict that its costs would not only be prohibitive but could also entail attacks on Chinese territory — all with the aim of preventing Beijing’s recourse to force to begin with. Such threats are undoubtedly nettlesome, but their necessity — both to reassure allies and to defend them effectively — as well as the manner of their conveyance deserve careful attention now as the United States prepares for a long-term competition with China that embodies some non-trivial risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States clearly recognizes the need to acquire the relevant capabilities to win such a war both at the front and within the wider theater. The joint force has already developed sensible concepts of operations toward this end, and the importance of acquiring more long-range and stealthier platforms, unmanned delivery and support systems, advanced standoff munitions in large numbers, better air and missile defenses, a survivable command and control system employing diverse components, and a redundant and highly resilient basing infrastructure around the region is well appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the services are certain to incorporate these capabilities progressively into their force structure over time, they are faced with four distinct types of risk. To begin with, many of the technologies that are intended to provide the U.S. military with a critical edge are either still in development or are not yet mature (and, in some cases, are not even invented yet). Further, the current service plans to divest legacy systems in order to free up resources for their advanced and more expensive replacements are eminently sensible from a long-term perspective but run the danger of producing a weaker force in the interim, especially if the more pessimistic assessments about China’s aggressive timeline for absorbing Taiwan turn out to be true. More consequentially, even with corrections to the force structure gaps, the U.S. military still needs to complete the force posture adjustments and plans pertaining to positioning key military assets if they are to effectively contribute in a China contingency. Finally, any successful strategy for realizing effective U.S. power projection in Asia — which involves neutralizing China’s expansive investments in theater denial — entails some form of “archipelagic defense,” yet the political understandings with allies and partners that will be required to implement such a concept are far from being realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the United States will be unable to restore its military power to serve the ends of successful extended deterrence in Asia and globally without sufficient budgetary support. Although the Biden administration, like the Obama administration before it, prioritizes the Indo-Pacific region specifically and the maintenance of U.S. military strength more generally, it has not yet provided the resources necessary for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to achieve these aims. Either some increases in the current budgetary top line are necessary or a more radical restructuring of the service components is essential. The administration appears shy about pursuing the latter because it involves making hard choices about which service’s budget must be robbed to pay for the expansion of the others; and it seems equally shy about pursuing the former course because of the constraints of domestic politics, even while its own budgetary requests are still populated by “a series of programs. . . that are of questionable utility to the Department of Defense’s [core] mission.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any calls for increased budgets invariably provoke criticism by skeptics who charge that the U.S. allocation for defense is already larger than the next nine countries combined — a complaint that, although trivially correct, fails to meter America’s defense expenditures against the extent of its interests, not to mention its hegemonic responsibilities. The plain fact of the matter is that the United States today spends about 3 percent of its GDP on defense, a far cry from the 6 percent or more spent during the Reagan administration and the even higher levels committed earlier in the Cold War. Washington can afford to spend more on defense if it chooses to without undermining the larger economy, and it will certainly blow through the current top line if it is forced to by a war with China. If a more modest increment now and in the future serves to strengthen deterrence and avoid conflict, the American people would certainly be better served by such a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that China represents the most serious challenge to U.S. hegemony since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the face of this challenge, it is often feared that the U.S. investment in opposing the Russian invasion of Ukraine might prove to be an enervating distraction that prevents Washington from effectively facing up to Beijing’s ambitions. These are not imaginary anxieties, but what is even more worrisome is that the American polity will fail to perceive that Chinese and Russian assertiveness goes beyond the specific threats they pose in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, respectively. Rather, they represent challenges to the larger liberal international order underwritten by U.S. hegemonic power — and the United States may end up mounting only a ragged defense if its people either are divided among themselves, fail to receive the benefits of hegemonic stability, or suffer a loss of civic virtue. These are indeed the greater and more enduring challenges faced by the United States, which must be addressed if the American regime is to be revitalized both abroad and at home. Doing so effectively is not beyond the nation’s capacities. A successful response here will strengthen the United States in the coming decades and protect both its values and its interests. It will also permit the productive — and necessary — engagement of China, but as Zalmay Khalilzad has perceptively argued, “engagement must be done from a position of strength with a clear-minded appreciation of the daunting realities we face.”&lt;/p&gt;

The senior leadership directs resource distribution globally, helping to surge support to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in different theaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups’ growing focus on local insurgent dynamics has enabled them to build support, expand territorially, and develop new capabilities. Weak governance and unaddressed grievances have made them resilient to counterterrorism operations, including leadership attrition, and enabled their reemergence after setbacks. Globally, Salafi-jihadi groups are set to strengthen as counterterrorism pressure lessens and local conditions worsen. They have prioritized local expansion over targeting the West, their “far enemy,” because of their operational successes in regional theaters. They may be able to generate or reconstitute transnational terror attack capabilities, which US counterterrorism pressure has largely eliminated, from these local bases. Al Shabaab, for example, pursued another 9/11-style attack in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan continues to reverberate through the Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Shabaab and others have cited the Taliban’s strategy as a model for their own success through jihad. Moreover, the new terrorist sanctuary in Afghanistan permitted al Qaeda to revitalize its lagging global media presence and possibly better coordinate among its affiliates. The global reduction in counterterrorism resources has also lifted pressure from many Salafi-jihadi groups, which increasingly enjoy their own regional safe havens from where they threaten to destabilize nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behind-the-scorecard&quot;&gt;Behind the Scorecard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;africa&quot;&gt;Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups have expanded rapidly in Africa. They have sustained local attack cells and broader insurgencies by capitalizing on local instability and governments’ inability to provide security and services, including drought and famine response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In East Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, al Shabaab’s insurgency in Somalia endures. Al Shabaab controls significant parts of south-central Somalia and has escalated attacks in the capital region since early 2022. It capitalized on diminished counterterrorism pressure caused by the withdrawal of US troops in 2021. Pressure on al Shabaab has increased since the reinsertion of US forces in May 2022, but its gains will take time to reverse. Additionally, al Shabaab conducted two military incursions into Ethiopia in summer 2022, indicating an intent to expand regionally. The Somali Islamic State province is relatively small but serves as an intermediary and financial hub for multiple Islamic State branches. It links the Islamic State’s central and east African provinces to Islamic State leadership in Iraq and Syria and transmits funds to Afghanistan via Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, Islamic State leadership declared the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) and the Islamic State in Mozambique (ISM) autonomous, rather than two wings of the same province. Both ISM and ISCAP may benefit from their connection to IS leadership, which may push them to focus on a broader regional approach or increase their emphasis on external operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, ISM has been engaged in an insurgency in northern Mozambique. Mozambican, Rwandan, and Southern African Development Community forces dislodged ISM from key towns in 2021, but ISM has relocated, expanded its activities elsewhere in the region — including increasing cross-border attacks into Tanzania — and encouraged fighters to melt into civilian communities until called on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, ISCAP has pursued a low-level insurgency for several years, prompting the declaration of martial law in two provinces in 2021. Ugandan and Congolese forces engaged in a concerted counterterrorism effort in late 2021 and early 2022, prompted by ISCAP attacks in Uganda, but ISCAP’s frequency of attacks has held steady. Over the past two years, ISCAP has effectively doubled its area of operation, increased its operational tempo, and attracted more foreign fighters. It has also freed upward of 2,000 prisoners in major prison breaks since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In North Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, the Islamic State Sinai Province (ISSP) continues to conduct attacks against gas pipelines and the Egyptian armed forces but has declined in strength due to persistent Egyptian counterterrorism pressure and the resolution of underlying local grievances. The leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) remains in Algeria, but its focus has been the success of its subordinate affiliates in the Sahel, primarily Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen (JNIM). AQIM appears to operate as a link to al Qaeda’s global leadership and a financial and ideological facilitator, although it has not exhibited significant independent operational capacity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In West Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, JNIM has embedded itself in communities in central Mali, providing aspects of governance, including administering justice, brokering interethnic peace deals, and imposing taxes. From this stronghold, it launched a series of attacks in southern Mali in summer 2022 and actively threatens security in Bamako, Mali’s capital. The withdrawal of French forces from Mali and possible further easing of counterterrorism pressure will permit JNIM to further entrench itself in central and northern Mali. JNIM previously expanded into Burkina Faso and has attack cells in Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo. JNIM’s population-centric approach better positions it to gain local support compared to its local Salafi-jihadi rival, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), known for its brutality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, the Islamic State declared ISGS an autonomous province, recognizing it as the Islamic State Sahel Province. The group has struggled due to leadership attrition. Malian pressure and intergroup competition have forced ISGS to reevaluate current approaches, including agreeing to a truce with JNIM. But ISGS remains an active operator in Mali’s embattled eastern provinces and a major threat to civilians in western Niger and northern Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northeastern Nigeria, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) has absorbed or eclipsed much of Boko Haram, the group from which it originally splintered. Over the past year, ISWAP has increased in operational tempo and audacity, including a large-scale prison break in July 2022 on the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. Its insurgency in the northeast is ongoing, but a rise in operations in central Nigeria indicates it has begun to build networks and capacity outside of its current strongholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northwestern Nigeria, al Qaeda–linked Ansaru appears to be making a resurgence after several years of dormancy. The group confirmed its loyalty to AQIM. Although it is not yet a major threat, its ascendency indicates growing al Qaeda influence in the region. It appears to be pursuing a population-centric strategy and has adopted the banditry tactics common to other militant groups in northern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;middle-east&quot;&gt;Middle East&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterterrorism campaigns have weakened Salafi-jihadi groups in Iraq and Yemen, though early indicators point to the groups reconstituting capabilities. Broader regional instability has set favorable conditions for Salafi-jihadi groups, particularly in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Iraq and Syria&lt;/strong&gt;, the Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) has exhibited resilience and persistence in the face of extensive counterterrorism operations. In Iraq, ISIS activities have declined in 2021 and 2022, but this may reflect a reorientation toward Syria to take advantage of growing instability and insecurity. ISIS has conducted several complex attacks, including a major January 2022 prison break in Hasakah, northern Syria, from its strongholds and training camps in the Syrian desert. Massive camps of displaced persons, many related to imprisoned ISIS fighters, may further stress security in Syria. The loss of multiple senior Islamic State leaders, both killed and captured, has weakened the global Islamic State leadership cadre operating from Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hayat Tahrir al Sham controls significant territory in northwestern Syria and has made a concerted effort to portray itself as moderate and legitimate, distancing itself from its Salafi-jihadi roots. It has consolidated power by targeting Hurras al Din — also known as al Qaeda in Syria — and occasionally the Islamic State in Idlib province, where Hayat Tahrir al Sham is the de facto governing body. It has pledged to provide services and defend those under its jurisdiction, and it exerts market controls and extracts taxes. Hurras al Din still professes strong loyalty to al Qaeda. It has been weakened over the past few years, though it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Yemen&lt;/strong&gt;, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) continued to strengthen slowly under reduced counterterrorism pressure. The group is more fragmented, but it remains focused on regenerating transnational attack capabilities, fighting the Houthis and local opposition and inspiring lone-wolf attacks in the US and Europe. The Islamic State in Yemen remains on a downward trajectory. Its key value to the global Islamic State network is its role as a financial and facilitation link between IS-Somalia and Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-asia&quot;&gt;South Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups in the region have strengthened considerably since the August 2021 withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan. Al Qaeda and al Qaeda–linked groups enjoy increased freedoms under the Taliban, while ISKP has strengthened. In Indonesia and the Philippines, counterterrorism efforts have been successful at degrading Islamic State cells. Major attacks have decreased substantially, though some pockets of militancy remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Afghanistan and Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, the Taliban has reestablished a safe haven for al Qaeda and al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) since the withdrawal of US and NATO forces in August 2021. Al Qaeda has not yet seen an increase in external operating capacity, but the apparent freedom with which al Qaeda leadership operates in Afghanistan indicates that recruitment, training, and propaganda operations are likely to increase. Some counterterrorism successes, such as the targeting of the late al Qaeda emir Ayman al Zawahiri, may be disruptive in the short term, but counterterrorism pressure has diminished substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIS has maintained a low profile and individual fighters remain part of Taliban combat units. The Haqqani network retains its role as a regional facilitator and link between various regional Salafi-jihadi groups, with close ties to the Taliban and al Qaeda. Notably, the Haqqani network’s leader is a cabinet member in the new Taliban government and has been implicated in harboring Zawahiri. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, while engaged in ongoing negotiations with the Pakistani government, has benefited substantially from Taliban leadership in Afghanistan. Splinter groups have rejoined the primary organization, and in March 2022, it announced a spring offensive against Pakistani security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISKP reconstituted over the course of 2021, taking advantage of Afghanistan’s instability in the wake of the Taliban takeover. The Taliban’s counterinsurgency operations against ISKP have had mixed results as ISKP focuses on undermining Taliban control, attacking infrastructure and targeting sectarian and ethnic divisions in Afghanistan and reestablishing former strongholds. ISKP’s ranks have swelled due to fighters’ release from prison during the Taliban’s summer 2021 offensive and increased recruitment afterward. The Islamic State has increased its funding for ISKP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, authorities have made a significant impact on the operational capacity of Islamic State–linked groups, although they still pose a threat. In the southern Philippines, some pockets of activity remain, and periodic clashes with government forces and small-scale attacks continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decapitation approach has strained al Qaeda’s and the Islamic State’s leadership cadres, though both have proven resilient to attrition. The Islamic State has routinized its leadership succession, but turnover in the group’s senior leadership has helped weaken its ties to its regional branches, resulting in forced delegation of authority to local leaders. Al Qaeda’s already decentralized structure limits the impact of leadership deaths, but attrition in the ranks of its next generation of leaders may challenge the organization in the future. Newfound sanctuary in Afghanistan and the release of al Qaeda operatives from prison has enabled increased messaging from senior leaders to their global followers and added to the number of veteran operatives on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Salafi-jihadi leaders as of September 2022 include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saif al Adel&lt;/em&gt;: A senior al Qaeda operative assessed to be the most likely new emir following the August 2022 death of Zawahiri. Adel spent significant time in Iran and may now be in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Rahman al Maghrebi&lt;/em&gt;: An al Qaeda shura council member, al Sahab media director, and head of external communications. He is believed to be in Iran. An alternate potential successor to Zawahiri.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Ubaydah Yusef al Annabi&lt;/em&gt;: AQIM’s emir, a longtime senior member. He succeeded Abdelmalek Droukdel after his death in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khalid Batarfi&lt;/em&gt;: AQAP’s emir since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahmed Umar (Abu Ubaidah)&lt;/em&gt;: Al Shabaab’s emir since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iyad ag Ghaly&lt;/em&gt;: JNIM emir with long-standing ties to AQIM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samir Hijazi&lt;/em&gt;: Hurras al Din’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Osama Mahmood&lt;/em&gt;: AQIS’s emir since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu al Hasan al Hashimi al Qurayshi&lt;/em&gt;: Islamic State leader and successor to Abu Ibrahim al Qurayshi, who was killed in February 2022. Possibly the nom de guerre of either Juma’a Awad Ibrahim al Badri or Bashar Khattab al Sumaidai, both high-ranking Islamic State leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tamim al Kurdi&lt;/em&gt;: Leader of the Afghanistan-based al Siddiq office, appointed by Islamic State senior leadership in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Bara al Sahrawi&lt;/em&gt;: ISGS’s emir, a seasoned logistical officer with experience operating in Libya. He replaced Adnan Abu Walid al Sahrawi after his death in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Musab al Barnawi&lt;/em&gt;: Served as ISWAP’s emir between August 2016 and March 2019, before being appointed head of the Islamic State’s al Furqan office, which is based in the Lake Chad region and coordinates regional branches, in May 2021. His current status is unclear. The Nigerian government reported in September 2021 he had been killed, but unsubstantiated reports have since emerged that he remains alive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musa Baluku&lt;/em&gt;: ISCAP’s leader in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Yasir Hassan&lt;/em&gt;: ISCAP’s leader in Mozambique, as identified by the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shahab al Muhajir&lt;/em&gt;: ISKP’s emir, an Iraqi who defected from the Haqqani network and al Qaeda and succeeded the group’s founder, Hafiz Saeed Khan, in April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Hajar al Hashemi&lt;/em&gt;: ISSP’s emir. He may have served previously as an Iraqi army officer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Qadir Mumin&lt;/em&gt;: IS-Somalia’s emir. He defected from al Shabaab.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Zacharia&lt;/em&gt;: Leader of ISEA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salafi-jihadi-attacks-with-american-casualties-202122&quot;&gt;Salafi-Jihadi attacks with American Casualties (2021–22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups such as al Shabaab, AQAP, and ISIS have pursued external attack capabilities but have not conducted a terror attack in the US since the December 2019 shooting in Pensacola, Florida. The most recent attack against US forces was the ISKP suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021. US forces on counterterrorism missions are no longer engaged in combat operations, limiting the opportunities for Salafi-jihadi groups to target them. Salafi-jihadi groups have targeted Westerners in kidnapping-for-ransom plots. In late August 2022, US special operations forces rescued an American kidnapped in Burkina Faso in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katherine Zimmerman</name></author><summary type="html">Salafi-jihadi groups are increasingly embedded in local conflicts, even while remaining part of al Qaeda’s and the Islamic State’s global networks.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/H60615l.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/H60615l.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software-Defined Warfare</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-07-software-defined-warfare.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software-Defined Warfare" /><published>2022-09-07T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-07T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/software-defined-warfare</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-07-software-defined-warfare.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the future, warfighting will only become more complex, even more chaotic, and even faster. The only way to stay competitive in a new warfighting environment is to ensure that it uses the most potent weapon available: technology, and more specifically, software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 20, 2011, Marc Andreessen published “Why Software Is Eating the World.” In the decade since this seminal article was written — an eternity in the technology industry — an entire new generation of “digital native” companies has emerged that forced slower-moving incumbents out of business. Technology has been devouring the world, and it also eats its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is considered the best in the world. With a budget larger than the next 10 militaries combined, the Department of Defense (DOD) outspends, out-equips, and out-trains its competitors. It is also an industrial-age, hardware-centric organization that has the “biggest, the mostest, and the bestest” military capital investments: tanks, ships, aircraft, and everything in between. Unfortunately, in today’s world, hardware is “old-school” — low-margin, commodity products that are manufactured, stored, shipped, and consumed. After depreciation and excessive wear and tear, hardware is scrapped for parts or ends up in a boneyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military’s hardware systems are built to wrap multiple layers of metal and protection around fragile human beings who operate these machines under fire and extreme levels of stress, with the planning and orders coming from groups of people watching screens and integrating information through PowerPoint and Excel. The DOD accomplishes incredible things, but as remarkable as the Department is in many ways, it shares with almost all other federal agencies the common trait of lagging woefully behind the commercial software industry’s state of the art — in everything from automating back-office functions to providing digital warfighting services to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, an organization like the DOD would be a huge target for “disruption” by entrepreneurs and investors (a euphemism for “putting out of business”). Fortunately, it has a monopoly on the nation’s warfighting functions, which insulates it from the usual forms of market competition. Yet this very monopoly is also the root cause of many of the worst problems when it comes to the DOD’s failure to adopt new technologies, change its legacy workflows and processes, and design and experiment with new operating concepts. Within the U.S. government, the DOD does not experience the kind of brutal, capitalist, Darwinian journey by which incumbent organizations face off against hungry new start-ups and risk getting pushed to the side — where the start-up takes over as the “new DOD” with brand-new underlying tech. Equally problematic, the massive DOD bureaucracy struggles with the kind of periodic “tech refresh” that has been instrumental to commercial industry success. While it is insulated from market competition within the U.S. economy, the DOD is not immune from the kind of revolutionary, secular, and wide-ranging technological changes happening outside the government. Nor is it immune from the threat of competition with other militaries around the world. Either the DOD will change itself, or its competitors will force it to change — after it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States to retain its dominant position in the future — which is not a guaranteed outcome — the DOD needs a new design and architecture that will allow it to be far more flexible, scale on demand, and adapt dynamically to changing conditions. And it must do so at a dramatically lower cost as it delivers its critical services. Central to this will be changing the role of the human in the information and decision loop as well as at the endpoint: increasing speed, accuracy, scale, and techniques to confuse, disorient, and overwhelm the adversary while preventing them from doing the same to U.S. forces. The DOD’s systems will need to support dramatically faster decisionmaking and execution speeds; allow for rapidly updating and modifying systems; lower the cost structure of building and deploying these systems; and upend the marginal cost and speed of delivering new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that the DOD must dramatically change the way it builds warfighting systems is hardly novel. There have been hundreds of articles, think-tank papers, and books that have made a compelling case for radical change. One of the best recent examples is The Kill Chain by Chris Brose, who calls upon the DOD to build a “military Internet of Things” that involves “large networks of autonomous systems” and a different mix of weapons systems. Likewise, in crafting the concept of the Third Offset Strategy, former deputy secretary of defense Bob Work has argued for years about the need for major DOD-wide changes, especially the widespread adoption of autonomous systems and AI-enabled capabilities. Other ideas that percolate regularly in defense policy circles revolve around concepts such as networked warfare, mosaic warfare, and next-generation battle networks. Much of this work describes the problem but does not get to the level of proposing concrete technology solutions. In solving extremely hard technology problems, leading commercial technology companies typically start by outlining a set of key architectural standards upon which the entire system will be built. This paper outlines the architecture needed for next-generation warfighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to this architecture lies in software. Software is disrupting and reconstituting entire industries — especially those that rely on manual processes and fail to leverage the power of low or zero marginal costs. This is not about sprinkling “magic software dust” on a company or business model to make it work. Software needs to be at the core of every business and operating model before any business can hope to gain an enduring competitive advantage. The DOD is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-the-kill-chain-getting-inside-a-competitors-ooda-loop&quot;&gt;Closing the Kill Chain, Getting inside a Competitor’s OODA Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “kill chain,” a phrase that long predates Brose’s book, refers to a multistep process that involves absorbing information, turning that information into knowledge (actionable intelligence), making a decision, acting on the decision, understanding the consequences of that decision, and refining future actions accordingly. Similarly, John Boyd’s “OODA loop” concept refers to the process by which an individual, commander, or team progresses through the same stages: observe, orient, decide, and act. The final part of the process — acting or closing the kill chain — is generally associated with firing and destroying something, but in today’s world it could also include a non-kinetic effect such as delivering a cyberattack against a target or deploying a piece of misinformation designed to disrupt the adversary’s orientation phase of the OODA loop while protecting one’s own. In general, the side that can consistently demonstrate shorter, tighter, and more resilient OODA loops will gain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the kill chain and OODA loop are essentially workflows buttressed by human cognition. Today, these workflows are implemented as a confusing mess of manual, semi-manual (including telephone calls), and electronic processes. It is both exciting and shocking to visit a combatant command operations center. In peacetime, it is easy to see how these commands and their subordinate units can handle a relatively limited number of aircraft and ships moving around. What is hard to imagine is how extant manual processes will be capable of tracking hundreds, if not thousands, of moving objects in wartime, all tasked with delivering kinetic and non-kinetic effects from undersea through space, cyberspace, and everything else in between. Executing these workflows so every step of the process and the data flows are done in software, even though decisionmaking is still in the hands of human commanders and operators, can yield a decisive advantage over an adversary: every stage of the OODA loop is tighter, faster, and more well-informed. Conversely, not taking a digital-age, software-centric approach in the battlespaces of the future could very well mean tactical, operational, and even strategic defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can easily misconstrue such “software cheerleading” as implying the demise of hardware. That misses the point. Military hardware and weapons systems are still vitally important. However, they need to be tethered to the end of internet-scale software systems that handle all the complexity of decisionmaking, targeting, and resourcing — everything but the final step of executing a decision to close the kill chain. Software will fundamentally and irretrievably change the value of hardware by making the processes that lead to the desired effects faster, cheaper, more efficient, scalable, and more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-data-center-architecture&quot;&gt;Lessons from Data Center Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferring lessons and experience from other domains can help inform breakthrough solutions to big problems in the DOD and other federal government organizations. Years of building large-scale software systems have revealed best principles and practices on how to design computer software and systems for squeezing out the maximum performance at the lowest cost and, where appropriate, removing the most expensive, least scalable, and slowest parts of the process and cost structure: humans, followed by hardware. These same concepts can — and should — be applied to the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the computer industry, “software defined” is a broad architectural concept that drives a few different core design decisions. These design decisions turn a bunch of disconnected hardware products into an integrated whole that can be operated and managed as a single platform. It also takes control and complexity, which is typically distributed all over the place, and centralizes it where it can be simplified, managed, and scaled. In military terms, this is centralized direction and decentralized execution: the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the large-scale computing systems and platforms used in the technology industry are software defined. The largest cloud-computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, are all “software-defined computing platforms” relying on “software-defined networking” (SDN); their storage is now “software defined,” as are fifth-generation wireless (5G) telecom systems, with provisioning and routing all done via software. These large-scale platforms run on commodity hardware (in some cases, built in house) with large-scale orchestration software that pulls the complexity out of the lower levels of the platform to a central system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to ask whether today’s computer systems can handle the scale and size of a battlefield. The answer is a resounding “yes!” Internet-scale companies such as Apple, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Netflix, and others routinely connect billions of users and systems every day, exchanging content and video in real time. While these companies do not typically face the risk of actual kinetic effects destroying their data centers, they do deal with cybercriminals and nation-state–sponsored cyberattacks — and even squirrels or rats eating through cable wires. The best of these architectures are built to be resilient in the event of failure. If these companies can operate at this enormous scale, there is no reason whatsoever why the same key concepts cannot be applied to warfighting to weave together thousands of hardware objects into a single software-defined system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-architect-for-scaling&quot;&gt;Concept: Architect for Scaling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier computer systems and software were designed to allow a single application to run on a single computer system. When a computer system ran out of capacity, the solution was always to throw more resources at the problem: a faster processor, more disk space, a faster network card, and so on. This method is called “vertical scaling.” Once a server was running at capacity, you were done, as there are physical limits to the resources you can add to a system. Over time, this evolution led the industry to one of the biggest systems possible: the mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of this paper’s authors had his first job out of college at a hot, upstart company called Sun Microsystems that was revolutionizing network computing. Sun computers — called “pizza boxes” because they looked like one — were competing against the mighty mainframe. Instead of the “unit of scaling” for the mainframe, which was another mainframe, to scale up you simply added a single “pizza box” worth of additional computing and memory every time you needed some marginal resources for an application. This marginal-expense option is far more attractive than being forced to buy another giant, multi-million-dollar mainframe that might only be 10 percent utilized. This method of small, marginal additions is called “horizontal scaling” and was created to overcome the limits of vertical scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a single, large computer system running an application, horizontal scaling involves distributing an application’s computing workloads across multiple, smaller computer systems. Unfortunately, moving from a vertically to horizontally scaled architecture does not come free. The software itself needs to be re-architected to support this new underlying system topology. Issues such as database storage (which is hard to distribute across multiple systems), file systems, caches and data consistency, software queues, and load balancers come into play. As companies moved their legacy applications from their on-premises data centers to the cloud, they realized they had to re-factor or even rewrite their applications to take full advantage of what cloud computing could provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer systems in older data centers are called “pets” because each computer system would have a unique name, typically part of a broader naming scheme. Popular naming schemes were the planets in the solar system or cats (e.g., “Fluffy”). Just as if a pet got sick and had to be taken to the vet, if one of these computers had a problem, engineers would try their best to fix it. In contrast, today’s computers running at a major cloud vendor have a virtually meaningless string of characters as a name (e.g., “i-0123456789abcdef”) — unfortunately, just like anonymous cattle. Cloud-computing instances are created and destroyed all the time, with little sentimental value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this to the United States’ warfighting systems architecture is simple: The DOD needs a massive number of cheap, disposable, and easy-to-manufacture endpoint systems that it can concentrate, distribute, and scale up or down as the need arises. In many cases, these systems will require little or no maintenance. If one breaks, you just replace it with an identical clone, driving down overall complexity in logistics and maintenance. Parts of the DOD are already thinking about this concept (with smaller drones, for example), but the Department needs to start applying this architectural thinking to many more of the aspects of hardware, vehicles, and weapons systems that it builds or buys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-eliminate-single-points-of-failure&quot;&gt;Concept: Eliminate Single Points of Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current design points for the U.S. military are hardware centric, human centric, and big. Size matters. The mighty aircraft carrier exemplifies this paradigm. It costs billions of dollars to build, carries thousands of sailors, and hosts dozens of different kinds of fighter aircraft. It sits in the middle of a carrier strike group (CSG), with many ships and submarines tasked to protect it. The protection offered by the CSG makes it extremely hard to sink a U.S. aircraft carrier. However, taking out an aircraft carrier destroys the entire CSG architecture, making it nearly useless for the purpose for which it was designed: to project force around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aircraft carrier, given its size and footprint, is like a very large mainframe or a large database system. An aircraft carrier is vertically scaled, as the unit of scaling for the system is yet another aircraft carrier. Many of these vertically scaled systems are also single points of failure. Since these systems are very expensive, there are normally not any redundancies from running two systems at the same time. The crash of a mainframe or database system crashes the entire system, as there is no backup. Obviously, architectures that have such single points of failure are extremely brittle and eventually fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying and eliminating these single points of failure are critical to building a resilient architecture, both in commercial industry and in the DOD. The aircraft carrier and the concept of the CSG were created at a time before China developed carrier-killer missiles. At $10 million a missile, shooting a few of these and hitting a U.S. carrier worth upward of $10 billion would generate an eye-watering return on investment (ROI). Or, as some of the fighting in Ukraine seems to presage, you can get an even more impressive ROI by attacking a CSG with hundreds (if not thousands) of small, attritable, armed, autonomous swarming drones, all of which can be horizontally scaled on demand to attack the most vulnerable parts of the enemy’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-virtualization&quot;&gt;Concept: Virtualization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtualization technology has revolutionized data centers by transforming a computer server into a virtual machine that can be copied, cloned, snapshotted, and moved around. It has helped create the revolution in cloud computing and “software as a service” by allowing users to rent computers by the minute and operate them remotely at an incredibly competitive cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its generic form, virtualization is the act of creating an abstraction and translation layer between two distinct systems, such as hardware and software, or taking an older system and allowing it to be manipulated and managed as part of larger digital workflows. Initially, virtualization’s most popular trait was the ability to take older/legacy Windows operating systems (such as Windows 2000) and continue to run them on newer hardware, as well as the ability to consolidate the systems into a central data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of legacy military platforms, sensors, and workflows, virtualizing the system involves wrapping it in a set of callable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow it to participate in any electronic workflows without the interruption of a manual process. An API is a standardized software layer with a set of well-defined and well-documented software entry points that a programmer can call from their code to receive data and initiate processes. Once kill chains have been converted to end-to-end electronic workflows, the effect of a weapons system at the end of such a workflow can be implemented as an API call. Ideally, these APIs should be two-way: inbound ones that allow for the control and execution of the system and outbound ones that provide status, capacity, usage statistics, and the like that can be fed back into the orchestration system for planning, resupply, and resource management. Even if a system can only enable some APIs — for instance, outbound APIs that deliver status and supply-level information — that is still a substantial improvement, as its calculations can be networked into the broader orchestration systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During previous DOD Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) demonstrations, the military services demonstrated API-based access to weapons systems. This is a crucial first step. In effect, it means that those systems could be integrated as part of electronic kill chains and brought under the management of the overall software orchestration engine. This functionality, however, needs to be moved into production and to the field instead of just used once in demonstrations or experiments. The importance of changing the DOD’s mindset from relying on individual hardware systems and one-off software programs to using a system centered on the role of APIs cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second dimension of virtualization is to set up the endpoint hardware to run multiple software stacks simultaneously, all completely isolated from each other logically but sharing the underlying hardware platform. There are numerous cases where fixed, one-time hardware costs dominate. The ability to dynamically reprogram or switch to a completely different workload stack — for example, based on the time of day — can drive up the utilization of the hardware. Small examples are cell phones, with a user potentially wanting to use multiple phone numbers (tied to SIM cards) on a single device. A more complex and expensive example is a satellite, for which the initial costs of building and launching the system are often extremely high, while the variable costs of operating it are fairly predictable. Squeezing out maximum utility from such an expensive system can make the difference between a profitable investment and one that is losing money. In addition, thinking about a constellation of satellites as a “computing grid” able to deploy multiple/dynamic workloads can fundamentally transform the traditional paradigm of satellites as having a fixed function. Instead, they can be used in the same way as any flexible cloud-computing system, giving actual “computing in the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-low-cost-commodity-hardware-and-stateless-endpoints&quot;&gt;Concept: Low-Cost Commodity Hardware and Stateless Endpoints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original Top Gun movie, it is hard to miss “MAVERICK” stenciled on Pete Mitchell’s plane — which is very cool until you start wondering what happens if it breaks down. One can just imagine this line from Ed Harris (playing the admiral in the latest film): “Maverick, I’ve got some bad news. Your airplane is going to be down for maintenance. The good news is that you can take Iceman’s jet if he agrees to give it up!” That might be great for Maverick, but he would have to face off against Iceman, who would rather die than give up the chance to fly his own jet. On top of that, Iceman won’t appreciate Maverick messing with his seat settings, air freshener, and radio presets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea that Maverick can only fly the plane with his name on it gets us back to the concept of “pets vs. cattle” systems — that a single piece of hardware has to be bound to a single pilot, and we cannot dynamically switch the pilot over to another piece of hardware through a “just-in-time” software deployment. Core to the architectural shift from vertical to horizontal scaling is making the actual endpoint systems both stateless and disposable, which introduces the possibility of just-in-time software deployment and configuration. The advantages of this approach include the ability to move to dramatically lower-cost hardware over time (i.e., ride the commoditization curve); scale up and down as needed; rapidly provision new systems; bypass bottlenecks in emergencies (if something breaks, just provision to a new system and fix things later); and introduce new security advantages, since the endpoint systems always have the latest software and do not retain state. Data, which should be clearly compartmentalized away from system and application software, lives in the cloud and synchronizes to the endpoint as needed for local processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these obvious benefits, the DOD should start thinking about how to integrate newer technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) into existing systems and how to design new systems differently from the ground up. Currently, the DOD thinks of deploying a “global” hardware platform — for example, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) — across multiple areas of responsibility (AORs). In a pre-AI age, this did not present any major problems. As the DOD integrates more AI-based software in these systems, however, the data the algorithms are trained on for each AOR can vary widely. For example, the data from Eastern Europe, which has snowy or muddy fields, and the South China Sea, which has open water and scattered islands, can be very different. AI software performs optimally when it is retrained from new data collected in an operational setting. In the digital age, fielded AI models must be updated regularly. Beyond Project Maven and the DOD Joint AI Center, there are few operational examples in the DOD of AI software fielded via continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) even though the approach was routinized in commercial industry a long time ago. The idea that fielded AI software is never finished and requires continuous updates is not a niche idea. At some point, almost every piece of software will be AI-enabled and, if embedded into hardware systems, will need to be designed for continuous and even over-the-air remote updates. As the DOD operationalizes this at scale, it will have to become much smarter about deploying just-in-time software on local systems custom-tailored to the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, once a crisis or conflict begins, bugs and problems in fielded systems will require fast fixes. This is no different than how commercial products move rapidly from “minimum viable product” to demonstrated high-performance production products. The ability to turn around a patch or “dot release” of software and deploy them to fielded hardware systems will become a key differentiator in future conflicts. Just as Apple runs operating systems such as macOS®, iOS® (for iPhones), and iPadOS®, the DOD should envision a day where it has a TankOS®, FighterOS®, and ShipOS® — each running individual hardware systems. Each armed service should be able to deliver over-the-air patches and new apps to each OS for improving functionality and fixing bugs. There is no question that in the first phase of any war, the United States’ adversaries will be launching a number of “zero-day” cyberattacks against its weapons systems vulnerabilities. The country’s ability to get back into the fight will be dependent on the DOD’s ability to spin patches for these vulnerabilities, clean up its endpoints, and do rapid updates of its systems before booting them up again. If the DOD adopted a stateless, just-in-time software deployment model, the time needed to close this loop will be dramatically shorter than having to clean up malware off of a stateful software/hardware system and ensure that it is malware free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-design-for-instrumentation&quot;&gt;Concept: Design for Instrumentation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since anyone can track the delivery of a hamburger or pizza on their phone in real time, it is unfathomable that the DOD’s combatant commanders cannot gain real-time visibility into the endpoint systems that are under their management. Today, almost every product used is heavily instrumented to measure a variety of data: real-time control of the endpoint system, status of the endpoint, and (on the development side) understanding what features end users are utilizing. There are hundreds of great products to choose from to both instrument and track this usage, and the DOD’s endpoint hardware systems need to be designed and built with instrumentation integrated into them from the outset. (A critique of user interfaces/user experiences in the DOD is outside the scope of this paper. Unfortunately, UI/UX best practices remain a foreign concept to most DOD hardware and software system developers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important design element is to include sensors for every part of the system that could be relevant for remote control and orchestration, as well as any other components that are crucial to the operation of the overall system. The sensors should provide the ability to read such information as on/off status, unit values, and the like. The simplest and most telling example is that many of the resources and munitions on all airplanes and tanks are still not tracked automatically — with few exceptions and rarely in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a particular component includes one or more sensors, the next question is whether those sensors should be paired with the ability to automate the component. Obviously, any component with a read-only sensor cannot be automated, but it should be possible to automate the others. This includes test and evaluation (T&amp;amp;E) sensors capable of reporting to users when a fielded system is not performing as expected. This is especially important for systems that integrate so-called “black-box” AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The close friend of instrumentation is real-time connectivity and reporting. If real-time connectivity is not possible, then the next best option is an ability to synchronize prioritized data when the system regains a connection. Currently, the DOD’s version of an iPhone sync is pulling out a hard drive from a helicopter, plane, or drone, then shipping it cross-country to a secure data center where it can be downloaded and processed. The military cannot continue to operate this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-simulation-testing-verification&quot;&gt;Concept: Simulation, Testing, Verification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning, exercises, and wargaming have always been an integral part of warfighting preparation. Scenes of military leaders and policymakers standing around tables with large maps that include board pieces representing personnel, tanks, aircraft, and ships — from the United States and its allies and partners, as well as the adversary — are sufficiently familiar. Each side makes a move, the outcomes of which are then assessed by impartial observers before the next round of moves. Military wargames like this take place regularly but not nearly frequently enough to account for the rapid pace of change unfolding in today’s digital environment. All militaries have plans for different kinds of scenarios and contingencies, but few of these plans are tested in advance. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, simulation systems vary widely depending on what someone is trying to simulate. The major factors that affect a simulation are its size and scale (typically the number of objects being handled), the fidelity of each object (what level of detail do you simulate), and the resources you are willing to throw at an object. For instance, a first-person shooter game can act as a simulation for a relatively small number of soldiers in very high fidelity. The gun’s operating can be replicated extremely accurately, along with a highly realistic small-scale simulation environment. On the other hand, complexity increases exponentially when attempting to run a simulation across the entire Indo-Pacific theater, with thousands of weapon systems and objects all interacting dynamically. Such a simulation would be incredibly complex, expensive, and probably unfeasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the actual setup of the simulation itself. In almost every case, actual operational systems are not used for simulation — meaning real-world operational data is rarely ported over to the simulation systems. Even when this happens, the data transfer is complex, hindered by data size and protection of classified information. This creates very high barriers to entry that are extremely hard to bridge. One such example is how the military services have been working for the past decade on ways to integrate live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) weapon systems. The Air Force’s Virtual Flag program, for example, was designed from the beginning as a LVC joint and combined exercise. Despite considerable progress over the past few years, Virtual Flag still suffers from the combined challenges of scale, integration of multi-level classified systems, and fidelity. One promising option is to find ways to easily export or pull information from operational systems into simulation systems that have been designed to handle low-fidelity/high object-count or high-fidelity/low object-count simulations — essentially a dial that someone can use to manage the trade-off between these choices. Once built, it would make sense not only to be able to run testing and verification on top of these systems, but also to include concepts such as “Chaos Monkey” (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational and contingency plans (to include branches and sequels) can also be described and explored as part of the system. There are numerous extremely lucrative technologies such as generative adversarial networks and digital twinning that can be built and run on these platforms. This approach would allow the DOD to use AI-enabled technologies and other capabilities to test different adversarial strategies and techniques, as well as explore ways to counter them (some of the most promising work in this area includes game-theoretic competitions). The problem is that these can only be developed if the DOD has the right platforms, designed with the right APIs, upon which to build. So far, this remains much more of a pipe dream than reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-design-for-failure-and-let-the-chaos-monkey-loose&quot;&gt;Concept: Design for Failure and Let the Chaos Monkey Loose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix built an open-source product called “Chaos Monkey” it used for testing complex and highly available software systems. Like a crazy monkey having a good time, it would randomly kill parts of a software system to see if they would recover and continue running. This has now been expanded to include the “Simian Army” family of tools that expand the testing concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running Chaos Monkey on your software is the equivalent of the “power-cord test” in a physical data center — essentially, randomly pulling a power cord of a running computer system or router to see if all the high-availability features of the site remain operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should consider Chaos Monkey in two forms: first as a traditional testing product that the Department can use to test its backbone with warfighting software systems and, second, to test warfighting plans in a simulation environment to see how they actually unfold in situations characterized by random and uncontrollable changes (the inevitable friction that happens in the real world). Both approaches would allow the DOD to begin to design more for resiliency and anti-fragility than for optimizing performance under the kind of perfect conditions that simply never exist. This is, of course, only possible if the DOD can build software simulation systems that accurately represent its fielded systems under the full spectrum of realistic operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-build-autonomy-and-automation-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;Concept: Build Autonomy and Automation at the Edge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When any system is software defined, it is typically the case that the control path and data path are pulled apart. Control becomes centralized, leaving the actual endpoint system to execute its mission with complex control logic, driving up cost and complexity. It is obviously not realistic or optimal for every small control decision to be made centrally. The latency between the endpoint and central control logic would be too high, and if the communication link were severed, the endpoint could not continue to function. This is also a case where the types of endpoints found in a military context (such as an aircraft, vehicle, or ship) are much larger and more complex than a typical computer network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument against this architecture is that if both the larger and smaller systems require manual management, then simple math shows that the DOD will require many more people to scale because it has more systems. As a matter of fact, the limiting factor in drone flights today are the crews to pilot the craft, not the actual hardware. For instance, each MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) system requires a pilot and sensor operator, along with a fairly large behind-the-scenes team of maintenance personnel and intelligence analysts (up to about 100 people total). As a business model, this does not scale well at all, as even with a relatively inexpensive piece of hardware, the human cost of operating the system remains quite high. Adding UAVs to the current architecture — wherein one pilot flies a single RPA — does not yield much of a cost or operating advantage (that is, there are relatively limited economies of scale). If anything, the DOD ends up with negative economies of scale: as the Department flies more systems, the harder and more expensive operating each aircraft gets. Unless they have an infinite supply of money, commercial companies with negative economies of scale quickly go out of business. The way around this is to figure out how to remove the expensive overhead of human involvement through more automation and autonomy, up to and including AI-enabled systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granting autonomy to these endpoint systems seems to run counter to the entire discussion of centralizing control through orchestration. The right way to think about it is to consider the scope of orchestration any particular system needs to have. An individual drone, for instance, should be responsible for the autonomy functions that are relevant to it, including taking off, landing, flying, and some route planning. If it is programmed to perform a certain function — perhaps identifying and tracking certain objects — then it should also be able to perform those functions without extensive human intervention or a central control system managing even the smallest tasks. But a single drone should not be responsible for orchestrating the functions of hundreds of other drones, nor should it be responsible for coordinating between a swarm of drones and armored vehicles on the ground. Those orchestration functions should be done by levels of software above, with a singular endpoint playing the right role and function within the broader context of all the systems being orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-integrate-development-environments-with-production&quot;&gt;Concept: Integrate Development Environments with Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the DOD’s core code-development environments are not tightly integrated with the deployment of this code at the endpoints. The Department has an entire spectrum of development environments that are all trying to address similar issues, but there are no simple pathways from code development — which is done in these specific enclaves — to production environments. It will be even more challenging to deploy code to an actual endpoint (a piece of hardware such as a drone, ship, vehicle, or manned aircraft). While these types of deployments are not trivial, given that they require substantial pre-deployment testing and evaluation, accelerating this development–production–fielding–sustainment cycle will be critical to future success and gaining a competitive battlespace advantage. This underscores an earlier critical point: whereas the DOD could once claim the mantle of being bigger than anyone in the world and, as such, could rationalize refusing to adhere to commercial best practices, today the world’s biggest tech companies deal with eye-watering speeds and scale well beyond anything the DOD regularly sees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containerization, which allows for the right packaging of code that can be “sealed” and deployed to the endpoints in a predictable manner, plays an important enabler role. This will require endpoint system developers to enable newer systems to handle containers and to build these systems to be receptive targets of development, security, and operations processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more important when a capability such as AI is integrated into these systems. Unlike traditional software, AI software is never done. The more operationally relevant data that is gathered and the more that an AI-based system performs in the operational environment, the more retraining and updating is needed. This loop of gathering data, retraining, and redeploying code is an important one to master and can only be enabled if these development environments are built the right way, with consideration of the end production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting It All Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying these core principles across the DOD can seem impossible. Large technology transformations at legacy, industrial-era organizations present seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Indeed, most of the successful examples of organizations that adopted the aforementioned software best practices have involved digital-native companies that did not have to deal with legacy systems. And these companies almost never faced the byzantine DOD, in which there are thousands of hardware and software systems built by hundreds of different vendors, few of whom had to adhere to any core architectural standards that would be considered commercial software best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report provides a blueprint for the way forward. The DOD should adopt these core concepts as it designs, develops, fields, and sustains all its weapon systems and supporting hardware. Think of a software “core” with an outer hardware “shell” — in essence, running the logic, planning, and optimization in the software plane, with the hardware tethered to the end of a long chain of software. In this idealized architecture, end-to-end software architecture connects all the relevant sensors (inputs) and outputs (weapons systems). It would also make it easier to model all the right workflows (kill chains), along with predictive intelligence systems, logistics, targeting, and fires, all of which would be integrated into a single architecture built on a few large-scale core platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of all these large networks of systems — whether autonomous or manually controlled — will be complex, internet-scale, highly available software that pulls everything together. The underlying software systems will help bind all the DOD’s people, weapons, logistics, and intelligence — and, equally important, pull together the Department’s development and production environments to allow for more rapid code development, deployment, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two critical steps required to pull off this kind of transformation. First, the larger problem needs to be broken down into smaller and smaller parts that are independent, allowing the creation of structured interfaces and APIs around them. This is especially important since each armed service runs its own infrastructure and applications, which will probably be the first to be cut, followed by segments underneath them. Second, the DOD should build the core scaffolding around which the other parts of the system can be “glued on” over time. Such a “loosely coupled, highly aligned” architecture could be expanded over time by bringing over and integrating more parts into the system instead of trying to upgrade or rewrite every part of the problem at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4i8REz7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Aspirational Core System Architecture for Software-Defined Warfare.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Designed by Nand Mulchandani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emphasized earlier, the most important part of this process will be to define an overall architecture with the right interfaces and abstractions. In addition, the DOD should use well-established and proven industry-standard and open-source best practices to build these types of interfaces (APIs, REST), data-exchange formats (JSON, XML), storage and representation methods (time-series databases, event/pipeline management systems), application packaging (containers), and the runtime architecture (microservices). At the same time, this approach should disconnect the data platform from the application logic, as well as the user interface and presentation services from the backend data and application logic (through APIs and other interfaces). This will allow each layer of the system to evolve independently without having to build a highly interconnected but fragile stack wherein even small changes will ripple through the architecture to every part of the system, making code updates extremely hard and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the DOD’s software architecture should be various software platforms to be built and operated across the department. These platforms provide a necessary divide between the data/core-logic layers and the applications. Separating the two provides an environment in which building a new application is dramatically simplified since all the heavy lifting of aggregating, cleaning, and integrating data is already done at the platform level. Additionally, the DOD should insist that any vendor implementing a platform and APIs build these as open interfaces that are well documented, version controlled, rent free, and availably freely to any vendor who wants to build upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the application writer need only be concerned about their own application logic, as they can freely rely upon any of these backend platform services for data and some common logic. Since they will not have to re-import, clean, and rebuild the entire data environment from scratch and recode common business logic, they will be able to rapidly build new functionality at a dramatically lower cost. Multiple vendors can also build competing products on the platform, driving down costs and increasing the quality of the applications for the DOD customer. Finally, when the Department owns the interfaces (the APIs, not the actual applications themselves), vendor lock-in will be lessened: no vendor will be able to hold the customer (DOD) hostage since all the data is captive in a system, with no way of exporting or accessing it. This is known as the “Roach Motel” problem, in honor of an aggressive late-night infomercial focused on cockroach removal that boasted, “Roaches check in, but they don’t check out!” The problem in this case is that data does not check out. In addition to enabling external vendors to build new applications, this architecture would also make it dramatically easier for internal DOD coders and data scientists to build smaller applications rapidly or enable new analytics on top of existing data. The same barrier of cleaning, importing, and normalizing data that exists for a smaller vendor is even larger for an individual internal developer. Immediately opening this up to the broader internal developer community will likely spur a dramatic increase in the kind of “micro applications” that are simply not developed today due to high costs and high barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warfighting has always been viewed as some esoteric combination of art and science that is incredibly complex to manage. The size, scale, and speed with which events take place and change continuously, even chaotically, can make it seem nearly impossible to master either the art or the science. In the future, warfighting will only become more complex, even more chaotic, and even faster. The art side of the art-science equation remains as important as ever. However, with the proliferation of new technologies and a shift to a data-centric world, the science part of the equation is becoming increasingly consequential. In future crises and conflicts, the side that adapts faster and demonstrates the greatest agility — to include rapidly updating and promulgating fielded software and AI models — is likely to gain a significant competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way for the DOD to stay competitive in this new warfighting environment is to ensure that it uses the most potent weapon available: technology, and more specifically, software. The commercial computer industry used to manage data centers the way the DOD has always conducted warfighting but realized that it did not scale. The industry came up with new tools and technologies to virtualize, automate, monitor, and scale data centers, which in turn have allowed the industry to offer services at a fraction of the cost with almost no downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges the DOD and other U.S. federal agencies face is that they were built from the ground up as industrial-age, hardware-centric organizations. Making the transition to digital-age, software-centric, more risk-tolerant organizations is exceedingly difficult. But it is also the only path to future success. The template exists; implementation is now the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of these concepts from the software industry may not have perfect analogues to military hardware and warfighting, it is important to understand the core concepts outlined in this paper and the effects they have on architecting large-scale, complex systems. The key is to begin thinking of military objects and hardware as part of a larger system that is woven together using software. This will not only prevent the most expensive and scarce resources from being subject to mind-numbing legacy workflow processes but will also dramatically accelerate information and decision cycles. At the same time, by automating most of the routine, mundane functions that currently absorb far too much of everyone’s time, implementing these software best practices will allow military leaders to spend more time focusing on the critical decisions they need to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-defined warfare is the way of the future. Of course, this should never mean that humans are redundant or uninvolved. To the contrary, the approach described in this report opens up incredible new opportunities for human-machine teamwork, in which the roles of humans and machines are optimized based upon what each does best. Business objectives, goals, and the overall architecture of the systems are still all set by humans. The actual operations are handled by software, based on parameters established by humans. Any exceptional conditions or issues are still escalated to humans. The best way to characterize this change is to “take the robot out of the human” by electronically connecting end-to-end processes, leaving the human with the time to concentrate on making the most important and consequential decisions. In a fully AI-enabled future, UI/UX will advance to the point where users will train smart machines so systems can adapt to an individual’s performance, the pace of their cognitive development, and even their past behaviors. Given the state of its hardware and software, there is no possible way the DOD can do this today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish the best for our country and, in our time at the Department of Defense, have tried our best to institute and implement best practices to orient the United States in this new direction. We hope this work continues and these ideas continue to make their way into the thinking and design of our next-generation warfighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

But how are sanctions seen from within the country?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been swift, coordinated and widespread. Russian banks have been decoupled from international payment systems and capital markets; the Russian Central Bank’s international reserves have been frozen; hundreds of Russian companies and individuals have been targeted; and there has been a ban on certain strategic exports and imports. Furthermore, over a thousand companies with operations across Russia have “self-sanctioned”, closing or selling their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western narrative on the impact of sanctions is one of significant economic contraction. The IMF projects a decline in Russia’s real GDP of 6% in 2022 and leading Yale academics have concluded that the “Russian economy is reeling”, while certain politicians have called for Russia’s economy to be pushed “back into the Soviet era”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the Russian perspective and narrative in response to these sanctions, how is their impact viewed from Moscow and across Russia’s 11 time zones, and what implications does this have for future Western policymaking as the fighting in Ukraine continues unabated? There are signs that Russian opinion is split between those who support the Kremlin and those who question its assessments. The Kremlin’s rhetoric is stoic and its message is confident, articulating economic resilience and a clear way forward in response to sanctions. In contrast, public non-conformist views, which are difficult to source because of censorship, present a more bearish perspective of the long-term consequences of sanctions, especially as they move beyond targeting Putin’s supporters to impacting the real economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-remains-strong-and-is-only-defending-itself-against-the-west&quot;&gt;Russia Remains Strong, and is Only Defending Itself Against the West&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to sanctions, the narrative from the Kremlin focuses on two main messages. The first is that the Russian economy is resilient and well-prepared for Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has been thorough in relaying a composed message of strength to the Russian public through all forms of state-controlled media, expressing continued confidence in the country and its economy in the face of sanctions, and emphasising the government’s “responsible macroeconomic policy over the past few years”. The policy of redirecting resources to serve domestic markets after international companies pulled out of the country; the lending programme to fund “much-needed initiatives and projects worth around half a trillion roubles”; and the provision of increased liquidity to the economy are but a few examples of the steps the Kremlin and the Russian Central Bank have taken to mitigate the short-term impact of sanctions. Russian companies have also sought to put risk mitigation measures in place by seeking alternate markets to replace exports to the EU, and Russia is portrayed as effortlessly making new connections with other countries sympathetic to its cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexei Miller, Chairman of the Board of Gazprom, has spoken of Russia’s ability to replace the exports to European markets it has lost through the strengthening of pro-Russian alliances with countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. Miller has highlighted global inflation and price volatility as evidence of Western mistakes and believes this will only worsen over time. Miller has also commented that the sanctioning of Gazprom has given the Russian oil industry the opportunity to create “new fuel and energy unions” with other countries including India and China. Miller has asserted that Russia ultimately has “energy security” and the ability now to “determine the course of future alliances”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Support from the religious establishment in Russia provides Putin with a halo of spiritual blessing and a deep-rooted religious anchor to justify the conflict in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Kremlin focuses on the belligerence and provocation of Western countries in imposing sanctions and their desire to halt the Russian economy at all costs, with Putin describing the sanctions against Russia as “akin to an act of war”. The West is portrayed as the aggressor with Russia only defending itself, as underlined by Putin in a televised address in which he stated that Western politicians have consistently created “fundamental threats” to Russia. As a result, he believes he had no choice but to begin the “special military operation” and take “bold and immediate action” in Ukraine. Putin has called Western leaders “short-sighted Russophobes” who are prepared to cause damage to Russia and other countries to “preserve their own global dominance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message is echoed by State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who believes the “range of means aimed at withholding [Russia’s] development [to have been] exhausted.” The depiction of the West as the aggressor is prevalent, as further exemplified by government officials such as Dmitri Peskov, diplomat and Putin’s press secretary, who, in regard to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control’s measures to prevent payments on Russia’s sovereign bonds, commented that “a default can be orchestrated, but this is a purely artificial situation created by the US Treasury and not due to any economic difficulty in Russia”. In other words, the West is choosing to wage economic war on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative of sanctions as a tool of aggression and Western belligerence threatening Russia’s security is being widely amplified by Russian radio and TV networks. The popular channel RT News consistently refers in its broadcasts to NATO doing “everything to provoke Russia”, and women have even posted videos on social media in which they cut up their designer handbags as a sign of resentment against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;patriarchs-support-for-gods-truth&quot;&gt;Patriarch’s Support for God’s Truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patriarch Kirill and the senior echelons of the Russian Orthodox Church have also shown support for Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. This support from the religious establishment in Russia provides Putin with a halo of spiritual blessing and a deep-rooted religious anchor to justify the conflict in Ukraine. In March 2022, Patriarch Kirill claimed to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation that Russians and Ukrainians come from “a single Kyiv baptismal font” which is united “by a common historical destiny”. Kirill also spoke of the “external hostile political forces” that have been used “to escalate Russian-Ukrainian hostility”, echoing the narrative of Putin’s preparatory essay from July 2021, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Western provocation has also been reflected by senior members of the Russian Orthodox Church in their rejection of the sanctions placed on the Patriarch for his support of the war. Vladimir Legoyda, acting head of the press service for the Russian Orthodox Church, has stated that the UK sanctions against Patriarch Kirill are “against common sense” and “absurd and futile”, accusing the UK of unsuccessfully attempting “to intimidate the Primate of the Russian Church” and of burning even the “last bridge” in communication between the two countries. Similarly, the Patriarchal Exarch of Africa, Metropolitan Leonid of Klin, has said the Canadian sanctions are an example of the West creating havoc wherever it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Kremlin’s assertion that the Russian economy is resilient, the measures taken by the Central Bank to mitigate the effect of sanctions suggest otherwise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this vocal support for the Kremlin and condemnation of Western sanctions, there is anecdotal evidence that the Russian Orthodox Church is not united in its support of Putin (the church in Ukraine has already broken ranks publicly). Kirill’s position is seen by some in the Church in Russia as contrary to the Christian view that “the life of every human is valuable”. In March 2022, 233 Russian Orthodox clerics signed an “Appeal of the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church” that called for reconciliation, a ceasefire and an end to war, showing that they do not condone Kirill’s blessing of the conflict. In another example, after speaking out for peace, John Burdin, a priest in the Kostroma village of Karabanovo, was reported by his parishioners for not supporting the war and later questioned in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-west-is-only-hurting-itself&quot;&gt;The West is Only Hurting Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate narrative being promoted by the Kremlin both domestically and internationally is that the West is causing more economic damage to itself than to Russia, as Europe will not easily be able to source replacements for imports of energy from Russia. Volodin believes that “new packages of sanctions will not do Europe any good” and are “illegal”, and has sought to blame Presidents Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky for actions that will lead to famine. This attribution of blame and depiction of Europe as suffering more than Russia is further amplified by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has introduced the idea of the “new poor” in Europe, where “living standards are deteriorating” as a result of the West’s own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin himself states that the “global crisis [of food and energy] is largely caused by these sanctions” and paints the EU as disunited, in contrast to Russia which is depicted as a strong and clear-minded nation – a narrative underlined during Lavrov’s tour of Africa, which cultivated unity in the face of suffering at the hands of Western sanctions. Emphasising the West’s dependence on Russian energy, Putin maintains that sanctions come at the “expense of [Europe’s] own national interest”, a view corroborated by figures such as opposition politician and economist Vladimir Milov, who talks of Putin’s ability to “finance his economy and the ongoing military aggression” as long as there is not a complete embargo on Russia’s oil resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-collapse-but-decay&quot;&gt;Not Collapse but Decay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Kremlin’s assertion that the Russian economy is resilient, the measures taken by the Central Bank to mitigate the effect of sanctions suggest otherwise. For example, capital controls, subsidised lending programmes for small businesses, and expected legal action by the Central Bank against the freezing of its offshore international reserves reveal an economy under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conformists and non-conformists in Russia agree that a major economic meltdown is unlikely. However, non-conformists seem more fearful of the long-term economic impact of sanctions, as industries with a reliance on Western products suffer and the rate of Western production cannot be replicated domestically. Valery Kizilov from The Insider Journal acknowledges the very significant effect sanctions will have on the financial sector, which will in turn directly affect other sectors such as housing and construction; the motor industry, which is reliant on key Western components; and the scientific sector, where international deals on equipment and collaboration – once prevalent – have now been suspended. All of this points to a more gradual deterioration and a future where economic hardship will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This more fearful reaction to sanctions is echoed by economists such as Ruben Enikolopov, director of the Russian Economic School, who believes that Russia’s isolation is now “worse than in the Soviet Union”, maintaining that while there will not be a market collapse as in 1991, there will be a scarcity of international products. Sergei Hestanov, a well-known Russian economist, believes that the sanctions are just the “tip of the iceberg”, alluding to suffering to come under the new restrictions. Oil expert Michael Krytikin agrees with Milov that Russia is only relatively secure as long as the West is reliant on its oil and gas products, but that once the West imposes a full oil embargo, the Russian economy will suffer a substantial hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of the economy to sustain itself through its reliance on oil and natural gas revenues is also a very real fear among ordinary citizens. In interviews on the popular Russian YouTube channel 1420, ordinary Russians express their concern that once the West no longer needs to purchase its natural resources, Russia will have little else to offer. This fear of eventual “not collapse, but decay” of the Russian economy, and the resulting impact on the quality of Russian life caused by a rise in economic challenges, is the core non-conformist view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s ability to control the narrative through state-controlled media, the criminalisation of anti-war protests, and the continued flow of energy revenues have allowed Putin to deflect the impact of sanctions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonid Volkov, top aide to imprisoned Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, believes that by starting the war Putin has “shortened his time in power”. Navalny himself additionally claims that the war was started to distract from financial problems within the country that will lead to “destroyed lives and continued impoverishment of Russian people”. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that while the Kremlin points to resilience against sanctions in Russia today and economic challenges in the West, the future of the Russian economy will be determined by the extent to which these fears materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-more-promising-future-elsewhere&quot;&gt;A More Promising Future Elsewhere?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the impact of propaganda, censorship and new legislative measures to criminalise anti-war protests makes it challenging to research the impact of sanctions on ordinary Russians and their resulting perceptions, other factors such as the “brain drain” that hit Russia after the first wave of sanctions point to growing concerns for the future. Current Time TV estimates that 15,000 millionaires will leave Russia this year, and Yulia Florinskaya, researcher at RANEPA, reports the exit of about 150,000 people, many of them educated young professionals working in the hi-tech, medical and business sectors. Despite the economy not crashing, many have not returned, which Florinskaya refers to as “forced migration”, demonstrating the continued fear that sanctions will affect people’s quality of life and opportunities and Russia’s economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of sanctions on Russia was framed by many in the West as a “shock and awe” campaign. It was hoped that the threat of massive economic consequences by Western leaders would change Putin’s calculus. The reality was always going to be different. Sanctions are a long-term tool that seek to build pressure over time. Unsurprisingly, Western-imposed sanctions are not triggering the extent of public opposition in Russia to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine that Western leaders sought, because – for now – the country’s economy remains superficially resilient, foreign currency revenues from the sale of oil and gas continue to fill the Kremlin’s coffers, and censorship silences dissent. But fears of the longer-term economic impact on the country are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s narrative will continue to highlight Russia’s economic resilience in contrast to the West and seek to frame sanctions as a tool of Western belligerence, thereby reinforcing his claim that Russia’s security is constantly threatened and that the invasion of Ukraine was in self-defence. But as evidence of economic stagnation emerges, this version of the truth could become increasingly difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Putin’s “special military operation” extends beyond six months, the ability of the Kremlin to control the narrative through state-controlled media, the criminalisation of anti-war protests, and the continued flow of energy revenues have allowed Putin to deflect the impact of sanctions. The West should ensure that it monitors and reports on the true effect of sanctions on the Russian economy, that it blunts the Kremlin narrative which seeks to portray sanctions as more harmful to the West than Russia, and that it maintains economic pressure on the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That economic hardship lies ahead in the West as a result of its support of Ukraine is certain, particularly until alternative sources of energy can be found; but Ukraine’s allies must stay the course, given the fundamental threat Russia’s war in Ukraine poses to Western security and democracy, until the economic reality in Russia undermines the Kremlin’s post-truth narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 August, Ukrainian forces significantly stepped up the intensity of their attacks on Russian positions around the city of Kherson. After months of discussion about a Ukrainian counteroffensive, this has precipitated a deluge of speculation about Ukrainian objectives and intentions. It would be inappropriate to discuss the specifics of Ukrainian planning, but it is important to establish reasonable expectations so that observers can accurately assess success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is contending with three conflicting imperatives. Firstly, there is a political demand to demonstrate to Ukraine’s international partners that the donation of equipment leads to progress on the battlefield ahead of a challenging winter in which many states will be seeking to curtail expenditure. Secondly, there is the need to continually disrupt Russian forces occupying Ukraine so that they can neither regain the initiative nor consolidate their control of the country. Thirdly, there is the ultimate aim of driving the Russians from Ukrainian soil through a deliberate offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these objectives requires the immediate expenditure of a high volume of resources to bring about quick results. The second depends upon the prolonged expenditure of resources at moderate intensity. The third necessitates the husbanding of personnel and materiel until a critical mass of units are available. Major offensive operations require a large pool of reserves because even if a small force is able to breach the lines of an adversary, exploiting that breach to occupy large areas of territory calls for fresh troops to be surged forwards following the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kherson-front&quot;&gt;The Kherson Front&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kherson Oblast offers an opportunity to reconcile the conflicting imperatives outlined above. As the city is predominantly on the western bank of the Dnipro, Russian forces there can be pushed up against the river, and as they become more concentrated they will also be more vulnerable to attrition from artillery. The river, meanwhile, prevents the Russians from counterattacking in the Ukrainian’s flank, and interdiction of supplies moving across Kherson’s bridges can prevent the city’s defenders from being effectively circulated or reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russia’s forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Ukrainians can expend a limited amount of their combat power to pen the Russians into the city, they can reverse the challenges they faced in Severodonetsk and create a killing area for a large portion of Russia’s best assault troops – primarily airborne forces – who will be fixed defending a politically critical position even as it becomes militarily untenable. In this scenario, the Russian leadership must either contend with the progressive degradation of their assault troops at a time when they are desperately short of motivated infantry, or make a ‘goodwill gesture’ and withdraw – in the process suffering a heavy symbolic defeat, as Kherson is one of only two cities that were occupied largely intact during Russia’s war against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, unless the Ukrainians want to expend scarce reserves needed for wider offensive operations, or unless Russian units collapse owing to abysmal morale – which is possible but not something that can be assumed in planning – a deliberate storming of Kherson city would likely be a mistake. Furthermore, seizing Kherson – while politically significant – would not enable rapid exploitation operations to occupy territory on the east bank of the Dnipro, because the Ukrainians would suffer from the same challenges with supplies over a small number of damaged bridges as the Russians, and would therefore risk outrunning their artillery support. Success, therefore, looks like a methodical driving in of Russian positions followed by the affliction of heavy attrition on the Russians. Moreover, the Kherson offensive should be seen as limited in its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reclaiming-the-east&quot;&gt;Reclaiming the East&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of a broader offensive to liberate occupied oblasts east of the Dnipro is a separate question to operations against Kherson. Any assessment of the amount of ground involved must lead to the conclusion that the Ukrainian armed forces need time to build up sufficient manoeuvre units. Combined with the hiatus in manoeuvre to be imposed by winter, these operations are most likely to take place through 2023. This, of course, also gives the Russians time to mobilise and train new units. These could either pre-empt a Ukrainian offensive or be used for a Russian counteroffensive to dislocate Ukraine’s attempt to liberate its territory. For this reason, it is important that Ukraine forces Russia to commit new units through the winter to hold its current positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may therefore understand Ukrainian offensive operations to be implemented in three broad phases: the Kherson offensive, a protracted period of asymmetric skirmishing and deep strikes to disrupt Russia’s occupation and demoralise its troops, and a period of major combat operations in 2023. It is clear that the Russians have come to the same conclusion. This is why they have significantly reduced attempts to conduct further offensive operations and are instead trying to conserve their combat power while regenerating new units, which Putin has suggested will be available coming out of winter. With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russia’s forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Convincing the Russians to negotiate seriously requires demonstrating to them that military defeat – and not just a stalemate – is entirely plausible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period of winter skirmishing also holds out the prospect of significant unconventional warfare. Ukraine – like the rest of Europe – is looking at the prospect of energy and fuel shortages. Unlike states not at war, however, many of its citizens lack homes, and much infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. The Russians will work hard to stir up criticism of the Ukrainian government from within, just as they will use propaganda and agents of influence to argue that Western governments should spend money at home rather than in support of Ukraine. This is a false dichotomy, but given Ukraine’s dependence upon Western financing and ammunition, one of Russia’s theories of victory centres on breaking support for Ukraine this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prospects-matter&quot;&gt;Prospects Matter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that offensive operations to liberate occupied territories are likely to run through 2023 and are dependent upon Western aid, it is important that Ukraine’s international partners stop periodic announcements about specific lists of equipment and instead articulate a longer-term commitment to structural aid out to 2024. The reasons for this are straightforward. Firstly, it would remove the political pressure from the Ukrainian government to expend combat power to make short-term gains at the expense of longer-term prospects. Secondly, it would generate more realistic expectations among Western publics about the duration and impact of the conflict, and therefore reduce their vulnerability to Russian propaganda. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would show the Russians that their prospects are deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Russia’s willingness to grind on in the face of setbacks has been premised upon a belief – and perhaps a self-deluding hope – that Western support for Ukraine will fade. If this war is to end, it is vital that the Russian leadership understand that in the medium to long term their position on the ground will get worse, the capability gap between their forces and the Ukrainian military will expand, and the gap between their rhetoric and the reality will become insurmountable. In this context, public commitments to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft like Gripen may take a year to come to fruition, but the impact of such a long-term commitment on the Russian government should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As during the assault on Kyiv or the abandonment of Snake Island, Russia’s leadership have demonstrated that they are prepared to desist when they see a bigger failure looming on the horizon. There are a number of Western academics and former officers calling for negotiations with Russia. There is nothing wrong with negotiations, but treating them as separate from fighting is ahistorical and immature. There is no reason why negotiations need take place from a presumption of weakness. Convincing the Russians to negotiate seriously requires demonstrating to them that military defeat – and not just a stalemate – is entirely plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

The two countries have so far eschewed a formal alliance, but they share deep military ties centering on arms sales and joint military exercises.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russian arms sales to China have been invaluable to China’s efforts to rapidly modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Joint military exercises have likewise aided the PLA and offered Beijing a suite of other benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet military ties between Beijing and Moscow are not without considerable hiccups. China’s repeated theft of Russian technology is a major sore spot, and arms sales are becoming a less important focal point of the broader bilateral relationship. With respect to joint exercises, shifting power dynamics between China and Russia are upsetting the status quo with mixed results for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the decades, cooperation on military technology has at times been an important and symbolic element of China-Russia relations. Politically, Russian military aid and arms sales have helped undergird the broader diplomatic relationship. Militarily, arms sales have provided the PLA with equipment that it struggled to produce on its own, like advanced aircraft, engines, and air defense systems. However, China has repeatedly stolen Russian technology and know-how, creating friction between Beijing and Moscow. Going forward, arms sales could become a less important area of the relationship or even become a point of contention as China advances and competes with Russia in the global arms industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ebb-and-flow-of-russian-military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;The Ebb and Flow of Russian Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military aid and arms sales played a major role in cementing ties between the newly founded People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. After entering the Korean War in October 1950, China suffered heavy losses and turned to the Soviets for aid. In October 1951, Moscow agreed to provide massive amounts of equipment and assistance from Soviet experts. Soviet aid included around 700 MiG-15 fighter jets and 150 Tu-2 light bombers and effectively tripled the size of China’s air force fleet. In total, Chinese historical data suggests the Soviets provided the equivalent of $1.5–2 billion worth of aid during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union also abetted China’s nuclear development, for both civilian and military purposes. Soviet aid included training Chinese scientists, supporting China’s weapons-grade uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, and assisting with warhead design and production and missile technologies. The Soviets, however, stopped short of directly providing China with nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This massive influx of Soviet aid catalyzed China’s indigenous weapons production. Moscow encouraged and assisted Chinese production through licensing and technical support, and by 1956 China was producing the J-4, its first indigenous combat aircraft modeled on the Soviet MiG-17. China likewise leveraged Russian aid to eventually develop its first successful atomic bomb by 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this military cooperation did not last. By 1960, ideological and political differences resulted in the Sino-Soviet Split, which effectively lasted until the normalization of relations in 1989. During this period, the two countries ceased virtually all forms of military aid and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Arms Purchases from the Soviet Union/Russia (1950-2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the resumption of normal relations between Beijing and Moscow in 1989, arms sales again played a major role in strengthening political ties between the two sides. The Soviet Union was one of the only major arms-producing countries willing to sell weapons to China after the deadly crackdown on protestors in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which left Beijing an international pariah. The benefits were not one-sided. Chinese arms purchases were a lifeline for Russia’s defense industry in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian arms sales to China burgeoned in the 1990s and early 2000s. Some of the most big-ticket purchases were of Russian fighter aircraft. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 1990 and 2005 China placed several orders for some 270 Su-27 and Su-30 fighters at a cost of approximately $10-11 billion. In the years following the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis — during which China’s navy was outmatched by U.S. naval forces in the region — Beijing ordered eight Russian Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines and four Sovremenny-class destroyers. China also bought thousands of missiles and several S-300 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, among other equipment. Altogether, between 1990 and 2005, China purchased more than 83 percent of its arms imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the 1950s, this influx of major weapons systems in the 1990s and 2000s significantly aided the PLA by filling modernization gaps. Russia’s willingness to license production rights to China catalyzed the development of China’s own defense industry. By selling China kits of Russian aircraft parts, Chinese engineers gained manufacturing experience, which aided China in developing indigenous designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;problems-in-the-china-russia-arms-trade-relationship&quot;&gt;Problems in the China-Russia Arms Trade Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a flurry of orders, Chinese arms purchases from Russia slowed to a trickle in the late 2000s. China’s overall arms imports were down 30 percent during the 2007-2021 period compared to 1992-2006. Declining orders from Russia drove much of this fall. China has procured around 71 percent of its arms imports from Russia since 2007 — a notable drop from 84 percent during the previous 15-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline is partly the result of growing frustration with China’s repeated theft of Russian military technology and intellectual property through espionage and hacks. According to ChinaPower analysis, there have been at least 17 cases of Chinese espionage and hacking to steal Russian military technology during the last two decades. China has most heavily targeted Russian aerospace technologies. In 2004 alone, three court cases saw seven Russians convicted of providing China with information on Russian airplane and satellite technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espionage and hacks are only part of the story. China has frequently breached agreements with Russian arms suppliers by reverse-engineering Russian equipment to produce its own. China copied Russian Su-27 fighters to develop its J-11 fighter and it reverse-engineered S-300 SAM systems to produce its HQ-9 SAM systems. This has not gone unnoticed in Moscow. In 2019, Russian state-owned defense firm Rostec claimed that there had been 500 cases of unauthorized copying of its equipment in the preceding 17 years. In a rare move, the company publicly criticized China, stating that “‘China alone has copied aircraft engines, Sukhoi planes, deck jets, air defense systems, portable air defense missiles, and analogs of the Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air systems.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Timeline of Chinese Espionage and Technology Theft against Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative decline in Russian arms sales to China is also largely due to China’s shrinking reliance on foreign-made equipment. Decades of growing defense spending and intensive efforts to modernize its defense industry have rendered China increasingly capable of producing its own advanced fighter jets, naval vessels, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does notably still depend on Russian-made engines for many PLA aircraft. Over the last five years (2017-2021), aircraft engines accounted for more than 54 percent of China’s arms imports (by value), with the overwhelming majority coming from Russia. Some of China’s Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters are equipped with Russian Saturn AL-31 engines and versions of China’s developmental Shenyang J-35/FC-31 jet fighter have used Russian RD-93 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Recent Chinese Orders of Russian Aircraft Engines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China appears to be making headway toward replacing Russian engines. A domestically built WS-10C engine is reportedly being used in variants of the J-20, and new variants of the J-35/FC-31 are likely to be outfitted with Chinese WS-13E engines. Over the next decade, both planes are expected to feature more advanced Chinese-made engines, including the WS-15 and WS-19. China also aims to phase out the Russian Soloviev D-30KP-2 currently powering China’s Y-20 large transport aircraft and H-6K bombers and replace them with Chinese WS-18 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-russian-arms-sales-to-china&quot;&gt;The Future of Russian Arms Sales to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, several factors could render arms trade a source of contention and competition, rather than a platform for cooperation. The Chinese defense industry’s continued efforts toward self-reliance could result in the evaporation of Chinese arms purchases from Russia altogether. There has already been a marked slowdown in recent years. China last purchased military equipment (two orders of Mi-17 transport helicopters) from Russia in 2019 — a far cry from earlier years when China placed more than a dozen orders in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if China does continue to purchase certain items, Russia may face challenges in supplying them. In 2020, Russia delayed delivery of its highly advanced S-400 SAM system to China, citing the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse. However, the move was seen by some as a diplomatic move by Moscow to avoid angering India — Russia’s top arms buyer — amid heightened tensions and border skirmishes between China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine could further inhibit Russia from delivering orders to China. After Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, international sanctions on Russia disrupted Russia’s ability to deliver certain equipment to Vietnam, one of Russia’s top arm export markets. The severe sanctions placed on Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine could further disrupt the Russian defense industry and limit its ability to fulfill large orders to China or other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if China pushes to establish itself as a more dominant player in the global arms market, it could put significant pressure on the broader China-Russia relationship. Russia’s prominence in the global arms market has already declined steeply. In 2021, Russian arms exports plunged to 11 percent of the global total — the lowest point in decades and a steep fall from a high of 32 percent in 2002. So far, China has not made major gains in capturing global market share due to steep competition from more established actors, including the United States and Russia. Nevertheless, China may be able to use Russia’s war in Ukraine to make marginal gains in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. In the long-term, Beijing could become a more attractive arms supplier as developing countries look to diversify their suppliers away from just Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nBm9tcO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of Global Arm Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, arms sales will likely remain a slightly diminished but positive element of the relationship. As China’s capabilities and influence grow, however, this could change and may ultimately become a thorny issue in the bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joint-military-exercises&quot;&gt;Joint Military Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike military aid and arms sales, which have waxed and waned over the years, joint exercises are a relatively new and thriving element of China-Russia military ties and a driver behind the strengthening of China-Russia relations in recent years. Joint military exercises provide China and the PLA with myriad benefits, such as operational experience and opportunities for deterrent signaling. These benefits could evolve or diminish, however, as China’s power grows and as Russia stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-evolving-nature-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Evolving Nature of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia first participated in a military exercise together in 2003. The multilateral exercise, dubbed Coalition 2003, featured a series of counter-terrorism drills and brought together 1,300 troops from China, Russia, and three other members of the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Two years later, China and Russia held their first bilateral military exercise, known as Peace Mission 2005, which began in the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok and moved to China’s Shandong Peninsula. The exercise was a major undertaking involving 8,000 Chinese troops and 2,000 Russian troops conducting both land and amphibious maneuvers. Exercises such as these, consisting of large ground or multi-domain operations, were the norm during the early years of China-Russia joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Faobkb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercises by Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as China and Russia strengthened ties, they dramatically scaled up the number and type of exercises. In 2007, they conducted their first joint paramilitary exercise Cooperation 2007, focused on anti-terrorism drills, and in 2009 they held their first joint naval drills in the Gulf of Aden. Starting in 2014, China and Russia began to participate in large-scale competitions such as the Aviadarts air force competition and Tank Biathlon, both of which are now annual exercises. Since then, the two have further widened the aperture of their cooperation by participating in computer-based simulations and by conducting joint aerial patrols. Altogether, China and Russia participated in at least 78 joint military exercises between 2003 and mid-2022, with more than half of these taking place since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia joint exercises have also expanded in terms of geographic reach. Early exercises largely took place in the rugged terrains of western China and Central Asia, but more recent naval exercises saw the two operate in the distant waters of the South African coast, the Mediterranean Sea, and even as far as the Baltic Sea. Joint aerial patrols have likewise seen the two flying across broad swaths of the Western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BK3AdTW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-china-benefits-from-joint-exercises-with-russia&quot;&gt;How China Benefits from Joint Exercises with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reaps many benefits from joint exercises with Russia. First and foremost, joint exercises have allowed the PLA to gain valuable experience operating with the far more experienced Russian military and afforded the PLA opportunities to practice maneuvering in a variety of geographies and climates far from China’s borders. These experiences are invaluable to the PLA, which has not engaged in large-scale military conflict in several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises provide additional benefits to China (and Russia) as a tool for sending political signals and deterring perceived adversaries. Chinese officials have long claimed that joint exercises do not target “third parties”; however, the 2020 edition of Science of Military Strategy — an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University — states that an exercise “not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China and Russia have increasingly exploited joint exercises to signal to the United States and its allies. In September 2016, just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, which featured island seizure operations in the South China Sea. It was their first and only naval exercise held there, sending a clear signal that it was a response to the tribunal’s ruling. More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (also known as the Quad) in Tokyo. The move was widely seen as a direct response and intentional provocation in protest of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also aims to use the exercises to positively signal to friends and neighbors. More than half of China-Russia exercises are multilateral. SCO members states and other neighbors participate in the lion’s share of these. These exercises help to both level up the military capabilities of these countries while also helping to assure them that China and Russia have the capability and will to aid them in addressing regional security threats. They also aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s own intentions, making the exercises an important element of China’s peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/55FsAVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercise by Number of Participants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, joint military exercises help to strengthen the broader bilateral relationship by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels. The recent Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises were viewed by Chinese experts as being unique in that the two sides not only jointly conducted the exercise but also collaborated in planning and commanding the exercises. More broadly, exercises have provided opportunities for Chinese military leaders — including vice chairs of China’s Central Military Commission and defense ministers — to meet with their Russian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, exercises increase mutual trust and transparency by revealing to each other their respective capabilities. At Zapad/Interaction 2021, more than 80 percent of China’s equipment used in the exercise was new — including the PLA’s KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones — giving Russia a look at some of China’s most advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shifting-dynamics-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Shifting Dynamics of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits that China gains from joint exercises with Russia are changing as China-Russia power dynamics shifts. Chinese analysts increasingly emphasize China’s military capabilities are catching up with, or surpassing, Russia’s. One expert argues, for example, that Chinese battalion groups have surpassed their Russian counterparts in terms of weapons and equipment and that Russian battalion tactical groups “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine… and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has even started to flip the status quo by leading exercises while Russia participates from a junior position. Official Chinese media described the Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises as the first in which the PLA led, as well as the first joint exercises held entirely in China using mostly Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction 2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and a chance to create a joint exercise “brand” centered on the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging dynamic is likely to be cemented as China’s power grows and Russia stagnates. Russia’s war in Ukraine may accelerate this trend. The Russian military has surprised many by how poorly it has performed in Ukraine, and the conflict has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Russia becomes deeply weakened and overstretched by the war, it may be unable to carry out frequent large-scale exercises. This may lead China to pivot toward smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling. The two sides could also continue with frequent exercises but with China more consistently leading as the senior partner. Alternately, if Beijing concludes that Russia’s performance in Ukraine has been bad enough, it may ultimately rethink the value of participating in joint exercises with Russia and even reconsider the overall value of strategic ties with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did China commit to the relationship at such a pivotal moment? Why did Beijing double down on the relationship by refusing to criticize the Russian invasion of Ukraine? This ChinaPower feature explores how the relationship came to be so close, up until the time of the invasion. This analysis centers on five key ways in which China benefits from the relationship, each of which is examined in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia supports China’s core interests;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin personally supports Xi Jinping and his key initiatives;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia helps to magnify China’s global reach at the expense of Western influence;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia enhances China’s military power through arms sales and joint military exercises; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia assists China in meeting important economic and energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supporting-chinas-core-interests&quot;&gt;Supporting China’s Core Interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China-Russia relationship is founded, first and foremost, on mutual respect and accommodation of each side’s core interests. For China, this means accepting China’s authoritarian political system, supporting (or not opposing) China’s sovereignty and territorial claims, and aiding China in maintaining stability on its periphery. Without these preconditions, the relationship would not be as close as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese and Russian political systems are meaningfully different, they share similar tendencies toward authoritarianism. Moscow’s acceptance and support of China’s basic political system, and its attempts to legitimize alternative, non-Western visions of democracy and human rights, made it possible for Russia to deepen relations with China as Western countries criticized Beijing on human rights issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also crucial to Beijing’s core interests is Russia’s support or acceptance of Chinese sovereignty claims. During the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, Moscow blamed Taiwan and the United States for heightened tensions and refrained from criticizing China for conducting military exercises and missile launches near Taiwan. In the 2001 China-Russia Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, Russia endorsed Beijing’s One-China Principle and stated that it “opposes any form of Taiwan’s independence.” Russia has continued to support Beijing’s stance on Taiwan, including in the February 4, 2022, joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Taiwan, Moscow has supported Beijing’s draconian policies toward Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, and it has even appeared to signal support for Chinese claims over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands that Japan also claims — most notably through a joint China-Russia bomber patrol near the islands in 2019. Russia has remained officially neutral on disputed Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but it has tacitly supported China by criticizing “non-regional powers” (i.e., the United States) for involving themselves in the region, and Russia even joined China in a naval exercise in the South China Sea in 2016 after an international tribunal sided with the Philippines and ruled against Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has reciprocated by supporting or not opposing Russian activities and claims. Beijing has largely avoided criticizing Russian military activities in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, and it has tacitly sided with Russian claims over the Kuril Islands, which Japan disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has further supported Beijing’s core interests by cooperating with China to shape favorable security dynamics along their shared periphery. The two countries cooperated in the 1990s and 2000s to resolve their decades-old border dispute, which eliminated a long-existing irritant in the bilateral relationship and set the stage for the two nuclear neighbors to view each other as strategic partners instead of rivals. It also freed up Beijing’s political attention and military resources to focus on other pressing concerns along China’s periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is a core member of the China-headquartered Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which comprises eight Member States (China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), as well as four Observer States and six Dialogue Partners. The SCO has provided a platform for China and Russia to coordinate their interests and manage competition in Central Asia and connected regions. The two countries have also used the SCO as a platform to cooperate on anti-terrorism and countering separatist activities, including through multilateral military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PvbR5Op.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia both seek security and stability in Central Asia and are wary of what they perceive to be potential western “interference.” Chinese officials have voiced support for cooperating with Russia to fight against potential “color revolutions” in neighboring countries, which Beijing worries could lead to instability spilling over into its western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. From Beijing’s perspective, Russia plays a crucial role in shaping regional security dynamics thanks to its close relationships with former Soviet states in the region. Russia demonstrated its ability to shape the region in January 2022 when it deployed troops to Kazakhstan to quell violent protests that erupted over high energy prices. China and Russia also both see shared interests in working with the Taliban in Afghanistan to reduce the risk of terrorist activity there and throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the region, Beijing has pursued cooperation with Moscow in managing the North Korean nuclear issue. Both countries have pushed back against calls by the United States and its partners to impose additional sanctions on North Korea, and they have recommended lifting certain sanctions. At the same time, Beijing is aware of Pyongyang’s desire to maneuver between its two large neighbors, as it has at times sought to pit Beijing against Moscow. To sustain any major policies toward North Korea, China needs Russian support or to at least ensure that Moscow does not play a spoiler role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supporting-xi-jinpings-priorities&quot;&gt;Supporting Xi Jinping’s Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is not unique in being willing to accept or support China’s core interests. Many countries are willing to do so. A key factor that differentiates Russia is high-level political support from Beijing, which stems from the close personal relationship between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Their personal ties help to drive high-level strategic convergence and overcome any distrust or differences at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has repeatedly heaped praise on Putin, calling him his “best friend and colleague” and his “bosom buddy.” This has been reflected in Xi’s diplomatic agenda. As of May 2022, Xi had met one-on-one with Putin 39 times — more than twice as many times as he has met with the leader of any other country. Xi has also traveled to Russia eight times since 2013, which is more than double the number of trips he made to his second most frequented country (the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MJMbAuA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Meetings with Select Foreign Leaders (2013-2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personal ties between the two leaders have brought their countries closer across several key areas. Under Putin, Russia has supported virtually all of Xi Jinping’s most important priorities on the world stage. Russia has at least rhetorically supported the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xi’s signature foreign policy aimed at expanding China’s global economic and political influence through heightened economic and physical connectivity. Russian and Chinese leaders have repeatedly voiced joint calls for linking up the BRI with its Russian counterpart, the Eurasian Economic Union; however, progress on synching the two initiatives has been lackluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia joined the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral bank headquartered in China that provides an alternative to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Russia has also supported China’s Global Development Initiative, which Xi proposed amid the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic to focus on issues such as poverty alleviation, food security, Covid-19 response, and other areas. Additionally, Xi Jinping likely saw Putin’s visit to China to attend the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a gesture of good will, especially given that most Western leaders chose not to attend or instituted diplomatic boycotts of the games due to concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amplifying-chinas-global-reach&quot;&gt;Amplifying China’s Global Reach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major force driving closer ties is a shared desire by Beijing and Moscow to expand their influence on the world stage at the expense of the United States and its democratic allies. While Russian power is stagnating in crucial areas, many in China see Moscow as being capable of “playing a weak hand well.” Beijing sees significant benefits in Russia’s capacity and willingness to wield its political, economic, military, and discourse power in ways that align with Chinese interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are both wary of a U.S.-dominated international order that they believe undermines their interests. The two maintain convergent threat assessments that Washington, with support from its allies, seeks to encircle and isolate them militarily while undermining their political systems and promoting “color revolutions.” They view Western economic sanctions, technological decoupling, and other efforts as being aimed at undermining their development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have frequently criticized the United States and its partners in their joint statements. Their February 4, 2022, joint statement — which highlighted their closeness on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — criticized the United States nine times, including complaints about the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, the trilateral AUKUS security partnership, and U.S. developments related to missile deployments, missile defense, and biological and chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pushing back against Western influence, Beijing benefits from Russia’s ability to shape international developments and leverage its power over countries — especially within the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the political front, Russia holds significant positions within international organizations such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where it (like China) enjoys veto power as a permanent member. Through the UNSC, China and Russia have sought to steer international developments in their favor. China and Russia jointly condemned NATO’s use of force in Yugoslavia and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. In 2020, China and Russia spearheaded a successful campaign within the UNSC to stop U.S.-led efforts to re-impose UN sanctions on Iran in the wake of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s 13 most recent vetoes within the UNSC have all aligned with Russian vetoes. Ten of these have been related to opposing U.S. and allied efforts to address the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria. China has also abstained from voting on UNSC resolutions that run counter to Russian interests, including a 2014 resolution declaring invalid a referendum that led to Crimea’s independence and a resolution condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C6uEGxH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese and Russian Vetoes in the UN Security Council&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing and Moscow have specifically sought to cooperate within international organizations to undermine Western norms around democracy and human rights. Since the late 1990s, China and Russia have been involved in the informal Like-Minded Group, a coalition of largely authoritarian countries that have worked together in the United Nations to weaken the international human rights regime and redefine human rights. The two countries have jointly signed over 40 statements in the UN Human Rights Council to endorse alternative views on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the United Nations, China and Russia have worked together in other important multilateral settings to offset Western influence. In 2009, Russia advocated that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expand the basket of Special Drawing Rights to include the Russian ruble and Chinese yuan as part of reforming the IMF to be more inclusive. The two countries have also advocated for their shared interests within BRICS Summits — annual meetings of the world’s leading developing economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) — and they continue to call for further cooperation within the BRICS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, Russia wields significant leverage over several countries through its provision of energy resources. In 2020, 10 European and Central Asian countries purchased more than 60 percent of their crude oil imports from Russia, with Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia, and Kazakhstan buying virtually all of their imported crude oil from Russia. These countries, and others, are also heavily reliant on imports of Russian refined oil, gas, and coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a track record of using its prominence in energy markets to its advantage. In 2014, Russian energy giant Gazprom cut off gas deliveries to Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Romania to disrupt diversions of oil to Ukraine. The European Union scrambled to find alternative sources of energy, but it was forced to pay a higher price in doing so. Many of these same dynamics played out in Europe amid Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline being a major source of contention. For Beijing, Russia’s ability to use such influence is an important asset for constraining and countering countries on key issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Cf1HKfu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on Russian Energy Imports in Select Countries (2020)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow also exerts significant influence in much of the developing world through its military power, especially its weapons sales. Particularly important for Beijing is Russia’s influence over Vietnam and India, both of which have tense relations with China. Since 2010, Vietnam has received some 80 percent of its weapons imports from Russia. India likewise ordered 62 percent of its arms imports from Russia during that period, and today nearly 70 percent of India’s military equipment is Russian-made. Moscow may be able to use its leverage over these two countries to discourage them from aligning closer to the West (and against Russian and Chinese interests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s international influence in the military realm does not just stem from arms sales. Moscow holds sway in developing countries through military deployments. Over the last few decades, Russia has amassed a substantial military footprint around the world, including within the Caucuses and Syria, but also further afield in the Central African Republic, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and even Venezuela. More recently, Russia has sought to expand its influence in the African country of Mali through the deployment of Russian private military contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on Russian Arms Imports (2010-2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China sees benefits in Russia’s ability and willingness to shape global discourse through disinformation and propaganda that converges with China’s own anti-Western messaging. The Russian government has long used online tools to spread pro-Russian, anti-Western narratives. The government-funded organization Russia Today, for example, regularly spreads divisive, anti-Western disinformation to its nearly 7.5 million Facebook followers and 3 million Twitter followers from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia and China have used their state-linked online platforms in complementary efforts to shape global discourse and spread disinformation. Russia, has focused intently on undermining confidence in Western vaccines and flaming internal divisions within Western countries over issues like vaccine mandates. Early on in the pandemic, China marshalled its diplomats and state-linked media to spread propaganda defending China’s response to the pandemic, but over time it focused more heavily on criticizing the West’s handling of Covid-19. Studies suggest the two countries learned from each other in spreading disinformation and that they benefited from shared efforts to undercut the image of the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advancing-chinas-military-power&quot;&gt;Advancing China’s Military Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military cooperation has been a crucial element of the China-Russia relationship over the years. The two sides have demonstrated a high level of cooperation on military technology — most notably through arms sales — as well as military-to-military cooperation through joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 1989 normalization of relations between Beijing and Moscow, Soviet and Russian arms sales to China were critical to China’s push to modernize and equip the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as Western countries limited their provision of weapons to China. In the 1990s, China spent billions of dollars ordering dozens of Russian Su-27 and Su-30 aircraft and securing the licenses to produce hundreds more of the planes within China. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, China ordered other major systems from Russia, including a dozen Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines, four Sovremenny-class destroyers, and S300 PMU2 anti-aircraft missiles, as well as numerous additional aircraft. Altogether, between 1990 and 2005, China purchased more than 83 percent of its arms imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years that followed saw a marked decline in Chinese arms purchases — from both Russia and other countries. This stemmed in part from Russian concerns about Chinese copying and IP theft of Russian military technologies as well as the Chinese defense industry’s growing ability to produce more equipment indigenously. China’s arms purchases from 2011 to 2021 fell 46 percent from the 2000-2010 period, and purchases from Russia as a percent of China’s total arms imports slipped to around 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H7c45sQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Arms Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, China and Russia made efforts to arrest this trend and revive arms sales as an important part of the relationship. A series of deals in 2015 saw China purchase some $5 billion worth of Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 air defense systems. In 2019, President Putin also announced that Russia was helping China to create a missile attack warning system, suggesting a continued high degree of military technological cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to arms sales, China and Russia have achieved substantial progress on cooperation through joint military exercises. The two countries conducted their first bilateral joint exercise in 2005. Known as “Peace Mission 2005,” the exercise saw 10,000 Chinese and Russian troops take part in land, sea, and air operations in Vladivostok in Russia and on the Shandong peninsula in China. Like many joint China-Russia military exercises that have followed, it was described as being largely aimed at counterterrorism operations; however, the inclusion of major military assets like strategic bombers was seen by many as an indication that it was broader in scope and also intended as a warning to the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next several years saw the two countries participate in a handful of joint exercises, averaging approximately one to two exercises per year. Starting in 2013, however, China and Russia significantly ramped up their bilateral and multilateral exercises with each other. Through mid-2022, they have held at least 78 military (and paramilitary) exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These military exercises have not only grown in number but also in complexity. In October 2021, China and Russia completed joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan, followed immediately by their first joint naval patrol in the western Pacific. The joint naval patrol consisted of 10 Chinese and Russian warships as well as six carrier-based helicopters and featured joint maneuvers and live-fire drills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frequent exercises present several benefits for China. Earlier on, they provided an opportunity for the PLA to learn from the more experienced and technologically advanced Russian military. In more recent exercises, Chinese defense experts have noted that the PLA now plays an equal or more senior role in planning and operations. The exercises also serve as an important means of institutionalizing bilateral military ties, promoting interoperability and confidence building, and sending deterrent signals to third parties such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-and-resource-complementarity&quot;&gt;Economic and Resource Complementarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s ties with Russia generate notable benefits on the economic front. The last two decades have witnessed enormous growth in trade between the two countries. Between 2000 and 2021, China’s annual trade with Russia grew more than 18-fold, from just $8 billion to more than $147 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this only represents about 2 percent of China’s total trade with the world, it is the content of the trade relationship — not the size — that is crucial to China. Major energy products, such as oil, coal, and gas, comprise approximately two-thirds of China’s imports from Russia. Crude oil alone accounts for over half of China’s imports from Russia. In 2021, China imported some $40.5 billion worth of Russian crude oil — roughly 16 percent of its total oil imports — making Russia its second largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Composition of Chinese Imports from Russia (2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian trade with China also has a disproportionate impact on certain local economies within China. Trade with Russia is particularly important among northeastern provinces that border Russia. According to Chinese customs data, 24 percent of exports out of China’s Heilongjiang Province went to Russia in 2021, and a massive 78 percent of the province’s imports came from Russia. Jilin and Inner Mongolia — both of which border Russia — are likewise more dependent on Russian trade than other provinces (though to a lesser extent than Heilongjiang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OCwSPAR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on Exports to Russia by Province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Beijing’s perspective, Russia plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth in a lagging region. Both Jilin and Heilongjiang form part of China’s northeastern “rust belt,” an area of the country that has struggled to overcome the impacts of de-industrialization. China has sought to maximize the benefits of Russian trade to the region by forming pilot free trade zones in Heilongjiang and enabling Jilin export access to a Russian port. Additionally, two land ports within Hunchun, a city in Jilin, were approved as official seafood import ports from Russia, allowing Russian seafood exports to directly reach Hunchun, lowering costs and improving quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CSIS China Power Team</name></author><summary type="html">China largely eschewed formal alliances, but has increasingly courted close ties with Russia.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/ngvKW1R.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/ngvKW1R.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">China-Russia Weaknesses</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-22-china-russia-weaknesses.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="China-Russia Weaknesses" /><published>2022-08-22T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-08-22T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/china-russia-weaknesses</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-22-china-russia-weaknesses.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has cast a spotlight on the China-Russia relationship. On February 4, 2022, just weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin met and issued a historic joint statement which stated their bilateral relationship has “no limits” and that “there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have indeed significantly strengthened their relationship in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoy close working relations, which drives high-level cooperation. The two sides also cooperate based on shared threat perceptions that the United States and its allies seek to encircle and undermine them. Close military ties and complementary economic dynamics help cement their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the China-Russia relationship is complex and comes with costs for both sides. Leaders in Beijing and Moscow appear to have assessed for now that the benefits outweigh the costs, but that calculus could change. In the sections that follow, this ChinaPower feature analyzes three key weaknesses of the relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical and structural factors engender strategic mistrust between Beijing and Moscow;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian stagnation renders Moscow a less useful partner and contributes to a growing power asymmetry; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian military aggression sparks blowback for China and exacerbates Russia’s stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-and-structural-factors-create-strategic-mistrust&quot;&gt;Historical and Structural Factors Create Strategic Mistrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strengthening of relations between Beijing and Moscow in recent years, considerable strategic mistrust exists between the two countries. Chinese strategic mistrust stems partly from the checkered history between the two countries, which saw the more powerful Russian Empire and the Soviet Union take advantage of a weaker China. For Russia’s part, enduring structural factors — especially geography — stoke fears that an increasingly powerful China may encroach on its interests and take advantage of Russian weaknesses. Moscow’s concerns are heightened by a strategic culture that harbors deep-seated great power ambitions and chafes at being the junior partner in a relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present close relationship between China and Russia is a notable deviation from history, which often witnessed the more powerful neighbor taking advantage of the weaker country. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was party to many of the “unequal treaties” that compelled China to hand over territory, money, and other spoils to European powers. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking were particularly harsh, forcing China to forfeit approximately 1 million square kilometers (km) of territory to the Russian Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2Vvikud.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Key Historical Sources of Chinese Mistrust of Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-20th century, tensions between the newly founded People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union devolved into the Sino-Soviet Split, which lasted into the 1980s. The two countries’ longstanding border disputes were a central flashpoint of the period. In 1969, hostility along the border escalated to nuclear posturing and nearly resulted in large-scale conflict between the two communist powers. Moscow also pressed Beijing on other fronts, including criticizing Chinese repression in Tibet and indirectly calling for Tibet’s independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations in 1989, China and Russia officially resolved their longstanding border disputes and Moscow began expressing support or neutrality on sensitive Chinese issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Nevertheless, Moscow’s decades of antagonism have remained a source of suspicion within China. The unequal treaties that Russia was partner to were central to China’s “century of humiliation,” which the Chinese Communist Party still draws on as a source of nationalistic energy. It is impossible to de-link Russia from that legacy. Many Chinese thinkers still view these historic incidents as indicators of Russia’s willingness to use its power to pursue its own interests at China’s expense, and many in China continue to be wary of Russia’s reliability as a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of historical factors, enduring structural factors generate friction in the relationship — chief among them, geography. China’s immediate proximity to Russia leads to competitive dynamics in areas along their shared periphery, most notably in the Russian Far East, Central Asia, and the Arctic. More fundamentally, China’s immense size and power make it a daunting neighbor in the event that relations between Beijing and Moscow sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the opening of the China-Russia border in 1988, China’s presence in the Russian Far East emerged as an irritant in the relationship. As China’s economy grew, Chinese workers and businesses flowed into the region. Many went into the agricultural sector. One study found that in 2018 Chinese citizens owned or leased approximately 350,000 hectares (3,500 square km) of farming land in the Russian Far East — approximately 16 percent of the total land used for agriculture. The presence of Chinese workers in the region stirred up anger among some Russians, with many complaining about Chinese workers stealing Russian jobs and exploiting Russian natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about China’s presence in the Russian Far East have waned somewhat in recent years, and China is broadly popular among the Russian public. According to the Pew Research Center, 71 percent of Russians said they viewed China positively in 2019 — the highest of all 35 countries surveyed. However, China’s presence in the Russia Far East continues to provoke negative views. A 2017 poll by the Russian Academy of Sciences found that more than one in three Russians view China’s increasing presence as “expansion.” Half of respondents said that China threatened Russia’s territorial integrity, and one-third of them believed that China’s policies endanger their country’s economic development. This negative local sentiment has at times stalled planned Chinese investment projects, such as a Chinese-funded water bottling plant in the Irkutsk region, which was suspended after local protests in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia also face competitive dynamics in their shared backyard of Central Asia, which could become a source of tensions. Moscow remains influential in the five former Soviet states of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and it considers the region to be within its “privileged sphere of influence.” Russia has thus far been willing to accept China’s activities there, for example, by cooperating with Beijing in the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization and by not opposing China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) ambitions. Russia currently even reaps some benefits out of China’s presence in the region: China’s considerable economic engagement there helps to facilitate regional stability and development allowing Russia to focus more on shaping military and security dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China is stepping up its security and economic footprint in Central Asia in ways that may increasingly be perceived through a competitive lens by Moscow. In 2021, it was announced that China would construct an outpost for police special forces in Tajikistan. While it appears that Chinese forces will not be stationed there, China’s move was seen by some as an encroachment on Russia’s ties to Tajikistan, which is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (a rough analogue to NATO comprising former Soviet states) and home to Russia’s largest overseas military base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, China has rapidly replaced Russia as the larger trading partner of all five Central Asian states. In 2000, Chinese imports from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan totaled less than one-fourth of Russian imports, but by 2020 they were more than double Russia’s imports. China’s exports have ballooned as well, with $19.3 billion worth of Chinese goods destined for Central Asia in 2020. As this trend continues, it threatens to undercut Russia’s ability to wield its economic influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0xmiTaB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Has Surpassed Russia as the Bigger Trade Partner in All Former Soviet States in Central Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia is wary of Chinese ambitions in the Arctic, where Moscow has significant interests. Approximately one-fifth of Russia’s expansive territory is located within the Arctic Circle. This area encompasses more than 24,000 km of shoreline and is home to some 2.5 million people. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has made the Arctic a key region of focus, including reviving Russia’s military presence there. In recent years, Russia has refurbished 50 previously closed Soviet-era military posts, including 13 air bases, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 integrated emergency rescue stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite lacking territory in the arctic, China has pushed to establish itself as a “near-Arctic state,” and in a 2018 white paper on the arctic, China put forward a vision for building a “Polar Silk Road” to complement the broader BRI. China and Russia have so far cooperated on energy and infrastructure projects in the region, but there have been considerable setbacks. Russia initially opposed allowing China onto the multilateral Arctic Council as an observer, and Moscow continues to be suspicious of Beijing’s strategic goals in the region. In 2012, Russia blocked Chinese research vessels from conducting surveys along the Northern Sea Route, and in 2020 Russian prosecutors charged a prominent Russian Arctic expert with treason for passing classified information to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Russia may feel the need to push back against China’s growing influence in these areas. In the spirit of the Chinese idiom “一山不容二虎” (one mountain cannot tolerate two tigers), China may also assert its interests over Russia’s as it pushes to shore up its regional and global power. So far, China and Russia have managed to compartmentalize competition in these areas, and they have succeeded in strengthening relations despite their turbulent history. Yet the seeds of mistrust remain planted within the relationship and could someday grow into a major impediment in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-stagnation-exacerbates-tensions&quot;&gt;Russian Stagnation Exacerbates Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have long sought to cast themselves as equal partners, but this narrative is increasingly difficult to maintain given the growing power asymmetry between the two. As Russia stagnates or even declines, and as China continues to bolster its national power, Russia is poised to be a less useful partner to China in countering Western influence. China’s growing lead over Russia could also exacerbate existing tensions and mistrust between Beijing and Moscow if Russia feels it is being disrespected or treated as a junior partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across virtually all elements of national power — including economic, technological, and military power — China is surging ahead of Russia or rapidly catching up. Economically, China has already far surpassed Russia. On a nominal basis, the Chinese economy was nearly 10 times larger than Russia’s in 2021. For the first time, China even surpassed Russia in nominal per capita GDP in 2020 (though Russia remains ahead of China when adjusted for purchasing power parity). The gap is set to widen significantly in the coming years. Economic forecasts by the International Monetary Fund expect China’s GDP to climb toward nearly $30 trillion by 2027 while Russia’s GDP is forecasted to stall at well under $2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/553C2Yv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ GDP of China and Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s stagnating economic growth is rendering it less important as an economic partner. In 2020, Russia only accounted for about 2 percent of China’s total trade (imports and exports). By comparison, China was Russia’s largest trade partner, accounting for about 18 percent of Russia’s trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term trends will likely render Russia even less economically relevant for China. Russia’s current value to China is in supplying energy, with oil, gas, and coal collectively accounting for two-thirds of Russia’s exports to China. Barring a major paradigm shift, Russia will decline in importance in the coming decades as China weens itself off fossil fuels. This trend is already in the works. In 2010, oil and coal made up nearly 87 percent of China’s energy consumption. In 2020, that figure had dropped to less than 76 percent. Similarly, renewable energies made up approximately 16 percent of China’s energy consumption — up from about 9 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vbyi7Dz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The China-Russia Trade Imbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia would face enormous headwinds in transitioning toward a more balanced and competitive economy since Russia lags far behind China and other global leaders when it comes to technological power and sophistication. In 2020, China spent 14 times more on research and development (R&amp;amp;D) than Russia. This was not simply the result of differences in economic size: China also spent more than twice as much as Russia as a percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the board, Russia lacks the science and technology ecosystem needed to produce the kinds of products that would make it a more valuable and dynamic economic and technological partner for China in the long-term. The Global Innovation Index, a leading index measuring innovative capabilities and performance, ranked China 12th globally in 2021, just behind France and ahead of Japan. Meanwhile, it ranked Russia 45th alongside Vietnam (44th) and India (46th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x7QSOel.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Performance in Key Metrics of Science and Technology Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stagnation on the economic and technological fronts is weighing on its military power, which has traditionally been a key source of its strength and influence. In 2021, Russia spent virtually the same on its military as it did in 2014 (about $64 billion). China’s military budget grew over 47 percent during that period, from $183 billion to $270 billion.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has multiple implications for China. In recent decades, Beijing has looked to Russia as a major military partner in competing with the United States and its allies, but Russia’s faltering defense spending is weighing on China and Russia’s collective capacity to compete militarily. In 2021, the United States and its NATO and Indo-Pacific allies collectively spent 3.7 times more on defense than China and Russia. More concretely, Chinese experts have complained about the state of the Russian military, highlighting, for example, that the Russian naval fleet largely comprises outdated Soviet-era vessels and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mb7Un3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Defense Spending: China and Russia vs. the United States and Allies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether, or at what point, the power disparity between the two countries would threaten their relationship. If Russian power wanes and Western isolation of Russia continues, Moscow may conclude that it has no choice but to bandwagon with China. However, given Russian perceptions of itself and its history as a great power, Russia may be unwilling to have a close partnership with China that is not built on equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs that some Russians are already wary of being treated poorly by China. In March 2022, former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev described China’s leaders as “ruthless businessmen” and said “China will never take [Putin] as an equal partner or even as ally.” If Russian leaders feel that they are being taken advantage of or treated like the junior partner, they may ultimately choose to cool relations with Beijing and limit cooperation. Russia may even assess at some point that the power imbalance has become so severe that China poses a direct challenge or threat to Russia, which could result in a full pivot away from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-aggression-runs-counter-to-chinese-interests&quot;&gt;Russian Aggression Runs Counter to Chinese Interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding these issues is Russia’s persistent military aggression on the world stage. Russia’s numerous military interventions — especially its ongoing war in Ukraine — have created political and economic blowback for China. On top of that, Russia’s war in Ukraine has weakened Russia, diminishing its utility to China and further exacerbating the widening power gap between China and Russia..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese strategists and analysts have contrasted Russia’s willingness to use force with China’s forbearance. Some have described Vladimir Putin as a “revolutionary” seeking to overturn the existing international order and noted that Moscow’s goals render it more willing to use violence to advance its interests. By comparison, Chinese scholars have characterized China as having the more modest goal of rendering the existing international system more conducive to China’s growth and development — and therefore less willing to resort to force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s willingness to use aggression has put China in politically awkward situations. Chinese officials have long described territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as a cornerstone of China’s foreign policy. Chinese officials and propaganda outlets frequently try to cast China as having never invaded or bullied other countries. Russia’s repeated invasions of other countries run in direct opposition to those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6jewgfW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Major Military Interventions by Russia under Vladimir Putin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has at times gone so far as to subtly criticize Russian military aggression. In 2008, then-spokesman of China’s foreign ministry Qin Gang stated that China “expressed concern” over the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia during Russia’s war in Georgia. Mostly, China has sought to neither criticize nor directly side with Russia. Beijing, for example, has not recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia; nor has it recognized the breakaway Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk or Russian claims over Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Xi Jinping has gone farther by publicly legitimizing Russian security and sovereignty concern, but this has come at a political and diplomatic cost. In the United Nations, China was compelled to make unpopular votes that placed it among a small minority of countries. In March 2022, for example, 141 countries voted in the UN General Assembly in favor of a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while China joined a minority of 34 other countries in abstaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rVnGSFO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ UN General Assembly Vote on Resolution to Condemn Russia’s 2022 Invasion of Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has also propelled a rapid and significant improvement in relations between the United States and its European allies as they collectively counter Russia, and it has strengthened perceived fault lines between democracies and autocracies — unwelcome outcomes for China. In the United States, China’s tacit support for Russia has brought a spotlight to the China-Russia relationship, with 62 percent of people polled describing it as posing “a very serious problem.” In Europe, a key economic partner for China where Beijing has been pushing to gain influence, countries there have toughened their stance toward China. In April and May, China sent an envoy to meet with officials in eight central and eastern European countries with the hopes of improving ties, but China’s outreach was rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also inflicted economic pain on China. The global rise in energy prices sparked by the war led oil prices to spike in China — much as they did in other countries. According to Chinese customs data, the price of China’s crude oil imports rose to RMB 5,070 per metric ton in April 2022 — up 37 percent from January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Average Monthly Price of Chinese Crude Oil Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and its companies are also facing the added burden of navigating Western sanctions on Russia. While China has not joined U.S. and European sanctions on Russia, and despite Beijing’s calls for companies to continue conducting business in Russia, many Chinese firms have paused or cut operations there. This includes major Chinese tech companies like computer-maker Lenovo, smartphone-maker Xiaomi, and drone-maker DJI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China’s exports to Russia plummeted to RMB 24.1 billion in April 2022 — down 53 percent from the recent high of RMB 52 billion in December 2021. Technology exports have been particularly hard hit. In March, laptop sales to Russia were down more than 40 percent and smartphones down by nearly two-thirds. In late May, five Chinese firms were told to stop construction of a Chinese-Russian liquefied natural gas pipeline, a key node in China’s “Polar Silk Road,” to avoid EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Monthly Exports to Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to causing political and economic blowback, Russia’s wars threaten to further diminish Russia’s utility as a strategic partner for China. Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine created significant setbacks for the Russian military and its supporting defense industry. The war disrupted Russia’s ability to deliver weapons systems to Vietnam — one of Russia’s top arm export markets — which in turn contributed to a broader decline in Russia’s arms exports in recent years. During the 2016-2021 period, Russian arms sales around the world declined 24 percent over the previous six-year period, and its share of global arms sales fell from 25 percent to 19 percent. This undercut a notable benefit of the China-Russia relationship for Beijing, wherein Russia could wield its prominence as an arms exporter to influence countries — like Vietnam — with which China has tense relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine has had far more drastic consequences for Russia. Western sanctions have had substantial impacts on the Russian economy. Russia’s GDP is expected to shrink by 8.5 percent in 2022 and unemployment is expected to rise substantially. Russia’s military losses in Ukraine are also staggering. In June 2022, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley stated that the Russian military had already lost roughly 20 to 30 percent of its armored force in Ukraine, which he described as a “huge” and “significant” loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Beijing has chosen to double down on its relationship with Russia despite these drawbacks. These developments nevertheless represent meaningful headaches for China. Russia is stagnating, and perhaps in outright decline, which could ultimately exacerbate existing mistrust between Beijing and Moscow and potentially render Russia of far less strategic value to China.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CSIS China Power Team</name></author><summary type="html">Russia’s war in Ukraine has cast a spotlight on the China-Russia relationship.

Yet this moment could be short-lived if not followed by a sustained, collective effort to transform and rationalize European defense.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Without this, additional European defense spending may be wasted and the continent will continue to rely on the United States for its defense. European nations should fully leverage the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other multilateral formats to overcome fragmentation and avoid a piecemeal approach to defense. By doing so, they can invest together in modern capabilities, build a strong, resilient, and open industrial base, and think creatively to pool and share forces. Importantly, the United States has a crucial role in providing both practical and political support to achieve this shared goal of a stronger and more capable European defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine has mobilized European nations to think more seriously about security and defense. In addition to sending an impressive surge of military equipment to Ukraine and making commitments at the Madrid summit to reinforce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) eastern flank with troops and materiel, the European Union also took new steps in its evolution as a credible defense actor. Perhaps most critically, European nations have also announced substantial increases to their defense budgets. A burst of political will — ignited by the invasion and fanned by its brutality — has fueled this response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are significant, but it would be premature to assume they mark the beginning of a new era. A true paradigm shift will require a sustained and focused effort to lock in the commitments that have already been made, ensure efficient implementation of those commitments, and build the institutional structure necessary to keep European defense moving in the desired direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-transformational-moment&quot;&gt;A Transformational Moment?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, European nations largely permitted their militaries to atrophy. The focus of military activity shifted from hypothetical conflict against a peer adversary to expeditionary operations focused on crisis management, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism. With the exception of the Balkans, these operations were also primarily out of area; the possibility of major war on the European continent appeared low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This began to change after the original Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Russia’s act of aggression catalyzed NATO’s European allies to commit at the Wales summit to meet the alliance’s target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. After decades of low-end operations, some European countries began the painful process of reconstituting their militaries for high-intensity warfare. On land, this has included a focus on rebuilding the readiness and aptitude of heavy, combat-capable brigades. At sea, it has included investments in principal surface combatants, submarines, amphibious vessels, and long-range strike, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After February 24, 2022, the argument for robust investment in the capabilities required for modern collective defense went from sensible to irrefutable. A Russian attack on a NATO member is no longer unthinkable. Indeed, NATO’s new strategic concept says as much: “We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As European security has become more perilous, U.S. attention has increasingly been pulled toward Asia. Despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Department of Defense has continued to prioritize China, which the unclassified summary of the forthcoming National Defense Strategy calls “our most consequential strategic competitor and the pacing challenge.” In other words, the U.S. pivot to the Indo-Pacific may have been paused or lessened in degree by events in Europe, but it has not been canceled. The need for the United States to provide precious military assets to defend Europe against Russia, support U.S. allies in Asia, and maintain other global commitments, such as in the Middle East, may put tremendous strain on the United States. Washington will therefore need more from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe seems on its way to stepping up to this challenge. There has been strong political will in Europe to take bolder steps, which has manifested in robust EU sanctions on Russia and support for Ukraine, including lethal and non-lethal aid and working to take in refugees — an area the European Union has found difficult in the past. The European Union’s recently released A Strategic Compass for Security and Defense signals a higher level of ambition for the bloc on foreign and security policy. In NATO, Europeans will contribute to troop reinforcements on the eastern flank, and two new European nations with highly capable militaries, Finland and Sweden, will join the strategic alliance. Most pertinently, the majority of European countries — from economic powerhouse Germany to tiny Luxembourg and neutral Ireland — have announced they will increase their defense budgets, opening the door to a potential future where Europe can theoretically afford to field the majority of the military capabilities necessary for its own self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The need for the United States to provide precious military assets to defend Europe against Russia, support U.S. allies in Asia, and maintain other global commitments, such as in the Middle East, may put tremendous strain on the United States. Washington will therefore need more from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sustaining-momentum&quot;&gt;Sustaining Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the opportunity for bold action on European defense will not remain forever. Europe has many other policy priorities: post-Covid economic recovery, migration, climate change and the energy transition, and tackling inflation, to name a few. Furthermore, although NATO has seen promising further rises in defense spending since 2014, many of the announcements made since February 24 have yet to be realized. In the short run, turning those announcements into budgetary commitments is how Europe can retain forward momentum. In the long run, while these new developments are encouraging, Europeans will still face many challenges to sustain that momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of declining defense budgets have led to a dramatic downsizing of European armed forces and generated major capability gaps. Competing national defense industries and diverging operational needs have also resulted in a deeply fragmented defense landscape where cooperative solutions are an exception, not the rule. Finally, endless debates on the need for, or the danger of, more European strategic autonomy have slowed down European ambitions and are still vivid today in the context of the war in Ukraine. Having a clear understanding of these limitations is critical as Europeans think about the future of their defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decades-of-underinvestment&quot;&gt;Decades of Underinvestment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent decisions in Europe to boost defense budgets represent good news but come after decades of budgetary cuts and anemic defense investment that has resulted in a major and lasting depreciation of European armed forces, especially compared to the Cold War period. Even though European partners started to increase their defense budgets again in 2015 (see Graph 1), primarily in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they had dug themselves an incredibly deep hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6rnoAz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, European militaries have lost 35 percent of their capabilities. To take the example of European navies, European countries had almost 200 large surface combatants and 129 submarines in 1990, but only 116 and 66, respectively, in 2021. Europe’s combat power at sea is considered to be about half of what it was during the height of the Cold War. Although often justified as favoring high-tech quality over quantity, reduced operational “mass” remains concerning. For example, the war in Ukraine suggests platforms remain vulnerable in high-intensity warfare. Russia itself might attest to this: according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Russian military may have lost 1,500 tanks, 3,600 armored vehicles, 750 artillery pieces, and 210 aircraft between the beginning of the invasion and the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declining military investments have also led to major capability gaps. As witnessed with military engagements in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and the Sahel, European armed forces are still relying on U.S. support for critical enablers such as air-to-air refueling, strategic airlift, and reconnaissance and intelligence capacities. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was a sobering demonstration of these limitations, as European states were incapable of evacuating their own citizens and allies without logistical support from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine offers another example of such constraints: European states have struggled to supply Ukraine with needed heavy weaponry. So far, the United States has provided most of the military assistance to Ukraine, demonstrated most recently by the adoption of a massive $40 billion support package. While Europeans have stepped up militarily, restricted stocks of equipment and ammunition are limiting their support, especially as they also have to maintain national militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-fragmented-defense-landscape&quot;&gt;A Fragmented Defense Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not simply that European countries are spending too little on defense, but also that they are doing so in a piecemeal way. In fact, overall European military spending is not that low. In 2020, for example, Europe collectively spent $378 billion on defense (roughly half of total U.S. defense spending). Yet, different strategic cultures and competing defense industries have led European governments to prioritize national solutions at the expense of collective projects. As recently underlined by the European Defense Agency, EU countries conducted only 11 percent of their total equipment procurement in a European framework in 2020. This share is well below the 25 percent share reached in 2011 and far short of the commitment member states made in 2017 to reach 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of joint procurement has resulted in a fragmented defense landscape. European armed forces suffer major redundancies, with 29 different types of destroyers, 17 types of main battle tanks, and 20 types of fighter planes, as compared to four, one, and six, respectively, for the United States. Some European countries have managed to develop joint platforms in the past, such as the A400M military transport aircraft, the Eurofighter combat aircraft, and the Tiger attack helicopter. But even these collaborative programs have not necessarily led to a rationalization of European capabilities. For instance, because of diverging operational requirements, the Tiger helicopter has been developed in four different models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has revealed another limitation of the European defense industrial base: the attrition of its military industrial capacity. Decades of declining defense budgets have led European countries to sacrifice scale for efficiency. As a result, they have struggled to respond to Ukraine’s needs due to limited stockpiles and slow production capacities. European defense industries are also facing vulnerable supply chains, showcased by the Covid-19 pandemic, with a growing dependence on critical raw materials from international sources, including China, for certain sectors, as NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned at the Madrid summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-clear-political-consensus&quot;&gt;No Clear Political Consensus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are major political obstacles to rationalizing European defense. What should amount to a largely practical and pragmatic effort often descends into an ideological squabble over “strategic autonomy” or national sovereignty. Bureaucratic turf wars erupt between ministries of defense, NATO, and the European Union over roles and responsibilities. National defense industries also each have their privileged place within national capitals and push for their interests, which are often at odds with creating a more integrated European defense landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can also play an obstructive role. Many European countries are reliant on U.S. security guarantees, giving the United States tremendous influence over the direction of European security. The United States is often a vocal opponent of European defense industrial initiatives focused on integration, as they benefit European companies to the detriment of the U.S. defense industry. Moreover, the United States has opposed EU defense efforts, fearing that NATO, and therefore the United States, would lose its pride of place in the European security architecture. This has led to a recitation by many in the United States that there should be “no duplication” of NATO by the European Union. Yet concerns over “duplication” can be treated so broadly as to risk erasing any role for the European Union in defense when it in fact can play a crucial role in fostering integration, mobilizing resources, and coordinating investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also clear strategic differences within Europe. European ambitions on security and defense have often been hampered by political debates surrounding notions of European “strategic autonomy” or “sovereignty.” These often passionate discussions reveal that European states disagree on the urgency for Europe to become capable of defending itself alone. There is a looming prospect of a future U.S. administration returning to an “America First” policy that relegates European security and multilateral institutions such as NATO. Paradoxically, the leadership position assumed by the United States since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has weakened the movement toward more European autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These disputes have resulted in a Europe which still relies too much on Washington to ensure its security and defense. In a recent study called the European Sovereignty Index, the European Council on Foreign Relations underlines that “the state of European security and defense sovereignty leaves much to be desired, especially in countries seeing U.S. security guarantees as their “main form of life insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blueprint-for-the-next-decade&quot;&gt;A Blueprint for the Next Decade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges to transforming European defense can be overcome. The level of ambition laid out in recent strategic documents, such as the European Union’s “Strategic Compass” and NATO’s new strategic concept, provides the requisite conceptual foundation. Practically speaking, this begins with following through on the defense spending pledges already made, but long-term success will require an ambitious vision to rationalize European defense, streamline its many national and intergovernmental processes, eliminate redundancies, and maximize efficiency. If Europe fails to do so, it will not get full value for its investments. Charting a few key lines of effort is a useful place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toward-joint-planning-in-europe&quot;&gt;Toward Joint Planning in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two levels of defense planning in Europe: national and multinational. At the national level, countries regularly produce defense strategies, which set out their national priorities for defense investment. At the multinational level, the two main efforts are NATO’s defense planning process (NDPP) and the European Union’s capability development process, which involves several institutions but is led by the European Defence Agency (EDA). Both identify military capability gaps and develop procurement plans to fill them. While there is some degree of synchronization between them — “ensuring the coherence and complementarity of each other’s defence planning processes” has been a goal of EU-NATO cooperation since at least 2016 — it has not been sufficient to prevent the fragmentation and duplication discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new approach that better aligns these processes and emphasizes joint development of capabilities is needed, especially for those most relevant for collective defense. The EDA is currently reviewing its Capability Development Plan, which was last updated in 2018. Promisingly, it will reportedly emphasize high-intensity warfighting scenarios and include guidance on working with NATO. This is notable, as the next NDPP cycle will likely begin next year now that the political guidance from the new strategic concept has been set. This moment of simultaneous review represents an opportunity. Although existing EU-NATO formats already endeavor to “ensure the coherence of output” between the two processes by exchanging information, coordination could be more proactive, perhaps even creating mechanisms for jointly identifying potential projects, in conversation with national ministries and defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-europes-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Strengthening Europe’s Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sustain an ambitious investment strategy, Europe needs to take a more strategic approach to its defense industrial base. The challenges in sustaining military assistance to Ukraine have shown why European force planning should drive the development of its industrial base, for example, to ensure sufficient stockpiles of weapons and spare parts. This should also include ramping up limited defense manufacturing capacities. In the short term, Europeans could mobilize their civilian industry to help support the defense sector; France aims to do so by emulating the U.S. Defense Priorities and Allocations System Program. In the medium term, the European Union should invest in advanced manufacturing, from robotics to nanotechnologies to advanced materials technologies. In the longer term, they should also encourage industrial alliances or even integration to rationalize production capacity, as France and the United Kingdom have pursued in the missile sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states also need to strengthen supply chain resilience. First, they should seek to diversify their supply of raw materials and components by collectively identifying alternative suppliers or substitutions. Second, the European Union should invest in domestic production of critical components, starting with semiconductors. In February 2022, the European Commission announced the European Chips Act, which aims to substantially increase chip production. Finally, the European Union should consider joint purchasing for the most critical raw materials to help create collective strategic reserves, which it already does for gas. Facing similar challenges, the United States and European Union should deepen their coordination on supply chain resilience using recent transatlantic working groups such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and the U.S.-EU dialogue on security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The challenges in sustaining military assistance to Ukraine have shown why European force planning should drive the development of its industrial base, for example, to ensure sufficient stockpiles of weapons and spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic coordination is also required to build the strong and sustainable defense and technology industrial base needed to underpin the long-term strategic advantage of NATO and the European Union. There are several fissures in transatlantic defense industrial policy that have the potential to, as one recent CEPS study puts it, “sorely undermine transatlantic unity.” These include Europe’s tendency to excessively buy non-European equipment, the controversial issue of non-EU third-party participation in joint EU capability initiatives, and export, technology, and intellectual property controls on both sides of the Atlantic that risk creating competing, rather than complementary, industrial bases. These potential pitfalls need to be addressed if the Euro-Atlantic community is to maintain the open, thriving ecosystem of technology and innovation it needs to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;catalyzing-joint-development-and-procurement&quot;&gt;Catalyzing Joint Development and Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many European countries have decided to raise defense spending in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, there are concerns that this will not translate into coordinated and coherent investments. This is where the European Union has an instrumental role to play in encouraging its members to jointly develop and procure defense capabilities. Fortunately, EU countries have already created promising tools to foster such a collaborative approach, such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation and the European Defense Fund, which has been allocated €8 billion ($8.3 billion) for 2021 to 2027. The European Commission has also recently announced an even more innovative program of €500 million ($507 million) to incentivize EU members to pursue joint procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU countries should not only fully leverage these tools but also expand their financial scope given the huge needs going forward. The €8 billion defense fund and the €500 million joint procurement program are a good start but are clearly insufficient to answer the immense investment needs. Furthermore, the joint procurement program still needs to get off the ground. Following the model of the €750 billion ($760.5 billion) Next Generation EU recovery plan, the European Commission could borrow on capital markets to either support collaborative investments or pursue joint procurements on behalf of member states. NATO’s common funding and new innovation fund could also contribute these much-needed investments. Increasing NATO’s common funding was discussed in the leadup to the Madrid summit but had limited follow-through in the strategic concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These coordinated investments should focus on high-end capabilities, building on existing projects such as a 15-nation effort to develop a new ground-based air defense system by 2028, the French-German-Spanish next-generation fighter program, and the Italian-led project to develop a new armored fighting vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-creatively-to-pool-and-share-forces&quot;&gt;Thinking Creatively to Pool and Share Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potential avenue for rationalizing European defense is via initiatives that pool and share national forces under a multinational command. A few examples can already be found in Europe. One of the oldest is the Benelux naval integration, under which the Belgian and Dutch navies operate under the commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy, who receives the title of Admiral Benelux. Another example is the European Air Transport Command (EATC), a program under which seven Western European countries pool military air mobility assets for air transport and air-to-air refueling under a single joint command. The new Franco-German tactical air transport squadron will fly missions for the EATC. Countries benefit from these arrangements in situations where their individual capacities are insufficient to meet some threshold for reliable operational success. These initiatives also increase interoperability through joint training and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts may seem niche and technical, but in fact represent a symbolic concession in a core area of national sovereignty. In these cases, as when they commit troops to NATO operations, nations decide if the security benefits outweigh any political costs. It should be noted that this concept is not new: the European Union has championed “pooling and sharing” since 2012, while NATO has focused on “Smart Defence” to achieve “greater security, for less money, by working together with more flexibility.” Both initiatives have had mixed results. Nonetheless, European countries should make a concerted effort, perhaps led by defense planners at the NATO or EU level, to explore new initiatives along these lines. Any new arrangements could constitute a new tool in NATO’s tool kit. In order to make this happen, European governments may have to make the strategic case to their own citizens that a trade-off in terms of sovereignty is worth the associated cost savings and the likely increase of overall European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-push-from-washington&quot;&gt;A Push from Washington?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If European defense is to be rationalized along some of these lines, the United States will need to play a critical role. For years, the United States has led a cadre of European nations that are critical or at least skeptical of EU ambitions to increase its capacity as a defense actor. The main fear has been the “Three Ds” of “decoupling, duplication, and discrimination.” Essentially, the United States and others are worried that unfettered EU defense and security initiatives could siphon resources and attention away from NATO. This fear of decoupling and duplication still manifests in many major documents, such as the most recent progress report on EU-NATO cooperation or the new NATO strategic concept. The fear of discrimination is present in debates about divergence in the transatlantic industrial base and the alleged exclusion of third parties from joint capability and procurement initiatives. It is time to rethink some of these assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most would agree that it is in the U.S. interest for Europe to be able to defend itself to the greatest degree possible without a large U.S. military commitment. As the late Madeline Albright wrote: “Our interest is clear: we want a Europe that can act. We want a Europe with modern, flexible military forces that are capable of putting out fires in Europe’s backyard and working with us through the alliance to defend our common interests. European efforts to do more for Europe’s own defence make it easier, not harder, for us to remain engaged.” America’s recipe for getting this done was to focus on “enhancing the practical capabilities Europe brings to our alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this focus on the practical over the political led to a paradox in European defense: progress on practical capabilities could only go so far in the absence of political support for their development and use. The capability gaps, fragmentation, and inefficiencies in European defense are as much due to political imperatives — to avoid the “Three Ds” — as they are down to insufficient investment, modernization, and institutional initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore time for the Biden administration, and future administrations, to find a new recipe for transforming European defense to achieve Albright’s goal of “a Europe that can act.” Several questions can serve as a starting point. First, how can the United States help Europe generate the practical capabilities and political support it needs to defend itself? This could be done through several avenues including NATO, the European Union, and mini- and bilateral frameworks, but it must be coordinated and consistent. Second, how can a balance be struck between the risk of duplication versus the risk of fragmentation and capability gaps? Third, what is the role of the European Union in stepping up as an engine of joint procurement for the most vital and expensive systems and high-end capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stronger-more-capable-european-defense&quot;&gt;A Stronger, More Capable European Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent the last decade urging European states to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. Now that European partners are spending more, the United States should become the most forceful advocate for transforming European defense. The United States’ role as the key guarantor of European security puts it in a privileged position. This is especially true for the most vulnerable NATO allies on the eastern flank, all of whom are also EU members and therefore in a position to block or water down EU initiatives. It follows that Washington’s support for EU defense proposals can play a major role in determining their fate. After years of urging European allies to spend more on defense, a new diplomatic initiative is needed that does not waste the urgency that Russia’s war in Ukraine created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington should encourage European countries to leverage the European Union, NATO, and other, flexible formats to rationalize the fragmented defense and industrial landscape by investing together in modern capabilities, building a strong and resilient industrial base, and thinking creatively to pool and share forces. To make this happen, the United States must provide practical and political support, including through encouraging the European Union’s ambitions and assuring eastern allies that those ambitions do not reduce U.S. commitment to their defense through NATO — which, it should be noted, the European Union’s own strategic compass still recognizes as the “foundation of collective defence for its [EU] members.” When combined with some of the initiatives proposed above, this active support from the United States could kickstart a new era of European defense and achieve the shared goal of “a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PNG presents unique operating challenges for the U.S. government’s implementation teams&lt;/strong&gt; due to the complex factors driving fragility in the country and limited U.S. government presence on the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key challenge facing policymakers is to generate clarity and consensus&lt;/strong&gt; on what factors of fragility the United States will address, how the United States will develop a bespoke operating model in PNG, and who will be critical to these efforts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/policymakers-guide-global-fragility-act&quot;&gt;Global Fragility Act&lt;/a&gt; (GFA) was signed into U.S. law in 2019. In April 2022, the Biden administration identified Papua New Guinea (PNG) as a partner country in a prologue it added to the 2020 U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-fragility-strategy-gets-refresh&quot;&gt;Global Fragility Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (GFS). Under the strategy, the United States has committed to at least 10 years of programmatic efforts aimed at lowering violence levels and enhancing conflict-prevention efforts in PNG. U.S. officials have indicated they intend to benefit from “lessons learned from decades of U.S. involvement overseas, to enhance the way the U.S. Government engages in challenging environments and to jointly build resilience against political, economic, and natural shocks.” The distinguishing feature of the GFS is its express intention to expand U.S. focus on preventing fragility, violence, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief provides policymakers with ideas on how to deploy U.S. conflict-prevention and peacebuilding capabilities in PNG. It outlines the strategic importance of PNG in the broader region, then canvasses four fragility trends to watch before discussing how to leverage U.S. strengths and avoid the pitfalls of those who have long operated in PNG. The brief concludes with recommendations on how to create a bespoke GFA operating model for addressing fragility focused on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cultivating a deliberate and adaptive planning process;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embracing a localized and partnership-based implementation approach;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fostering the right enabling environment; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leveraging U.S. comparative advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-importance-of-papua-new-guinea&quot;&gt;Strategic Importance of Papua New Guinea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is one of the most biodiverse countries on earth. It is as diverse geographically — consisting of mountains, jungles, and valleys — as it is ethnically and linguistically. PNG is rich in gold, copper, silver, natural gas, timber, oil, and fisheries, bringing distinct economic opportunities not always available to the other Pacific Island states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG has shown remarkable resilience despite much international analysis and discourse (including in this brief) focusing on the factors contributing to its fragility. For example, although the 1988–98 Bougainville civil war resulted in an estimated 20,000 deaths, PNG navigated a predominately peaceful independence referendum for the autonomous region of Bougainville in November 2019 (see textbox). Despite extremely high levels of corruption and violence, its civil society discusses, reports on, and circulates instances of corruption and violence with significant energy and freedom — particularly through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While PNG does not have an extensive breadth or depth of civil society organizations (CSOs), those that exist provide avenues for engagement with the government and, if appropriately empowered, can generate better governance outcomes. Dialogues such as the 2021 forum on gender and human rights bring together government, civil society, and advocacy groups to assess the successes, failures, and opportunities for advancing human development in PNG. Civil society groups also fill in critical gaps in service delivery. Churches, for example, provide around 50 percent of healthcare services and independently operate two universities. Additionally, while PNG’s growing youth population brings significant employment and education challenges, it is also a great opportunity for a new generation to lead the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is strategically relevant to the United States and its allies, Australia in particular. Its status as Australia’s closest neighbor and its history as a former colony and site of Allied cooperation against Japanese forces during World War II means that it holds a place in both the strategic and nostalgic imaginations of many Australians and Americans who served in the Pacific theater. Australia is the single largest donor working in PNG and has been regarded by many U.S. administrations as key to engagement in Melanesia and the Pacific Islands, especially given the relatively light U.S. footprint in the region. While it was resoundingly rejected by many Australians and regional leaders at the time, the mid-2000s image of Australian prime minister Howard as “Washington’s deputy sheriff” in the Pacific was a prevailing notion for years. Even now, there is a sense in some Australian foreign policy circles that signs of increased fragility in places like PNG do not reflect well on Australia’s role in the country or region. It is easy to imagine that Australia would welcome increased U.S. focus on PNG and opportunities to collaborate on, among other things, violent conflict prevention programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG is strategically relevant to the United States and its allies, Australia in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is also a destination for Australian and U.S. businesses and is increasingly a place where rival geostrategic interests meet. Chinese communities have long been present in PNG, but recent fear of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expansionism in the region has put it on the radar of U.S. and Australian officials, especially after the recent Solomon Islands–CCP security pact sent shockwaves through Washington and Canberra alike. Meanwhile, the ongoing process of Bougainvillean independence and the possibility of similar movements from other provinces suggest significant potential for fragmentation within PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;independence-and-autonomy-movements&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Independence and Autonomy Movements&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In November 2019, Bougainville held a referendum on whether residents wanted greater autonomy or full independence from PNG. Nearly 98 percent of voters chose independence, with at least 85 percent voter turnout. This historic event on the island, located nearly 600 miles east of Port Moresby, comes after decades of unrest and displacement. Tensions over control of the island’s natural resources escalated into what became known as the Bougainville civil war, which lasted from 1988–98 and was the most violent conflict in the South Pacific since World War II. As many as 20,000 people died, many were displaced, and social services in Bougainville were disrupted. The Bougainville Peace Agreement that marked the end of the war stipulated that an independence referendum would be held 10–15 years after the first Autonomous Bougainville Government was elected in June 2005. While it was successfully and peacefully executed, the referendum vote is nonbinding, and leadership from both sides will have to negotiate a final agreement, which could take years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similar movements exist in the New Ireland, Enga, and East New Britain provinces, which have called for greater autonomy for over a decade. Shared grievances over the national government’s mismanagement of natural resources and failure to deliver public services have increased the prevalence of regional and provincial fragmentation. While there is no imminent threat of violence, the political legitimacy of these sentiments could generate greater factionalization throughout the country. It could also give prominence to political elites who exploit them to mobilize voters and create opportunities for geostrategic competitors to exert greater influence in newly formed nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a PNG that is increasingly poor, susceptible to foreign interference, and fragile is a stark reality for Australia. Taken to its most extreme, fragility in PNG might precipitate external intervention—just as Australia intervened in the Solomon Islands Regional Assistance Mission for a decade following civil unrest — and could also shift the balance of power in Melanesia against U.S. and allied interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the proximity of the Pacific Island nations to vital trade routes and relevance to U.S. and allied security assets, PNG’s strategic profile is only growing. This is evident in the recent shift in rhetoric, funding commitments, high-level visits, and partnership-led tone of engagement by Australia’s new Albanese government, which is echoed by a significant uptick in the attention Washington has paid to the Pacific Islands since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-fragility-trends-in-papua-new-guinea&quot;&gt;Four Fragility Trends in Papua New Guinea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG gained its independence from Australia in September 1975 after roughly seven decades of colonial rule. In the years leading up to independence, a Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) was tasked with recommending priorities and mechanisms of implementation for an eventual PNG constitution. Following comprehensive, countrywide consultations, in August 1974 the CPC released its report, which recommended an endogenous state- and nation-building process, prioritizing human development over economic growth. The 350-page report specified rights and freedoms and established five national goals and directive principles to achieve a free and just society in PNG. However, the constitution that was adopted in August 1975 was a watered-down version of the unique, autochthonous features of governance the CPC proposed. Instead, the new government approved a “conventional Westminster-type constitution,” choosing to avoid contentious issues of citizenship and decentralization. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this did not translate into the nation-building process that many envisioned. This history contributes to the modern state of PNG not enjoying a high degree of legitimacy with its citizens — who, in turn, have only limited access to inclusive channels for engaging with the state. Democratic governance principles are not institutionalized, and legacies of colonialism linger, contributing to a general downward trend of instability and insecurity in PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief focuses on four phenomena that are simultaneously the cause and result of shortcomings in PNG’s development and the current dynamics of fragility. These include: (1) weak governance, (2) economic inequality, (3) vulnerability to climate change and limited adaptive capacity, and (4) intercommunal and gender-based violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weak-governance&quot;&gt;Weak Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak governance in PNG is a barrier to meaningful participation in civic life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past several decades, the tenets of personal and collective wellbeing envisioned by the CPC report — and engrained in the Melanesian concept of gutpela sindaun — have been replaced by a political-economic system that has proven corrupt and whereby citizens, especially women and youth, cannot fully engage in sociopolitical affairs. A 2019 survey across six provinces of PNG revealed few citizens felt that they had “a lot of influence” over government decisionmaking at the national and local levels. Disempowerment was especially acute among women, who felt that patriarchal views and systemic gender inequality preclude their representation in leadership positions and engagement with political representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Papua New Guinean state makes it difficult for citizens to interact with national, provincial, and local-level governments. The diverse physical and human geography of PNG makes the functions of a central government uniquely difficult. PNG consists of the main island and 600 offshore islands, with a population of about nine million people who speak more than 800 languages and make up about 600 distinct tribes. The 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Government and Local Level Government and its amendments instituted a model of decentralization whereby provincial and local-level governments were allocated budgets to fund and deliver public services. In principle, such a decentralized state facilitates citizen empowerment and development from the bottom up — especially considering the strong Melanesian traditions of consensus, reciprocity, and the harmonization of diversity. However, this technical and largely top-down process has failed to establish mechanisms for accountability and community participation, particularly ones that leverage the country’s latent dynamism. As a result, local governments have limited capacity, weak accountability mechanisms, funding gaps, and unqualified staff, making public administration primed for corruption and capturable by political elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG consists of the main island and 600 offshore islands, with a population of about nine million people who speak more than 800 languages and make up about 600 distinct tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women face additional barriers to participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Women are historically underrepresented in Papua New Guinean politics and public administration. Since independence in 1975, only seven women have been elected to PNG’s National Parliament. Although 167 female candidates are running in the 2022 elections, as of publication in August 2022, two female representatives have been confirmed in office. Additionally, women hold only 24 percent of administrative positions in national public service; that portion further decreases to 7 percent at the executive-appointment level. At the provincial and subnational levels, women’s representation in public service is marginal, accounting for zero executive-level appointments, 6 percent of senior management, and only 10 percent of middle management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both institutional and cultural barriers to women’s participation in government. There is no quota to ensure women are elected to the national legislature. Each one of several attempts to institutionalize women holding political office failed, most recently in March 2022, when a proposal to have 5 parliamentary seats out of 111 reserved for women was shelved until after the August general elections. PNG’s patriarchal society and gender norms, which colonial administrations reinforced, also limit women’s political participation and institutional seniority. Threats of divorce, public shame, harassment, and physical violence prevent women from exercising political agency. Elections are also highly localized and personalized; political candidates must bargain for support among those who control voting blocs through patronage networks. Since women are mostly excluded from leadership hierarchies in the first place, they often lack the resources and networks to negotiate support among local leaders. Political and public administration systems favor so-called “big men” who cultivate patronage networks, reinforcing citizens’ association of political authority with men and view of leadership as a masculine trait. The disparity in women’s engagement in sociopolitical systems and processes reinforces the conditions under which gender equality and gender-based violence (discussed in more detail below) persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak governance and limited capacity hinder the state’s provision of security and broader services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Governance limitations have increasingly manifested in the inability of the state to provide safety in the face of growing intercommunal violence nationwide. In Hela Province in the highlands, for example, a land dispute in January 2021 between two relatives led to the deaths of 21 people. At the time, there were only about 60 permanent police officers in the province, which has a population of approximately 250,000 people. The July 2022 death tolls from election-related assaults suggest intercommunal violence trends continue. This comes at a time when law enforcement is chronically underfunded, inadequately resourced, and understaffed across the country. Nationally, the police force has only grown by 30 percent to about 7,400 staff since PNG’s independence in 1975 while its population has more than tripled. Limited institutional capacity, combined with the absence of community-based policing capabilities, undermines public trust in the government and lessens the visibility of the state in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With police forces being overstretched, private security actors are an increasingly ubiquitous part of efforts to maintain stability in certain regions. These companies are often employed by businesses, community leaders, and politicians. Some government officials have significant interests in this industry, including as a source of personal revenue and employment for constituents. The official number of private security personnel is over three times that of police officers and surpasses the sum of all security sector forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, government effectiveness is unequal and limited across PNG, with the reach of the state being practically undetectable in some rural areas and highland regions, despite 87 percent of the total population living in such communities. The country’s fragile health systems, limited access to and quality of education, and low literacy levels are barriers to developing local capacity to deliver and monitor service provision. Yet another colonial legacy is uneven and underdeveloped access to educational opportunities in PNG, with girls being highly underrepresented and several districts having very low participation rates. This reinforces the conditions under which citizens cannot cultivate human capital, achieve upward social mobility, and practice active citizenship. Without these opportunities, citizens often look to traditional systems over the formal state for governance functions and public services. These conditions also create a permissive environment for corrupt elites to act against the public good in pursuit of their interests, at times cynically perpetuating narratives that young and poor populations and the country’s political immaturity, rather than their corruption, contribute to gaps in state governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systemic corruption limits inclusive and sustainable development, fuels distrust and frustration with political leadership, and generates apathy toward political participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Papua New Guinean state is marred by endemic corruption, lack of accountability, and the privatization of security, all of which benefit the elite to the exclusion of the general public. Although the constitution provides a legal framework for government structures at all levels, de facto national authority revolves around clientelism. Across the archipelago, most Papua New Guineans identify closely with their local communities and use the wantok (“one talk”) system of reciprocal obligations among people who share a common language, ethnicity, or community. While this system can be a resilient safety net that compensates for insufficient governance and inadequate state services, politicians have also exploited it to serve their interests. Elected officials routinely use their power to capture and disperse state resources toward their narrow constituencies in exchange for political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Global Corruption Barometer found that 54 percent of Papua New Guineans paid a bribe to receive a public service in the previous 12 months and that 57 percent were offered bribes for their votes. Frequent turnover among politicians and government officials compounds the highly personalized, “short-termism” nature of PNG politics, making what many consider to be bribery a highly normalized part of cultivating a voter base. Systemic, increasingly sophisticated, and entrenched corruption at all levels of government reinforces the conditions under which citizens are excluded from providing input and oversight on essential state functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-inequality&quot;&gt;Economic Inequality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resource-based wealth is not widely distributed, and poor human development outcomes stunt the potential for women and youth to boost economic growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; At a macroeconomic level, PNG’s positive economic trajectory and resource-rich environment suggest strong potential for international investment and engagement. In 2022, PNG’s economy is expected to grow by 4 percent, driven largely by the industries sector, which accounts for about 43 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). However, wealth and economic opportunities are concentrated among the country’s elites, who habitually engage in rent-seeking behavior by facilitating grants and contracts for foreign companies, particularly in the extractive industries sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG has one of the highest levels of economic inequality in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, recovery in employment has been slower for the bottom 40 percent of households, and those with jobs have seen a significant share of their incomes fall. Profits from mining deposits and natural-gas reserves maintain the country’s middle-income status but are unevenly distributed and rarely enjoyed by average citizens. Foreign-owned businesses and corrupt officials are significant benefactors of the profits of these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG has one of the highest levels of economic inequality in Asia and the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extractive industries have long caused friction and contributed to fragility in PNG. One of the most notable examples is the conflict between PNG and the Bougainville region described in the textbox above. Land disputes and environmental degradation caused by the Panguna copper and gold mine and uneven distribution of the mine’s profits significantly contributed to the outbreak of the 10-year civil war. Tensions still simmer in Bougainville, and its connections to the central government in Port Moresby remain tenuous at best. Mines throughout PNG continue to fuel disputes over land rights and profit distribution, environmental damage wrought by their activities, extractive profiteering of international companies, and the limited economic benefits reaped by local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutional economic challenges are significant, especially for women and youth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These include low domestic resource mobilization, subpar human development outcomes, and limited economic growth outside the extractive resource sector. PNG’s 2019 Human Development Index score was 0.555, ranking it 155 out of 189 countries and territories. Relatedly, PNG’s 2019 Gender Inequality Index score was 0.725, ranking it 161 out of 162 countries. As detailed in the governance-focused section above, Papua New Guinean women are marginalized and excluded from the formal economy because of cultural customs and colonial legacies, which are reinforced by weak institutions, poor public service delivery, and the lack of gender-sensitive policy implementation. These conditions perpetuate health, education, and employment disparities that lead to unequal opportunities for men and women and limit overall economic growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor economic conditions are particularly acute for women in agriculture and for urban youth. Papua New Guinean women are overrepresented in the informal and agricultural sectors, which have both been significantly affected by the pandemic; this will undoubtedly deepen economic gender inequalities. Globally, only 4 in 10 women in fragile settings are formally employed, leaving the majority more vulnerable to economic shocks. Women engaged in unpaid labor are consistently excluded from social protection measures targeted at the formal workforce, and with limited avenues for skills development, they are left with few options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of youth in the population of PNG is large and growing: 31 percent of the population is between the ages of 10 and 24, and 62 percent is between 15 and 64. In urban areas, 60 percent of youth are unemployed, and less than 7 percent are employed in formal jobs. Young people, especially young women, transitioning from childhood to adulthood have less personal agency because they rarely participate in community decision-making processes and have limited access to educational and vocation opportunities, yet are still expected to find formal work in the modern economy. In the absence of formal social safety nets and the informal protections wantoks provide, the growing urban youth population could be an indicator — though not a precondition — of civil unrest and political violence. Disengagement and discontent can lead to increased youth involvement in criminal activity, especially if social protections, educational pathways, and economic opportunities remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant international research shows that youth and women’s empowerment can be drivers of overall economic development, so these challenges — and PNG’s ability to overcome them — are foundational to the country’s development and resilience. Minimizing gaps in human-capital development, including expanding health services and continuing education, could cultivate a skilled workforce that is less vulnerable to economic shocks. Additionally, improving access to production inputs and financial services could shift imbalances in decision-making and create new business opportunities. In particular, a young, educated, and empowered workforce could bring new investment opportunities, creating a virtuous cycle of formal employment. With 67 percent of businesses in PNG identifying crime as a constraint for further investment and expansion in 2014, there are both public and private incentives to improve livelihoods and opportunities for women and youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PNG government aims to address some of these institutional issues by transitioning to a fully industrialized economy, using evocative slogans such as “Take Back PNG.” At the same time, foreign actors are seeking regional influence through political and economic investments. In June 2022, Papua New Guinean prime minister James Marape and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi announced a potential free trade agreement. This development follows PNG becoming the second Pacific Island country to sign onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2018. In 2019, China imported seafood, wood, and mineral products from the region (including PNG), amounting to about $3.3 billion in trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-to-climate-change-and-limited-adaptive-capacity&quot;&gt;Vulnerability to Climate Change and Limited Adaptive Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNG’s agriculture-based economy is highly vulnerable to climate change, and women are likely to be disproportionately affected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Two sectors dominate the Papua New Guinean economy: (1) subsistence agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for the majority of informal employment; and (2) the minerals and energy extraction sector, which accounts for most export earnings and GDP. These sectors are highly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate-related disasters, including floods, droughts, and landslides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG ranks 22 out of 191 countries on the 2022 European Union’s INFORM Risk index; in other words, it is high on the list of countries at risk of humanitarian crises and disasters that could overwhelm national response capacity. PNG’s resilience to potential climate change–related disruptions is low. With highly dispersed populations that are often remote, accessing communities and assessing damage in the event of a natural disaster is extremely challenging. Moreover, the prevalence of poverty, poor infrastructure, corruption, and insecurity — among other factors of fragility — heighten local populations’ vulnerability to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As with most places, climate change disproportionately affects women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Female labor participation in PNG is concentrated in rural work, mainly in subsistence agriculture rather than commercial farming. More than 50 percent of the female labor force is engaged in unpaid agricultural work. In addition to ensuring their families’ nutritional needs are met, women are involved in growing, harvesting, and selling crops. While selling this food in local or urban markets generates some income, women lack opportunities to engage in the more lucrative production and export of cash crops (such as coffee and cocoa) and intensive forms of agriculture because of the familial and community roles they are expected to fulfill. Because of women’s reliance on informal agricultural production, their means of food and economic security are increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, women’s coping capacity is limited because of gender-specific barriers to accessing fixed and financial assets. Although women traditionally have access to customary land — which comprises 97 percent of PNG’s land area — this does not always extend to having ownership and decisionmaking power over the use of that land: Only 1 percent of women in PNG report being the main decisionmaker at home. Additionally, PNG has the highest gender gap in financial inclusion in the Pacific region, with women being 29 percent less likely to access formal financial services. The gap in control over land and finance means that women are more dependent on natural resources even as they have limited agency to adapt to climate change–related threats to those resources and cope when natural disasters strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Women are more dependent on natural resources even as they have limited agency to adapt to climate change–related threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, women have strong knowledge in sustainable resource management and disaster mitigation within their communities. Integrating climate considerations into gender programming — and gender considerations into climate-adaptation work — is critical to identifying and addressing the specific vulnerabilities women face in PNG. Ensuring women’s equal access to assets, information, and services can also increase the coping capacity and decisionmaking powers necessary for climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intercommunal-and-gender-based-violence&quot;&gt;Intercommunal and Gender-Based Violence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intercommunal and gender-based violence (GBV) are both symptoms and causes of state fragility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; PNG has hundreds of ethnolinguistic groups, and research shows a long history of conflicts among them, typically over land ownership since 97 percent of the land in PNG is customarily owned. These conflicts have typically been managed and resolved through traditional mechanisms, such as village courts, which were seen as legitimate channels to address perceived wrongdoing in many communities. However, as PNG modernizes, traditional rules and customs surrounding conflict and violence are eroding; elders and authorities who once held power in their communities have seen their influence diminish over time. This has, in turn, reduced the capacity of traditional means to resolve contemporary conflicts in PNG. Rather than invoking culture as a legitimate and often singular explanation for violence in PNG (as is often the case), the authors of this brief suggest that the structural and institutional shortcomings discussed above are more significant drivers of fragility and conflict in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of traditional conflict-resolution systems coincides with other trends such as shifting gender roles, increased foreign involvement, the influx of smuggled modern firearms, and climate variability. The interaction between these dynamics has led to increased violence and the displacement of tens of thousands of people. Approximately 30,000 people were displaced in 2021 alone due to communal violence, triggering further conflict between resettled populations and host communities despite strong cultural norms of shared land use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rather than invoking culture as a legitimate and often singular explanation for violence in PNG (as is often the case), the authors of this brief suggest that the structural and institutional shortcomings discussed above are more significant drivers of fragility and conflict in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercommunal conflict in PNG coincides with interpersonal violence, particularly gender-based, sexual, and family violence. Here culture and changing traditions do play a role. Intercommunal conflicts, once fought primarily between men, now increasingly target women and children. More than two-thirds of women in PNG are victims of domestic violence, and one woman is beaten every 30 seconds. Additionally, violence related to sorcery accusations against men and women is increasingly prevalent. Domestic violence has also increased during the Covid-19 pandemic: Between March 2020 and April 2021, the national helpline for those experiencing family violence or sexual violence, “1-Tok Kaunselin Lain,” saw a 75 percent increase in demand. This aligns with global trends, where emerging data shows that Covid-19 has resulted in an increase in cases of gender-based and domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are movements within PNG to address GBV, including the government’s National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender Based Violence 2016–2025, which aims to coordinate anti-GBV efforts across the country, and the 2002 Sexual Offences and Crimes Against Children Act. These efforts, while important, have had limited impact due to weak state capacity to enforce them. Even when cases of domestic violence are reported, very few are investigated. As of 2020, there were only 150 staff in the police force’s Family and Sexual Violence Unit across the whole country. Meanwhile, of 15,444 cases of domestic violence reported in 2020, only 250 people were prosecuted and fewer than 100 were convicted. The police force, lacking the resources to properly support survivors of GBV, relies on partnerships with non-governmental organizations to fill this gap in service provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-strengths-and-avoiding-pitfalls-in-a-challenging-environment&quot;&gt;Leveraging Strengths and Avoiding Pitfalls in a Challenging Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous section indicates, there is significant potential for the United States to address a broad range of fragility factors over the medium-to-long term via the Global Fragility Strategy (GFS). To do this effectively, the United States should be clear-eyed on the challenges ahead, six of which are presented below. It should be deliberate in deciding how to address them and cognizant of its unique capability to deliver on its GFS mission in PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;six-challenges-in-focus&quot;&gt;Six Challenges in Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ideal circumstances, the United States could deploy the GFS’s whole-of-government strategy and trust that its execution stays true to the mission. But lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, combined with the complex operating environment in PNG, suggest that whole-of-government efforts, while attractive for their potential, are challenging to implement in practice. These challenges will manifest in at least six broad ways for the United States in PNG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The drivers of fragility discussed above are complex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; PNG is distinct from fragile places in which the United States generally operates. It is also unlike the other three GFS partner countries (Haiti, Libya, and Mozambique) and partner subregion (coastal West Africa). PNG is not in a state of civil conflict, terrorism has not taken root, and a significant cause for concern is personal safety (e.g., GBV). U.S. operations in the region will unfold against a backdrop of such PNG provinces as Bougainville seeking various forms of autonomy and independence, as well as analyst predictions that fragility indicators are trending in the wrong direction. This means the United States cannot bring a templated stabilization mission to PNG, nor can it rely on experience from other places. It will need to take a deliberate and iterative approach to address proximate triggers of fragility, structural causes, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States has limited experience, presence, and networks in PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Melanesian expertise within U.S. government, security, and development circles is scant, and the United States has little presence on the ground in PNG. Papua New Guineans place great value on relationships and build trust slowly over time, often outside of formal interactions or business dealings. The initial budget allocated to this work will partially dictate the scale of relationships and impact the United States can generate, but the temptation in new contexts is to rush in with money, ideas, and projects without carefully setting goals and understanding the operating environment. Both implementing partners and U.S. government officials will need to invest significant time in building the community and individual connections that will be critical to any conflict-prevention and resilience-building efforts. Failing to invest in relationships at the start of the process could have longer-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole-of-government ambition of the GFS will produce a unique set of operational challenges in the field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The GFS asks the Departments of Defense and State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to identify areas of common interest and collaborate, so their work adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Interagency collaboration is hard enough in environments where there is a need to respond to easily identifiable threats (e.g., violent extremism); it is always easier to address known threats rather than ones on the horizon. However, coordination is more complicated when, as is likely to be the case for GFS implementation in PNG, the goal is to address elements of fragility so they prevent the expansion of conflict and violence. This means the United States will need to be clear in setting out the challenges it seeks to address, how agencies will be accountable for aligning their work, and how individual and collective efforts demonstrate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GFS implementation in PNG involves diverse stakeholders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These stakeholders will be found in countless time zones and include local Papua New Guinean communities, public leaders, private-sector actors, and government officials; bilateral partners such as Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union; and multilateral entities such as the United Nations and World Bank Group. GFS implementation will also require coordination among U.S. agencies, as well as between Port Moresby and Washington, presenting the risk that U.S. activities do not achieve coherence and effectiveness. This means that stakeholder management and engagement will be a critical feature of U.S. implementation and should be considered central to the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States will not be the most significant donor to PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Australia is by far the largest contributor of development assistance to PNG, accounting for 6 percent of all aid spent in 2019. Australia’s fiscal year 2021–22 budget reflects the prioritization of gender equality, committing $120 million to its flagship program Pacific Women Lead. Funding and resources for PNG’s development agenda have concentrated on women’s empowerment. This means the United States will need to determine how to complement existing PNG leadership priorities, when to lead versus support initiatives, whether to finance efforts through existing Australian mechanisms or fund projects separately, and how to foster effective working relationships with other donors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engagement with PNG also relates to the broader geostrategic context of competition between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Australia-PRC relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; China has historically taken an active role in the Pacific and will likely continue to do so in the future. Increased regional engagement by the PRC may also shape the nature of fragility in PNG in the coming years. The United States should respect PNG sovereignty and policy but be attuned to the dynamics of PRC operations there and be respectful of the Chinese community’s long history in the country but ready to calibrate its interagency response according to emerging dynamics. This means the United States needs to avoid its penchant for prioritizing short-term security gains at the expense of sustainable peace. The United States should also be self-aware of its own (unintentional) contributions to fragility in PNG, including through the presence of multinational corporations and their operations, as well as the reverberations of its domestic and international politics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-bespoke-operating-model-for-addressing-fragility-in-png&quot;&gt;Toward A Bespoke Operating Model for Addressing Fragility in PNG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of the challenges discussed and to avoid the pitfalls of previous efforts to prevent conflict and violence in PNG, the United States should consider developing a bespoke operating model centered around deliberate and adaptive planning and implementation efforts that creates an enabling environment for violent-conflict prevention and builds on U.S. comparative advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultivate-a-deliberate-and-adaptive-planning-process&quot;&gt;Cultivate a Deliberate and Adaptive Planning Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn first, program second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Time spent learning about the context during the establishment phase of U.S. presence in PNG will be time saved in the longer term. Extensive lessons learned from Australia, New Zealand, and other partners in PNG will be a rich source of guidance for the United States. Still, the most valuable lessons will be drawn from extensive engagement with PNG stakeholders, particularly at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consult widely but prioritize PNG stakeholders, especially those outside Port Moresby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Operating in PNG will necessitate close cooperation with like-minded donors, including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, the European Union, and multilateral agencies. But there is a risk that consultation with these stakeholders becomes a proxy for consultation with PNG stakeholders. This should be avoided to ensure the United States builds robust and legitimate stakeholder relationships that are complementary to — but independent of — other donors. Care should be taken to look beneath the surface and recognize that usual “interlocutors” for the U.S. government, such as key private-sector entities or donors, may be critical to some solutions but at times also contributors to corruption or broader fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expect the unexpected from the outset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Change does not occur in linear ways in any country; given the complexity of PNG, this non-linearity is a certainty. Challenges and opportunities will arise, often at unexpected moments. The United States should place a high value on being informed through church, community, and people-to-people networks, finding ways to adapt quickly as contexts shift. Adaptation and flexibility should be embedded into all planning and management approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritize diplomatic boots on the ground as a first-order mission, even over programming if necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Building and sustaining the local knowledge networks needed to operate in PNG requires an on-the-ground presence. This should be a first-order priority and will enable better USG coordination, decision-making, and engagement. Program funding and operation in the absence of significant diplomatic engagement are likely to be ineffective or even potentially counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mainstream gender and youth inclusion in every program activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Violence against women is often a leading indicator of insecurity and instability within a state, acting as an early warning for potential widespread conflict. Increasing gender equality generally has a positive effect on preventing and countering corruption and rebuilding institutions and legal frameworks. The United States should look to mainstream gender and youth inclusion in its work to address factors of fragility in PNG within informal and formal processes, systems, and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embrace-a-localized-and-partnership-based-implementation-approach&quot;&gt;Embrace a Localized and Partnership-Based Implementation Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work with existing momentum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. officials should identify and cultivate relationships with church, civil-society, and public service leaders in order to work within and strengthen functioning policy architectures. They should seek out and help accelerate positive momentum in local communities. This effort should include aligning efforts with existing Papua New Guinean strategies such as the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, and anti-money laundering frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead from behind when appropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Under the GFS, the U.S. approach to conflict prevention and stability in PNG should bolster Papua New Guinean leadership and complement work by other donors and partners. Doing so is not only practical, it aligns with the U.S. government’s commitment to localization and effective fragility practice, which empower women and youth in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinate and co-finance rather than co-deliver with like-minded donors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Co-delivery of projects is good in principle but often challenging in practice. Issues of procurement, embassy coordination, and branding requirements can challenge otherwise well-intentioned co-leadership of projects between donors. While interoperability and coordination with other key donor partners should be a high priority, in the shorter term, co-financing rather than co-delivering will likely be an easier means of operating in-country. That said, the United States should not overlook the possibility of working in co-leadership structures with Papua New Guinean stakeholders in areas of comparative strength over the medium-to-long term, including in areas of private-security sector reform, civil-society support, anti-corruption efforts, anti-money laundering measures, digital development, and peacebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not avoid structural issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; With a limited budget and presence, it will be necessary to make clear choices about what the United States supports and what it does not. However, this risks focusing on proximate triggers to the exclusion of addressing structural drivers of fragility. U.S. officials should be receptive to opportunities that intersect and extend beyond whatever core areas of focus it identifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foster-the-right-enabling-environment-for-addressing-fragility&quot;&gt;Foster the Right Enabling Environment for Addressing Fragility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop integrated analysis and leadership among the United States, PNG, and like-minded allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For U.S. engagement to be effective, it needs to be grounded in a shared understanding of the factors of fragility in PNG and connected to political and community leadership at all levels. Investments in trilateral fragility assessments, Track 1.5 dialogues, and U.S.-based research institutes’ increased engagement with those in the Pacific Islands and broader Oceania will improve the enabling environment for program implementation and ensure PNG analysts are connected to decisionmakers in Washington, Canberra, and other capitals through communities of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institute a clear monitoring and performance framework that tracks the impact of work done under the GFS and the country’s eventual implementation plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Priority feedback on program impact should be sought first and foremost from PNG communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codify and communicate strategies for implementing the GFS to key stakeholders in PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Local events, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and other efforts to communicate the mechanisms through which the United States intends to achieve its goals will go a long way toward ensuring broad-based buy-in from geographically and linguistically diverse stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest heavily in whole-of-government coordination efforts to ensure coherent U.S. engagement in PNG, as well as buy-in from key U.S. stakeholders in the agencies involved in implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. officials across the interagency should be incentivized to participate meaningfully in these efforts under the auspices of the chief of mission. These efforts should be tracked, assessed, and adjusted as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leverage-us-comparative-advantages&quot;&gt;Leverage U.S. Comparative Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emphasize the length and seriousness of commitment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Papua New Guineans prioritize relationships built over time and may be sensitive to the perception that the United States is only engaging because of its regional geopolitical or geostrategic interests. The longer-term horizon of the GFS and whole-of-government approach to implementation are assets the United States should communicate clearly — alongside core GFS tenets that speak to a broad set of Papua New Guinean interests in security, economic development, and international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead in areas of comparative advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has significant experience in development, security, and fragility that will complement the predominately economic development-focused footprints of other donors. Injecting this expertise, for example, in private security sector reform, civil society support, combating corruption, and anti-money laundering efforts may be a refreshing and welcomed approach in the donor community in the Pacific Islands. USAID’s recently released 2022–2027 Strategic Framework for the Pacific Islands sets out the agency’s comparative advantages as an “innovator and convener” working through “people-to-people programming” and “building institutional and human capacity,” all efforts that align well with an eventual GFS country strategy for PNG. Other agencies involved in PNG should consider reaching similar levels of clarity; however, more important than this is the overall coherency of the U.S. comparative advantage, including the need to avoid individual or uncoordinated agency activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sport the brand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has strong diplomatic, development, and security brands. It should use these to call international attention to issues, convene a diverse range of stakeholders, and engage in policy dialogue with PNG-based politicians and civil society leaders. The sheer fact that there will be a sustained U.S. presence — beyond a programming footprint managed by a regional USAID mission — will be a significant asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take important stances that others might not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While care should be taken that the U.S. approach to democracy, corruption, and human rights is not regarded as an “ill-fitting” imposition in the context of Papua New Guinean society and state, the United States has a stronger appetite for work in areas of anti-corruption, civic space, human rights, and principles of democratic accountability than most other donors operating in PNG. This may benefit its efforts to address drivers of fragility and offer unique opportunities for it to achieve impact in areas where other donors have not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish international precedent for effective whole-of-government engagement in a conflict-prevention setting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. mobilization of development, diplomacy, and defense capabilities should be aligned with, complementary to, and increasingly integrated into its operations and leadership. There is some risk that GFS engagement in PNG is only seen through a development prism; this would miss an opportunity to leverage U.S. security and diplomatic capabilities in support of conflict prevention in PNG in ways that other countries have not been able to do. With an increasing appetite for whole-of-government engagement emerging in the United Kingdom and Australia, this is an opportunity for the United States to set an international precedent for whole-of-government approaches, especially in contexts experiencing fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work the international system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While much of the focus under the GFS will naturally be at the community level, U.S. engagement with the government of PNG will be integral — as will international collaboration with other donors such as Australia, the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank. The wording of this recommendation is deliberate; while the United States should work within the international system, it should also work the system to achieve its GFS-related goals.&lt;/p&gt;

They arrived bearing a highly classified intelligence analysis, compiled from newly obtained satellite images, intercepted communications and human sources, that amounted to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war plans for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For months, Biden administration officials had watched warily as Putin massed tens of thousands of troops and lined up tanks and missiles along Ukraine’s borders. As summer waned, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, had focused on the increasing volume of intelligence related to Russia and Ukraine. He had set up the Oval Office meeting after his own thinking had gone from uncertainty about Russia’s intentions, to concern he was being too skeptical about the prospects of military action, to alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session was one of several meetings that officials had about Ukraine that autumn — sometimes gathering in smaller groups — but was notable for the detailed intelligence picture that was presented. Biden and Vice President Harris took their places in armchairs before the fireplace, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined the directors of national intelligence and the CIA on sofas around the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasked by Sullivan with putting together a comprehensive overview of Russia’s intentions, they told Biden that the intelligence on Putin’s operational plans, added to ongoing deployments along the border with Ukraine, showed that all the pieces were now in place for a massive assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence community had penetrated multiple points of Russia’s political leadership, spying apparatus and military, from senior levels to the front lines, according to U.S. officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more radical than Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and instigation of a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, Putin’s war plans envisioned a takeover of most of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using mounted maps on easels in front of the Resolute Desk, Milley showed Russian troop positions and the Ukrainian terrain they intended to conquer. It was a plan of staggering audacity, one that could pose a direct threat to NATO’s eastern flank, or even destroy the post-World War II security architecture of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he absorbed the briefing, Biden, who had taken office promising to keep the country out of new wars, was determined that Putin must either be deterred or confronted, and that the United States must not act alone. Yet NATO was far from unified on how to deal with Moscow, and U.S. credibility was weak. After a disastrous occupation of Iraq, the chaos that followed the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and four years of President Donald Trump seeking to undermine the alliance, it was far from certain that Biden could effectively lead a Western response to an expansionist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine was a troubled former Soviet republic with a history of corruption, and the U.S. and allied answer to earlier Russian aggression there had been uncertain and divided. When the invasion came, the Ukrainians would need significant new weaponry to defend themselves. Too little could guarantee a Russian victory. But too much might provoke a direct NATO conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This account, in previously unreported detail, shines new light on the uphill climb to restore U.S. credibility, the attempt to balance secrecy around intelligence with the need to persuade others of its truth, and the challenge of determining how the world’s most powerful military alliance would help a less-than-perfect democracy on Russia’s border defy an attack without NATO firing a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first in a series of articles examining the road to war and the military campaign in Ukraine, it is drawn from in-depth interviews with more than three dozen senior U.S., Ukrainian, European and NATO officials about a global crisis whose end is yet to be determined. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence and internal deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin did not respond to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Milley laid out the array of forces on that October morning, he and the others summed up Putin’s intentions. “We assess that they plan to conduct a significant strategic attack on Ukraine from multiple directions simultaneously,” Milley told the president. “Their version of ‘shock and awe.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the intelligence, the Russians would come from the north, on either side of Kyiv. One force would move east of the capital through the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, while the other would flank Kyiv on the west, pushing southward from Belarus through a natural gap between the “exclusion zone” at the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant and surrounding marshland. The attack would happen in the winter so that the hard earth would make the terrain easily passable for tanks. Forming a pincer around the capital, Russian troops planned to seize Kyiv in three to four days. The Spetsnaz, their special forces, would find and remove President Volodymyr Zelensky, killing him if necessary, and install a Kremlin-friendly puppet government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Russian forces would come from the east and drive through central Ukraine to the Dnieper River, while troops from Crimea took over the southeastern coast. Those actions could take several weeks, the Russian plans predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pausing to regroup and rearm, they would next push westward, toward a north-south line stretching from Moldova to western Belarus, leaving a rump Ukrainian state in the west — an area that in Putin’s calculus was populated by irredeemable neo-Nazi Russophobes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had obtained “extraordinary detail” about the Kremlin’s secret plans for a war it continued to deny it intended, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines later explained. They included not only the positioning of troops and weaponry and operational strategy, but also fine points such as Putin’s “unusual and sharp increases in funding for military contingency operations and for building up reserve forces even as other pressing needs, such as pandemic response, were under-resourced,” she said. This was no mere exercise in intimidation, unlike a large-scale Russian deployment in April, when Putin’s forces had menaced Ukraine’s borders but never attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in the White House found it hard to wrap their minds around the scale of the Russian leader’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It did not seem like the kind of thing that a rational country would undertake,” one participant in the meeting later said of the planned occupation of most of a country of 232,000 square miles and nearly 45 million people. Parts of Ukraine were deeply anti-Russian, raising the specter of an insurgency even if Putin toppled the government in Kyiv. And yet the intelligence showed that more and more troops were arriving and settling in for a full campaign. Munitions, food and crucial supplies were being deposited at Russian encampments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden pressed his advisers. Did they really think that this time Putin was likely to strike?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they affirmed. This is real. Although the administration would publicly insist over the next several months that it did not believe Putin had made a final decision, the only thing his team couldn’t tell the president that autumn day was exactly when the Russian president would pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIA Director William J. Burns, who had served as U.S. ambassador to Moscow and had had the most direct interactions with Putin of anyone in the Biden administration, described the Russian leader to the others as fixated on Ukraine. Control over the country was synonymous with Putin’s concept of Russian identity and authority. The precision of the war planning, coupled with Putin’s conviction that Ukraine should be reabsorbed by the motherland, left him with no doubts that Putin was prepared to invade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believed he was quite serious,” Burns said months later, recalling the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii&quot;&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence had underscored the promise of Putin’s own words. Three months earlier, in July, he had published a 7,000-word essay, “On the Historical Unity Between Russians and Ukrainians,” suffused with grievance and dubious assertions. Russians and Ukrainians, he argued, were “one people” — an idea rooted in Putin’s claims about “blood ties” — and Moscow had been “robbed” of its own territory by a scheming West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,” Putin wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just weeks before the essay appeared, Biden and Putin had held a June 16 summit that both declared was “constructive.” At that point, Ukraine was a concern, but one that White House officials felt could be dealt with. As the White House delegation left the meeting, held in Geneva, a senior Biden aide would later recall, “we didn’t get on the plane and come home and think the world was on the cusp of a major war in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Putin’s subsequent publication “caught our attention in a big way,” Sullivan later said. “We began to look at what’s going on here, what’s his end game? How hard is he going to push?” As a precaution, on Aug. 27, Biden authorized that $60 million in largely defensive weapons be drawn from U.S. inventories and sent to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late summer, as they pieced together the intelligence from the border and from Moscow, analysts who had spent their careers studying Putin were increasingly convinced the Russian leader — himself a former intelligence officer — saw a window of opportunity closing. Ukrainians had already twice risen up to demand a democratic future, free from corruption and Moscow’s interference, during the 2004-2005 Orange Revolution, and the 2013-2014 Maidan protests that preceded Russia’s annexation of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a member of NATO or the European Union, Ukraine was now moving steadily into the Western political, economic and cultural orbit. That drift fed Putin’s broader resentment about Russia’s loss of empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a grim actuarial assessment, the analysts concluded that Putin, who was about to turn 69, understood that he was running out of time to cement his legacy as one of Russia’s great leaders — the one who had restored Russian preeminence on the Eurasian continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts said Putin calculated that any Western response to an attempt to reclaim Ukraine by force would be big on outrage but limited in actual punishment. The Russian leader, they said, believed that the Biden administration was chastened by the humiliating U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and wanted to avoid new wars. The United States and Europe were still struggling through the coronavirus pandemic. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the de facto European leader, was leaving office and handing power to an untested successor. French President Emmanuel Macron was facing a reelection battle against a resurgent right wing, and Britain was suffering from a post-Brexit economic downturn. Large parts of the continent depended on Russian oil and natural gas, which Putin thought he could use as a wedge to split the Western alliance. He had built up hundreds of billions of dollars in cash reserves and was confident the Russian economy could weather the inevitable sanctions, as it had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented with the new intelligence and analysis at the October briefing, Biden “basically had two reactions,” Sullivan said. First, to try to deter Putin, they “needed to send somebody to Moscow to sit with the Russians at a senior level and tell them: ‘If you do this, these will be the consequences.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they needed to brief allies on the U.S. intelligence and bring them on board with what the administration believed should be a unified and severe posture of threatened sanctions against Russia, reinforcement and expansion of NATO defenses, and assistance for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burns was dispatched to Moscow and Haines to NATO headquarters in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, Milley still carried in his briefcase note cards encapsulating the U.S. interests and strategic objectives discussed at the October briefing. He could recite them off the top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem: “How do you underwrite and enforce the rules-based international order” against a country with extraordinary nuclear capability, “without going to World War III?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. 1: “Don’t have a kinetic conflict between the U.S. military and NATO with Russia.” No. 2: “Contain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.” No. 3: “Strengthen and maintain NATO unity.” No. 4: “Empower Ukraine and give them the means to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s advisers were confident Ukraine would put up a fight. The United States, Britain and other NATO members had spent years training and equipping the Ukrainian military, which was more professional and better organized than before Russia’s assault on Crimea and the eastern region of Donbas seven years earlier. But the training had focused nearly as much on how to mount internal resistance after a Russian occupation as on how to prevent it in the first place. The weapons they had supplied were primarily small-bore and defensive so that they wouldn’t be seen as a Western provocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration also had grave concerns about Ukraine’s young president, a former television comic who had come into office on a huge wave of popular support and desire for fundamental change but had lost public standing in part because he failed to make good on a promise to make peace with Russia. Zelensky, 44, appeared to be no match for the ruthless Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math was not in Ukraine’s favor. Russia had more troops, more tanks, more artillery, more fighter jets and guided missiles, and had demonstrated in previous conflicts its willingness to pummel its weaker adversaries into submission, with no regard for the loss of civilian lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv might not fall as quickly as the Russians expected, the Americans concluded, but it would fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii&quot;&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 2, Burns was escorted into the Kremlin office of Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser and a former ambassador to the United States. Ushakov’s boss was on the other end of a phone line and spoke to Burns from the resort city of Sochi, where he had retreated during another wave of coronavirus infections in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian leader recited his usual complaints about NATO expansion, the threat to Russian security, and illegitimate leadership in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was very dismissive of President Zelensky as a political leader,” Burns recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practiced at listening to Putin’s tirades from his years in Moscow, Burns delivered his own forceful message: The United States knows what you’re up to, and if you invade Ukraine, you will pay a huge price. He said he was leaving a letter from Biden, affirming the punishing consequences of any Russian attack on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin “was very matter-of-fact,” Burns said. He didn’t deny the intelligence that pointed toward a Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA director also met with another of Putin’s advisers, Nikolai Patrushev, an ex-KGB officer, from Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg, who ran Russia’s Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrushev had thought Burns flew to Moscow to discuss the next meeting between Putin and Biden and seemed surprised that the CIA chief had come bearing a warning about Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He almost exactly echoed Putin’s grievances about history and NATO in his discussions with Burns. There seemed to be no room for meaningful engagement, and it left the CIA director to wonder if Putin and his tight circle of aides had formed their own echo chamber. Putin had not made an irreversible decision to go to war, but his views on Ukraine had hardened, his appetite for risk had grown, and the Russian leader believed his moment of opportunity would soon pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My level of concern has gone up, not down,” the spy chief reported back to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv&quot;&gt;IV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Burns was speaking with Putin, Blinken was sitting down with Zelensky, in Glasgow, Scotland, on the sidelines of an international summit on climate change. He laid out the intelligence picture and described the Russian storm that was heading Ukraine’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was just the two of us, two feet from each other,” Blinken recalled. It was a “difficult conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken had met before with the Ukrainian president and thought he knew him well enough to speak candidly, although it seemed surreal to be “telling someone you believe their country is going to be invaded.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found Zelensky “serious, deliberate, stoic,” a combination of belief and disbelief. He said he would brief his senior teams. But the Ukrainians had “seen a number of Russian feints in the past,” Blinken knew, and Zelensky was clearly worried about economic collapse if his country panicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken’s presentation, and Zelensky’s skepticism, set a pattern that would be repeated both privately and in public over the next several months. The Ukrainians could not afford to reject U.S. intelligence wholesale. But from their perspective, the information was speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky heard the U.S. warnings, he later recalled, but said the Americans weren’t offering the kinds of weapons Ukraine needed to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can say a million times, ‘Listen, there may be an invasion.’ Okay, there may be an invasion — will you give us planes?” Zelensky said. “Will you give us air defenses? ‘Well, you’re not a member of NATO.’ Oh, okay, then what are we talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Americans offered little specific intelligence to support their warnings “until the last four or five days before the invasion began,” according to Dmytro Kuleba, Zelensky’s foreign minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks after the Glasgow meeting, when Kuleba and Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, visited the State Department in Washington, a senior U.S. official greeted them with a cup of coffee and a smile. “Guys, dig the trenches!” the official began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we smiled back,” Kuleba recalled, the official said, “ ‘I’m serious. Start digging trenches. … You will be attacked. A large-scale attack, and you have to prepare for it.’ We asked for details; there were none.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Americans became frustrated at Ukraine’s skepticism about Russia’s plans, the Ukrainians were no less disconcerted at the increasingly public U.S. warnings that an invasion was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We had to strike a balance between realistically assessing the risks and preparing the country for the worst … and keeping the country running economically and financially,” Kuleba said. “Every comment coming from the United States about the unavoidability of war was immediately reflected in the [Ukrainian] currency exchange rate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of U.S. officials have disputed Ukrainian recollections, saying they provided the Kyiv government with specific intelligence early on and throughout the lead-up to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when it came to Ukraine, U.S. intelligence was hardly an open book. Official guidance prohibited the spy agencies from sharing tactical information that Ukraine could use to launch offensive attacks on Russian troop locations in Crimea or against Kremlin-backed separatists in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s own intelligence apparatus was also shot through with Russian moles, and U.S. officials were leery of sensitive information ending up in Moscow’s hands. After the war began, the Biden administration changed its policy and shared information on Russian troop movements throughout Ukraine, on the grounds that the country was now defending itself from an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v&quot;&gt;V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a side meeting during the Group of 20 conference in Rome at the end of October, Biden shared some of the new intelligence and conclusions with America’s closest allies — the leaders of Britain, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, Haines used a previously scheduled trip to Brussels to brief a wider circle of allies: NATO’s North Atlantic Council, the principal decision-making body of the 30-member alliance. Speaking in a large auditorium, she limited her remarks to what the intelligence community believed the evidence showed, and didn’t offer policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A number of members raised questions and were skeptical of the idea that President Putin was seriously preparing for the possibility of a large-scale invasion,” Haines recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French and German officials couldn’t understand why Putin would try to invade and occupy a large country with just the 80,000 to 90,000 troops believed to be massed on the border. Satellite imagery also showed the troops moving back and forth from the frontier. Others posited that the Russians were performing an exercise, as the Kremlin itself insisted, or playing a shell game designed to conceal a purpose short of invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most were doubtful, and noted that Zelensky seemed to think Russia would never attack with the ambition and force the Americans were forecasting. Didn’t Ukraine understand Russia’s intentions best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the British and the Baltic states were fully on board. At one point, an official from London stood up and gestured toward Haines. “She’s right,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Paris and Berlin remembered emphatic U.S. claims about intelligence on Iraq. The shadow of that deeply flawed analysis hung over all the discussions before the invasion. Some also felt that Washington, just months earlier, had vastly overestimated the resilience of Afghanistan’s government as the U.S. military was withdrawing. The government had collapsed as soon as the Taliban entered Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“American intelligence is not considered to be a naturally reliable source,” said François Heisbourg, a security expert and longtime adviser to French officials. “It was considered to be prone to political manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Europeans began to settle into camps that would change little for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there were basically three flavors,” a senior administration official said. To many in Western Europe, what the Russians were doing was “all coercive diplomacy, [Putin] was just building up to see what he could get. He’s not going to invade … it’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of NATO’s newer members in eastern and southeastern Europe thought Putin “may do something, but it would be limited in scope,” the official said, “ … another bite at the [Ukrainian] apple,” similar to what happened in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Britain and the Baltic states, which were always nervous about Russian intentions, believed a full-scale invasion was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When skeptical member states asked for more intelligence, the Americans provided some, but held back from sharing it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the United States rarely revealed its most sensitive intelligence to an organization as diverse as NATO, primarily for fear that secrets could leak. While the Americans and their British partners did share a significant amount of information, they withheld the raw intercepts or nature of the human sources that were essential to determining Putin’s plans. That especially frustrated French and German officials, who had long suspected that Washington and London sometimes hid the basis of their intelligence to make it seem more definitive than it really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the alliance countries provided their own findings, Haines said. The United States also created new mechanisms for sharing information in real time with their foreign partners in Brussels. Austin, Blinken and Milley were on the phone to their counterparts, sharing, listening, cajoling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, one senior European official at NATO recalled, “the intelligence was narrated repeatedly, consistently, clearly, credibly, in a lot of detail with a very good script and supporting evidence. I don’t remember one key moment where the lightbulb went off” in the months-long effort to convince the allies, the official said. Ultimately, “it was the volume of the lights in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;VI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron and Merkel had been dealing with Putin for years and found it hard to believe he was so irrational as to launch a calamitous war. In the weeks after Biden’s Geneva meeting, they had tried to arrange an E.U.-Russia summit, only to be shot down by skeptical members of the bloc who saw it as a dangerous concession to Russia’s aggressive posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, despite the new U.S. intelligence, the French and Germans insisted there was a chance for diplomacy. The Americans and the British had little hope that any diplomatic effort would pay off, but were prepared to keep the door open — if the Europeans gave something in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A big part of our focus,” recalled Sullivan, “was basically to say to them, ‘Look, we’ll take the diplomatic track and treat it [as] serious … if you will take the planning for [military] force posture and sanctions seriously.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side was convinced it was right but was willing to proceed as if it might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, the Americans strove to show the Western Europeans and others that they were still willing to search for a peaceful resolution, even though in the back of their minds, they were convinced that any Russian efforts at negotiation were a charade. “It basically worked,” Sullivan said of the administration strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 7, Putin and Biden spoke on a video call. Putin claimed that the eastward expansion of the Western alliance was a major factor in his decision to send troops to Ukraine’s border. Russia was simply protecting its own interests and territorial integrity, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden responded that Ukraine was unlikely to join NATO any time soon, and that the United States and Russia could come to agreements on other concerns Russia had about the placement of U.S. weapons systems in Europe. In theory, there was room to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, as Blinken headed the U.S. diplomatic effort with repeated visits to NATO capitals and alliance headquarters in Brussels, the Ukrainians continued their contacts with European governments that still seemed far less convinced of Putin’s intentions than the Americans were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuleba and others in the government believed there would be a war, the Ukrainian foreign minister later said. But until the eve of the invasion, “I could not believe that we would face a war of such scale. The only country in the world that was persistently telling us” with such certainty “that there would be missile strikes was the United States of America. … Every other country was not sharing this analysis and [instead was] saying, yes, war is possible, but it will be rather a localized conflict in the east of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put yourself in our shoes,” Kuleba said. “You have, on the one hand, the U.S. telling you something completely unimaginable, and everyone else blinking an eye to you and saying this is not what we think is going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the British and some Baltic officials believed a full invasion was probable. But Kuleba was far from alone in his skepticism. His president shared it, according to Zelensky’s aides and other officials who briefed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We took all of the information that our Western partners were giving us seriously,” recalled Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. “But let’s be honest: Imagine if all of this panic that so many people were pushing had taken place. Creating panic is a method of the Russians. … Imagine if this panic had started three or four months beforehand. What would’ve happened to the economy? Would we have been able to hold on for five months like we have?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii&quot;&gt;VII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early January, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman led a diplomatic delegation to Geneva and met with Sergei Ryabkov, her Russian counterpart, whom she knew well. He reiterated Moscow’s position on Ukraine, formally offered in mid-December in two proposed treaties — that NATO must end its expansion plans and halt any activity in countries that had joined the alliance after 1997, which included Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting the proposal to close NATO’s doors and reduce the status of existing members, the administration instead offered talks and trust-building measures in a number of security areas, including the deployment of troops and the placement of weapons on NATO’s eastern flank along the border with Russia. The offer was conditioned on de-escalation of the military threat to Ukraine. Ryabkov told Sherman that Russia was disappointed in the American attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House had envisioned Sherman’s meeting with Ryabkov as “a chance to test whether the Russians were serious about the substance of the concerns … and if there was a way forward for any kind of diplomacy,” said Emily Horne, then the spokesperson for the National Security Council. “I think it became pretty clear, pretty quickly that [the Russians] were performing diplomacy, not actually undertaking diplomacy. They weren’t even doing it with much seriousness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All the Western allies wanted to convey that there was an alternative path involving dialogue and respect for Russia as a great power,” said a senior British government official involved in negotiations. “What became increasingly clear was that Russia was not interested in those.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States pursued the diplomatic track, it also positioned forces to defend NATO, all of them visible to Moscow and to Europeans and demonstrating American willingness to put skin in the game. While Biden repeatedly said there would be no U.S. troops in Ukraine, the Pentagon increased pre-positioned weapons stocks in Poland and moved a helicopter battalion there from Greece. Paratroops from the 173rd Airborne were deployed to the Baltic states. More troops were sent from Italy to eastern Romania, and others went to Hungary and Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, the U.S. military presence in Europe increased from 74,000 to 100,000 troops. Four airborne fighter squadrons became 12, and the number of surface combatant ships in the region increased from five to 26. Combat air patrols and surveillance were flying 24/7 missions over the alliance’s eastern flank, with visibility deep inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were saying, ‘Look, we’re taking diplomacy seriously, but we’re so worried about this that we’re actually moving men and material,’ ” Sullivan recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With National Security Agency authorization, the United States established a direct communication line from the Ukrainian military to U.S. European Command. The highly secure system would keep the Americans in direct contact with their Ukrainian counterparts as events unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration was also sending arms to Ukraine. In December, Biden authorized an additional $200 million in weapons to be drawn from U.S. inventories — even as the Kyiv government, many in Congress and some within the administration itself argued that if the United States really believed a full-scale invasion was coming, it was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every step in the administration campaign was premised on avoiding direct U.S. involvement in a military clash. The overriding White House concern about provocation influenced each decision about how much assistance and what kind of weapons to give the Ukrainians to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I make no apologies for the fact that one of our objectives here is to avoid direct conflict with Russia,” Sullivan said of the prewar period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians were going to do what they did regardless of what the allies did, a senior official involved in the decisions said, and the administration found “incredible” the notion, as some later argued in hindsight, that “if only we would have given” the Ukrainians more arms, “none of this would have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining whether Russia would interpret a military exercise or a weapons shipment as provocative or escalatory was “more art than science,” the official said. “There’s not a clear and easy mathematical formula. … There has always been a balance between what is required to effectively defend, and what is going to be seen by Russia as the United States essentially underwriting the killing of huge numbers of Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials have expressed unending gratitude to the United States for what it has provided since the start of the war. “No other country in the world did more for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons than the United States since 24 February. No other country in the world,” Kuleba said recently. But from the beginning, he said, he and other Ukrainian officials have believed that the “non-provocation” strategy was the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where did it take us to?” Kuleba said. “I think this war — with thousands killed and wounded, territories lost, part of the economy destroyed … is the best answer to those who still advocate the non-provocation of Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viii&quot;&gt;VIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its ongoing campaign to convince the world of what was coming — and dissuade the Russians — the White House decided toward the end of 2021 to challenge its own reluctance, and that of the intelligence agencies, to make some of their most sensitive information public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence had picked up on “false flag” operations planned by the Russians, in which they would stage attacks on their own forces as if they had come from Ukraine. Publicly exposing those plans might deny Putin the opportunity to concoct a pretext for invasion, administration officials reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the White House decided to reveal the scale of the troop buildup that continued on Ukraine’s borders. In early December, the administration released satellite photos, as well a map created by U.S. analysts showing Russian troop positions and an intelligence community analysis of Russian planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis said the Russians planned “extensive movement” of 100 battalion tactical groups, involving up to 175,000 troops, along with armor, artillery and equipment. The picture that administration officials had been developing for weeks in secret was now seen around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of more selective disclosures of intelligence, Sullivan set up a regular process at the White House in which a team would determine whether a particular piece of information, if made public, could thwart Russian plans or propaganda. If the answer was yes, it would then be submitted to the intelligence community for recommendations on whether and how to release it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January, the British government publicly accused Russia of plotting to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. The allegation, based on U.S. and British intelligence, was revealed in a highly unusual press statement by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, late in the evening in London but just in time for the Sunday morning papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in early February, the Biden administration disclosed that Moscow was considering filming a fake Ukrainian attack against Russian territory or Russian-speaking people — the false flag that intelligence had detected. The propaganda film would be heavy on spectacle, officials said, with graphic scenes of explosions, accompanied by corpses posed as victims and mourners pretending to grieve for the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had watched Putin falsely set the narrative too many times,” another U.S. official said. Now, “you could see him planning quite specifically in [eastern Ukraine] false flags. It was quite precise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence disclosures themselves had an air of theatricality. The initial revelation of satellite pictures could be corroborated by commercial footage, though the analysis was unique to the intelligence community. But whether the public believed the subsequent disclosures depended on the government’s credibility. And Biden administration officials knew they faced a public, at home and abroad, that could be deeply skeptical of “intelligence,” following the Iraq War and the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, the U.S. public information campaign worked. World attention focused on the Russian troop buildup. The idea that Putin would falsify the reasons for his invasion seemed plausible, perhaps because in 2014 he had denied entirely that his troops were in Crimea, an assertion that led to descriptions of “little green men” in military uniforms without insignia occupying part of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how skeptical some allies remained about the intelligence, the most powerful effect of disclosing it was to shape Russian behavior and deprive Putin of the power to use misinformation, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ix&quot;&gt;IX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 12, Burns met in Kyiv with Zelensky and delivered a candid assessment. The intelligence picture had only become clearer that Russia intended to make a lightning strike on Kyiv and decapitate the central government. The United States had also discovered a key piece of battlefield planning: Russia would try to land its forces first at the airport in Hostomel, a suburb of the capital, where the runways could accommodate massive Russian transports carrying troops and weapons. The assault on Kyiv would begin there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in their conversation, Zelensky asked if he or his family were personally in danger. Burns said Zelensky needed to take his personal security seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks to the president were growing. Intelligence at the time indicated that Russian assassination teams might already be in Kyiv, waiting to be activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zelensky resisted calls to relocate his government and was adamant that he not panic the public. Down that path, he thought, lay defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t simply say to me, ‘Listen, you should start to prepare people now and tell them they need to put away money, they need to store up food,’ ” Zelensky recalled. “If we had communicated that — and that is what some people wanted, who I will not name — then I would have been losing $7 billion a month since last October, and at the moment when the Russians did attack, they would have taken us in three days. … Generally, our inner sense was right: If we sow chaos among people before the invasion, the Russians will devour us. Because during chaos, people flee the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Zelensky, the decision to keep people in the country, where they could fight to defend their homes, was the key to repelling any invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As cynical as it may sound, those are the people who stopped everything,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials remained irritated that the Americans weren’t sharing more about their intelligence sources. “The information that we received was, I would call it, a statement of facts without a disclosure of the origins of those facts or of the background behind those facts,” Kuleba recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Western intelligence wasn’t alone in thinking Zelensky should prepare for a full-scale invasion. Some of Ukraine’s own intelligence officials, while still skeptical that Putin would strike, were planning for the worst. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, said he moved the archives out of his headquarters three months in advance of the war and prepared reserves of fuel and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American warnings were repeated on Jan. 19 when Blinken made a brief visit to Kyiv for a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky and Kuleba. To the secretary’s dismay, Zelensky continued to argue that any public call for mobilization would bring panic, as well as capital flight that would push Ukraine’s already teetering economy over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Blinken stressed, as he had in previous conversations, the importance of keeping Zelensky and his government safe and intact, he was one of several senior U.S. officials who rebuffed reports that the administration had urged them to evacuate the capital. “What we said to Ukraine were two things,” Blinken later recalled. “We will support you whatever you want to do. We recommend you look … at how you can ensure continuity of government operations depending on what happens.” That could mean hunkering down in Kyiv, relocating to western Ukraine or moving the government to neighboring Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky told Blinken he was staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had begun to suspect that some Western officials wanted him to flee so that Russia could install a puppet government that would come to a negotiated settlement with NATO powers. “The Western partners wanted to — I’m sure someone was really worried about what would happen to me and my family,” Zelensky said. “But someone probably wanted to just end things faster. I think the majority of people who called me — well, almost everyone — did not have faith that Ukraine can stand up to this and persevere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, warning Ukrainians to prepare for war as some partners wanted him to, he said, would have weakened the country economically and made it easier for the Russians to capture. “Let people discuss in the future whether it was right or not right,” the Ukrainian leader recalled, “but I definitely know and intuitively — we discussed this every day at the National Security and Defense Council, et cetera — I had the feeling that [the Russians] wanted to prepare us for a soft surrender of the country. And that’s scary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;x&quot;&gt;X&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a news conference on Jan. 19, Biden said he thought Russia would invade. Putin had come too far to pull back. “He has to do something,” the president said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden promised that the West would answer Russia’s attack. “Our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy,” he said, predicting that if Putin ordered an invasion, it would prove a “disaster” for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of Biden’s most forceful warnings to that point. But the president also muddied the waters, suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russian forces, as opposed to a full-scale invasion, might not prompt the severe response that he and allies had threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,” Biden said, signaling that NATO was not unified in its opposition to any Russian use of force. “If there’s something where there’s Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters, et cetera, I think that changes everything,” Biden said when, later in the news conference, a reporter asked him to clarify what he meant by a “minor incursion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But it depends on what he [Putin] does, actually, what extent we’re going to be able to get total unity on the NATO front.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s comments revealed the cracks in his own administration’s planning, as well as in NATO. Blinken was in Kyiv, vowing that the United States would support Ukraine, in every way short of committing its own forces, if the country was attacked. But privately, administration officials had been contemplating for weeks how they would respond to a “hybrid” attack, in which Russia might launch damaging cyber-strikes on Ukraine and a limited assault on the eastern part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky and his aides, who still weren’t convinced Putin would go to war, replied to Biden’s comments about a “minor incursion” with a caustic tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden clarified the next day that if “any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion” for which Putin will pay. But White House officials quietly fumed that while the administration was trying to rally support for Ukraine, Zelensky was more interested in poking the president in the eye over an awkward comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was frustrating,” said a former White House official. “We were taking steps that were attempting to help him, and there was a feeling that he was protecting his own political brand by either being in denial or projecting confidence because that’s what was important to him at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aide to Zelensky who helped craft the tweet said it was meant to rebut Biden, but also to be light and humorous, a way to defuse the burgeoning tension. Zelensky’s inner circle worried that Washington’s predictions that war was around the corner would have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Biden was clarifying, Zelensky’s team tried to assuage Washington with a conciliatory message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you @POTUS for the unprecedented [U.S.] diplomatic and military assistance for [Ukraine],” Zelensky tweeted, with emoji of the U.S. and Ukrainian flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xi&quot;&gt;XI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan. 21 was a cold, bleak day in Geneva, with gusty winds whipping the surface of the usually placid lake that shares the Swiss city’s name. As Blinken and his aides sat across from their Russian counterparts at a table set up in the ballroom of a shoreline luxury hotel, the secretary offered the whitecaps as a metaphor. Perhaps, Blinken told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, they could calm the turbulent waters between their two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They exchanged tense niceties and covered other issues — a spat about the size and activities of their embassies in each other’s capital, the Iran nuclear deal — before turning to Ukraine. Blinken again laid out U.S. positions. If Putin had legitimate security concerns, the United States and its allies were ready to talk about them. But once an invasion of Ukraine began, Western sanctions would be fast and merciless, isolating Russia and crippling its economy, and the alliance would provide Ukraine with massive military assistance. If one Russian soldier or missile touched one inch of NATO territory, the United States would defend its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken found Lavrov’s responses strident and unyielding. After an hour and a half of fruitless back-and-forth, it seemed there was little more to say. But as their aides began to file out of the ballroom, Blinken held back and asked the Russian minister to speak with him alone. The two men entered a small, adjacent conference room and shut the door as the U.S. and Russian teams stood uncomfortably together outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Lavrov’s nearly 18 years as Russia’s foreign minister, a succession of American diplomats had found him blunt and doctrinaire, but occasionally frank and realistic about relations between their two countries. After again going over the Ukraine situation, Blinken stopped and asked, “Sergei, tell me what it is you’re really trying to do?” Was this all really about the security concerns Russia had raised again and again — about NATO’s “encroachment” toward Russia and a perceived military threat? Or was it about Putin’s almost theological belief that Ukraine was and always had been an integral part of Mother Russia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without answering, Lavrov opened the door and walked away, his staff trailing behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the last time top national security officials of Russia and the United States would meet in person before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden spoke with Putin once more by telephone. On Feb. 12, the White House said, he told the Russian president that “while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xii&quot;&gt;XII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace had flown to Moscow to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, a longtime Kremlin survivor who helped sculpt Putin’s tough-guy persona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace wanted to ask one more time if there was room for negotiation on Putin’s demands about NATO expansion and alliance activities in Eastern Europe. The Russians, he said, showed no interest in engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace warned Shoigu that Russia would face fierce resistance if it invaded Ukraine. “I know the Ukrainians — I visited Ukraine five times — and they will fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My mother’s Ukrainian,” Wallace said Shoigu replied, implying that he knew the people better. “It’s all part of our same country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace then raised the prospect of sanctions. Shoigu responded: “ ‘We can suffer like no one else.’ And I said, ‘I don’t want anyone to suffer.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoigu aired a long and by now familiar list of complaints and said Russia couldn’t tolerate Ukraine’s Western trajectory. “It was in some respects incomprehensible,” said a British official who attended the meeting. “Everyone wanted to keep negotiations going — we were throwing off-ramps, but they weren’t taking them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the British officials were about to leave, Shoigu spoke directly to Wallace. “He looked me in the eye and said, ‘We have no plans to invade Ukraine’ ” Wallace recalled. “That shows you how much of a lie it was.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later, on Feb. 18, Biden called the leaders of several NATO allies and told them the latest U.S. analysis. Biden told reporters in the Roosevelt Room at the White House later that day, “As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision” to invade. “We have reason to believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French, however, continued to seek a way out of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, Macron called Putin and asked him to agree to a meeting in Geneva with Biden. The conversation led the French president to believe that Putin was finally willing to seek a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a proposal that merits to be taken into account,” Putin said, according to a recording of the conversation aired months later in a France TV documentary, “A President, Europe and War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron pressed the Russian leader. “But can we say, today, at the end of this conversation, that we agree in principle? I would like a clear answer from you on that score. I understand your resistance to setting a date. But are you ready to move forward and say, today, ‘I would like a [face-to-face] meeting with the Americans, then expanded to the Europeans’? Or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin didn’t commit and appeared to have more-pressing matters at hand. “To be perfectly frank with you, I wanted to go [play] ice hockey, because right now I’m at the gym. But before starting my workout, let me assure you, I will first call my advisers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Je vous remercie, Monsieur le President,” Putin concluded, thanking him in French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron is heard laughing in delight as he hangs up. The French president and his advisers thought they had a breakthrough. Macron’s diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, even danced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the following day, in a televised address, Putin officially recognized two separatist Ukrainian provinces in Donbas, including territory controlled by Kyiv, as independent states. It was a stark sign that Putin — his French-language pleasantries aside — intended to dismember Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xiii&quot;&gt;XIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain and France made last-ditch efforts at diplomacy, world leaders gathered in Munich for an annual security conference. Zelensky attended, prompting concerns among some U.S. officials that his absence might give Russia the perfect moment to strike. Others wondered if the Ukrainian leader believed Russia would attack and had used the opportunity to leave the country before the bombs started falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech, Zelensky reminded the audience that his country was already at war with Russia, with Ukrainian troops fighting against the eastern separatists since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to constantly talk only about the dates of a probable invasion,” Zelensky said. Instead, the European Union and NATO should welcome Ukraine into their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European officials were still unconvinced that an attack was coming. One told a reporter, “We have no clear evidence ourselves that Putin has made up his mind, and we have not seen anything that would suggest otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It felt otherworldly,” the British official said. In sideline conversations, U.S. and British officials were convinced of an imminent invasion, but “that just wasn’t the mood in the hall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in London began to doubt themselves, the British official said. “People were saying [we] got it wrong on Afghanistan. We returned and scrubbed the [Ukraine] intelligence again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They came up with the same conclusion — Russia would invade. But despite the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence-sharing campaign, it remained a difficult sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you discover the plans of somebody to attack a country and the plans appear to be completely bonkers, the chances are that you are going to react rationally and consider that it’s so bonkers, it’s not going to happen,” said Heisbourg, the French security expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Europeans overrated their understanding of Putin,” he said. “The Americans, I assume … rather than try to put themselves in Putin’s head, decided they were going to act on the basis of the data and not worry about whether it makes any sense or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been many reasons to be mystified. U.S. intelligence showed that the Kremlin’s war plans were not making their way down to the battlefield commanders who would have to carry them out. Officers didn’t know their orders. Troops were showing up at the border not understanding they were heading into war. Some U.S. government analysts were bewildered by the lack of communication within the Russian military. Things were so screwy, the analysts thought, Russia’s plans might actually fail. But that remained a distinctly minority view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kuleba, the turning point came in the days after the Feb. 18-20 Munich conference, when he traveled again to Washington. “These were the days I received more-specific information,” he recalled. At a specific airport A in Russia, they told him, five transport planes were already on full alert, ready to take paratroops at any given moment and fly them in the direction of a specific airport B in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was where you see the sequence of events and the logic of what is happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western intelligence officials, looking back at what turned out to be the shambolic Russian attack on Kyiv, acknowledge that they overestimated the effectiveness of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We assumed they would invade a country the way we would have invaded a country,” one British official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xiv&quot;&gt;XIV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening of Feb. 23, the White House received an urgent intelligence flash. There was “high probability” that the invasion had begun. Troops were on the move, and the Russians had fired missiles on targets in Ukraine. The president’s top advisers assembled; some met in the Situation Room while others joined on a secure line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sullivan spoke with Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. There was “an extremely high level of agitation” in Kyiv, said a person familiar with the call. “They were not spinning out of control. Just extremely emotional, but in a way you’d expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermak told Sullivan to hold on — he wanted to bring Zelensky to the phone to speak directly with Biden. Sullivan connected the call to the Treaty Room, part of the second-floor White House residence used as a study, and got the president on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky implored Biden to immediately contact as many other world leaders and diplomats as possible. He should tell them to speak out publicly and to call Putin directly and tell him to “turn this off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zelensky was alarmed,” the person recalled. He asked Biden to “ ‘get us all the intelligence you possibly can now. We will fight, we will defend, we can hold, but we need your help.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

It also attempts to understand the degree to which Rome’s policy positions are shaped by external influences or internal choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is inherently difficult to demonstrate influence, this paper stresses Italy’s agency in driving the relationships forwards, though it is clear that interference attempts and the economic connections that exist between the three powers play a role in influencing Italian planning. Even if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is heavily impacting the relationship between Rome and Moscow, how this will play out in the longer term is hard to predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has been one of the leading advocates in the EU of dialogue and cooperation with Russia, to the point that it has been accused of being Russia’s trojan horse in Europe. Rome has faced similar accusations about China, especially after it became the first G7 and major EU power to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2019. Yet, these perceptions miss the underlying dynamics in Italy’s choices, which draw on a long history of trying to sit in the middle – a consistent practice no matter which of the many political parties have taken power in Rome. From Beijing’s and Moscow’s perspectives, these internal dynamics are par for the course for Rome, where governmental instability has been the norm since the end of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has consistently sought to hedge between its close transatlantic ties and its longstanding connections with Moscow and Beijing. Both see Italy as a useful power to support them, given its prominent role in the G7 and as a central member of NATO and the EU. As President Xi Jinping wrote on the eve of his 2019 visit to Italy, ‘China hopes to strengthen coordination with Italy in international affairs and multilateral organisations’. President Vladimir Putin took this further, often expressing the view that Italy could act as a bridge for Russia and even calling for Italy to ‘play its role in normalising Russia-EU relations’, shortly before launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Although this paper was initially drafted before the invasion, it has tried to incorporate what has been seen in Rome’s approach under Prime Minister Mario Draghi towards Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine (though is unable to speculate about what might come next). During Draghi’s brief reign, Italy had for the most part consolidated its transatlantic and European bonds in Russia policy. While Rome harshly condemned the invasion, Italy’s subsequent push to support NATO, US and European positions backing Ukraine have highlighted the importance of transatlantic relations to Rome and have undermined the narrative that Italy is in Russia’s thrall. Of course, it remains to be seen how Italy (like other powers) approaches the war and Russia in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to explore the dynamics between Italy and Russia, and Italy and China. It does this through an examination of political, security, economic and cultural ties to understand the degree to which Rome’s policy positions are shaped by external influence or internal choices. It is inherently difficult to demonstrate influence, but from what is observable this paper concludes that Italy is driving the relationship forwards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the economic connections that exist between the three powers play a role in influencing Italian planning and there have been efforts by both Moscow and Beijing to influence Rome’s thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines the historical background to Italy’s deep bilateral ties with both Russia and China. It then explores Rome’s complex and multifaceted relationship with Beijing and Moscow in the political, economic, military and cultural spheres, focusing on developments since 2010. The research draws on secondary literature and is informed by the authors’ longstanding engagement with officials and experts in Italy, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-and-interference&quot;&gt;INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to define and demonstrate influence, which in its attempt to advance national interests can be malign, benign or a complex mix. For example, the causal links between a business transaction and a subsequent government decision can only be proven if a specific trail of evidence has been left, especially as countries wish to maintain good relations with significant trading partners and will take actions to preserve those ties. While a correlation may be clear, it is hard to prove causality or demonstrate the existence of a deliberate ‘influence’ operation (unless, for example, some formal engagement between governments was also involved). Furthermore, the motivations of different actors and the relationships between them are difficult to assess objectively in the absence of detailed inside information. However, it is clearer when influence becomes interference, which includes meddling in governance processes, actively bribing or recruiting officials, or conducting espionage operations against them. This paper examines suggestions that Italian strategic thinking is being influenced by Russia and China, and highlights evidence of specific interference episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-long-history-of-engagement&quot;&gt;A LONG HISTORY OF ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing and Moscow have frequently cited Italy as a significant middle power with which they have deep historical links. Both governments regularly invoke their links to Italy’s rich history, from the deep cultural ties forged during the various stages of Russian imperial history, to Marco Polo or Matteo Ricci’s travels across Eurasia or contacts between the Chinese Han dynasty and Ancient Rome. The history of cultural cooperation is also cited as a key factor shaping relations by both countries’ leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia were part of the Communist sphere during the Cold War, while Italy, despite its membership in NATO and role as a close US ally, retained a strong Communist party which sought to preserve relations with Moscow and Beijing during the second half of the 20th century. While these links were fraught with tension, Italian financiers and investors saw China and Russia as economic opportunities to be explored throughout the post-Second World War period. This history has provided the foundations for contemporary Italian relations as many of the firms, and some of the individuals, involved in developing ties during the Cold War have continued to play a role in relations between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has historically seen Italy as one of the friendliest countries in Western Europe. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in 2020, ‘relations with Italy have always been based on continuity, mutual respect and regard for the sides’ interests’. Indeed, Italy was the first destination (outside the former Soviet states) of newly-elected Putin in 2000. Putin has continued to visit regularly, even after the EU imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Contacts with Draghi did not stop in the wake of the 2022 invasion – in a call on 30 March, the two leaders discussed the progress of peace negotiations and energy issues. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has strained relations with Italy, with Rome vocally condemning the invasion, openly supporting Ukraine, and forced to look for alternative energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, China and Italy signed an intergovernmental agreement on science and technology, which laid the foundation for repeated engagements between the two countries – this was the general pattern of their bilateral engagements until the signing of the BRI MoU in 2019. In 2004, as Premier Wen Jiabao made his maiden foreign tour to Europe, he stopped in Germany, Italy, the UK, Ireland and Belgium. He signed ‘Strategic Comprehensive Partnership’ agreements in the UK, Germany and Italy, elevating relations between China and these powers to new heights. Distinguishing Italy’s agreement from the others was the creation of a high-level intergovernmental committee to help with implementation, ‘the first time for China to set up such a high-level coordination body with a foreign government’. While this was intended to show the special nature of China–Italy relations, China regularly engages in this kind of rhetoric when undertaking bilateral engagements, seeking to highlight the ‘special’ nature of the particular interlocutor. At the same time, Italy’s embrace of the narrative highlights Rome’s desire to show it has positive relations with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy-as-a-middle-power-bridge&quot;&gt;ITALY AS A MIDDLE-POWER BRIDGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have maintained relationships with Italy which seek to take advantage of its consistent desire to reap the international prestige and favourable business deals that come from acting as a bridge between the two countries and the West. This balance with Russia may have changed in the wake of the current war in Ukraine, which may lead to a reassessment of Italy’s ties with Russian companies and institutions for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a senior Italian MP from the Democratic Party (PD) speaking before recent events, ‘Italy’s view on Russia does not change according to the political colour of the government in charge; what changes is the narrative’. Over the last decade, Italy has had seven governments, all of which have tried to act as a bridge to Russia, putting forward an image of ‘mediators’ – a common narrative in Italian foreign policy and even more critical in the case of the relationship with Moscow. The latter actively encourages this narrative in its public discourse towards Rome. For instance, the Russian ambassador to Italy declared in a 2018 interview: ‘Russia is counting on the fact that Italy, based on our historical friendly relations, will play that role as a bridge with Europe to overcome current tensions … We expect this mediating role to feature during the [next] European Council’. Relations with China are not dissimilar, with Italy sometimes presenting itself as a possible bridge between China and Europe. While it is not entirely clear that Rome has served this role, it suits Russia and China to be seen to engage with an influential European state, given their hostile relations with other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘special relationship’ between Russia and Italy became more evident during the two governments led by Giuseppe Conte, a member of the Five Star Movement (5SM), between 2018 and 2021. The first government was a coalition with Lega, a right-wing party that until the invasion of Ukraine has openly promoted a strong pro-Russian agenda. Their agenda reflected the economic interests of northern Italy (where most of the companies doing business with Russia are located, and where Lega’s powerbase is strongest), as well as an instrumental alignment with Russia’s conservative values that was functional to his political use of religion, and – according to allegations under investigation by Italian prosecutors – Russian financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic element features strongly in the Lega–5SM alliance government’s anti-sanctions lobby. Both parties agreed on a &lt;em&gt;contratto di governo&lt;/em&gt; (contract of governance, a codification of their agreed points of policy) that, among other things, recognised the crucial role of Russia as ‘an increasingly important economic and trade partner’ and ‘potential partner for NATO and the EU’ and advocated the lifting of EU sanctions. In October, Salvini attended a gathering of the Russo-Italian business community organised by Confindustria (the Italian Industrial Federation); he denounced the ‘madness’ of Western sanctions against Russia and said that he felt ‘at home’ in Moscow, launching a fierce attack on the EU. Salvini knew he could count on broad anti-sanctions support among the Italian business community and continued to criticise sanctions until shortly before the invasion. Despite Russia’s obvious support for the goal of eliminating sanctions, the policy circles close to Moscow’s officialdom showed some constraint towards Salvini’s blunt declarations, which did not lead to any tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China–Italy relations also show a roughly consistent pattern. An example is provided in the decision to sign an MoU on the BRI in 2019 – essentially, an agreement to do things together under the rubric of the BRI. Beijing had been keen to sign such a document with a major European country for some time as it provided an endorsement of Xi’s keynote foreign policy vision. In 2017, then Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni (a centre-left politician who is currently Italy’s representative to the European Commission) attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing as the most senior European representative. He described the initiative as ‘perhaps the most important infrastructure modernisation project underway in the world today’. He echoed views expressed by President Sergio Mattarella who had visited Beijing in February 2017 when he met with Xi. They discussed cooperation on a new Silk Road and Italy’s ability to help China get into the heart of Europe. Xi specifically referred to Italy as a power that could bridge China and the EU. The implicit trade-off suggested here was Italian assistance with Chinese efforts in Europe in exchange for trade, prosperity and investment offered under the BRI rubric. Consequently, it was of little surprise that two years later, Italy was at the front of the queue in Europe to sign an MoU for the BRI. Under Draghi, the narrative towards the BRI shifted with greater hesitancy and a push to engage with Western alternatives like the US’s Build Back Better World initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the actual signing of the BRI MoU reflects the confusing complexity of Italian politics in regard to China. Signed under a government whose general orientation was to engage with China, the document was pushed through at the behest of a senior minister within the coalition from the traditionally more Sinosceptic Lega, with Salvini’s approval. Italian leaders have consistently shown similar ambivalence towards China. For example, recently, Gentiloni echoed allies’ concerns about the signing of the BRI MoU, notably the security worries expressed by others and the damage it might do to Italy’s standing in Europe and with the US. This contrasted with his appearance as the most senior Western leader at the first Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, and the ‘road-to-50’ vision for China–Italy relations as they approached their 50th anniversary. When out of government in 2019, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who famously tried to sell his beloved Milan football team to Chinese owners and when in power signed the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement between Italy and China, had made fighting China a key plank in his push into Brussels politics. Even the consistently antagonistic Salvini, once out of office, appears to have had an additional about-face on China and engaged prominently with the Embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the critical factor across Rome’s relations with both Moscow and Beijing is that the underlying political orientation will largely be towards engagement. However, there are rhetorical oscillations depending on the political context, related both to the Italian leadership’s Atlantic orientation and the wider international environment – namely, severed ties with Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. Italy has sometimes become a useful tool for Russia and China when trying to show cracks in the Western alliance. It can appear to be more cautious towards China than Russia, though this is likely a product of a less direct link to Beijing than to Moscow (for example, Italy is very dependent on Russian gas – something that may now change – and lacks such critical dependencies with China whose geographical distance means it has always been a more remote partner). Furthermore, individual politicians have shown more consistently positive attitudes towards Russia than to China. It remains to be seen how permanent the fissure with Moscow will be in the wake of the Russia–Ukraine war. Italy has not seemed to lead European conversations about China (though has steered a line that matches European and US partners), but it has been robust in its condemnations of Russia from the very beginning of the invasion, likely a reflection of the more Atlanticist orientation of the just defenestrated Draghi government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy, Russia and China share some mutual security and strategic aims in key regions. This applies especially to Russia, which has stepped into an increasingly prominent role in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region since its military intervention in the Syrian conflict in 2015. While, for the most part, Italian interests tend to be aligned with those of NATO or the EU, there are divergences in certain areas, particularly North Africa, and Russia’s military and defence diplomacy in the MENA region have made the country an essential regional player. As a result, Russia has gained considerable leverage among Italian diplomats, for whom Russia’s diplomacy in the Middle East became ‘if not a model, at least a point of reference, thanks to its ability to have relations with all opposing parties’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya is probably the regional crisis where Italy has the biggest stake, in light of its colonial past, current energy interests and migration concerns. In recognition of Russia’s role in the Libyan crisis, Rome has tried to involve Moscow in its diplomatic initiatives, chiefly the Palermo conference in November 2018, despite the countries backing opposing sides. According to a politician from the PD, Rome relied heavily on Moscow to make Libyan General Khalifa Haftar participate in the conference, which legitimised Russia’s role in the eyes of other regional actors, granting a sort of ‘Italian pass’ to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to defence, there is unsurprisingly little engagement between Italy and the two countries given Italy’s alliances and treaties with the US, the EU and NATO. An arms embargo with China is still in force due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, while sanctions and the invasion of Ukraine have further limited defence cooperation with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain level of diplomatic and technical engagement, but defence diplomacy is not a major feature of the relationships. A significant moment in Italy–Russia defence relations came in 2002 during the Berlusconi government when Italy hosted a NATO–Russia Summit, which was used to re-establish ties between the two adversaries. More recently, Italy–Russia defence relations were dealt a blow when it was revealed that an Italian navy captain was recruited by Russian intelligence and sold classified national and NATO documents, with Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio speaking of ‘an act of hostility’ and immediately expelling the two Russian officials based at the Embassy linked to the case. Contrary to other espionage events in which Russia has been caught out, the Kremlin did not immediately reciprocate and instead tried to downplay the event, with Russia’s Ambassador Sergey Razov remarking that ‘we hope that this incident will not negatively affect the overall constructive relations between our countries’. Eventually, the Kremlin expelled one Italian diplomat roughly a month after Italy expelled two Russian diplomats linked with the spy scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major engagements or clashes linked to espionage do not play a similarly big role when it comes to China. High-profile security engagement has come in the form of Chinese police joining their Italian counterparts on patrol in Rome and Milan – ostensibly to provide support for the many Chinese tourists that come to Italy every year. It may also be to help Italian authorities develop their capabilities to police the growing Chinese communities in places like Prato. Serious organised crime within the wealthy Chinese community in Italy’s north has been identified as a problem, with links to state insitutions identified in the ‘River of Money’ (&lt;em&gt;Fiume di denaro&lt;/em&gt;) investigation, which revealed that around €4.5 billion had been siphoned out of the country in tax evasion in a system that used the Bank of China’s Florence branch. More recently, police uncovered €200 million being sent from Padova to China, part of a much bigger investigation in which Chinese firms were openly flouting tax laws and using the Bank of China to send money back to China. These scandals were a source of some limited embarrassment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where defence relations become more significant is in the case of arms and dual-use technology sectors. A report found that Italy and other EU states exported €346 million worth of arms to Russia between 2015 and 2020, despite the restrictions posed by EU sanctions. In 2021, Italy delivered €21.9 million worth of arms and ammunition to Russia. Italy’s defence industry seems willing to find ways of skirting around sanctions. A 2019 investigation accused Italian defence manufacturer Iveco of supplying light multirole vehicles to the Russian Defence Ministry. In March, Italian journalists spotted Russian forces using Iveco vehicles on the Ukrainian frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has had a science and technology relationship with China since its 1978 agreement. Since then, numerous agreements in this sector have been signed, including on the successful China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite, which aims to improve the capability to monitor natural disasters from space. Reflecting the high-level engagement in the project, Xi and Mattarella exchanged congratulatory notes and hoped for greater future cooperation between Italian and Chinese experts. However, Chinese firms are increasingly targeting Italian defence firms for acquisition. In 2012, Chinese firm SHIG-Weichai purchased 75% of Ferretti, predominantly an Italian luxury yacht maker but also a defence contractor. In October 2020, Conte went to the port of Taranto, where he announced that Ferretti (now 85% owned by SHIG-Weichai) was expanding its presence in the port, which was particularly sensitive given the nearby NATO base. This followed a report by the parliamentary oversight committee of the intelligence and security services, Copasir, which expressed concern about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian defence cooperation with China and Russia broadly adheres to the commitments and values of a NATO member. But in the defence industrial space, Italy has been a site for both Chinese and Russian acquisition of high-quality European equipment. While the government has sought to control this flow of technology, it is not clear how firmly this is being implemented, suggesting a relationship that is at least one of tacit acceptance or wilful ignorance in some cases. The recent case of military drone manufacturer Alpi Aviation – which was covertly purchased by a state-linked Chinese consortium – raised questions about oversight. While the deal was eventually reversed, there are concerns that some technology leakage may have taken place. This sort of an aggressive policy by Chinese firms is not surprising and is not necessarily part of an influence campaign, but rather is a reflection of the quality of Italian firms. Whether the sales were missed by oversight institutions on purpose, by accident, or as a result of influence is unknown. It is also the case that this general sort of behaviour and skirting of the rules is not anomalous for European firms, though the Italian case of Alpi Aviation does seem to be a particularly extreme one. It is not clear the degree to which the Russian or Chinese state have sought to exert excessive leverage through defence ties, recognising the clear benefits of pragmatically maintaining the existing wider relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;ECONOMICS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic considerations play a large role in shaping Rome’s relations with Moscow and Beijing. Powerful and vocal financial lobbies in Italy actively promote their business interests to the Italian government and drive the trade relationship. Both China and Russia enjoy close economic ties with Italy, with China ranking fourth among Italy’s trade partners in 2021 and Russia occupying the 11th position on the same list. Russia has been one of Italy’s primary sources of energy, with around 40% of gas supplies delivered by Russian firm Gazprom. Although EU sanctions have not yet targeted gas at the time of writing, Italy is already looking to reduce its energy dependence on Moscow. Italy is not as dependent on China, though recent commercial deals suggest a growing penetration by Chinese firms into the Italian economy – in 2019, there were some 51,000 Chinese firms in Italy, of which 10,000 were in Lombardy. Since then, at least seven new investment deals have been inked by Chinese firms in Italy, with a known value of at least €270 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian trade with both countries is complicated by sanctions and broader issues linked to the West’s turn against Moscow and Beijing. In 2013, before EU sanctions, the total trade exchange between Russia and Italy was €31 billion, while in 2019 (before the coronavirus pandemic) it was down to €22 billion (an increase on €8 billion in 2016). According to Italian figures, total trade with China was around €45 billion in 2020 (€12.9 billion export/€32.1 billion import), which was only slightly up from €44.6 billion in 2019 (export/import balance almost identical). These numbers have been on an upward trajectory since 2013, with imports from China, in particular, jumping by almost €10 billion during the same period and exports by a more modest €3 billion. In the overall scheme of Italian trading, imports from China are second only to Germany. While the volumes are substantial in absolute terms, they remain modest compared to Italian trading with European partners such as France or Germany. Italy’s dependence on China seems to be growing (particularly in terms of imports), while its trade with Russia may now decline in the wake of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese investment into Italy is signficant. By the end of 2019, there were 405 Chinese or Hong Kong-based direct investment entities in Italy. In monetary terms, the flow from China to Italy increased from €573 million in 2015 to €4.9 billion in 2018 (in terms of Italian investment into China, the numbers dropped considerably from €237.7 million in 2016 to €1.4 million in 2020). The most significant goods for both export and investment were machines, while textiles and telecommunications products were the most significant imports. The overwhelming volume of these investments and exports are from Italy’s wealthy northern regions, with Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piemonte and Tuscany accounting for around 80% of the total in 2019. Lombardy is the biggest site of Chinese investment and entrepreneurs (around 45% of the overall total). That likely reflects Xi’s decision as vice-president to meet with the president of the Lombardy region on his 2011 visit to Italy, where he specifically highlighted the desire of Chinese investors to come to the region. The strategy of targeting Lombardy (one of the wealthiest parts of Europe) is one that has clearly had an effect, with the local chamber of commerce noting the volume of Chinese firms in the region had jumped by 18% between 2014 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-influence&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INFLUENCE?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to anti-sanctions lobbying, the most impactful public activities are carried out mainly by Italian business associations such as Confindustria, the Italian–Russian Chamber of Commerce and the Lombardy–Russia Association. Prominent business figures also play a role, including Bank Intesa’s Russia president, Antonio Fallico, and former president of Confindustria and the Italian oil and gas group ENI, Emma Marcegaglia, who have publicly voiced their opposition to sanctions. Events, such as the ‘Eurasian seminars’ organised by the Roscongress Foundation and the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in collaboration with Bank Intesa, represent other substantial lobbying and networking opportunities for key Russian and Italian economic actors. But, according to a participant in the 2019 edition of the seminar, the event was more ‘a meeting between the Russian ambassador and the Italian business community’, organised ‘by Italians for Italians’. The participant even felt like one of the goals was to stress Fallico’s role as a ‘facilitator’ for Italian companies and a valuable partner for Moscow. The bulk of businesses and organisations lobbying for scrapping sanctions are in the north, especially Lombardy and Veneto, where economic ties with Russia are stronger: of the 434 Italian companies with at least one branch in Russia, 143 of them are in Lombardy, while Veneto comes second with 79 companies. In 2016, the ruling coalition in Veneto approved a resolution aiming to ‘promote the establishment of a committee against sanctions against Russia, for the recognition of Crimea’s self-determination right, and the defence of Venetian products’. As of 22 June 2022, only one Italian company (Assicurazioni Generali) has exited Russia completely due to the invasion; other companies have either temporarily suspended their operations (Ferrari, Prada), are holding off on new investments (Barilla, Bank Intesa) or simply continuing business as usual (Benetton, UniCredit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a much greater concern about the threat of China’s economic might in the wider Italian economy. On the one hand, in 2019, Confindustria expressed concerns about the imbalance in trade between China and Italy and the lack of reciprocal access to Chinese markets for Italian firms and products. They have called for greater European cooperation and echoed many of the sentiments visible from other industrial bodies in Europe that are worried about Chinese companies overwhelming their markets. The traditional core of the Italian economy is small to medium-sized enterprises, precisely the sort of firms that struggle to compete against globalisation and Chinese behemoths. Yet, shortly after Confindustria’s statement, the Italian government signed its MoU on the BRI – a decision which goes against the view of one of its main industrial representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaints about Chinese market control and sanctions against Russia emanate most strongly from Italy’s northern industrial heartland. For China and Russia, there is a natural interest in focusing on this part of Italy, as it generates most of the country’s economic activity. The critical question for this paper is the degree to which China and Russia see the economic relations here as a lever, which they can use to influence the overall strategic approach towards their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, powerful business figures have always played a significant role in Italian relations with both China and Russia. ENI’s boss Enrico Mattei was carving out deals for his firm in China and the Soviet Union long before the normalisation of relations. Cesare Romiti, the principal shareholder of Fiat, was part of the firm’s push into China in the 1970s, establishing a China–Italy Institute to help develop relations. Fiat-Chrysler has invested over €3.5 billion into China and has enjoyed an uptick in Chinese sales in recent years. Pirelli’s CEO, Marco Tronchetti Provera, allowed 45.5% of the firm to be bought by the Chinese state-owned firm ChemChina and BRI-specific state investment vehicle the Silk Road Fund. Tronchetti Provera is also a key player in the relaunch of the Italian–Russian Business Committee for Economic Cooperation, a joint Italian–Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiative that he has been chairing since 2020 together with Dmitry Konov, chairman of the management board of SIBUR Holding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class of business leaders is likely a source of influence and connectivity between Italy, China and Russia and helps shape the political view towards Beijing and Moscow. Tronchetti Provera, for example, has supported projects focused on the Italy–China relationship and features regularly in the press discussing ties with China. When commenting on Draghi’s government and how it might change the Italy–China relationship, he focused on the fact that it seemed to encourage a greater European balance between the relationships with Beijing and Washington and praised the return to multilateralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome’s proclivity towards engagement with both Beijing and Moscow is actively favoured by Italy’s powerful northern business elite. Yet, this support may stem from their assessments of business interests rather than active external influence campaigns or covert activity. For example, Tronchetti Provera’s sale of Pirelli to Chinese firms caused concerns in Italy at the time. However, it was something that was driven by economic opportunity, with him talking about having sought Japanese or Korean investors as well, but ultimately settling on terms he dictated with Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;culture-and-the-media&quot;&gt;CULTURE AND THE MEDIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has long been a significant attraction to Chinese tourists (generating considerable revenue for the country), though their interest is often more focused on shopping than culture. Russian tourists have also long favoured Italy’s resorts but the combination of sanctions and the closure of the EU airspace to Russian airlines and private jets has caused an abrupt decrease in tourist numbers. Moreover, while there are state-sponsored Russian and Chinese cultural institutes in Italy, it is not clear that they have any broader goal than their stated one of helping with culture and language and what soft power might flow from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s more significant soft power tools are narratives focused on anti-American and anti-globalisation sentiment; and separately, conservative and religious values. Anti-Americanism is a powerful narrative used by Russia to influence people from both far-right and far-left backgrounds. In Italy, as with other major European powers, anti-American attitudes are widespread and connected to both the US government’s unpopular actions (such as the invasion of Iraq) and deeply rooted country-specific anti-American traditions in some groups such as Italy’s radical left. Over 17% of Italians surveyed in March/April 2022 blamed NATO for the conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s conservative narratives, on the other hand, attract far-right conservative parties across Europe. Despite its anti-liberal and anti-EU narratives, or perhaps in virtue of them, Russia frames itself as part of the European community, a vital member of a ‘true Europe’ based on a common Christian identity. There may have also been concrete actions in support of conservative groups in Italy. In spring 2019, Italian journalists reported that the World Congress of Families in Verona received financial support from the oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, one of the richest men in Russia, who was also involved in the reports about Russian money going to the Lega. The Congress brought together Russian Orthodox nationalists, American evangelical conservatives and Italian ultra-Catholics with Lega’s political support to advance an anti-abortion, anti-divorce and anti-gay agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the media space, both China and Russia have sought influence. Russia has appeared to attempt disinformation campaigns, for example, during the 2019 European Parliament elections, though there is limited evidence regarding the scope or impact of the operation. After the invasion of Ukraine, the EU Council suspended RT and Sputnik’s broadcasting in the EU. Sputnik, unlike RT, used to offer dedicated programming in Italian, but its audience was limited – in February 2021, its YouTube page, now taken down, had less than 50,000 followers (three times less than Sputnik Turkey, for example). However, the Italian media landscape remains vulnerable to Russian disinformation. In May 2022, Copasir launched an investigation into Russian commentators who have appeared on Italian TV programmes and are suspected of being on Putin’s payroll. Chinese state broadcasters have a long history of establishing content-sharing relationships with their Italian counterparts – for example, between Ansa (Italy’s largest news agency) and Xinhua (the Chinese state media organ). Still, it is unclear how effective they are in influencing the Italian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both China and Russia used the pandemic as an opportunity to promote their narratives, and Italy was a target. Sputnik V, the only Covid-19 vaccine with its own Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter handle (at least at the time of writing), also turned into an ‘unlikely new social media star’ through its bold communication campaigns. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s website highlighted positively San Marino, a microstate completely enclosed by Italy, when it elected to use Sputnik V to mark the difference with the more chaotic vaccine situation in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts were more focused on advancing a positive vision of China, and attempting to capture the social media airwaves of pandemic discourse in Italy and promote China’s supportive role. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular, sought to highlight what China was doing to support Italy as the first European power to be hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, though it later emerged some of the videos being circulated and promoted by officials were fake. Chinese state media’s attempt to deflect blame for the outbreak of the virus saw it suggest Italy was the origin point. This generated an angry tirade from Matteo Salvini, and spoke of a broader growing mistrust towards China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has attempted through fairly blunt measures to influence the Italian debate on China. In November 2019, the Chinese Ambassador Li Junhua protested loudly after a bipartisan event was held at the senate in which Hong Kong protest leader Joshua Wong was brought in as a speaker online. The ambassador’s protest drew condemnation from across the board, including the government. Public protests related to Hong Kong at around the same time were plagued by counter-protests in which angry Chinese nationalists chased and threatened pro-Hong Kong supporters in Milan. It was not clear that the embassy or consulate in Milan were involved, though their online profiles were drawn into subsequent online discussions seeking to punish the pro-Hong Kong protesters. More clearly linked to the Chinese embassy was a formal letter sent to the municipality in Brescia calling on them to cancel an exhibit that was being held by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao, which merely ended up promoting the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These counterproductive efforts by the embassy to stifle debate have been matched by similarly uninspired attempts to advance pro-China narratives. An example of this emerged in June 2021 when the influential founder of 5SM, Beppe Grillo, posted a report entitled ‘Xinjiang: Understanding Complexity, Building Peace’. The report largely echoed Chinese talking points about what was going on in Xinjiang and loudly pushed back on the genocide narratives and sanctions policies being pushed through by European governments (including Italy) at the time. With no single author, the report relied heavily on Chinese official sources and was instead credited to a list of European experts, Grillo and a 5SM Senator, Vito Petrocelli, who was then president of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee. It was unclear how the report had been funded, or whom it was aimed at influencing, but it was attacked in the Italian press. It was, however, promoted by US alternative news outlet Grayzone, which has regularly disseminated Chinese and Russian disinformation campaigns. Perhaps more influential was an article published by former undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Economic Development, Michele Geraci, who in 2021 went on a Chinese government-sponsored visit to Xinjiang, publishing articles and media afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have been accused of working together in the information domain. China has been learning from Russian disinformation techniques and spreading conflicting conspiracy theories: ‘both China and Russia have worked not to spread a single specific story and convey the idea that the truth is unknowable’. Both states are accused of spreading a narrative on a sloppy and patchy EU coronavirus response. Copasir specifically denounced Russia and China’s ‘infodemic’ during the crisis, highlighting recurrent themes such as disorders in supermarkets, the government’s inefficiency, but also explicit migration references, which often manipulated the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there seems to be evidence that China’s and Russia’s campaigns have had short-term effects (such as media resonance, or among individual politicians), it is not clear that it has generated the change in national behaviour that Beijing and Moscow wanted (if that is what was sought). It is possible that individual relations have been cultivated of senior figures which could then be manipulated to China’s or Russia’s favour, but it is not clear that the narratives that are being advanced by the individuals are ones that they are promoting out of external influence or their own belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a G7, NATO and EU member, Italy is a significant player on the world stage in institutions currently hostile to China and Russia. Yet, Rome has consistently demonstrated a willingness to engage with both countries, act as a bridge and consequently potentially undermine Western cohesion. What is harder to understand is the degree to which this willingness to engage is a product of influence campaigns by Beijing and Moscow or Italian geopolitical pragmatism and strategic hedging. Moreover, although it is hard to assess the long-term impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine, Italy’s strong condemnation of Russia’s actions so far points to a rethinking regarding its ties with Moscow, despite public attitudes to the war and the continued interest of Italian businesses in maintaining relations. However, the breakup of Draghi’s government coalition in July 2022 exposes the tensions and divergences in Italy’s wider politics, as well as its relationship with Russia in particular. Hence, it remains to be seen whether this is a permanent shift or something which may yet be reversed with a change of political power or economic hardship as a result of the cost of living crisis precipitated by the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that economic relations, often driven by the interests of large Italian industrial groups, provide a strong underlying basis for the default mode in Italian foreign policy of continued engagement. The web of business contacts brings consistency to relationships that the more variable Italian political system may not. The current government appears more focused on strengthening Italy’s role in Western institutions than its predecessor, leading to greater pushback against China in particular and, more recently, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the key question is how much any of China’s or Russia’s activity in Italy can be characterised as effective influence or interference operations. From the available information, it is difficult to ascribe Rome’s choices to external influence, rather than a longstanding Italian foreign policy approach of trying to take a middle path in its relations; staying friendly with both the US and European allies, while at the same time maintaining positive relations with Moscow and Beijing. In this context, the country’s industrial class – mostly in Italy’s wealthy northern regions – functions as an influential constituency that favours keeping doors open with China and Russia. There is a similar tendency within the political class, with some groups with more dogmatic views on China or Russia (both positive and negative) making these choices for their domestic political calculations rather than direct external influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Russia appears to see Italy as a more significant partner than China does. While Beijing is appreciative of Rome’s useful role in appearing to weaken transatlantic alliances against China, the Politburo seems relatively disinterested in Italy – something that is testified by the limited number of visits by paramount Chinese leaders to Italy. During the early days of the pandemic, there was a focus by China on Italy, but this seemed pragmatic and ultimately did not lead to a major change in perspectives. Economic relations appear driven by industrial interests, which serves broader government goals of improving the Chinese industrial and technological base as part of the Made in China 2025 national economic vision and, more simply, good economic opportunities for cash-rich Chinese firms. In contrast, Putin has frequently and overtly sought to use Rome to prove the lack of uniformity in European (or transatlantic) views towards Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s key conclusion is that Italy continues to be able to maintain considerable agency in its relations between China and Russia. While it is clear both powers have strong links into the country, and have used Italy as a conduit to acceptance on the wider international level, Rome has seemed a willing partner. This is something that reflects the approach taken both to China and Russia by a number of major European powers. The degree to which these decisions have been shaped by external influence or interference is very difficult to gauge in aggregate, though some individual cases do shine through. However, what is equally clear is that the transatlantic alliance remains a cornerstone in governmental strategic thinking, meaning Italy’s choices are unlikely to ever completely contradict its transatlantic partners. At the same time, it is equally unlikely that Italy will ever seek to completely sever relations with China and Russia – a decision that is driven principally by national strategic thinking as opposed to external influence or interference.&lt;/p&gt;

Senior Russian and Iranian officials have met frequently in recent months to boost cooperation and sign economic and military agreements.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Moscow and Tehran have long cooperated when their interests have aligned, especially in opposing the US in the Middle East, but their recent engagements highlight more concerted efforts to strengthen their partnership. Presidents Vladimir Putin and Ebrahim Raisi have spoken at least four times since the invasion began — more than either individual has engaged most other world leaders. Putin visited Tehran in July 2022, marking his first foreign travel outside the territory of the former Soviet Union since the war began. These interactions reflect a deepening and potentially more balanced relationship wherein Russia is no longer the dominant party. This partnership will likely challenge US and allied interests in Europe, the Middle East, and around the globe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-cooperation&quot;&gt;Economic Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran are working to increase bilateral commerce, trade, and use of non-dollar currencies. Russian and Iranian officials have agreed to the following in recent months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing Iranian trade centers in Moscow and joint economic zones;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing passenger flights between Russia and Iran and other aviation cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing food exports to Russia; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing the use of the Kremlin’s Mir electronic payment system to replace the SWIFT financial transaction service, from which Russian banks were banned in response to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian officials also announced that they were transferring goods from Russia to India via an Iranian transit corridor for the first time in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding bilateral trade and doing it without the US dollar are long-standing Russian and Iranian goals. One could easily overstate the significance of these agreements before they materialize. Nevertheless, Moscow is seemingly pursuing these efforts more urgently, likely in response to growing global isolation and international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is pursuing greater economic engagement with Belarus as well. The Iranian industry minister signed agreements on automobile manufacturing, medicine, and transportation in Minsk on July 29. The agreements between Iran and Belarus underscore Tehran’s willingness to support Minsk despite international sanctions. The West has sanctioned both the Russian and Belarussian automobile industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran — likely with Russian support — may be trying to enhance its cooperation with the Union State, which is a supranational organization through which the Kremlin has sought to integrate Belarus with Russia, particularly their economies and militaries, with mixed results. The Iranian industry minister announced in Minsk that Iran would finalize a comprehensive cooperation agreement with Belarus in the next year. Iran has pursued similar agreements with China, Russia, and Venezuela in recent years, reflecting its strategic alignment with revisionist powers against the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-cooperation&quot;&gt;Military Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran have increased their military cooperation in Ukraine, Syria, and Venezuela in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Iran is providing weapons and possibly conducting cyberattacks to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Iran agreed to provide some its most sophisticated military drones, such as the Shahed-129 and Shahed-191, to Russia for use in Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official claimed on August 5 that the Kremlin had received 46 drones thus far, and Western media has indicated that Iran could provide up to 300 total. An unidentified US official claimed on August 9 that Russian personnel are currently in Iran training to use the drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is likely providing Iran sophisticated military platforms in exchange for the drones. Russia launched a Kanopus-V satellite on behalf of Iran on August 9. The satellite allows Tehran to collect high resolution satellite imagery to support its external military operations and attacks on US and partner forces in the Middle East. The Kremlin may also provide Iran fourth-generation fighter jets, such as the Su-35, allowing the Iranian armed forces to operate a modern air force. Unconfirmed social media reports suggest that Russia is training Iranian pilots and technicians on operating Su-35s. It is unclear whether Moscow has functional military aircraft to spare, but part of the recent Russia-Iran aviation agreement includes sending Russian aircraft to Iran for maintenance, repairs, and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran may have also organized a cyberattack to support Russia against NATO. A hacking group, Farigh al Tahereh, conducted a denial-of-service attack against Romanian websites, including the Romanian border guards’ website, on July 15. Iranian state media has described Farigh al Tahereh as an “Iraqi resistance group” — terminology usually reserved for Iranian proxies. Farigh al Tahereh is likely either the cyber wing of an Iranian proxy in Iraq or a front group for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iran may have targeted the Romanian border guards to threaten Europe with an overwhelming influx of migrants or refugees driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and consequent global food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran could provide additional military or cyber assistance to Russia, particularly ballistic and cruise missiles, in exchange for further economic and military benefits. Tehran maintains a large and rapidly advancing missile program and could help Russian forces replenish their dwindling missile stockpiles with Iranian variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; Moscow and Tehran may be coordinating to replace Russian units with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria. The Kremlin has reportedly drawn down its forces in Syria in recent months to send reinforcements to Ukraine, leaving a security vacuum for the IRGC to fill. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met with Syrian President Bashar al Assad on May 8, reportedly to discuss transferring Russian positions to Iran and its proxies. IRGC Commander Hossein Salami paid his first known visit to Syria sometime in July 2022, likely to coordinate and oversee these transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venezuela.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has organized military exercises with Iran, China, and other countries to take place in Venezuela from August 13 to 27, likely as a show of force to the United States. China, Iran, and Russia have increased their joint military exercises in recent years, but this upcoming exercise will be the first in the western hemisphere, demonstrating these countries’ ability to strike the American homeland in the event of a larger conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-power-dynamics&quot;&gt;Changing Power Dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran enjoys a stronger position than it had previously in this partnership. Russia has historically been the dominant party, but Iranian leaders have extracted military concessions from the Kremlin in recent months. Tehran has traditionally sought to purchase military technologies from Moscow rather than the inverse. The Kremlin fielding Iranian drones in Ukraine will showcase these platforms to other potential international buyers, further benefitting Iran. Furthermore, Russia has previously tried to limit Iranian influence in Syria but is now enabling its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Russian concessions indicate a shifting power dynamic as Putin seeks economic and military support from a position of growing need. Mounting global isolation and the war in Ukraine are weakening Putin and forcing him to lean on Iran (and other revisionist powers) more heavily. Putin may seek to benefit from Iranian leaders’ experience operating under heavy international sanctions and building military systems with devalued currencies and limited access to foreign parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-implications&quot;&gt;US Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepening Russo-Iranian ties will almost certainly threaten US and allied interests in Europe, the Middle East, and around the globe. Iranian material support to Russia may help the Kremlin achieve some of its military objectives in Ukraine and eastern Europe. Russian support to Iran’s nascent military space program and air force could improve Iranian targeting and increase the threat it poses to the US and its partners in the Middle East. Growing Iranian control and influence in Syria will enable the IRGC from Syria to threaten US military bases in the Middle East and our regional partners, such as Israel and Turkey, more effectively. Finally, Moscow and Tehran will likely leverage their deepening economic ties to mitigate US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nicholas Carl, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">Russia and Iran have expanded their strategic partnership since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Chinese escalation has precipitated the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis, leading to international calls for China to immediately halt its military activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeline-of-key-chinese-military-activities&quot;&gt;Timeline of Key Chinese Military Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prior-to-speaker-pelosis-arrival&quot;&gt;Prior to Speaker Pelosi’s Arrival&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the leadup to Speaker Pelosi’s travel to Taiwan on August 2, the PLA took a series of actions to demonstrate its resolve and willingness to escalate, with the hope of deterring Speaker Pelosi from setting foot on the island and backing up China’s increasingly stern public warnings with action. This included military drills and operations across multiple theater commands, including to the north, west, east, and south of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 28, China began testing Taiwan’s defenses by sending unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over Taiwan’s Dongyin Island, a well-defended Taiwan outpost that is part of its Matsu Islands located close to mainland China. This marked the first time that China has sent drones over Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By August 1, China placed the PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC), which leads military operations against Taiwan, on high alert. There was significant movement of troops and equipment within the ETC in the regions closest to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA further repositioned key military assets from other regions to the Eastern Theater Command. The PLA Navy’s two operational aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, had previously deployed from their respective home ports of Qingdao and Sanya, and were moving in the waters around China. Large Chinese towboats were also spotted en route towards Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced military exercises and live fire drills in the South China Sea from August 2–6. The PLA’s Southern Theater Command (STC) — which is responsible for operations in the South China Sea and some operations around Taiwan — was placed on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 2, PLA aircraft flew close to the Taiwan Strait centerline. A number of civilian flights at multiple airports in Fujian Province were canceled, suggesting that China was clearing the airspace in the Taiwan Strait to engage in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these activities caused speculation among Chinese netizens that the PLA may have been ready to engage in some military operation against Pelosi’s entourage if her plane flew the typical route to Taipei, traveling through the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait to reach Taipei. Although it is unlikely that China considered shooting down her plane or engaging in aggressive intercepts of her airplane — which could risk a deadly accident or miscalculation — it is possible that China may have wanted to send planes to “escort” her flight. The PLA may have also considered limited operations against U.S. or Taiwan planes accompanying her plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, her aircraft (and accompanying escorts) took a detour that avoided the PLA exercise in the SCS and flew to Taipei via the east of Taiwan. It would have been significantly more risky for China to engage in military operations to the east of Taiwan given the prepositioning of multiple U.S. military assets in the vicinity and the difficulty of supporting PLA operations at longer distances and during nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;after-speaker-pelosi-landed-in-taipei&quot;&gt;After Speaker Pelosi Landed in Taipei&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After China failed to deter Speaker Pelosi from landing in Taiwan, the PLA rapidly transitioned to punishing Taiwan and exercising China’s capabilities to engage in a range of military operations against the island. This involved PLA live-fire rocket and missile launches on August 4 as well as significant joint military operations from August 4 to August 7. At the same time, China stepped up air intrusions against Taiwan’s offshore islands located close to China, namely Kinmen and Matsu. These actions were accompanied by an aggressive disinformation operation to exaggerate the extent and scale of China’s capabilities. Despite these efforts, and up until August 8, PLA aircraft have not intruded into the airspace of Taiwan’s main island and Chinese military vessels have stayed outside of the main island’s territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline below lists key Chinese actions starting after Speaker Pelosi’s arrival. The timeline reflects publicly available information as of 12 PM EDT on August 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-august-2&quot;&gt;Tuesday, August 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Speaker Pelosi landed, China’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) said that it is on “high alert” and will launch a “series of targeted military operations as countermeasures.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese state media announced that the PLA would conduct military exercises from August 4-7 in six zones throughout the Taiwan Strait and around the island of Taiwan. State media detailed that the exercises would include: a series of joint military operations around Taiwan; joint air and sea exercises in the sea and airspace of the northern, southwestern, and southeastern Taiwan Islands; long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait; and test firing of conventional missiles in the waters east of Taiwan. Notices warned civilian and commercial traffic to avoid exercise areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Taiwan’s MND refuted false Chinese rumors that Su-35 fighter jets crossed the Taiwan Strait when Pelosi’s plane entered Taiwan’s airspace. Instead, for August 2, the PLA flew 21 aircraft into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), including 10 J-16 fighters, eight J-11 fighters, one KJ-500 airborne early warning and command (AEW&amp;amp;C) aircraft, one Y-9 electronic warfare (EW) aircraft, and one Y-8 electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-august-3&quot;&gt;Wednesday, August 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Wednesday, the PLA began exercising in regions around Taiwan. The ETC announced that China had “organized joint combat training exercises in the northern, southwestern and southeastern waters and airspace” near Taiwan and the exercises involved most PLA elements under the ETC. The PLA focused on training for “joint blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control operation, and the joint combat capabilities of troops.” The actual extent of China’s operations remain unclear: for example, Chinese media shared alleged videos of J-20 fighter jets taking off, but Taiwan’s MND clarified that no J-20s had operated in Taiwan’s ADIZ on August 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reports emerged that China had established a seventh zone for the exercises, located east of the island. It was set to last from August 4–8, meaning it would go one day longer than the six other zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 27 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. Six J-11 fighters and 16 Su-30 fighters crossed the Taiwan Strait median line and six J-11 fighters flew into the southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two Chinese UAVs penetrated the airspace over Taiwan’s Kinmen Islands, located just off the coast of mainland China. This marked the first time PLA drones have done so. Taiwan’s Kinmen Defense Command responded by firing flares to warn the drones to leave Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-august-4&quot;&gt;Thursday, August 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA began exercises in the six designated zones. China launched long-range rockets and conventional ballistic missiles from four main regions within China into multiple exercise zones to the north, east, and south of Taiwan. Japan’s MND reported nine missiles were fired by China into four exercise zones, while China and Taiwan reported 11 missiles, with some Chinese reports suggesting only three zones were hit. Video footage posted by official Chinese media suggested that at least some of the missiles were DF-15B short-range missiles. At least five missiles splashed down in Zone 4, on Taiwan’s east coast within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Japan’s MND estimated that at least four of the missiles flew over the island of Taiwan — an unprecedented move by China. However, Taiwan downplayed the danger noting that the ballistic missiles flew in a high path more than 100 km and were therefore not within Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA fired missiles from Zone 1, near Taiwan’s Matsu islands, and fired long-range rockets near Matsu, Wuqiu, Dongyin, and other outlying islands, contributing to concerns in Taiwan of China’s intent around the islands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Eastern Theater Command said that it was mobilizing more than 100 fighter planes, bombers and other aircraft, as well as more than 10 destroyers and frigates, to “carry out joint closure and control operations.” Images showed military helicopters flying past Pingtan island, one of Taiwan’s closest points to mainland China. China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, joined the exercises around Taiwan accompanied by at least one nuclear-powered attack submarine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 22 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 12 Su-30 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and eight J-11 and two J-16 fighters crossing the median line southwest of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan reported that drones flew over the waters surrounding the Kinmen, Dongyin, and Matsu Islands on Thursday. UAVs were also spotted in the waters near Japan. During the morning and night, a Chinese reconnaissance drone and another reconnaissance/attack drone flew into the East China Sea, passing between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima and into the Pacific Ocean, and then turned to head south of the Sakishima Islands. They then turned and traced the same path in the opposite direction. Another presumed Chinese drone flew in from the East China Sea and flew circles over the area. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force scrambled fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-august-5&quot;&gt;Friday, August 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA ETC announced it conducted air and sea combat drills to the north, east, and southwest of Taiwan to test troops’ joint combat capabilities. According to the Taiwan MND, the PLA dispatched 68 aircraft and 13 vessels as part of military activities around the Taiwan Strait. This included PLA assets crossing the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 49 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ and across the median line. This included 24 Su-30 fighters and six J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and 10 J-16 fighters, seven J-10 fighters, one Y-8 EW aircraft, and one Y-8 ASW aircraft crossing the median line southwest of Taiwan. This was the second-highest number of aircraft ever recorded entering Taiwan’s ADIZ in a single day, superseded only by 56 aircraft on October 4, 2021. More broadly, PLA ADIZ incursions averaged nearly 26 aircraft per day between August 2–8, a major uptick from an average of roughly three aircraft per day from January 1–August 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four PLA drones flew over the waters around Kinmen Island and nearby Lieyu Island and Beiding Islet. In response, the Kinmen Defense Command fired warning flares to repel the drones. Around the same time, similar aircraft were detected flying over Liang Island and Dongyin Island, which are part of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;saturday-august-6&quot;&gt;Saturday, August 6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the third day of exercises, the PLA focused on testing troops’ land attack and sea assault capabilities with joint air and naval operations in the sea and airspace to the north, east, and southwest of Taiwan. These missions aimed at clearing paths for amphibious landing forces to launch beach assaults against Taiwan. PLA ETC naval forces deployed warships, warplanes, and coast-based anti-ship missiles. Taiwan’s MND reported multiple PLA vessels (later numbered at 14 ships) around the Taiwan Strait, with some having crossed the median line and some possibly simulating attacks against “HVA” (high-value assets).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Maritime Safety Administration announced zones in the Yellow Sea where exercises would take place from August 5–15. China also announced exercises in the Bohai Sea set to start Monday, August 8, and last until September 8.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 20 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 10 Su-30 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and four J-16 fighters, one Y-8 ASW aircraft, and one Y-20U aerial refueling aircraft flying into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six PLA drones flew over waters around Kinmen and Beiding Islet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-august-7&quot;&gt;Sunday, August 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the scheduled final day of the exercises, Taiwan’s MND reported 14 PLA Navy vessels and 66 PLA aircraft in the area. The PLA ETC said it conducted live-fire drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan “as planned.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While exercises in the initial six zones were set to end, the seventh zone (later added and reported by Taiwan’s government) would continue until Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A commentator on Chinese state television said the Chinese military would now conduct “regular” drills on the Taiwan side of the line, largely confirming fears that China was aiming to use the exercises to shift the status quo and make recent unprecedented moves the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 22 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 10 Su-30 and four J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and six J-16 fighter, three H-6 bombers, and one Y-8 ASW aircraft entering the southwest area of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the morning, the PLA flew multiple drones in areas around the Taiwan Strait. In the evening, there was one batch of drones found around the Kinmen area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-august-8&quot;&gt;Monday, August 8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China extended military operations around Taiwan by announcing new military exercises to engage in “joint anti-submarine and sea assault operations.” There was no publicly announced exercise restriction zone and no live-fire. Taiwan’s MND reported 13 PLA Navy vessels and 39 PLA aircraft were detected in the areas around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND shared that between August 1 and August 8, China engaged in multiple cyberattacks against Taiwan political and military targets and 272 attempts at political warfare and disinformation. Chinese disinformation attempts peaked on August 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 21 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included eight Su-30 fighters, six J-11 fighters, two JH-7 fighter-bombers, four J-16 fighters, and one KA-228 ASW aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matsu Defense Command reported spotting nine “unidentified light spots” presumed to be UAVs that passed over the Matsu area. The Matsu Defense Command fired flares as a warning signal. The PLA also flew one drone around Kinmen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-august-9&quot;&gt;Tuesday, August 9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China continued exercises that focused on joint containment and joint support operations, such as aerial refueling and sea support. Taiwan’s MND reported a total of 45 PLA aircraft and 10 ships detected around the Taiwan Strait, as joint air and sea operations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 16 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ, all of which flew over the median line of the Taiwan Strait. Eight Su-30 fighters and four J-16 fighters flew across the northern portion of the median line. Four J-11 fighters flew across the central part of the median line, approximately due west of Taipei — the first time ADIZ incursions have taken place there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to China’s continuous exercises, Taiwan kicked off a two-day military exercise, known as Tianlei. It featured more than 700 troops and included live-firing of 114 artillery shells into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA ETC announced that operations around the island had concluded. Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesman for the ETC, regarded the recent exercises around Taiwan as successful, “with all tasks accomplished and the troops’ combat capabilities in integrated joint operations effectively verified.” However, the PLA will continue to monitor the region, conduct military training and preparations, and regularly organize combat patrols in the Taiwan Strait, as China intends to maintain its presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the PLA’s operations, the Taiwan MND reported 10 PLA Navy vessels and 36 PLA aircraft around the area of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 17 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ, all of which crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. This included nine SU-30 fighters crossing near the center of the line (but further north than the preceding day’s incursion) and eight J-11 fighters crossing toward the southern portion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-august-11&quot;&gt;Thursday, August 11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite China’s official conclusion of the exercises around the island, Taiwan’s MND reported 6 PLA Navy vessels and 21 PLA aircraft around the island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 11 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. One JH-7 and six Su-30 flew over the northern portion of the median line and 11 J-4 aircraft flew over the median line to the southwest of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-the-plas-unprecedented-six-exercise-zones-around-taiwan&quot;&gt;Mapping the PLA’s Unprecedented Six Exercise Zones around Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the various Chinese activities detailed above, the most significant to date is a series of large military exercises and live-fire drills that took place from August 4-7. As a whole, these exercises are much closer to the main island of Taiwan than prior ones, showcasing the PLA’s increased confidence in its capabilities to operate near Taiwan. The six exercise zones are within Taiwan’s ADIZ and encircle Taiwan from multiple directions. Several exercise zones are far from the Chinese mainland and beyond the Taiwan Strait, venturing into Japan’s and the Philippine’s EEZ. Three of the exercise zones intrude into Taiwan’s territorial waters and lie dangerously close to Taiwan’s capital and key cities. It is also worth noting that these exercises were rolled out at once, while the exercises during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis took place in multiple stages from July 1995 to March 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MH0Tf1V.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Military Exercises around Taiwan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statements by Chinese military analysts have made clear that the PLA chose the location of each exercise zone for specific purposes. Below are details on the importance of each zone to PLA operations and to Taiwan’s security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 1:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is positioned off the coast of mainland China’s Pingtan Island at the narrowest part of the Taiwan Strait. It is also close to the Taiwan-controlled Matsu Islands that sit immediately off the coast of mainland China’s Fujian Province. PLA operations there could signal Chinese threats to seize the offshore islands. PLA analysts have noted that operations by this narrow neck could position China to close off the northern entrance to the Taiwan Strait. This zone was also chosen to intentionally breach and undermine the legitimacy of the “median line” running through the Taiwan Strait, where PLA forces typically operate to the west of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Located north of Taiwan, this zone intrudes into Taiwan’s territorial waters and is 22.5 kilometers (km) away from the tip of the island and approximately 50 km from Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. It is near both the Port of Taipei and Keelung Harbor, a key port for both military and commercial activity. Both ports are critical to Taiwan’s economy and together handle approximately 20 percent of total cargo to the island. Zone 2 is also located near Taipei’s Taoyuan International Airport, the island’s busiest airport, as well as Taipei Songshan Airport, which serves as a military airbase and saw over six million passengers in 2019. This zone is located close to beaches and coastal areas to the northwest and west of Taipei that military planners believe to be suitable for a potential PLA amphibious landing on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Located 18.5 km northeast of Taiwan, this zone is near the only beaches on the east coast of Taiwan that may be suitable for a PLA amphibious invasion. The southeast corner of Zone 3 intrudes into Japan’s EEZ and is a short distance from the hotly contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are administered by Japan and claimed by China and Taiwan. Zone 3 thus further positions the PLA to conduct operations against both Taiwan and Japan. Similar to Zone 2, this zone is close to Taipei and Keelung Harbor. Control of both zones could make it difficult for the United States or Japan to flow forces into Taipei from the northeast side and could enable the PLA to blockade Keelung Harbor. Operating from Zones 1, 2, and 3 could allow the PLA to move quickly to seize Taipei from three different directions and may be particularly important if the PLA seeks to engage in a decapitation attack against Taiwan’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 4:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone rests approximately 130 km from Taiwan’s eastern shores in the Pacific Ocean. Because of the distance to China and relatively mountainous terrain on Taiwan’s east coast, the PLA has historically engaged in fewer operations and exercises in this region than on the western side of Taiwan. This zone directly faces two air force bases at Hualien and Taitung, which are among Taiwan’s most important military bases. Placing forces there would enable the PLA to launch attacks on Taiwan’s eastern shores and bases and help deny the United States and other countries from flowing forces into Taiwan from the east. This zone also overlaps with Japan’s EEZ. Sandwiched between this zone and Zone 3 is Japan’s Yonaguni Island, which hosts a military base, radar, and other equipment and serves as a critical outpost near Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 5:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is positioned southeast of the southern tip of Taiwan. It sits between Taiwan’s Orchid Island and the islands comprising the Philippine Province of Batanes and intrudes into the Philippine EEZ. This stretch of seas, known as the Bashi Channel, is a critical choke point separating waters within the First Island Chain from the Philippines Sea and the broader Pacific Ocean. The Bashi Channel is also home to several undersea cables, which could be severed to severely disrupt internet access and communications in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 6:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is located at the southwest corner of Taiwan and is the largest of the six. It is close to a region that has been a stronghold of the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), the party that President Tsai Ing-wen leads and Beijing views as pushing for Taiwan independence. The southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ is where the PLA has engaged in the most air intrusions, but typically at a distance much farther from the main island of Taiwan than the exercise zone. This zone reaches into Taiwan’s territorial waters, near the large cities of Kaohsiung and Zuoying, which are both home to key military bases. Kaohsiung also boasts Taiwan’s most important commercial port — which handled nearly 59 percent of Taiwan’s total shipping throughput in 2021 — and Taiwan’s second-busiest airport. Similar to the zones in northern Taiwan, this zone is close to beaches and coastal areas suitable for an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Military operations from Zone 6 could target DPP supporters, significantly undermine Taiwan’s economy (as part of a blockade), and support a potential invasion of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-significance-of-the-plas-exercises&quot;&gt;The Significance of the PLA’s Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unprecedented exercises serve at least four main objectives. First, they are intended to impose political costs on Taipei and undermine morale and support for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen among Taiwan’s public. Part of this involves making clear that Taiwan will bear the brunt of Chinese punishment for closer relations with the United States. Beijing hopes that this will drive a wedge between Taipei and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, these exercises are part of larger Chinese deterrence and signaling efforts toward the United States, Taiwan, U.S. regional allies, and the broader international community to demonstrate how capable and determined China is to exert control over Taiwan and enforce its One China Principle. The exercises involve direct costs for Japan, and to some extent the Philippines, because of PLA operations (and firing of missiles) within both countries’ claimed waters. PLA activities are also meant to deter countries from supporting Taiwan by showcasing how much China is willing to escalate. More broadly, the PLA exercise led to rerouting of commercial air and maritime traffic around Taiwan to avoid the exercise zones, demonstrating China’s ability to “control” activities near and around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s decision to ambiguously extend (and then end) parts of the exercises also fit into China’s playbook for using military exercises for deterrence signaling. Science of Military Strategy, a relatively authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University, highlights PLA strategic thinking on the role of exercises in creating confusion and uncertainty. It states exercises can be directed at adversaries with the goal of “making them uncertain about our intentions and making it difficult to determine whether we are conducting routine training, maintaining close diplomatic relations, or taking the opportunity to move into actual combat operations, thereby causing psychological panic and conduct a deterrent effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, these exercises allow the PLA to rehearse how to conduct a variety of military operations that could form part of a larger-scale military operation - such as seizing one of Taiwan’s offshore islands or PLA blockade or invasion of the main Taiwan island - or a standalone operation by itself. This includes not only activities directed at Taiwan, but operations to prevent potential third country intervention in a China-Taiwan conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and longer term, Beijing aims to use the exercises to establish a new status quo in the Taiwan Strait. China is specifically seeking to erase the notion of the median line that divides the strait and aims to constrain PLA operations west of the line. China also seeks to establish a new normal in which the PLA no longer respects Taiwan’s claims to a separate airspace and territorial waters. These exercises are likely only the beginning of PLA operations close to and above Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-2022-white-paper-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s 2022 White Paper on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 10, 2022, the Chinese government published a white paper titled “The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era.” The white paper has been under development for some time, and it was released to coincide with and mark the ending of China’s unprecedented August 2022 military exercises. As a result, it serves as a powerful Chinese messaging tool to explain why China escalated with military force and what to expect from China’s policy toward Taiwan moving forward, including further changes to come after China’s 20th Party Congress, which is set to be held this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper sought to convey that China’s overall policy toward Taiwan has not changed — that China remains committed to peaceful unification and “one country, two systems” despite the escalation of military force against Taiwan. Even as the PLA seeks to establish a “new normal” of military operations closer to Taiwan, Beijing is trying to signal that China would prefer to resolve the Taiwan question without use of significant military force. In other words, the August 2022 exercises is an example of China having no choice but to use military force to fight Taiwan separatism and external interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed reading of this new white paper, however, shows mixed messages about China’s willingness to use force. The white paper also reflects Beijing’s toughened positions against Taiwan, and it no longer contains guarantees that Taiwan can maintain its democracy or military post-unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-the-white-paper&quot;&gt;What Is New in the White Paper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper represents authoritative and official Chinese policy toward Taiwan under President Xi Jinping. It is the latest Chinese white paper on Taiwan that follows two prior white papers in 1993 and 2000. There are significant differences between the 2022 and 2000 white papers that reflect the influence of three Chinese leaders — Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping — on China’s Taiwan policy. The new white paper also demonstrates that cross-Strait dynamics and the balance of power have shifted drastically in the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper defines resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s “complete unification” as a “historic mission.” Although Jiang and Hu have used the term complete unification to characterize the desired end state for Taiwan, both leaders generally placed more emphasis on peaceful or national unification in their speeches and white papers. Under Xi Jinping, there are increased references to complete unification. The 2000 white paper did not use the term historic mission and this term suggests Xi’s elevation of the importance of unification, the importance of making progress on unification, and linking of unification with “national rejuvenation,” which was also absent from the 2000 white paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper clarifies that China’s national development and progress set the direction of cross-Strait relations (and unification). Broadly increasing people-to-people contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides is no longer sufficient to drive cross-Strait relations in the direction that Beijing wants. China must rely on its growing political, economic, technological, and military power to shape and coerce Taiwan’s trajectory. To some extent, this also suggests that China is not in a hurry or rush to achieve unification because its growing power could give China even more advantage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new white paper specifies “use of force would be the last resort taken under compelling circumstances.” This sentence was an addition that was not in the 2000 Taiwan white paper or the 2005 Anti-Secession Law. Because China already engages in near daily military operations against Taiwan, this sentence likely refers to either kinetic or larger-scale use of military force, which Beijing demonstrated with its August 2022 exercises. Although this sentence suggests that China should be less willing to use significant military force, it must be paired with other portions of the white paper that warn of the dangers posed by active separatist forces on Taiwan and prominent external interference (namely, the United States). The document urges China to have the courage, skill, extensive unity, and solidarity “to mobilize all factors to fight,” with “fight” referring to leveraging the range of Chinese capabilities, including military means. In other words, there are likely to be more instances of “compelling circumstances” and, if diplomacy does not work, China may have to use military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what Taiwan can expect after unification, the new white paper writes that China’s principles of peaceful unification and One Country, Two Systems “take full account of Taiwan’s realities and are conducive to long-term stability in Taiwan after unification.” The addition of long-term stability suggests that Beijing wants to avoid the “instability” it suffered from the massive protests in Hong Kong. Beijing must be able to impose a sufficient degree of control over Taiwan to ensure there is no repeat of Hong Kong in Taiwan. The document offers that, “Provided that China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests are guaranteed, after unification Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region.” This means that Taiwan’s autonomy is highly conditioned. This is a far cry from the 2000 white paper that laid out what Taiwan could enjoy after unification without stipulating the conditions under which Beijing might revoke such offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-missing-from-the-white-paper&quot;&gt;What Is Missing from the White Paper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper is missing a host of key items that illustrate China’s toughening position against Taiwan and the degree of control Beijing will need to exert over the island:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most tellingly, the English version of the document does not mention the word “negotiate” when describing how the two sides can proceed to unification. It notes that there will be “consultations and discussions as equals.” The Chinese version of the white paper still uses “谈判” (negotiate) — but only in three areas — and there is no mention of “平等谈判” (negotiations as equals). The lack of explanation of what “as equals” means, and the refusal to link that term with negotiation, raise serious questions of how Beijing views Taipei and whether Taipei — or perhaps the specific DPP leadership — will be allowed any room for bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the 2022 white paper is missing this key passage from the 2000 white paper: “[N]egotiations should be held between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese KMT on a reciprocal basis and… talks between the two parties may include representatives from all parties and mass organizations of Taiwan.” The 2000 white paper also noted that “we [Beijing] have never spoken of negotiations between the ‘central and local authorities.’” The exclusion of that statement in the 2022 text raises key questions about whether Beijing will view the DPP (or any Taiwan party) as an equal or subordinate for unification talks. If it is the latter, Beijing may seek to impose its will on Taipei than allow for genuine negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper only guarantees that Taiwan can maintain its own social and economic system under the One Country, Two Systems formula. Gone are assurances in the 1993 and 2000 white papers about a host of other rights that Taiwan could enjoy after unification that would allow the island to continue functioning as a vibrant democracy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “will have its own administrative and legislative powers”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan will maintain “an independent judiciary and the right of adjudication on the island”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “will run its own party, political, military, economic, and financial affairs”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “may keep its military forces and the mainland will not dispatch troops or administrative personnel to the island”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: “Representatives of the government of the special administrative region and those from different circles of Taiwan may be appointed to senior posts in the central government and participate in the running of national affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, in Beijing’s ideal world, Taiwan would be governed by patriots who are loyal and subordinate to Beijing. The white paper makes this clear, concluding: “All Taiwan compatriots who support reunification of the country and rejuvenation of the nation will be the masters of the region, contributing to and benefitting from China’s development.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bonny Lin, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">As U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan on August 2-3, China responded with forceful and coercive military, economic, and diplomatic measures.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/caylwb3.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/caylwb3.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Silicon Lifeline In Ukraine War</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-08-silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Silicon Lifeline In Ukraine War" /><published>2022-08-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-08-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-08-silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An examination of the components and functioning of 27 of Russia’s most modern military systems – including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes – supports that the degradation in Russian military capability could be made permanent if appropriate policies are implemented.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia invaded Ukraine, the West announced tough new sanctions and tech companies said they had halted all exports to Russia. Yet supplies of Western computer parts continued, a joint investigation finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tip of a hunting knife, a senior Ukrainian security official removed 18 screws and lifted off the lid of a small black metal box. Inside were four sliding panels packed with scores of computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the electronic brain of an unexploded Russian 9M727 cruise missile — one of the devastating weapons Russia has used to strike Ukraine since it invaded the country on Feb. 24. Russian troops have fired more than 3,650 missiles and guided rockets in the first five months of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities, destroying military targets as well as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and killing hundreds of civilians. On July 14, three cruise missiles struck the city of Vinnytsia, killing 27 people, including a four-year-old girl, Ukrainian authorities say. Russia says it only fires at military targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black metal box, as well as other Russian weaponry shown to Reuters, were collected on the battlefield by Ukraine’s military. They contain Russian electronics bearing Cyrillic markings, sometimes handwritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many of the most important electronic components inside are microcontrollers, programmable chips and signal processors stamped with the names of American chip-makers, including Texas Instruments Inc; Altera, owned by Intel Corp; Xilinx, owned by Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD); and Maxim Integrated Products Inc, acquired last year by Analog Devices Inc. Chips made by Cypress Semiconductor, now owned by Germany’s Infineon AG, were also visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fqNibeV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A radio altimeter, used in the Kalibr and 9M727 Iskander missiles, enabling them to hug terrain. The altimeter pictured was recovered by Ukraine’s military and contains Altera chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite simple,” said the senior Ukrainian official, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “Without those U.S. chips, Russian missiles and most Russian weapons would not work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western components in the Russian weapons were examined as part of an investigation by Reuters in collaboration with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense think tank, and iStories, a Russia-focused investigative news site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of the more sophisticated Western chips in the Russian weapons have been subject to special export licensing requirements for years, the investigation found that many of the armaments also contain run-of-the-mill computer chips and other components found in consumer products. These are easily obtainable and in many cases aren’t subject to export restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the invasion, the United States and other countries banned high-tech exports to Russia to try to cripple its defense industry and tech companies announced that they had halted all exports to Russia. Yet the reporting team found that the flow of Western brand-name computer parts to Russia hasn’t stopped, with thousands of shipments since the invasion of Ukraine. The shippers were mainly unauthorized suppliers, but they also included some manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters provided to AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments data from Russian customs records on shipments of their products to Russia that arrived after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the manufacturers – AMD, Analog Devices and Infineon – said they had launched internal investigations after Reuters provided the customs data showing thousands of recent shipments of their products to Russia by third-party sellers. Infineon and Texas Instruments said products that they had shipped were already in transit at the time of the invasion. Intel said goods it shipped were internal company deliveries before it ceased its Russian operations in early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about their chips’ use in Russian weapons systems, the companies said they comply with export controls and trade sanctions. Infineon said it was “deeply concerned should our products be used for purposes for which they were not designed.” Intel said it “does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s reliance on Western electronics for its weapon systems has been known for years. Moscow has a long history of acquiring smuggled military-grade parts from the United States, including costly specialized chips for satellites that can withstand radiation in space. On the day of the invasion, the White House announced that the United States and its allies were imposing “Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies” that it said would “cut off Russia’s access to cutting edge technology.” Many non-military tech products, however, remain exempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia characterizes the conflict as a special military operation meant to disarm Ukraine. Moscow has cast the sanctions as a hostile act and has denied targeting civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers export restrictions, said, “The powerful export controls put in place by the U.S. and 37 allies and partners are severely impacting Russia’s access to items and technologies it needs to sustain its military aggression, including semiconductors. As time goes on and their stockpiles continue to diminish, our controls will bite even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will remain vigilant and engaged with our allies and partners in enforcing our controls,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onboard computer system inside the cruise missile’s black metal box shows that Russia doesn’t just rely on state-of-the-art technology for its precision weaponry. For example, stamps on two of the Texas Instruments chips – which process digital signals – showed they were manufactured more than 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, it’s the same chips that you find in your car or your microwave,” said a Ukrainian weapons expert with access to recovered Russian military gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gehan Amaratunga, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Cambridge, reviewed a list of more than 600 Western components compiled by RUSI and Reuters that were found in Russian weapons and military systems recovered in Ukraine. “They are mostly standard products which are dated and can be found in many industrial electronic systems,” he said. “As such, they are not specialist military specification products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, he added, “it is the reality that all standard integrated circuits can be used for both civilian and military purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what the West has described as an unprecedented series of strict sanctions against Russia, many commodity electronic components still aren’t subject to export controls. And even if they are, there’s a global galaxy of suppliers and traders in East Asia and other countries that are willing to ship them and are often beyond the control of Western manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review by Reuters of Russian customs records identified more than 15,000 shipments of Western electronic components that reached Russia after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine through the end of May. The manufacturers included AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts included microprocessors, programmable chips, storage devices and other items, according to the Russian customs data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia itself has made no secret of its desire to continue the flow of imported Western tech products. In June, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to permit Russian companies to import electrical goods and their components without the patent owners’ permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Moscow-based computer retailer, Kvantech, now proclaims at the top of its website in Russian: “Attention! We are working normally. Our warehouses are ready to supply equipment to customers from the Russian Federation despite EU and U.S. sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. The EU didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eXulGwu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A screenshot from the website of Moscow-based computer retailer Kvantech shows Western brands it says it is still selling, even though the firms have stopped doing business in Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian website features the logos of more than a half-dozen top U.S. technology companies. Asked how Kvantech manages to continue procuring Western computer equipment, a company official who gave his name only as Viktor said it was “a commercial secret.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters obtained the Russian customs records from three commercial providers, including one that had 2022 data. To verify the most recent data, the news agency cross-checked a sample of that provider’s earlier records – including the date, buyer, seller, international product code and other information – with the two other sources and found that they matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andre Tauber, a spokesman for Infineon, said the German company had launched an internal investigation based on Reuters findings, which identified more than 450 shipments to Russia between Feb. 25 and May 30 of products made by Infineon-owned Cypress Semiconductor. Reuters also found nearly 2,500 shipments of Infineon products that arrived in Russia after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are in the process of reviewing and verifying the information you provided and will take appropriate actions as needed,” Tauber said. “Infineon takes this matter very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that “Infineon instructed all distribution partners globally to prevent deliveries of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions and their spirit.” He said, “Compliance with applicable laws is of utmost importance for Infineon, and we have established robust policies and processes to comply with these laws. It proves difficult to control ongoing sales throughout the entire supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for AMD said the firm is investigating Russian customs data shared by Reuters showing that between March 2 and May 31, there were about 200 shipments of AMD components and nearly 700 shipments of Xilinx components to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The information shared is concerning,” a spokesperson said. While the company has “not seen any diversion of AMD products into Russia … AMD takes these matters very seriously and we have commenced a thorough review of the data to identify potential issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters shared with Analog Devices Russian customs data showing that since the invasion, there have been more than 7,700 shipments to Russia of its components through the end of May. There have also been nearly 900 shipments of parts made by Maxim Integrated, which Analog Devices owns, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Analog Devices said, “Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with U.S. and EU sanctions, Analog Devices ceased business activities in Russia and promptly instructed all of its distributors to halt shipments of our products into Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spokesman added, “We take this seriously and are investigating the veracity of the” Russian customs data “and whether any of our distributors violated our express instructions. Any post-sanctions shipment to Russia would be in direct violation of ADI’s express instructions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Texas Instruments said it had conducted “an in-depth review” and found that 36 shipments by the company and six by one of its authorized distributors that arrived in Russia in late February and early March “were in transit before the invasion began.” Reuters found nearly 1,300 additional shipments of Texas Instruments parts to Russia by third-party sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We stand behind our earlier statement that we are not selling into Russia … and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,” the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about more than 80 shipments of Intel products that arrived in Russia in March, a spokesman for Intel said, “In certain cases, these are internal Intel shipments to our offices in Russia, which supported software development work until our cessation of operations on April 5th.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, more than 1,300 shipments of Intel components and 800 shipments of Altera parts from other companies “in most cases … appear to be shipments from third-party suppliers who may have obtained their inventory from various sources,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Intel has a clear policy that our distributors and customers must comply with all export requirements and local and international laws,” the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-doors&quot;&gt;Back doors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia relies on Western technology for some of its weapons systems because it doesn’t produce many of the required electronics parts itself. But Russian defense companies don’t just use any available components. Even the most ordinary chips must pass through a strict bureaucratic procurement process designed to test and certify them and make sure they don’t contain “back doors” that could enable Western spying or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of foreign-made chips in U.S. military equipment is a top concern in Washington as well, “because there can be vulnerabilities that are manufactured into them,” said Ian Williams, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The Russians are very aware of this, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a measure of how seriously Russian authorities view infiltration risks, a Ukrainian expert with access to Russian weapons showed Reuters photographs of three small holographic stickers bearing the sword-and-shield logo of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, its main intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stickers appeared on electronic components recovered from Russian missiles, combat helicopters and fighter aircraft, the expert said. The FSB didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lmVI4uN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This photo, provided to Reuters by a Ukrainian weapons expert, shows the signature logo of Russia’s FSB on a component of a Russian missile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent compromised components from making their way into Russian weapons, the Kremlin relies on a scientific institute located near Moscow. Recently renamed the All-Russian Research Institute of Radio Electronics, the body acts as a central certifier of all electronic parts used by the defense industry, including manufacturing, as well as repairs, upgrades and even experiments, said two people familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institute’s central role was bolstered last year when Putin issued a decree elevating it to the rank of strategic enterprise. The institute cooperates with a large network of labs and certification centers to fulfill its task of cataloging, testing and validating tens of thousands of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master list of authorized domestic and imported electronic components curated by the institute can be accessed online by accredited Russian companies. In addition, research and production companies from Russia’s defense industry can submit lists of electronic parts they wish to use for a new project, and the institute tries to make sure they don’t include any unauthorized components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the institute’s mandates is to encourage Russian manufacturers to use domestically produced electronics, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But an institute document seen by Reuters suggests that many Western components have no Russian equivalents. In 2017, the institute reviewed a proposed helicopter-mounted radio-jamming station – designed to disrupt enemy communications – and determined that of the 921 foreign components the design called for, only 242 could be procured from Russian manufacturers at the time, the document showed. The Kremlin and the institute didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NY5M9DI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-ties&quot;&gt;Defense ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to trace how specific Western chips found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a review of the Russian customs records shows that some of the same parts were shipped before the invasion by third-party suppliers to several Russian military companies or to other firms with links to the defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the importers named on the customs records as having received some of the same types of Western chips found in Russian weapons are AO VOMZ, AO NPK Uralvagonzavod and AO Radiopriborsnab. According to Russian corporate records, Rostec – a state-owned defense giant – has an indirect ownership stake in all three companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the U.S. Department of the Treasury called Rostec “the cornerstone of Russia’s defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors.” It is headed by Sergey Chemezov, a former intelligence officer who once worked with Putin in the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jDAwQ5l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov are pictured in Moscow in May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rostec and Chemezov have been targeted with sanctions by Washington, the European Union and other countries. Rostec and Chemezov did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiopriborsnab describes itself on its website as a supplier of electronic components. According to Russian customs records, it has imported Altera and Xilinx chips, the same kind found in Russian radio and electronic-warfare equipment recovered in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another five Russian importers have participated in tenders to supply Russian weapons manufacturers, according to data from Goszakupki, Russia’s official public procurement platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of those five importers – OOO Trade-Component and AO GK Radiant – were sanctioned last year by the U.S. government, which accused them of trying to procure American components “likely” for use in Russian military programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian importers didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has become adept at converting consumer-grade chips for military use. For example, Western weapons manufacturers often rely on special military-grade versions of chips to ensure they can withstand very high temperatures. Since such chips are subject to export controls and harder to procure, Russian weapons companies have found alternatives, according to one of three Ukrainian weapons experts interviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding the rugged black metal box containing a missile’s on-board computer, the expert pointed to a heat sink designed to cool the electronic components inside, as well as a thick insulation seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NY5X4wx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This circuit board found inside a Russian 9M727 missile includes a vintage Texas Instruments DSP chip and is surrounded by a heat sink to cool its components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Russia, they take the consumer version and put some protection around it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean Russian weaponry is outdated, another Ukrainian expert said, noting that the designs of many Russian weapons feature pioneering concepts. Examining the innards of a Russian cruise missile, he found what he said was true technological prowess: a satellite-navigation antenna engraved on a piece of ceramic the size of a postage stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is quite something,” the expert said. “A lot of people would be interested in seeing this, even the Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flexibility&quot;&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Western electronics found in Russian weapons, one particular type of integrated circuit stands out, according to Western microelectronics experts: programmable chips, known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One FPGA – a shiny black Altera Cyclone II chip – was mounted between the gyroscopes of a navigation system recovered in Ukraine from a Russian precision-artillery rocket known as a 9M544.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmable chips, which have been available for decades, give electronic-equipment manufacturers enormous flexibility because they quickly can be reprogrammed to perform whatever new task is necessary, said Daniel Nenni, a veteran semiconductor professional and co-author of a book on FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly useful for weapons manufacturers whose products require upgrades and modifications through their typically long life cycles, Nenni said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when many industries are starved for chips because of global supply-chain shortages, another advantage of FPGAs is that they can be recycled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key about the FPGAs is that you can reuse them,” Nenni said. “You can buy a washing machine, take an FPGA out and put it in a missile. It’s that simple because you can reprogram it to do whatever you want.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Byrne, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">An examination of the components and functioning of 27 of Russia’s most modern military systems – including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes – supports that the degradation in Russian military capability could be made permanent if appropriate policies are implemented.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/tNWSFUb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/tNWSFUb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Securing Semicon.

This legacy of innovation largely stands on the foundation of a key component: semiconductor chips, found today in almost all electronic products.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Semiconductors are an integral component of various consumer products across industries, including cars, smartphones, and household appliances. But semiconductors can also be used in dual-use goods — products that have both military and civilian applications — such as air guidance systems for both civilian and military aircraft. The tension between economic gain and security risk inherent within dual-use semiconductor goods is heightened in fields with national security implications, such as supercomputing and artificial intelligence (AI). How the government and private sector manage the global value chains (GVCs) of chips will directly affect U.S. global competitiveness and national security going forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two years have underscored the importance of semiconductors to the U.S. economy and its national security interests. Pandemic-induced spikes in consumer demand boosted semiconductor demand by 17 percent between 2019 and 2021. Global sales reached $555.9 billion in 2021, 26.2 percent more than the year before. Although China remains the largest market in the world for semiconductors, sales in the Americas represented the largest region for industry growth in 2021. However, this spike in demand, along with stagnating investment, inadequate input supplies, and logistics breakdowns, has led to an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors that has reverberated throughout the roughly 200 downstream industries that depend on chips. In the automotive industry alone, it was projected that global semiconductor shortages were responsible for $210 billion in lost revenue as of September 2021. Short-term supply chain disruptions for the semiconductor industry are compounded by long-term geopolitical challenges and the need to rethink what constitutes both secure and resilient supply chains. While China is a top customer for the semiconductor industry, the perception of China has shifted in recent years from potential partner to existential threat. This shift has led companies and countries alike to rethink their dependency on China as both partner and customer. In particular, the Biden administration has sought policies that attempt to accelerate progress and prolong the United States’ innovative edge, while simultaneously dampening China’s influence throughout the semiconductor marketplace. Countries around the world have begun thinking about ways to reduce dependencies on China, enhance supply chain resiliency, and keep costs down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, this confluence has manifested in calls for nearshoring and “friend-shoring.” As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in April 2022 remarks, “friend-shoring means . . . that we have a group of countries that have strong adherence to a set of norms and values about how to operate in the global economy and about how to run the global economic system, and we need to deepen our ties with those partners and to work together to make sure that we can supply our needs of critical materials.” The key difference between onshoring and friend-shoring is that friend-shoring is not restricted to domestic production, but rather seeks to move production to allied partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While moving supply chains away from East Asia could increase security in the long run, an ill-conceived implementation of this friend-shoring strategy could result in price hikes and a stronger China over time. In its 2022 capstone report on supply chains, the Biden administration explicitly stated that “the United States cannot make, mine, or manufacture everything ourselves. We must cooperate with our allies and partners to foster and promote collective supply chain resilience.” Thus emerges the need for the United States to choose its partners wisely when it comes to semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States considers how to build more secure and resilient supply chains, it should seek closer collaboration with countries demonstrating the following characteristics: (1) the bloc should maintain robust support for technology development, whether through a conducive regulatory environment or significant government investment in research; and (2) as a matter of national security, the United States should enhance cooperation only with those parties whose export controls are consistent with its own, including compliance with the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is already leveraging relationships with foreign partners to enhance semiconductor supply chain resiliency; increase collaboration on distortive trade practices, investment screening, and export controls; and enhance transatlantic cooperation regarding secure internet and communication technology (ICT) supply chains. In its first year, the Biden administration pursued closer security relationships with both selected Asian countries and the European Union. In May 2022, the United States and the European Union held the second ministerial of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The TTC seeks to promote closer transatlantic collaboration through 10 specific working groups, including rebalancing transatlantic semiconductor supply chains. The joint statement from the second ministerial underscores the need to build more geographically and commercially diversified supply chains and directly highlights an overdependence on China for the production and processing of certain inputs. In the supply chain annex, the parties agreed to develop an early warning and monitoring mechanism on semiconductor value chains, monitor and prepare for supply chain disruptions, and enhance transparency and commit to exchange information to avoid a subsidy race. These types of generalized commitments are relatively easy to put forth, but much more difficult to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also become a major focus of TTC activity, particularly regarding cooperation on sanctions and export controls. The united export control response is intended to cripple Russia’s war machine by cutting the country’s military off from advanced technologies like semiconductors, which are used in military goods like aircraft and tanks. Continued close coordination on sanctions is expected, but whether that will translate into the same level of cooperation outside the Ukraine context remains to be seen. Furthermore, the U.S. focus on export controls in the sector, coupled with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and mounting Chinese pressure on Taiwan, has injected a new level of national security discourse into the trade policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to closer collaboration with the European Union, the Biden administration has accelerated its engagement with Asian partners. In September 2021, the United States, Japan, India, and Australia launched a “joint initiative to map capacity, identify vulnerabilities, and bolster supply-chain security for semiconductors and their vital components” as part of their Quad alliance. Quad leaders also convened in May 2022, though the meeting largely centered on security issues. It is unclear how these EU and Quad semiconductor supply chain efforts will progress, but each comes with different economic and national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another evolving initiative is the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). All of the Quad countries have indicated their intent to participate in the IPEF, though they have not yet announced which specific pillar negotiations they will join. While details of the framework remain elusive, the IPEF launch in May 2022 confirmed that the framework will consist of four primary policy pillars: (1) trade; (2) supply chain resiliency; (3) infrastructure, clean energy, and decarbonization; and (4) tax and anti-corruption. The United States Department of Commerce will lead supply chain resiliency, infrastructure and decarbonization, and tax and anti-corruption. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) will head the fair and resilient trade component. It is likely that the Commerce Department will leverage the supply chain resiliency pillar to collaborate more closely with Indo-Pacific partners on semiconductor supply chains, including early warning systems for shortages and information sharing on how to avert future supply chain crunches. That Australia and Japan are likely participants in the USTR’s trade pillar provides the United States with a forum for governments to redouble efforts toward strengthening semiconductor GVCs and cooperation, though Indian participation in the trade pillar remains highly unlikely. Export controls will not be one of the topics covered in the IPEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the evolving security relationship between the United States, the Quad, and the European Union, this paper focuses on both Quad and EU countries and the possibilities for friend-shoring in both. It assesses how the EU and U.S. governments can collaborate to avoid duplicative policies that fail to enhance the overall resiliency of transatlantic semiconductor supply chains. In addition to analyzing opportunities for closer cooperation across governments, this paper also evaluates policies the U.S. government should pursue to support the private sector and ensure the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The paper also looks at another emerging security partnership among the Quad countries to assess their viability in terms of semiconductor friend-shoring. This project looks at the current landscape of semiconductor research and development (R&amp;amp;D), fabrication, and packaging capacity in these case study countries; evaluates export control regimes in each country; and assesses which countries are best positioned to partner with the United States to build more resilient semiconductor supply chains based on economic and national security considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper finds that, given the inherent and increasing complexity of global semiconductor supply chains, self-sufficiency in semiconductor production is probably unattainable and, in any event, would be counterproductive in the short term and would contravene long-term geostrategic interests that depend on continued innovation and competitiveness. China’s persistent pursuit of intellectual property theft and subsidization of domestic production underscores how important it is for the United States to engage more closely with like-minded allies to bolster the security of analog and next-generation chips. What emerges is the need for an affirmative agenda for semiconductor supply chains among allies. Key recommendations emerged from interviews conducted for this research, including the need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;identify policy goals that would help bolster semiconductor supply chain resiliency;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promulgate consistent, predictable policies, particularly related to trade;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consider the creation of a new mini-export control regime that could function similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these key themes, this paper assesses specific case study countries to evaluate how governments can better support the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-semiconductor-value-chain&quot;&gt;Global Semiconductor Value Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global semiconductor value chain is dominated by the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Europe, and China. The semiconductor GVC consists of three main stages: R&amp;amp;D (chip design), fabrication (chip production), and advanced testing and packaging (back-end manufacturing). R&amp;amp;D and chip design require substantial funding and human capital input; consequently, the industry has one of the highest R&amp;amp;D margins across all industries. Semiconductor companies spend more than 18 percent of their revenue on R&amp;amp;D. Fabrication (fab) involves the production of chips, a deeply technical and precise six-step process. Front-end manufacturing requires significant capital expenditures. For example, a standard semiconductor fab requires roughly $5 billion of investment, while an advanced fab can cost over $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cTSXGPp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Semiconductor Value Chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fabless foundry model allows firms to specialize in one primary aspect of the semiconductor GVC and to outsource manufacturing. For example, chips might be designed in Silicon Valley, manufactured in East Asia with Dutch machine tools, and then packaged in Malaysia. U.S.-based Qualcomm specializes in the design of semiconductors and does not have production facilities, while companies like Global Foundries specialize in manufacturing and do not do their own design. Meanwhile, companies such as Amkor specialize in assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP), also known as back-end manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YfzLZXL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A large web of global trade flows supports the geographic specialization in the semiconductor value chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back-end manufacturing is typically handled by outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) companies. Taiwanese companies maintain 53 percent of the back-end market share, though the United States International Trade Commission finds there is a “notable concentration” of ATP service providers in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. In 2019, Taiwan maintained 53 percent of the OSAT market, and a single Taiwanese firm, ASE Group, maintained 26 percent of the global back-end market. The largest OSAT firm in the United States is Amkor Technologies, which accounted for 13 percent of the market in 2019. While ATP services account for only 10 percent of a chip’s value, they are the important last step in the production process. On the other hand, the integrated device model (IDM) represents the vertical integration of semiconductor GVCs. Few firms follow the IDM. However, IDM sales reached $257.4 billion, while fabless chip sales reached $127.9 billion, underscoring the profitability derived from the efficiency of vertical integration models. Examples of these vertically integrated firms include Intel, Samsung, and Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Technology complexity and need for scale have led to emergence of business models focused on a specific layer of the value chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semiconductor-policy-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Semiconductor Policy in the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While semiconductor GVCs are distributed around the world, diversification of GVCs helps keep costs down and reduces the likelihood of a major disruption. One month into office (in February 2021), President Biden signed an Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains. The order mandated that relevant agencies undertake a comprehensive review U.S. supply chain security in the following key areas: semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging, batteries, critical minerals and materials, and pharmaceuticals. With respect to semiconductors, the 100-Day Review found that while the United States remains a leader in design, lack of production capacity and continued reliance on foreign manufacturers continue to restrain industry growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department, which oversaw the review of semiconductor supply chains, found in its one-year review that chip shortages were particularly acute in certain types of semiconductors. These include legacy logic chips, such as those used in medical devices and automobiles, analog chips used in power management and image sensors, and optoelectronic chips used in sensors and switches. These categories of chips are relatively large in nanometer size, meaning increasing supply is relatively easier to achieve than with other, more advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of factors in the United States, such as high labor costs and insufficient government-supported R&amp;amp;D, has led to a decrease in the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 2019. In light of ongoing disruptions to semiconductor supply chains and a decreasing U.S. market share, the Biden administration has deemed this a national security priority. As directed by the February 2021 executive order, the Commerce Department released its 100-day critical supply chain report the following June, providing a comprehensive overview of risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to strengthen and secure U.S. semiconductor supply chains. Also in June 2021, the United States Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), followed by the House version — the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the America COMPETES Act). These bills, currently in conference, both contain the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (the CHIPS for America Act), which would provide substantial investments to boost domestic semiconductor production — to the tune of over $52 billion. In the backdrop of geostrategic competition with China, the Biden administration’s approach to semiconductor investment represents a desire to scale up U.S. industry and maintain a competitive edge for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Act would allocate $39 billion to the Commerce Department’s semiconductor incentive program, providing up to $3 billion per firm for the construction of new fabs. It would allocate roughly $11 billion for R&amp;amp;D. Additionally, the act would create a new Multilateral Semiconductors Security Fund to promote the development of a secure semiconductor supply chain. The act would also establish new supply chain programs within the Commerce Department. CSIS outlines additional contours of the CHIPS for America Act in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the act, U.S. government spending on semiconductors would complement existing industry efforts to bolster the resiliency and security of semiconductor supply chains. As of 2020, the United States accounted for the largest portion of the semiconductor market share, at 47 percent, equaling $207.9 billion in sales. Major private players are making sizable investments in the domestic semiconductor industry, including to increase domestic production capacity. In 2022, Intel announced it would invest $20 billion in building two Ohio factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) concluded a deal to spend $12 billion in Arizona to develop a new plant. Texas Instruments plans to invest $3.5 billion annually for chip manufacturing in the United States through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investment-screening-export-controls-and-trade-initiatives&quot;&gt;INVESTMENT SCREENING, EXPORT CONTROLS, AND TRADE INITIATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade policy is an important part of facilitating the development of a resilient semiconductor industry. Trade policies can be tools that enhance innovation and growth, while at the same time restraining the ability of adversaries to develop cutting-edge technologies. The task for policymakers is to ensure that policies to promote industry growth do not conflict with ones to protect national security. Trade policy can play an important role in helping domestic industry “run faster” against competition, but excessive technology controls in the name of national security can have the unintended effect of denying U.S. high-tech companies the revenue they need to innovate and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a robust policy tool kit for building more resilient semiconductor supply chains while advancing national security measures. In 2018, Congress passed legislation that enhanced government capabilities to review both foreign investments and domestic outflows. The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) provides the president with the authority to establish new export controls on “emerging” and “foundational” technology — though ECRA did not explicitly define either of those terms, leading to significant uncertainty throughout the private sector. The designation of semiconductors as foundational could result in wide-ranging license requirements for standard chips used in everyday items. However, the Bureau of Industry and Security recently announced in a proposed rule that it was no longer going to distinguish between emerging and foundational designations. Designating semiconductors as foundational could potentially dampen U.S. private-sector profits, thereby restraining the industry’s ability to invest in next-generation R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trade policy can play an important role in helping domestic industry “run faster” against competition, but excessive technology controls in the name of national security can have the unintended effect of denying U.S. high-tech companies the revenue they need to innovate and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trade tool the United States has implemented administratively is the FDPR. The FDPR is an extraterritorial application of U.S. law that permits the government to curb foreign-produced exports containing U.S. equipment or technology, including design, to those on the Entity List. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration announced it would apply the rule to Russia. The FDPR imposes new license requirements on exports to Russia and applies a policy of denial to license applications for exports or reexports to Russia or for transfers within the country. Overall, the application of the rule significantly restricts Russia’s ability to acquire critical goods like microelectronics, telecommunications items, and aircraft components. Key to compliance is whether foreign trading partners, such as China, will adhere to secondary sanctions — such as the FDPR — that will affect the production, thereby restricting foreign availability of covered products. The European Union and Japan have adopted restrictive measures similar to those of the United States. South Korea has agreed to comply with Western sanctions but has indicated it will not implement its own. In February 2022, Taiwan announced it would also join Western sanctions, and in April 2022, Taiwan initiated its own export curbs on products to Russia, adding 57 products to a new export control list. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether other trading partners — namely, China and India — will comply with Western export controls, thereby restricting the outflow of semiconductors made with U.S. inputs or design. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether Western agreement on Russia sanctions will extend beyond the Ukraine conflict — for example, in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another policy tool that could affect collaboration on semiconductor supply chains between the United States and foreign partners is a new outbound investment-screening tool that has been proposed by Senators Casey (D-PA) and Cornyn (R-TX). The Senators’ bill would establish an interagency process to review outbound investment in areas of “national critical capabilities” to entities “of concern.” A similar proposal exists in the House’s America COMPETES Act as well. Proponents of outbound investment screening argue that the outflow of U.S. investment to China bolsters Chinese critical industries, threatening U.S. national security interests. Although critics of the proposal argue it would duplicate the Department of the Treasury’s remit to screen investments, proponents believe this could be a useful mechanism for ensuring that U.S. funds are not used to enhance technological capabilities of foreign adversaries, including bolstering advanced semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and investment policy affects where firms decide to locate and plays a key role in determining which countries can acquire sensitive technologies, and in turn, which types of sensitive technologies are permitted to leave those countries. For trade policy to succeed in achieving desired geopolitical outcomes, it needs to be based on determined end goals and on a calculation of how best to achieve those goals. Part of this consideration requires governments and firms to take into account foreign availability of equivalent products. If most, but not all, countries converge to reduce the export of sensitive chips to adversaries, it remains likely that the adversarial countries will be able to acquire chips from nonparticipating third countries. It is therefore crucial for the United States to work in concert with like-minded countries as it decides whether to encourage or require restrictions on technologies such as semiconductors. Building secure semiconductor GVCs thus requires multilateral cooperation among governments of foreign semiconductor producers, whether specializing in R&amp;amp;D, production, or back-end packaging. It is also incumbent on companies to be familiar with policy developments in this area and make location and investment decisions consistent with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For trade policy to succeed in achieving desired geopolitical outcomes, it needs to be based on determined end goals and on a calculation of how best to achieve those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multilateral-initiatives&quot;&gt;MULTILATERAL INITIATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to U.S. policies that affect the trade and security of semiconductors, there are multilateral trade arrangements that create governance structures for chips and other dual-use goods. The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies is a multilateral export control regime formally established in the Netherlands in 1996. Currently, 42 states participate in this regime, which aims to promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of arms and dual-use goods and technologies, including semiconductors. All Quad countries are members of the Wassenaar Arrangement. There are significant limitations to the Wassenaar Arrangement — namely, the slow pace of its decisionmaking and its role to advise and notify, rather than constrain, trade. Furthermore, Russia’s membership in the arrangement is a factor that makes it difficult for the framework to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With executive branch efforts to build more resilient and secure semiconductor supply chains, along with proposed legislation that would provide historic amounts of semiconductor funding, the U.S. government has made the production of chips a top priority that intersects with both economic and national security strategic objectives. As the United States builds the foundation for the next generation of its technological sovereignty, it is confronted with the inherently global nature of semiconductor GVCs and must reconcile the need to promote U.S. industry while protecting national security interests. R&amp;amp;D often occurs in the United States and in Taiwan, while the Netherlands is a key exporter of the machine tools to produce chips. Packaging, meanwhile, occurs primarily in East Asian countries. Recognizing that total onshoring is neither feasible nor desirable, it is important to evaluate which countries could help the United States build more secure semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semiconductor-policy-in-eu-member-states&quot;&gt;Semiconductor Policy in EU Member States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with the United States’ review of its critical semiconductor supply chains, the European Union has also had a reckoning with its own dependency on foreign producers in critical areas and has reassessed how to enhance its technological sovereignty. In 1990, Europe produced nearly 35 percent of semiconductors globally, but that number has dropped to roughly 9 percent as of 2020. In general, the European Union lags in the final step of the semiconductor value chain — back-end manufacturing — which involves the assembly, testing, and packaging of chips. Globally, only 5 percent of that capability is located in Europe. Even if an increased number of semiconductor wafers are made in Europe, they would still be sent elsewhere, such as China, for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021, the European Union announced a legislative package parallel to that of the United States — the European Chips Act — which it formally introduced in February 2022. The European Chips Act intends to reinforce European commitment to significant investments in semiconductors through R&amp;amp;D, fabrication, production, and support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The act consists of three main policy pillars: (1) the “Chips for Europe Initiative,” which supports capacity building through increased investment; (2) “security of supply” through the creation of first-of-a-kind advanced facilities; and (3) preparedness and monitoring to avert supply chain crunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The act will also work to build stronger supply chains with the United States and with Japan. Given the semiconductor shortage of the past two years, the European Commission intends to strengthen European R&amp;amp;D leadership, improve upon its capacity to innovate in design and manufacturing, and significantly increase its production capacity by 2030. The act also bolsters the Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies, which seeks to identify gaps in microchip production by reinforcing the European electronics design ecosystem and increasing manufacturing capacity, including testing and advanced packaging. These efforts complement the European Union’s Digital Decade strategy, which establishes an agenda for European digital transformation by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European investment in semiconductor production has raised questions about subsidies — known as “state aid” in the European Union — particularly related to Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs). IPCEIs are cross-border initiatives led by member states that can contribute to EU strategies. Since this constitutes state aid, these initiatives must seek approval from the commission. In November 2021, the European Commission adopted revised state aid rules for these projects, which establish criteria for the commission to assess “member state support to cross-border IPCEIs that overcome market failures and enable breakthrough innovation in key sectors and technologies and infrastructure investments, with positive spillover effects for the EU economy at large.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These revised guidelines state that IPCEIs must meet the following criteria: (1) involve at least four member states, (2) be designed in a transparent and inclusive manner, (3) facilitate SME participation, and (4) align their objectives with current EU priorities, such as the green transition. The guidelines also include safeguards to ensure that the aid is proportional and prevents any undue market distortions. These subsidies would generally fall under the ambit of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures under World Trade Organization rules. If the effects of such subsidies are determined to be injurious, they can be countervailed by other countries, which could have the net effect of restricting semiconductor trade and driving up costs. There are six requirements for IPCEIs and none of the requirements prohibit the inclusion of non-European companies in such projects. Thus, nominally, a U.S. company could benefit from IPCEI funds. Only four IPCEIs have ever been notified and assessed by the commission. Two were infrastructure projects that did not include non-European companies. The other two IPCEIs involved strategic value chains and did include non-European companies. Murata (in Japan) and Cortec (in the United States) took part in the microelectronic IPCEI, and Endurance Technologies (in India) participated in the battery IPCEI. However, the vast majority of companies that participated in these two IPCEIs were still European.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the existence of IPCEIs presents companies with added benefits when partnering with the European Union on semiconductor supply chains. First, IPCEIs offer additional funding revenues. Second, they leverage the European Union’s integrated single market, which makes it relatively easier to build a semiconductor ecosystem, with parts of the supply chain split among countries to leverage the capabilities of specific member states. Although IPCEIs are projects led and funded by the government, multinational private firms are not restricted from obtaining that funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section of this paper evaluates which EU member states are best positioned for increased semiconductor collaboration with the United States. While some degree of redundancy in semiconductor supply chains can help increase overall resiliency, the transatlantic alliance should attempt to avoid duplicative spending on chips where possible. The member states assessed below possess existing semiconductor infrastructure and are poised to expand domestic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belgium&quot;&gt;BELGIUM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgium’s central location between Europe’s major economic powers makes it a natural crossroads for the semiconductor industry and European diplomacy. Most economic activity is concentrated in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium, where many Belgian high-technology and services firms are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium is a top player in the global semiconductor R&amp;amp;D supply chain. Belgium ranks fifth on the European Innovation Scoreboard. Flanders is home to five research universities and four strategic research centers. Specific to semiconductor R&amp;amp;D, Belgium had the fifth-highest accumulated number of paper contributions to semiconductor research between 1995 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crown jewel of Belgium’s semiconductor R&amp;amp;D industry is the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (Imec) in Leuven, one of the world’s top semiconductor R&amp;amp;D institutes. Imec boasts 12,000 square meters of cleanroom and lab capacity and a workforce of over 5,000 researchers from 95 countries across its facilities. Imec’s $3 billion experimental pilot line is one of its top attractions, allowing researchers to develop limited quantities of leading-edge chips two or three generations ahead of current leading-edge manufacturing with a new 2D graphene-based process. Imec often refers to itself as “the Switzerland of semiconductors” to highlight its corporate and geopolitical neutrality. Although the Belgian government funds 16 percent of its $773 million budget, no single firm or state has a controlling stake. As a result, Imec holds a unique place as a convener in the global semiconductor industry and a nexus of basic and applied research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has taken note of Imec’s industry centrality, noting its geopolitical importance in its supply chain 100-day review. Under the European Chips Act, Imec would receive over €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in public funding to create new test line facilities to speed the transition from the R&amp;amp;D of leading-edge chip technology to its commercialization. The United States Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have also identified Imec as a potential partner for overlapping with or complementing U.S. efforts to build a stronger domestic semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium is home to only one fab, U.S.-based Onsemi’s Oudenaarde manufacturing facility. The 40,000 square foot fab produces six-inch wafers at the 350–2000nm level for mostly automotive and industrial application, but no leading-edge chips. In February 2022, Belgian firm BelGaN Group BV acquired the Oudenaarde manufacturing facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium’s central location and role in the European Union, along with its robust R&amp;amp;D ecosystem and transportation linkages to major European markets, make the country an attractive location for semiconductor investment. However, the United States International Trade Administration warns that Belgium’s shortage of STEM labor limits the country’s R&amp;amp;D and high-tech manufacturing potential. Compared to other case study countries in this report, Belgium has the lowest percentage of tertiary graduates from STEM programs, roughly equal to only 17 percent of total graduates, according to data from the European Commission. In Belgium, 72 percent of young adults enroll in a bachelor’s program or equivalent by the age of 25, the highest rate among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Nevertheless, only 0.8 percent of working-age Belgians have a doctoral degree, which ranks below the OECD average. While Belgium’s streamlined policies for high-skill immigration partially offset this relative shortcoming, the country’s more limited number of STEM graduates is a factor that could affect its ability to compete against other countries with a larger talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-netherlands&quot;&gt;THE NETHERLANDS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands is a semiconductor powerhouse, one of the few countries in the world with a fully integrated vertical semiconductor supply chain. This includes applied research, chip design, chip architecture, chip production, and system integration and applications. The Dutch have also effectively dominated the machine tool portion of the semiconductor supply chain in Europe. Businesses in the Netherlands generate the highest average sales in the semiconductor industry, accounting for €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion) annually. The four companies that predominantly make up the industry are ASM International, ASML, BE Semiconductor Industries (Besi), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP). The Netherlands is also home to several companies that provide equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. For instance, ASML is the largest supplier of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry worldwide and is also involved in the production of 5 nm chip technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; ASML is the world’s largest supplier of lithography equipment, which is integral in transferring circuit patterns onto wafers. ASML’s sales reached $6.5 billion in 2020, and it is the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which it unveiled in 2019. EUV machines use extreme ultraviolet wavelengths to print the most intricate layers of chips, creating advanced and highly complex semiconductors to achieve “big things on a tiny scale.” ASML’s control of EUV has led some competitors to claim that ASML maintains monopolistic control over the lithography industry. While ASML largely controls the lithography machine side of the supply chain, Intel, Samsung, and TSMC also produce high-grade chips. ASML’s position as the sole provider of EUV machines makes them an ideal partner for companies like Intel and TSMC. In a 2012 deal, Intel acquired a 15 percent ownership stake in ASML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands is also home to ASM International (ASMi), which was founded in 1968. ASM pioneered technologies such as lithography, deposition, ion implant and single-wafer epitaxy. ASMi also holds a 25 percent stake in ASM Pacific Technology (ASMPT), which was founded in Hong Kong in 1975 and, at the time, was the most productive vertical furnace in the semiconductor industry. Vertical furnaces are key to productivity because they allow a stack of wafers to be loaded into a furnace for simultaneous processing. ASMi’s subsidiary, ASMPT, focuses mostly on assembly and packaging. ASMi was involved throughout the chip-making process, from unprocessed silicon wafers to packaged chips. Recently, they have made breakthroughs in atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition, developing the concept from R&amp;amp;D through production. Their primary focus today is on front-end wafer processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, another prominent Dutch semiconductor company, is engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and service of semiconductor assembly equipment. It operates seven facilities in Asia and Europe for production and development. Besi is involved in the development and supply of die attach equipment, packaging equipment, plating equipment, and service equipment. R&amp;amp;D is spread across Europe, North America, and Asia, while manufacturing occurs largely in Singapore, South Korea, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands is an attractive partner for closer U.S. collaboration for several reasons. In the 2021 International Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Ranking, the Netherlands ranked fourth overall, surpassed by Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark. The Netherlands placed second for overall economic performance, fourth for business efficiency, and seventh for infrastructure. The country also scored well on international trade, international investment, and technology infrastructure. The most recent edition of the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, in 2019, also ranked the Netherlands as the most competitive country in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands also excels in education. Dutch expenditures on higher education are 30 percent higher than the OECD average and its expenditures on R&amp;amp;D are the sixth highest in the OECD. Furthermore, the Netherlands has a comparatively internationalized higher education system, meaning it succeeds in attracting foreign talent to complement its domestic workforce. Among doctoral students, 43 percent are international, the majority of which come from other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other attractive features of the Netherlands are its geographic location and its top-tier infrastructure. Its location affords the country easy access to other European capitals and to an extensive international trade network that facilitates cross-channel flows to the United Kingdom and transatlantic flows to its North American partners. The Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port, is a key facilitator of the country’s robust international trade profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has also recently acquiesced to U.S. demands for cooperation on export control issues. In 2018, the Dutch government provided ASML with an export license to send advanced lithography equipment to China, thereby enabling China to produce its own chips. The Trump administration, fearful about Chinese acquisition of these advanced machine tools, sought to outright ban the transfer of lithography equipment from the Netherlands to China. Pressure from the Trump administration ultimately prevailed, and the Netherlands reversed the license. While transatlantic cooperation ultimately prevailed in this case, Dutch cooperation on export controls was reluctant and only followed significant pressure from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NXP, in particular, has had to placate both U.S. and Chinese regulatory authorities in recent years. In 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission required that NXP divest its radio-frequency power amplifier before it approved NXP’s acquisition of Freescale, a U.S. semiconductor company. NXP acquiesced and sold the unit to a Chinese state-owned investment management firm. After the merger with Freescale, NXP further divested and sold its standard products business to the same Chinese firm in 2016. Finally, in 2018, Qualcomm attempted to acquire NXP, and NXP sold its stake in a Chinese chip-design joint venture in an attempt to appease Chinese regulatory authorities, who ultimately failed to approve the Qualcomm-NXP merger. These actions suggest that NXP and the Dutch have worked to placate Chinese authorities and have sought to play the middle ground in order to maintain access to both the Chinese and U.S. markets. Overall, the ASML and NXP cases underscore that the Netherlands will continue to contend with not only political pressure from the U.S. government, but also the continued attractiveness of the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Netherlands and the European Union have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the extraterritorial application of U.S. export controls, the case with ASML demonstrates the importance of allied collaboration regarding long-term geopolitical goals, since restricting which countries can access advanced manufacturing tools can help or hinder their bid for technological superiority. Overall, given the Netherlands’ abundance of water, highly trained workforce, and closer cooperation with the U.S. government on export controls, it continues to remain one of the best options for U.S. foreign collaboration on semiconductor GVCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is the second-largest economy in the European Union and maintains a significant presence in the European semiconductor industry, with centers for R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and packaging. In 2019, France exported €1.05 billion ($1.15 billion) in semiconductor devices, primarily to Singapore, Germany, China, and the Netherlands. The French semiconductor industry will receive not only support from the EU initiatives on semiconductors, but also funding from the France 2030 initiative. As part of the €30 billion ($30.7 billion) France 2030 investment initiative, France is committing nearly €6 billion ($6.5 billion) to the semiconductor industry, focusing primarily on the physical and electronics components to double the country’s electronics production by 2030. This investment will go toward the creation of smaller chips, with the goal of reasserting France as a “leader in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; CEA-Leti is a government research center based in Grenoble and a major player in the international nanoelectronics sector. It has partnerships with various companies such as III-V Lab, Intel, Mapper, Soitec, and STMicroelectronics (ST) on a range of issues regarding the development and research of semiconductor technologies. The first-stage resources from the European Chips Act will go to major European research institutions. ST has an office in Tours that also works on R&amp;amp;D, engineering, processes, applications, and other business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; STMicroelectronics is the preeminent semiconductor vendor in France. The company operates two wafer fabs and the largest R&amp;amp;D center and produces up to 16 nm chips, providing notable production capacity. Its location in Grenoble has over 10,000 staff, and a manufacturing facility for automotive-grade chips in Rousset has over 4,000 staff. The company has a strong presence in automotive integrated circuits. ST is a key supplier to the German automotive industry. Besides fab capacity, France does have some back-end manufacturing capabilities. In 2017, UnitySC opened its operations in Grenoble, where it has approximately 10,000 square feet in cleanroom space and carries out its packaging operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; France benefits from robust macroeconomic stability and a well-developed financial system. Moreover, it is regarded as a prominent innovation hub. The 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking places it at 29th overall; it is surpassed by its neighbors, the Netherlands and Germany. Regardless, it is the seventh-largest economy in the world in terms of GDP and eighth in total exports. France boasts the highest rate of public support for R&amp;amp;D among OECD countries. It is the top destination for international investment in Europe. Its well-educated population and renowned universities help generate a talented, well-equipped workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainland France is close to the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. With its well-established infrastructure links, it is a key player in continental trade. Paris’s Charles de Gaulle Airport processes the second-highest amount of airfreight in Europe, second only to the Frankfurt Airport. France is one of Europe’s only silicon metal producers. Its overseas territories, stretching from French Polynesia to French Guiana, hold substantial amounts of mineral wealth. France stands to benefit from bauxite refining in French Guiana, which is crucial to extracting gallium. In addition, yet-untapped mineral reserves on the ocean floor of its maritime possessions in the Indo-Pacific would allow France to present itself as an alternative to China in supplying rare-earth minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While France, along with Belgium and Germany, already has robust R&amp;amp;D infrastructure for next-generation semiconductors, it is creating plans to accelerate production. However, the United States Department of Commerce notes that France’s regulations and government bureaucracy can sometimes restrain the French market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy&quot;&gt;ITALY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has the third-largest economy in the European Union, with several large manufacturing sites for a diverse set of semiconductor components. In Italy, the automotive industry accounts for 6 percent of the GDP and employs 300,000 people, meaning the effects of semiconductor supply chain crunches are particularly pronounced for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; In June 2021, STMicroelectronics (ST) announced an agreement with the technological university, Politecnico di Milano, to create a research center on advanced materials for sensors. ST hopes to enable researchers and university faculty to collaborate on microelectromechanical systems technology and attract new academic talent. The company signed an agreement with the University of Catania in late 2021 to create a framework for enhanced education and research activities in power electronics. Italy is also the headquarters of Technoprobe, which has three research centers and 2,200 employees worldwide. Technoprobe specializes in testing solutions for chips, as well as the design, development, and production of probe cards. These allow for the testing of chips before they are individually packaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy is the second home of multinational STMicroelectronics, which has over 9,000 employees in the country. ST focuses on sensory and power technologies, automotive products, embedded processing solutions, and a broad range of segments. In reaction to high demand, ST plans to double its investments in 2022 to up to $3.6 billion. In Milan, ST has facilities with several fabrication lines, including a 300 mm fab. The company’s Catania in Sicily site hosts two 200 mm fabrication facilities. In March 2022, the European Investment Bank announced it would provide ST a loan of €600 million ($628.7 million), which the firm will use for R&amp;amp;D and pilot production lines for advanced semiconductors. ST will use this investment primarily at two existing facilities in Italy and one in France. Following the announcement of this funding, French minister for the Economy, Finance, and Recovery Bruno Le Maire underscored that the primary goal of the funding is to accelerate French and Italian production of semiconductors, adding that “it is only by mastering this technology, that we will be able to safeguard the European Union’s strategic independence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant player in the Italian semiconductor industry is Lfoundry, which runs an advanced 200 mm manufacturing fabrication site and proprietary technologies at 150 nm and 110 nm nodes. Lfoundry provides complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, or CIS, through CIS processes to 90 nm and backside illumination technology. In 2016, Lfoundry was acquired by Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. PVA Italy is also a player, specializing in wafer plasma treatment systems and in crystal production plants for the photovoltaic industry and the semiconductor industry. NXP Italy in Milan manufactures devices for the automotive, industrial, and consumer and transaction/access segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel has been planning to expand into Italy with a facility for assembly, testing, and packaging, which would complement Intel investments in France and Germany. The Italian government has encouraged Intel to invest in the country. Turin and Catania are potential sites that Intel has considered for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; In some ways, Italy may not be an ideal partner for closer engagement on semiconductors with the United States. Among the identified potential European partners, Italy ranked last in both economic performance and government efficiency according to the 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking, as well as in the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness ranking. As a percentage of GDP, Italy also spends less on R&amp;amp;D than Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Additionally, Italy has a less educated workforce than most of the European Union, with the second-lowest percentage of a tertiary-educated population among EU countries. Italy’s political system is also relatively unstable compared to other western European nations, with coalition governments that are often short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mario Draghi has taken steps to protect Italy’s domestic semiconductor industry from Chinese competition. In April 2021, Draghi blocked a Chinese company from taking over an Italian semiconductor firm. This decision blocked Chinese company Shenzhen Investment Holdings from acquiring a 70 percent stake in Milan-based LPE. LPE produces components for power electronics applications. Draghi cited the ongoing semiconductor shortage as leading to slowdowns in the Italian automotive sector and said that semiconductors had thus become “a strategic sector” for the country. An actual or attempted Chinese acquisition of domestic industries is not inherently problematic, but the decision to allow a foreign takeover of a domestic business that is deemed to have strategic importance from both an economic and security perspective can change a government’s calculation of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy also has a complicated relationship with China, which affects its reliability as a partner in this strategic space. In 2019, Italy signed a memorandum of understanding supporting China’s Belt and Road Initiative, against the warnings of European and U.S. leaders. Since the Draghi government took over in 2021, Italy has begun to reverse course and has reemphasized transatlantic relations while distancing itself from China. The Draghi government has vetoed bids by Chinese companies to acquire Italian firms on three different occasions, including once in the semiconductor industry as discussed above. Nonetheless, the back-and-forth nature of Italy’s relationship with China causes concern when identifying potential long-term strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are benefits to partnering with Italy. A major benefit to closer collaboration with the country is the recent Intel investment. As mentioned above, the project intends primarily to build a large, state-of-the-art packaging facility, which has historically been the weak point in the European semiconductor supply chain. Thus, Italy may have to be included in any strategic planning out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draghi has been behind new momentum in Italy for European semiconductor production, saying in October 2021 that “governments need to fully commit to a European Union plan to increase the bloc’s share of global semiconductor production to 20 percent by 2030.” In March 2022, Draghi announced that Italy would spend €4 billion ($4.4 billion) to develop its domestic semiconductor industry. The Italian government has approved a new fund to allocate €150 million ($157.1 million) in 2022 and €500 million ($523.7 million) annually until 2030. The government is also in talks with Intel to nearshore part of its semiconductor supply chain to the country. It is estimated that Italian incentives for Intel, including favorable terms and public financing, will be worth €8 billion ($9 billion) over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;GERMANY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Germany exported $6.5 billion in semiconductor devices, making it the fourth-largest exporter in the world. On the other hand, Germany is also the fourth-largest importer of semiconductor devices. Imports of semiconductors reached €5.7 billion ($6.3 billion) in 2019. In total, Germany accounts for €10.8 billion ($11.8 billion) of Europe’s €33 billion ($36 billion) semiconductor market. Germany is key to semiconductor production due to its production of gases, specialty chemicals, and other consumables that play direct roles in fabrication and facility-cleaning materials. For example, Merck KGaA in Darmstadt produces specialty gases that are critical to chip production. Germany, like the rest of Europe, is challenged by the final step of the semiconductor value chain, back-end manufacturing. Germany’s use of semiconductors is concentrated in consumer goods, such as automobiles and other high-end manufactured household goods. These include digital devices like cameras and household appliances such as dishwashers, which use standard rather than cutting-edge chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel has recently agreed to invest nearly €80 billion ($88 billion) in semiconductor production in the European Union, of which €17 billion ($18.6 billion) is slated for Germany, where the company plans to build a “leading-edge semiconductor fab mega-site.” Companies such as Infineon, Carl Zeiss, and Zollner all have R&amp;amp;D operations in Germany. In 2020, Carl Zeiss employed approximately 1,300 people in R&amp;amp;D roles across Germany. The Fraunhofer Group for Microelectronics and the Leibniz Association are major players in international microelectronic R&amp;amp;D. Between the two groups, they have the largest cooperation for microelectronic R&amp;amp;D in Europe, over 2,000 research staff, and 12,000 square meters of cleanroom space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Bosch has also been a major manufacturer of German semiconductor chips, including application-specific integrated circuits and power conductors. In December 2021, Bosch started large-scale production of silicon carbide semiconductors in its Reutlingen factory, where Bosch will manufacture the chips on 200 mm wafers to achieve “important economies of scale.” This facility will enable Bosch to meet growing demand for chips used in both internet of things (IoT) and mobility applications. This new factory follows Bosch’s 2021 expansion in Dresden. The semiconductor facility in Dresden is Bosch’s first aIoT (AI with the internet of things), providing specialized chips for the automotive sector. Despite the expansion in semiconductor building capacity, it will likely not be sufficient to address supply chain issues in Europe, particularly amid sustained demand. Infineon is by far the largest semiconductor company in Germany. Originally part of Siemens, it spun off in 1999 and is now an independent company with revenues of over €11 billion ($13.2 billion) in 2021. Lantiq, a spin-off from Infineon Technologies, was a key supplier of broadband access and home networks technology, but it was acquired by Intel in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany is an attractive partner for U.S. collaboration given its robust economy and stable political position in the European Union. Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world and accounted for nearly a quarter of the EU GDP in 2020. Furthermore, Germany is an important global exporter, the third-largest after China and the United States. The United States imports many German goods and Germany is the United States’ largest European trading partner. Germany is also the sixth-largest market for U.S. exports. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, in 2019, Germany ranked seventh in global competitiveness. Germany is advanced in research and innovation and has a pro-business climate. Germany has many established supply chain linkages and the policy to enforce due diligence. Furthermore, Germany has a strong industrial base, including its global leadership in the automotive industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany maintains a stable domestic government and historically has been one of the most politically influential countries in the European Union. The previous chancellor, Angela Merkel, established a leading role in the European Union for many years, but it is yet to be seen if the new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will take on a similar role. Although it remains unclear as to what extent the new chancellor will continue Merkel’s foreign policy approach to China or whether he will join Brussels in taking a harder line against Beijing, Germany’s stable government makes it an attractive partner for continued U.S. partnership on semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany is aiming to phase out coal and nuclear energy in favor of renewable sources. While this energy transition is desirable for the future, it could cause an increase in energy prices in the short term, affecting economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microelectronics was deemed an IPCEI by Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The article allowed five EU member states, including Germany, to allocate state aid to projects in microelectronics. This provided Germany with €1 billion ($1.01 billion) in funding for microelectronic industries. In December 2021, Germany formally notified the European Commission of a new IPCEI through which Germany will support transnational cooperation on microelectronics, such as semiconductors. With the new IPCEI for Microelectronics and Communication Technologies underway, Germany will benefit from €4.5 billion ($4.9 billion) in state aid and total investments of €15 billion ($16.5 billion). This is in addition to forthcoming funds from the European Chips Act, which will further enhance member state production capabilities. Other initiatives include Germany’s Microelectronics Framework Program, launched by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research last year, which emphasizes the importance of trustworthiness and sustainability in the supply chain. In addition, the EUREKA Clusters Program supports important research, development, and innovation topics with national authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-union&quot;&gt;THE EUROPEAN UNION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the European Union is an attractive partner for closer collaboration with the United States on securing semiconductor GVCs. A particularly appealing and unique factor to investing in the European Union is its single market, which facilitates the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. This makes it relatively easy for companies to invest across member states and to capitalize on local incentives and favorable business conditions. That Intel has deployed investments in France for R&amp;amp;D, Germany for production, and Italy for back-end manufacturing underscores the appeal of cooperating with the bloc on semiconductor GVCs. Furthermore, funding made available through both Brussels and member state governments helps increase the cohesion and resilience of semiconductor GVCs throughout the bloc. Other benefits the European Union offers in terms of supply chain resilience include geographic proximity to the United States and an existing close security relationship, including deepening cooperation on trade policies such as export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to transatlantic cooperation regarding China — a strategic adversary to both parties, as well as a large and consistent customer — the relationship becomes more complicated. Overall, the European Union has taken a more moderate approach to China, seeking to increase market access for EU firms, while simultaneously adopting new trade defense and investment-screening tools, such as the EU anti-coercion instrument, intended to stem Chinese influence throughout Europe. Large European economies have an interest in maintaining positive relationships with Beijing due to its large consumer base, which maintains high demand for Germany’s automobile industry, for example. In 2020, one in three German cars were sold in China. It remains to be seen whether China will continue to comply with international sanctions against Russia or whether a decision not to comply would force Brussels closer to Washington, D.C., in its approach to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the United States, the European Union has recently made significant changes to its export control and foreign investment policy. In September 2021, the European Union announced its new Export Control Regulation, which tightens control of dual-use items, strengthens critical supply chains, and protects human rights. It also seeks to enhance cohesion among member states regarding export control policy, including by providing capacity-building and training services for licensing and enforcement programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the TTC has bolstered EU-U.S. collaboration on export controls following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The TTC has provided diplomats with clear communication channels through which to consult on urgent trade and security matters, including semiconductor supply chains. In the European Union, export controls have historically been a competency of member states, which vary by country. For example, Belgium delegates export licensing responsibility to its three regional states, adding complexity to an export control regime closely intertwined with — though distinct from — the European Commission. The joint statement released following the May 2022 ministerial lays out the transatlantic plan to cooperate more closely on semiconductor R&amp;amp;D, including increasing transparency on subsidies and developing an early warning system for semiconductor supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Group of Seven (G7), currently under German leadership, has also proven adroit at navigating security and supply chain issues. The G7 responded swiftly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, revoking Russia’s most favored nation status and initiating sweeping sanctions on key Russian officials and business elites. Given the near impossibility of expelling Russia from the Wassenaar Arrangement and the improbability of Russia removing itself, multilateral cooperation on export controls is likely to occur through other frameworks, such as the G7, the TTC, and smaller plurilateral agreements. There is growing discussion about the need to capitalize on current momentum behind the international response to Russia by creating a new plurilateral arrangement for advanced technologies among allied countries. Possible participants include specific EU member states (such as France, Germany, and the Netherlands), Japan, South Korea, and potentially Taiwan. Such an architecture could either complement the Wassenaar Arrangement or potentially replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is growing discussion about the need to capitalize on current momentum behind the international response to Russia by creating a new plurilateral arrangement for advanced technologies among allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quad-cooperation&quot;&gt;Quad Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India, slated to become the world’s most populous nation, is a major growth market for the semiconductor industry. In 2020, semiconductor consumption in India was worth 1.1 trillion rupees ($13.87 billion), significantly less than the €44 billion ($47.8 billion) consumed in Europe in 2020. However, consumption of semiconductors in India is expected to grow to $80–90 billion by 2030. Despite a large population and growing manufacturing base, India imports nearly 100 percent of its commercial semiconductor products. Most large multinational semiconductor companies such as Intel, Samsung, TSMC, NXP, Broadcom, and Micron have offices in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; India has thus far specialized in the R&amp;amp;D and design phases of the semiconductor supply chain. A deep bench of highly skilled information technology and engineering workers, coupled with world-renowned public institutes of technology, enables India to specialize in R&amp;amp;D. This has led to several important public and private semiconductor R&amp;amp;D facilities in India. Since 2006, the Indian government has supported two Centers of Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CENs) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore and at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in Mumbai. IISc’s CEN hosts over 150 researchers across 14,000 square feet of cleanroom space, with the capacity to conduct leading-edge R&amp;amp;D at the 10 nm level. IITB’s CEN hosts a nanofabrication facility that has limited fab capabilities for two-inch, four-inch, and eight-inch silicon wafers, though only for R&amp;amp;D purposes. In the private sector, several major semiconductor companies, such as Micron, Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, and Huawei, have R&amp;amp;D facilities in Bangalore, “India’s Silicon Valley.” For both Intel and Samsung, their facilities in Bangalore represent their largest R&amp;amp;D operations outside of their home countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, over 500,000 Indian engineers are involved in designing 2,000 chips each year. This is the largest number of leading-edge chip designers outside of the United States. In India, most design output comes from very large-scale integration and electronic design automation (EDA). However, the United States continues to dominate by far in EDA scale and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its relatively strong R&amp;amp;D capabilities, India lags in semiconductor fabrication. India attempted to incentivize private fab construction in the late 2000s and 2010s, but it currently has only two fabs: the Society for Integrated Circuit Technology and Applied Research (SITAR) in Bengaluru and the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) outside of Chandigarh. SITAR can produce six-inch wafers, but not advanced nodes. SCL can fabricate 180 nm six-inch and eight-inch wafers. However, both facilities are government-run and primarily produce semiconductor products for defense and space uses, not for the Indian commercial market, though they do have onsite packaging and testing capacity. As a result, India produces no legacy or next-generation chips for export or domestic consumption, instead relying on imports of many of the products it researches and designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The Indian government has taken several initiatives since December 2021 under its Semicon India Program, with an outlay of $10 billion to increase production of semiconductors. These include (a) a scheme for setting up semiconductor fabs, with financial support subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, infrastructure support, and a designation of a nodal agency for faster regulatory approvals; (b) a scheme for setting up display fabs, with similar fiscal and infrastructure support, and establishment of the nodal agency; (c) a scheme for setting up compound semiconductors and semiconductor assembly, testing, marking, and packaging, with a percentage of capital expenditure fiscally supported by the government on fulfillment of relevant criteria; and (d) the Design Linked Incentive Scheme composed of chip design infrastructure support, product design linked incentive, and deployment linked incentive. Through these incentives, the government is also looking to increase foreign investment in the sector. In February 2022, the government confirmed that it received applications from three companies for semiconductor fabs, two companies for display fabs, four companies for compound semiconductors and assembly, and three companies for design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, systemic issues continue to restrain enthusiasm for closer collaboration with India. Ongoing water shortages, power outages, and transportation disincentivize new investment, particularly the construction of new production facilities. Furthermore, India has historically been reluctant to join the Western sanctions and export control regimes, aside from the Wassenaar Arrangement. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, India opted against joining the Western sanctions effort and abstained from a vote at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s invasion, making India an outlier among the major powers. India’s decision to maintain a middle line in global relations with China and Russia dilutes its attractiveness as a trusted partner for friend-shoring secure semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is the world’s fourth-largest market for semiconductor manufacturing and equipment sales. The United States Department of Commerce estimates that Japan’s semiconductor industry will grow to over $47 billion in 2022 after having grown more than 19 percent in 2021. In terms of global monthly wafer capacity, Japan accounts for roughly 15.8 percent of global supply. The effects of the ongoing semiconductor shortage have been particularly acute in Japan’s automobile sector. In October 2021, for example, domestic automobile sales declined 31.3 percent due to the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan still has the most semiconductor factories in the world, these factories largely lag behind other more high-tech factories abroad and, thus, do not produce the type of cutting-edge semiconductor chips that are needed around the world. Japan’s strength lies in its deep industrial expertise in semiconductor materials. For instance, in 2019, Sony semiconductors became a top global supplier through the production of camera image sensors. Other examples include Lasertech Corp., the world’s sole manufacturer of equipment that tests stencils for the most advanced chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan specializes in power semiconductors and NAND flash memory chips, it lags behind other Asian competitors — namely, South Korea and Taiwan — when it comes to the manufacture of next-generation, highly specialized chips. Furthermore, despite being home to 84 chip factories, Japan imports 64 percent of its chips, making it reliant on foreign producers and vulnerable to semiconductor supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for this reliance is Japan’s failure to embrace a horizontal production model of chips that gained favor in the early 2000s. The Japanese model instead focused on vertical integration, whereby companies like Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Hitachi produced chips solely for their own products. This model ultimately lost out to companies like TSMC, which focuses on producing chips for a wide range of uses and companies. Other reasons for the decline in Japanese chip making include the industry’s delay in embracing digitalization and a lack of public investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Although Japanese R&amp;amp;D expenditure remains relatively high at roughly 3 percent of the GDP, it continues to lag behind competitors when it comes to industrial innovation. In May 2021, TSMC announced it would open an R&amp;amp;D facility in Japan to develop cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The cost of the new project is anticipated to be roughly $338 million, of which the Japanese government will subsidize about half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; The 1980s were marked by lithography asymmetry between the United States and Japan, though Japan became dominant as the country’s indigenous semiconductor market expanded. Japanese manufacturing is not as strong as it was in the 1980s and 1990s. Statistics from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) show that the Japanese share of the world’s semiconductor market shrank from 50 percent in 1990 to 10 percent today. One factor that affected Japan’s domestic semiconductor market was the entry into the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement in 1986. The agreement called for antidumping guarantees, along with a 20 percent market share provision meant to open the Japanese market to foreign producers over a five-year time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor that restrained Japanese growth of the indigenous semiconductor industry is that Japanese companies invested in dynamic random access memory (DRAM), rather than advanced logic chips. Intense competition from Korean firms in DRAM memory led Japanese companies to double down on DRAM-related skills and accelerate production of DRAM memory chips, moving the Japanese market further away from a focus on computing power. Around the time this decision was made, U.S. markets shifted their focus to computing power rather than memory. Advanced computation capabilities have national security implications, including applications in quantum computing efforts and military advancements, meaning that investments in advanced computing — rather than memory chips — can facilitate increased strategic independence over time and reduce reliance on foreign producers for critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; In June 2021, METI announced the creation of its “Strategy for Semiconductors and the Digital Industry.” A core goal of the new strategy is to maintain Japan’s modest 10 percent of the global market share of semiconductors by 2030. Maintaining that 10 percent market share will cost an estimated $38 billion. In recognizing the weaknesses in its semiconductor supply chain, the government is working to help companies enhance production of chips, large-capacity batteries, and other key materials through subsidy programs. In addition to the public funding boost for Japan’s semiconductor industry, TSMC has announced it will spend $7 billion to open a new production facility in southern Japan, expected to be completed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the United States and Japan held the first ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Commercial and Industrial Partnership, at which the parties agreed to develop “Basic Principles on Semiconductor Cooperation” to be coordinated by the United States Department of Commerce and METI. At the leadership summit of the two heads of state in late May, the parties announced efforts “to cooperate on diversifying semiconductor production capacity, increasing transparency, coordinating emergency response on shortages, and strengthening semiconductor R&amp;amp;D and workforce development.” The United States and Japan are also working toward creating a working group to facilitate joint research into state-of-the-art semiconductors. They also agreed to establish a “Work Plan on Export Control Cooperation.” These joint initiatives seek to enhance semiconductor supply chain resiliency while limiting the proliferation of sensitive dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;AUSTRALIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from producing some chips used in Wi-Fi and the Mars Rover, Australia is largely a consumer of chips and lacks the direction and commercial will to reenter the strategic semiconductor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia does have potential strengths based on its history and market dynamics. It has world-class design capability in radio frequency, millimeter wave, photonics, and radar. Australia is also fortunate to have abundant and underdeveloped silica deposits, a critical compound for wafers. Its history of successful mineral exploration and extraction could accelerate the development of domestic silica mines. Alternatively, Australia’s robust materials science, academic, and R&amp;amp;D capabilities are also well positioned to explore silica substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Australian companies involved in the semiconductor industry are small and scattered, and have different technological requirements for semiconductor development. Some of the biggest challenges involved in growing the industry are deciding where to build a foundry and figuring out how to grow the ecosystem. A manufacturing plant will not automatically turn the switch on for the industry. There are currently no large Australian companies whose core business activity is participation in the semiconductor design, development, and production value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several downside risks for large Australian semiconductor producers. Risks include a lack of historical experience in the sector and a lack of incentives for capital investors, which lack the impetus to launch the typical 5–10-year investment cycle needed to establish the industry. Australian investors are also reluctant to accelerate investments due to the regional competition from Taiwan, as well as a crowded global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-quadrilateral-security-dialogue&quot;&gt;THE QUADRILATERAL SECURITY DIALOGUE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Quad countries convened in person for the first time in September 2021, the joint statement highlighted that the partners are working together to map semiconductor supply chains. The parties affirmed “positive commitment to resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains of critical technologies, recognizing the importance of government support measures and policies that are transparent and market-oriented.” Joint efforts to build more resilient supply chains and combat nonmarket economic practices represent an enhanced level of coordination against China. Australia and Japan have joined efforts to restrict trade with Russia, but India’s reluctance to join the coordinated response weakens the Quad’s general position vis-à-vis Europe when it comes to friend-shoring semiconductor supply chains. Overall, it remains to be seen which tangible results will materialize from Quad partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Recommendations and Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor GVCs are inherently complex in nature, meaning there are distinct limitations to what the United States can accomplish unilaterally. Onshoring of semiconductor supply chains is not feasible in the short term. In the long term, onshoring would raise prices, reduce efficiency, and dampen long-term U.S. competitiveness. Thus emerges the need for an affirmative agenda for semiconductor supply chains among allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fundamental recommendation from interviews conducted for this research project centered around the need to identify tangible goals that will enable governments and the private sector to bolster semiconductor supply chain resiliency. Another recommendation that emerged from this research is the need for the U.S. government to promulgate consistent, predictable policies — particularly related to trade — including collaborating to create a new Information Technology Agreement (ITA) to reduce tariffs on additional ICT goods. Overall, interviewees stressed that the government should avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries and should consider the creation of a new mini-export control regime that could function similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement. These findings, coupled with an evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of working with specific countries, make closer cooperation particularly enticing with Belgium, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States, in concert with close allies, must identify the goals it seeks to achieve by bolstering efforts to friend-shore supply chains, while simultaneously seeking to dampen the ability of foreign adversaries to gain a competitive edge over next-generation chips. Allied countries need to determine whether their policies are primarily motivated by pandemic-induced supply chain crunches or whether these policies constitute an inherently negative agenda that is reactionary to adversaries’ technological advancements. Once allies have an affirmative agenda, it will fall on countries to collaborate on smart, targeted investments that bolster innovation. These investments should seek to mitigate “small batch” problems that restrain the ability of startups to obtain prototypes of new semiconductors. These policies should also seek to avoid a subsidy war in which multi-government spending results in significant overcapacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to leading efforts in building an affirmative semiconductor supply chain agenda, the United States should work with close allies to promulgate consistent, predictable policies. These include increased certainty about the application of tariffs that affect the semiconductor industry. For example, the USTR finding that Vietnam’s currency manipulation was actionable under Section 301, coupled with labor shortages and Covid-19 regulations, created an environment that led to Samsung relocating some of its production to Indonesia and India. Such a move was costly for the company and an option only available to large firms with adequate agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also work with allies to create a new ITA with the goal of reducing tariffs on additional ICT goods. Technology changes quickly in this sector, and the first two ITA iterations do not cover newly developed products and technologies. A new ITA would represent a step forward in continuing liberalization throughout the ICT sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promulgating consistent trade policy with allies is also crucial. Moreover, the United States should avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries, as well as restraining the ability of U.S. firms to invest in next-generation R&amp;amp;D efforts. If the United States chooses to pursue a more integrated approach to semiconductor supply chains with the European Union and Japan, this decision is likely to have a fundamental impact on existing international export control architecture, potentially leading to the creation of a new framework. The United States should therefore also more seriously consider the creation of a mini-regime, which could function more similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement. A new mini-regime could also enhance information sharing among allies and increase transparency related to government spending on semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely that even a highly coordinated mini-regime will prevent China from obtaining critical semiconductor technology in the long run. However, an effective regime can delay that inevitability and buy time for like-minded countries to invest in and create the next generation of semiconductors, increasing tech sector independence and resiliency. Furthermore, a new mini-regime could capitalize on current momentum among a group of 38 countries to coordinate and codify new technology controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given plans in the European Union to fortify and expand its semiconductor capabilities, the United States should work with Brussels in the TTC to institutionalize closer collaboration. The parties should work together to implement frameworks that would facilitate surge capacity for production, including an assistance agreement to ramp up production in cases of supply chain disruptions. While redundancy in production can be helpful in certain instances — for example to ensure an adequate supply of chips used in automobiles — with limited financial resources, the parties should seek to avoid duplicative efforts on next-generation R&amp;amp;D. Overall, increased semiconductor cooperation presents the United States and the European Union with a unique opportunity to build a positive agenda that cements its leadership in critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long maintained export controls in the semiconductors sector, particularly on chip manufacturing equipment, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating relations with China have made national security a much more important part of the trade policy debate. The result is that companies are forced to rethink how they make location decisions. Supply chain management historically has centered around price, quality, and delivery. Now, in this sector in particular, governments have effectively added security and compliance with government policies and regulations as an important additional variable that affects companies’ supply chain location strategies. In an already complex industry operating in an environment of growing geopolitical tensions, cooperation with allies becomes even more important for the private sector and governments alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the United States has long maintained export controls in the semiconductors sector, particularly on chip manufacturing equipment, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating relations with China have made national security a much more important part of the trade policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both the United States and foreign partners, governments need to identify — and then implement policy based on — where they want to lead and where they can afford to follow. Thus emerges an inherent need to develop an affirmative strategy that identifies end goals and leverages multilateral frameworks as an avenue for achieving those goals. Creating a stronghold over chokepoints throughout semiconductor GVCs affects consumer markets and national security capabilities, thus amounting to geopolitical power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on an assessment of what EU and Quad countries are currently producing, as well as their alignment with U.S. export control policy, the best candidates for friend-shoring U.S. semiconductor supply chains are EU member states and Japan. Within the European Union, the best candidates from a supply chain security perspective, both in terms of national security considerations and overall supply chain resiliency, are Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Each has an educated population, a relatively open immigration system that can attract foreign talent, and an existing close relationship with the United States on issues of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For both the United States and foreign partners, governments need to identify — and then implement policy based on — where they want to lead and where they can afford to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, disruptions throughout the semiconductor GVC are likely to persist, making it a more urgent matter for governments and the private sector to minimize ongoing disruptions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine could prolong these trade disturbances and could also usher in a more fractured global trading system in which China and Russia become closer and liberal democracies band together, leaving countries like India awkwardly in the middle. Mounting tension between authoritarian and democratic states, coupled with an injection of social policy into trade agendas, is likely to reshuffle semiconductor GVCs, particularly as the United States reconsiders what qualifies countries to maintain trusted trading partner status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sinking of the Russian Slava-class cruiser Moskva in April this year by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missile may well have been a watershed moment. This is not because it illustrated the risks posed to warships by anti-access capabilities – something already well understood and accounted for in naval circles – but rather because it signposted the potential for smaller states to assure their own maritime sovereignty with little or limited support from larger partners. This, of course, is not just a matter of importance to Ukraine and Russia – it is increasingly a factor in the strategic competition underway in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though anti-ship cruise missiles are not themselves a gamechanger, they could in future form part of a package of measures including weaponised uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs), uncrewed aerial vehicles, and a range of other increasingly affordable capabilities that can enable defenders to impose an exacting, unacceptable cost on potential aggressors. Coupled with options such as containerised missiles on nondescript vessels such as cargo ships, they could significantly limit the ability of revisionist actors to challenge the maritime status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the lowering of the unit costs, there is more to anti-access/area denial than just buying the latest equipment. To be effective, the defender must be able to combine capabilities into a system of systems, to have real-time local maritime domain awareness, and to exercise slick command and control, all in a bespoke manner to suit particular circumstances. The process of designing and building these system architectures and training people to operate and maintain them may still benefit from partnership. It is here that we see a point of synergy between the stated ambitions of countries such as the UK with a persistently engaged – albeit small – naval force, and the aspirations of coastal states who, in many cases, may seek strategic partnerships with third parties rather than explicit alignments with regional or global hegemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-lessons-from-ukraine-and-the-concept-of-assured-sovereignty&quot;&gt;The Lessons from Ukraine and the Concept of Assured Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must not read too much into the sinking of the Moskva. The vessel was in many ways decrepit, and its crew may not have been vigilant to the Ukrainian anti-ship cruise missile threat. Well-equipped warships with alert crews should hardly be sitting ducks for missiles, and the engagement could have ended very differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trends in areas such as electronic miniaturisation are enabling sophisticated guidance and targeting payloads to be incorporated into relatively small effectors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we might also consider that the Ukrainian capacity to erect a localised anti-access bubble was less robust than it might have been given more time and greater partner support. For example, the number of anti-ship cruise missiles at Ukraine’s disposal was minimal, and the Neptune (a variant of the Soviet-era KH-35) does not benefit from the characteristics of more modern missiles such as low observability or very high speed. Moreover, Ukraine had little chance to bring its vision of a mosquito fleet – something it intended to build with UK support – into existence before the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To consider what such a mosquito fleet might look like, or how assured sovereignty in the maritime domain might work, we could look to countries such as Iran, which combines ground-based missiles with missile-equipped fast-attack craft operating in swarms, midget submarines and weaponised UUVs. The threat the Iranian navy poses is not driven by any one capability, but by its ability to deploy many simultaneously, confusing its adversary’s picture and operating well inside its observe-orient-decide-act loop. This threat would not be insurmountable for a Western navy in a high-intensity fight, but the very costs it could impose serves as an important part of the Iranian maritime deterrent during conditions of constant competition. Harass rather than defeat may often be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same suite of capabilities that enables offensive action can also enable more defensive purposes with growing potency. Trends in areas such as electronic miniaturisation are enabling sophisticated guidance and targeting payloads to be incorporated into relatively small effectors – something that the UK’s own capabilities like Spear-3 illustrate. This extends to a range of other relatively low-cost, small effectors such as loitering munitions. Consider, for example, the Israeli Harpy – a 500km range munition with a unit cost of $70,000 – or the US Navy’s SLOCUM glider – a low-cost automated surveillance asset which could easily be utilised as a smart mine, capable of designating its own targets. Trends in areas such as additive manufacturing will likely drive the costs of these capabilities down even further. Finally, as North Korea’s testing of a hypersonic glide vehicle shows, with partner support, even states with very limited capabilities can field a small number of more exquisite assets, which – if deployed judiciously – can act as effective deterrents. Combined with traditional green water assets such as frigates, corvettes and diesel electric submarines, they could pose a substantial challenge in areas that a larger adversary might previously have considered permissive sea space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, though effectors are increasingly low-cost, the underpinnings that make them an effective, reliable system are not. For example, the ability to operate effectively against hostile vessels – especially in congested waterways where a substantial amount of neutral shipping may be present – requires a robust and high-fidelity C4ISR capability that can withstand disruption. Consider, for example, the way in which Ukraine’s early warning network was destroyed in the early days of the war. Not only does this require resilient networks and the information architecture needed to fuse data from multiple sources, but it also imposes exacting demands on operators. Skilled operators capable of making decisions with only partial information and a network architecture capable of drawing data from other sources, including proliferating commercial networks, will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Assured sovereignty aligns the Royal Navy’s ends with its regional means and dovetails with the objectives of partner states who seek to deter unwanted interference without joining formal military alliances&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why relatively affordable capabilities, such as air defence systems, have typically required substantial advisory missions to enable the creation and operation of a systems architecture. The utilisation of area denial capabilities also requires other organisational competencies. As examples from the Iran–Iraq tanker war – including the attack on the USS Stark and the mine damage to the USS Samuel Roberts – show, damaging the wrong target – even inadvertently – can have international repercussions. The need to classify targets under conditions of limited information demands a sophisticated organisational capacity for information processing, which will become all the more acute when making decisions about when to release weapons capable of self-designation. Finally, though the unit costs of emerging effectors may be cheap, the human capital and infrastructure needed for their manufacture is not. This is likely to be true in other areas, such as the use of automation for data fusion and command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-engagement-and-assured-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Persistent Engagement and Assured Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that partners can offer choice and value. The development of resilient ISR and the capacity to operate under contested conditions, which navies including the Royal Navy are working to achieve, can be co-developed with partners. Partners from more established forces can add expertise in a number of key areas, from niche capabilities such as the connectors and procedures needed to manoeuvre in littoral spaces, to organisational competencies such as planning and staffing campaigns. In return, the less developed force contributes local area expertise, skilled labour and the determination to maintain its independence. There are opportunities in the process of knowledge exchange which can lead to valuable synergies for all partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Royal Navy looks to build on its presence in the Indo-Pacific, a two-ocean mega-region where it has limited mass and competes with a systemic challenger with the world’s largest navy, it will require a concept that links persistent engagement to desired ends. Assured sovereignty could be precisely such a concept. Not only does it align the Royal Navy’s ends with its regional means but, crucially, it also dovetails with the national political objectives of partner states who seek to deter unwanted interference without joining formal military alliances. The concept could also support the evolution of frameworks such as the Five Power Defence Arrangements or even AUKUS – which, as it evolves beyond an initial focus on delivering submarines to Australia, could emphasise the co-development of capabilities for export to other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this is a modern variant of the active defence described by figures such as Sir Julian Corbett as the optimal choice for a weaker maritime power, or of the naval strategy developed by la Jeune Ecole, combining shore-based defence with active hit-and-run attacks by light flotillas. The very tactics and techniques used by China to safeguard its own (and its illegally claimed) maritime territory can now help to safeguard at affordable cost the coasts, territorial waters, maritime infrastructure, and exclusive economic zones of states unwilling to pay tribute to Beijing, without them becoming wholly dependent on Washington. In short, they represent an opportunity to achieve the paramount goal of all small, independent states: assured sovereignty, on their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

Opponents of the regime and even ordinary citizens who have had unauthorized foreign contacts are being thrown into Moscow’s Lefortovo Prison, where in Stalinist times, political prisoners were tortured and executed. Special border agents have been interrogating and intimidating Russians who are trying to leave or return. But even those who have made it out are not safe; exiles who have spoken out are being investigated, and their relatives in Russia are being harassed by the regime. And security police are cracking down on Russian companies that buy foreign rather than Russian raw materials and hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters its sixth month, a dramatic shift has occurred in the Kremlin’s security bureaucracy, and it has centered on the agency closest to Putin himself: the Federal Security Service, or FSB. When the war began, the Kremlin planned to use the FSB mainly in Ukraine, as a special operations force that would consolidate a rapid Russian conquest. According to the plan, the Russian tanks rolling into Ukraine would trigger regime change in Kyiv, and a new pro-Moscow leadership, sponsored by FSB spymasters, would take control of the country. At the time, it was the FSB’s foreign intelligence branch — the Fifth Service — that was to carry out this task. It was the only major FSB department, out of a dozen, that was directly involved in preparing for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As those plans faltered, however, Putin crafted a different, far more comprehensive mission for the FSB: it would be at the forefront of Russia’s total war effort at home as well as its intelligence operations in Ukraine. And every branch of the service would now be involved. Running the new crackdowns in Russia are the FSB’s counterterrorism unit, its counterintelligence service, and its investigative department. Meanwhile, FSB special forces and the military counterintelligence branch are running operations targeting Ukrainian service people in occupied territories and beyond, recruiting Ukrainian agents, and processing those whom the FSB hopes to see prosecuted in show trials. FSB agents are stationed at Russia’s borders, and the Economic Security Service, which is often considered the most corrupt department of the FSB, has been vigorously enforcing Russia’s economic policies. At FSB headquarters at Lubyanka Square in Moscow, the agency’s rank and file have been told to prepare for three-month tours of duty in the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the FSB spearheads a transformed, increasingly paranoid, and heavily securitized state bureaucracy, the shift has profound implications for the nature of Putin’s rule. In contrast to the largely surveillance-oriented agency of previous years, the FSB has become a far more expansive arm of an increasingly ruthless state. In its sweeping reach into domestic society, foreign affairs, and the military, the FSB has begun to look less like its late-Soviet predecessor, the KGB. It now resembles something much scarier: the NKVD, Stalin’s notorious secret police, which conducted the great purges of the 1930s and maintained an iron lock on Russian society into the early years of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-long-reach-of-lubyanka&quot;&gt;The Long Reach of Lubyanka&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not hard to find signs of the FSB’s evolving strategy. Consider its tactics toward journalists and members of the political opposition. In the past, when it came to the press, the FSB limited itself to spying on journalists critical of the government and encouraging them to leave the country. Even when Ivan Safronov, a former journalist who covered the military for the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant, was arrested on treason charges in the summer of 2020, it was understood as a message to the others: stop writing about sensitive issues or leave the country. In fact, the following year, many Russian journalists were placed on a government list of foreign agents but not arrested, and many went into exile. This exodus continued in the opening phase of the war in Ukraine, when hundreds of Russian journalists and activists fled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the spring, however, the FSB has set out to reverse the flow. Two months after the war started, for example, it let in the prominent opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza. For years, Kara-Murza has shuttled between the United States, Europe, and Russia, promoting sanctions against Putin’s cronies; since the war started, he has feared that the Kremlin would ban him from entering Russia. But in April, Kara-Murza flew to Moscow and was let in — only to be swiftly thrown in jail, where he has remained ever since, on charges of spreading fake news about the war. In July, another opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, was arrested on identical charges. After Alexei Navalny was arrested and imprisoned — following his own return to Russia in August 2021 — Yashin was the most prominent opposition figure; now, like Navalny and Kara-Murza, he has been locked up and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no accident. Starting in May 2022, the FSB has been visiting the families of Russian exiles to convey the message that the Russian government is ready to welcome the exiles back. There are also reports that Russian IT specialists who left Russia at the start of the war but returned have been summoned to FSB headquarters and interrogated: the agency was seeking information in particular about Russian exiles who have stayed abroad. Rather than forcing Russians out, where they may be able to encourage opposition movements, the regime has decided that it would be better to keep them under close watch in Russia — an approach last used by the Kremlin during the early stages of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shifting tactics, the FSB is luring opposition figures back to Russia and arresting them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the FSB has become bolder in its pursuit of journalists and others who have long been in exile. Here, we can cite our own experience: in March, the internal security department of the FSB initiated a criminal case against one of us, Andrei Soldatov, on charges of spreading fake news about the war, charges that carry a sentence of up to ten years in prison. Soldatov’s bank accounts in Russia have been frozen, and the Russian government has issued formal international warrants to arrest him and extradite him to Russia. The number of Russian journalists who have been threatened with similar charges has only grown. And since most already live in exile, the criminal cases are meant to put further pressure on their relatives back in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally dramatic has been the agency’s growing crackdown on scientists, lawyers, and other Russians who have been involved in activities the regime now regards as suspect. The FSB’s efforts to harass and intimidate Russian scientists who collaborate with foreign research institutions are not new. But since the war began, the FSB has become far more aggressive. On June 30, the agency took extreme action against Dmitry Kolker, the director of the Laboratory of Quantum Optics at Novosibirsk State University, accusing him of treason for purportedly sharing state secrets with China. (He gave a series of lectures in China as part of an exchange program.) Even though Kolker was in a hospital with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the FSB arrested him and sent him to Lefortovo Prison, where he died three days later. Many Russians were shocked, but this was hardly an isolated incident. A day before Kolker’s arrest, the FSB jailed Dmitry Talantov, a prominent human rights lawyer, who had defended Safronov, the journalist accused of treason by the FSB. Talantov now found himself charged with spreading fake news about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even mainstream sectors of the Russian economy have come under FSB pressure. Consider Russia’s national health-care system. Since June, the Russian financial monitoring agency, together with the FSB, has investigated medical clinics across the country for prescribing Western drugs rather than Russian ones. The campaign was presented to the public as “cracking down on schemes by foreign pharmaceutical companies that sell their drugs through Russian doctors.” The Kremlin has also asked the FSB to investigate bureaucrats who “failed” to substitute Russian products, like IT technologies, for foreign ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB purges have also begun to reach the Russian elite, including senior security officials themselves. In July, three top generals in the Interior Ministry were arrested on embezzlement charges; the operation has been regarded as a message to the interior minister to watch himself — nobody is completely safe in this new security state. This is only the latest in a series of purges that have targeted Oleg Mitvol, a well-connected former prefect of Moscow Precinct, and Vladimir Mau, a leading Russian economist, who is close to the liberal bloc of the government and head of the Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, the major training facility for Russian bureaucrats. Mitvol was thrown into jail; Mau was put under house arrest — events that have unnerved the Moscow financial elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most striking change concerns the FSB’s tactics in Ukraine. Before the war, the FSB’s role was mostly to recruit Ukrainian politicians. Now, the agency is running a massive operation to detain large numbers of Ukrainians in Russia and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. The main task of this operation is not to expose Ukrainian terrorists, as the FSB officially claims; rather, it is to process large numbers of Ukrainians in order to recruit assets and send them back to Ukraine, on FSB orders. Nor has the FSB neglected a ruthless pursuit of Ukrainian intelligence agents, as well as the units that defended the Azovstal steel works against an 82-day siege by Russian forces this spring. Along with Russians who are accused of state treason, these high-value Ukrainians have been sent to Lefortovo Prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-in-the-ussr&quot;&gt;Back in the USSR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB’s sweeping new role raises larger questions about Putin’s regime. For years, it has been well known that Putin has modeled his security services in part on Soviet practices, including those of the KGB, where he spent almost 16 years. For much of Putin’s time in office — and especially over the past five years, as he sought to shore up his regime — the KGB model made sense. For one thing, in the later decades of the Soviet era, the KGB, although it was powerful, remained a comparatively small organization and preferred a light approach to control. It watched and spied on everyone, from factory workers to ballerinas, but the KGB didn’t seek to carry out large-scale arrests or purges. Instead, it relied on sophisticated forms of intimidation that could make people fall in line without mass repression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other respects, the KGB was also shaped by the politics of the post-Stalin era. Rather than controlled by a single all-powerful leader, it was a bureaucracy that answered to the Communist Party. And although the agency was omnipresent, it was largely invisible: KGB officers hated military uniforms, preferring gray suits instead. The KGB also invested hugely in public relations, sponsoring books and movies promoting the image of the agency as the most intellectual government entity in the country — the only one that could effectively fight corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first 15 years in power, Putin relied on the FSB but tried to distance it somewhat from the KGB. He wanted the FSB to be his rapid-response team, rushing to him with solutions to his political problems, inside and outside Russia. But after the FSB repeatedly let him down — failing to warn him of color revolutions, Moscow protests, and finally, the Maidan revolution in Kyiv in 2014 — Putin changed the rules. Instead of having the FSB serve as a rapid-response force, he revised its mandate to something much closer to that of the KGB. He made it an instrument for providing political stability through the intimidation of the Russian people, including elites. But the recent moves suggest that Putin is once again shifting course. Instead of the KGB of the 1970s and 1980s, the FSB increasingly resembles Stalin’s secret services, the NKVD, which aimed to a much greater degree at total control of the Russian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putins-monster&quot;&gt;Putin’s Monster&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin’s NKVD — the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs — was a true monstrosity. Stalin purposely designed the ministry to oversee vast and widely disparate parts of the Soviet state, including the national railway system, Russia’s nuclear program, and the assassination of Stalin’s enemies abroad. The NKVD oversaw police, espionage operations, political repressions, and the Gulag (the Soviet Union’s extensive system of forced labor camps), as well as the construction industry and even public utilities. To conduct internal repressions, the NKVD built up a network of directorates all over the country: to process such large numbers required an enormous security bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NKVD was also heavily militarized. Not only did NKVD officers wear military uniforms and carry military ranks but the agency also had its own military units equipped with heavy weaponry such as tanks and aircraft. At the end of the 1930s, as war in Europe looked increasingly likely, Stalin put the country on a military footing, beginning with his security bureaucracy. Once the war started, NKVD troops set up camps in the occupied territories of Poland and the Baltics to identify troublemakers and recruit agents. The NKVD was also put in charge of a campaign to get Russian exiles to return to Russia at the end of the war. These were people who had fled Soviet Russia, and many of them were persuaded to return — only to end up in Stalin’s camps. In these and other ways, the NKVD was designed for a regime that was constantly at war: with its own political enemies, with former comrades in the country and abroad, and with the West. And what made the NKVD so powerful — and so feared — was that it answered only to Stalin, not to the Communist Party or the Soviet government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the war in Ukraine began, Putin’s rapidly growing security state seems to be inching closer to its Stalinist predecessor. The militarization of the FSB, its new recruitment camps, its increasingly open and brutal tactics all suggest that Putin is looking more closely at the approach of the NKVD — an agency that was forged by a totalitarian state in wartime. And the long war is what the Kremlin is priming the country for.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes the Philippines, which is vulnerable to external threats and aiming to modernize its military by the end of 2027. Japan has developed a close relationship with the Philippines and supported capacity building to help Manila manage an increasingly complex security environment, including concerns about a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Japan’s relationships with Southeast Asian countries, its relationship with the Philippines is particularly close. The Fukuda Doctrine, which later became the cornerstone of Japan’s diplomacy with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), was announced by Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda in Manila in August 1977 and focused mainly on economic cooperation. However, security cooperation between the two countries has also developed in recent years. More recently, Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept, introduced by former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2016, accelerated these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines is due to a shared sense of urgency after China actively pursued maritime expansion in the 2010s. A collision between two Chinese patrol vessels and a Philippine survey vessel at Reed Bank in March 2011 and a standoff at Scarborough Reef in 2012 shocked the Benigno Aquino III administration and caused it to seek defense cooperation with Japan and Australia in addition to its only ally, the United States. Meanwhile, Chinese coercion around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea began straining Japan-China relations in 2009 and prompted Japan to network more closely with countries around the region to counter Chinese assertiveness throughout the First Island Chain. In a veiled reference to China, Japan’s first national security strategy, unveiled in 2013, states that Japan will strengthen diplomatic and security cooperation with ASEAN countries, which prefer to resolve the South China Sea issue according to the rule of law rather than by force. Thus, defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines has progressed in countering China’s maritime expansion in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity building for Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, is critical to addressing the challenges posed by Chinese assertiveness. As David B. Shear, former assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, noted with regard to U.S. force posture in the region, “In Northeast Asia we have a clear forward line of defense, numerous forward deployed forces, and strong, capable allies. It’s just the opposite in Southeast Asia, where we have a more ambiguous line defense, many fewer forces, and far less capable allies.” Japan has embraced this cause and is working to strengthen the defense capabilities of the Philippines. This paper examines recent developments in defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, reviews the security policies of the Benigno Aquino III (2010–2016) and Rodrigo Duterte (2016–2022) administrations, and proposes measures to strengthen the security partnership between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-in-security-cooperation-between-japan-and-the-philippines&quot;&gt;Progress in Security Cooperation between Japan and the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security partnership between Japan and the Philippines has grown closer in recent years, as evidenced by Japan’s decision in August 2020 to transfer air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines. In June 2021, Japanese minister of defense Nobuo Kishi and Philippine secretary of national defense Delfin Lorenzana held a video teleconference in which they agreed to: (1) strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or any act that would increase tensions, (2) continue to promote bilateral defense cooperation and exchange, and (3) maintain and strengthen the Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Philippines have long had active economic relations and cultural exchanges, but the two countries have made remarkable progress in defense cooperation since the 2010s. In contrast, the relationship between the United States and the Philippines, both treaty allies, has appeared relatively distant in recent years. In February 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte’s entourage was refused entry visas by the United States due to human rights violations, and the Philippines unilaterally notified the United States that it was breaking the Visiting Forces Agreement governing the U.S military presence in the country. In July 2021, U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin visited the Philippines, and the Visiting Forces Agreement was kept in place, but the relationship between the two countries is still in the process of repair. In August 2021, in an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Defense Minister Lorenzana stressed that “U.S. support for the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces would make the Philippines a more reliable ally and would be beneficial to the United States.” However, it is difficult to determine whether concrete progress has been made in security cooperation between the United States and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan-philippines-security-partnership-before-aquino&quot;&gt;Japan-Philippines Security Partnership before Aquino&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the 2010s, the bilateral relationship between Japan and the Philippines was particularly pronounced on the economic front. Figure 1 summarizes the trends of the Philippines’ major trading partners and shows that while China’s advance in 2020 was remarkable, Japan’s presence has been significant since the 1990s. Figure 2 shows the number of foreign visits of Philippine presidents to select major countries, which reveals emphasis on relations with Japan. Japan also has historically been the largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Aquino and Duterte Visits to Select Major Partners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan-Philippines security cooperation started to develop from the early 2000s. During the summit meeting between Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and Philippine president Gloria Arroyo held on September 15, 2001, immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the two leaders agreed to elevate their relationship to a higher partnership level, including discussions on bilateral, regional, and global security. In addition, they affirmed the need to hold an annual political dialogue on security. Also, in December 2006, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Arroyo met in Manila to discuss a wide range of security issues and signed the “Philippines-Japan Joint Statement on the Partnership of Two Neighboring Countries in Proximity for Comprehensive Cooperation.” The statement pledged that the two countries would promote policy dialogue on security, maritime and consular issues and strengthen joint efforts to prevent and combat human trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has also strengthened ties with the Philippines through diplomatic engagement with ASEAN leaders in many international forums, including the Japan-ASEAN Summit (established in 1977), the Japan-ASEAN Forum (established in 1977), the International Conference on the Future of Asia (established in 1995), ASEAN Plus Three (established in 1997), and the East Asia Summit (established in 2005). In addition, the ASEAN Regional Forum (established in 1994) and, more recently, the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (established in 2010), where ministers in charge of foreign affairs and defense participate in ASEAN-related meetings to discuss regional security issues, naturally led to an increase in high-level bilateral exchanges between Japan and the Philippines. Prior to 2012, Tokyo and Manila did not pursue formal agreements on defense cooperation. However, in the face of China’s aggressive behavior in the South and East China Seas, Japan and the Philippines were forced to change this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-the-japan-philippines-security-partnership-during-aquino&quot;&gt;Evolving the Japan-Philippines Security Partnership during Aquino&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The March 2011 collision between two Chinese patrol boats and a Philippine survey ship on the Reed Bank and the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff gave the Aquino administration a great sense of urgency and prompted it to seek military assistance from Japan and Australia in addition to assistance from its only ally, the United States. At the same time, Japan had its own reasons for approaching the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between Japan and China have been strained since a Chinese fishing trawler collided with a Japanese coast guard vessel in the East China Sea in 2010, which was followed by a persistent campaign of Chinese coercion to support its sovereignty claims over the Senkaku Islands, which Japan rejects. Soon after returning to power at the end of 2012, Prime Minister Abe declared, “The islands are Japan’s inherent territory, and we own it, we have effective control over it, and there is no room for negotiation,” and he refused to acknowledge the existence of a dispute over the Senkaku Islands. China responded by increasing the number and frequency of its civilian vessel deployments. Abe then signaled his tough stance on Chinese coercion to support its maritime sovereignty claims in the South China Sea by noting in the country’s first National Security Strategy (released in 2013) that Japan would enhance diplomatic and security cooperation with ASEAN countries that prefer settling South China Sea disputes not by force but by following the rule of law. Thus, in response to China’s maritime aggression, defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, which faces similar challenges in the Scarborough Shoal, started to gain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, Japanese minister of defense Satoshi Morimoto and Philippine minister of defense Voltaire Gazmin signed the Japan-Philippines Defense Cooperation Intention Statement, including plans to conduct a wide range of exchanges among defense officials and explore defense cooperation in areas such as capacity building. A few days after this meeting, Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario announced that Japan would provide 10 40-meter-class vessels to the Philippine coast guard (PCG) by the end of the year as part of Japan’s ODA to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2013, Japanese defense minister Itsunori Onodera and defense secretary Gazmin welcomed the deepening of the “strategic partnership” between Japan and the Philippines in the field of defense, especially in the maritime area, and confirmed that steady progress had been made, including mutual visits between Japan’s chief of the maritime staff and the commander of the Philippine navy; consultations between the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Philippine naval staff; expansion of the JMSDF fleet’s port calls to the Philippines; and implementation of the Pacific Partnership defense exchange in 2012. The two ministers also focused on extending security cooperation between the two countries to the aviation sector, which was emphasized during the visit of the chief of staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force to the Philippines. At the same meeting, Secretary Gazmin proposed allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) access to bases in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also conducted humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities in the Philippines, which was severely damaged by Typhoon Haiyan in mid-November 2013. Japan dispatched three JMSDF destroyers (the transport ship Osumi, the large destroyer Ise, and the supply ship Towada), three CH-47 transport helicopters, three UH-1 transport helicopters, two KC-767 air tankers, seven C-130 transport aircraft, one U-4 support aircraft, and a maximum of about 1,180 personnel to conduct medical and epidemic prevention activities, rescue operations, and the transport of relief supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, President Aquino and Prime Minister Abe also exchanged views on the regional and international situation, including issues surrounding the South China Sea and China’s establishment of an air defense identification zone, and confirmed that they would work even more closely together to address regional and international challenges as the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe. After the meeting, Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine foreign minister del Rosario signed a letter regarding the “provision of patrol boats to the Philippine Coast Guard.” In June 2014, Abe and Aquino met again and exchanged views on the role of the United States in the region. Prime Minister Abe welcomed the recently agreed Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the Philippines and the United States, as it would contribute to regional peace and stability by strengthening U.S. presence in the region, including improving disaster response capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his official visit to Japan in June 2015, President Aquino held in-depth discussions with Prime Minister Abe on regional peace and stability. The two leaders issued two documents, a joint declaration on “A Strengthened Strategic Partnership for Advancing the Shared Principles and Goals for Peace, Security and Growth in the Region and Beyond” and an accompanying action plan. The joint declaration stated that the relationship between the two countries reflects common ideals and goals to ensure regional peace and stability and referenced Chinese behavior by expressing serious concerns about unilateral actions to change the status quo in the South China Sea. In the action plan, the two governments committed to promoting security cooperation in various areas, including intelligence protection, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security, the provision of defense equipment, technical cooperation, and capacity-building support. The two leaders also welcomed the signing of a contract for the construction and acquisition of 10 patrol vessels and expressed their intention to continue and accelerate talks on strengthening maritime domain awareness (MDA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deepening-the-japan-philippines-security-partnership-during-the-duterte-administration&quot;&gt;Deepening the Japan-Philippines Security Partnership during the Duterte Administration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security partnership between Japan and the Philippines, promoted under the Aquino administration, was intended to counter China’s advances in the South China Sea. However, Philippine foreign policy under President Duterte took a different direction. Duterte prioritized economic engagement with China, downplayed territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and the challenges posed by Chinese coercion, and seemed to distance the Philippines from the United States, as evidenced by his declared intent to nullify the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States. Despite apparent tensions in Philippine-U.S. security relations, the two countries confirmed in 2019 that the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty will be invoked in the event of an attack on the Philippines in the South China Sea. Furthermore, the Philippines was one of the first ASEAN countries to announce its support for the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral security partnership announced in 2020. These Philippine actions are understandable given the Philippines’ strategic location along the First Island Chain and the importance of cooperation with the United States and other regional players to counter Chinese assertiveness across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this complicated period in U.S.-Philippines relations, Japan facilitated regular consultations with the Duterte administration to strengthen security ties. In September 2016, Prime Minister Abe held his first summit meeting with President Duterte in Laos. The two leaders agreed to cooperate in the field of maritime security by transferring a JMSDF training aircraft (TC-90) to the Philippine navy and continuing to promote security and defense cooperation by improving the MDA capabilities of the Philippines, supporting pilot training, strengthening the maintenance infrastructure of the Philippine navy, and delivering the first 40-meter-class large patrol boat to the Philippines. During a visit to Japan in October of the same year, President Duterte witnessed the signing of a letter regarding the lease of five JSDF TC-90 maritime reconnaissance aircraft to the Philippines to monitor Chinese activities in the South China Sea and a document to strengthen the PCG by granting the construction of two ships. President Duterte also referenced the prospect of military exercises between the Philippines and Japan in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, Prime Minister Abe paid a two-day official visit to Manila for a summit meeting with Duterte, stating that Japan would further enhance the maritime capabilities of the Philippines through the provision of patrol vessels and training and that the JSDF would participate in that year’s joint U.S.-Philippines Balikatan exercise. President Duterte thanked Japan for its assistance in enhancing capabilities in the field of maritime security and counterterrorism, particularly the provision of patrol vessels and small speed boats and the loan of the TC-90. One U.S. analyst observed that Abe’s visit reflected “Tokyo’s ambition to keep up with growing Chinese influence in the geopolitically strategic Southeast Asian country by ensuring steady flows of aid and investment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2018, Japan had completed the delivery of all five TC-90s to the Philippine navy, which are expected to boost its capabilities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; humanitarian assistance; disaster relief; and maritime air surveillance. Additionally, Japan completed the delivery of 10 multi-role capable vessels to the PCG in August 2018. These vessels are used for search and rescue, marine environmental protection, pollution control, humanitarian and disaster relief, and enforcement of maritime laws. In June 2018, the Japan Ministry of Defense announced that it had decided to transfer parts and other items from UH-1 multi-purpose helicopters retired from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force to the Philippines at no cost. The free transfer of UH-1 parts to the Philippines was the second military equipment transfer to the Philippines since May 2016, when the free transfer of used Japanese patrol aircraft, ships, and other JSDF equipment became possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the momentum for strengthening Japan-Philippines defense cooperation was not lost during the Covid-19 pandemic, even though face-to-face personnel exchanges were temporarily suspended. In August 2020, the Japan Ministry of Defense announced that a contract had been signed between Mitsubishi Electric and the Philippine Department of National Defense regarding air surveillance radars. In July 2021, the first air-to-air bilateral training was conducted between the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the Philippine air force at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, and in June 2022, General Izutsu Shunji, chief of staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, and Lieutenant General Connor Anthony D. Canlas Sr., commanding general of the Philippine air force, were present in the second joint training. During his stay in the Philippines, General Izutsu stated “both nations, the Philippines and Japan, are engaging in increasing surveillance capability (and have) interest in engaging in the space situation awareness.” He also mentioned the possibility of cooperation on air surveillance radars, in terms of software to control the radars, as well as operational training for the Philippine air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-policy-of-the-aquino-administration-20102016&quot;&gt;Security Policy of the Aquino Administration: 2010–2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated by the preceding chapter, security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines increased dramatically in both quantity and quality in the 2010s, especially during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s tenure. Japan’s deepening of defense cooperation with the Philippines is aimed at enhancing the presence of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in Southeast Asia and improving deterrence in the region as a whole by supporting defense capacity building. Japan should seek to further strengthen its security partnerships, particularly interoperability. In order to consider how best to build a more robust security partnership between Japan and the Philippines, it is important to understand the evolution of Philippine defense policy in response to drastic changes in the regional security environment since the 2010s, when China became more assertive with respect to its maritime sovereignty claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Benigno Aquino took office in June 2010, he promised to eradicate poverty and combat corruption and announced a policy to promote stable economic development and peaceful conflict resolution with domestic rebel groups. The content of this inaugural speech clearly shows that the initial threat perception of the Philippines at that time was directed toward domestic threats such as the rebels in Mindanao. The island of Mindanao, located in the south of the Philippines, has long been a predominantly Muslim area, but many Christians settled there under immigration policies dating back to the colonial era. The region has long been beset by conflicts as a result. Aquino pursued peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and in 2014, the government of the Philippines signed the Bangsamoro Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the MILF. However, Aquino’s perceptions of the regional security environment shifted after a Philippine oil exploration vessel was intercepted by a Chinese ship near Reed Bank in March 2011 and after a standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal that lasted about two months, starting in April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Aquino took the two incidents as an opportunity to review the military posture of the country, which had been focused on domestic governance, and began a full-scale modernization effort to make the military more capable of defending the region against external threats. Under a long-term plan, the Aquino administration slowly but steadily built a defense posture capable of dealing with maritime and air threats, despite tight finances, by acquiring two major pieces of equipment: two U.S. Coast Guard Hamilton-class cutters for the Philippine navy and 12 South Korean FA-50 fighter planes for the Philippine air force. In response to China’s violations of Philippine sovereignty, Aquino developed a new defense strategy with four pillars: (1) formulating the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act; (2) building maritime domain awareness; (3) rebuilding air defense posture; and (4) seeking cooperation with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;formulating-the-revised-national-armed-forces-modernization-act&quot;&gt;Formulating the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as July 2010, Aquino had ordered a comprehensive review of the defense system and announced his intention to push for the modernization of the air force for territorial defense. However, in response to the two incidents mentioned above and with external threats in mind, he embarked on a full-scale effort to modernize the military. In December 2012, six months after the impasse at the Scarborough Shoal, he signed Republic Act No. 10349. The act revised Republic Act No. 7898, otherwise known as the AFP Modernization Act, which expired in December 2011 without any significant pieces of equipment acquired for the military. The revised act extended the military modernization program to December 2027. The first phase of the plan under this act was from 2013 to 2017, the second phase is from 2018 to 2022, and the third phase will be from 2023 to 2027. The total funding amount for the first five years is at least 75 billion Philippine pesos ($1.5 billion). Under this long-term plan, the Aquino administration was able to acquire big-ticket assets, such as two former U.S. Coast Guard cutters for the Philippine navy and 12 South Korean FA-50 fighter jets for the Philippine air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-maritime-domain-awareness&quot;&gt;Building Maritime Domain Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Philippines, a country with 7,641 islands and a coastline longer than that of the United States, the importance of establishing maritime domain awareness (MDA) has long been a necessity. MDA is defined as “the effective understanding of any activity associated with the maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment.” The Philippine coastal monitoring system was originally based on a human intelligence network, which lacked the means to verify, confirm, or establish patterns of reported sightings and prevented timely and effective monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, at the end of the Arroyo administration, Republic Act No. 9993 was passed, separating the coast guard from the navy. In September 2011, a little more than a year after taking office, the Aquino administration organized the National Coast Watch System by Executive Order No. 57. The objectives of these two movements were to enhance maritime situational awareness from Philippine territorial waters, including the South China Sea, to its exclusive economic zone. The Aquino administration decided that the mainstay of the National Coast Watch System would be the coast guard and established the headquarters of the National Coastal Watch Center in the coast guard headquarters compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebuilding-air-defense-posture&quot;&gt;Rebuilding Air Defense Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine air force retired all of its mainstay F-5 fighter jets in 2005. From then until the arrival of the first FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea in 2015, the Philippines did not operate fighter jets, and the Aquino administration had to rebuild its air defense posture from scratch. In addition, based on available public information, the radar coverage of the air force at the time was probably limited. For this reason, the Philippines had to urgently introduce fighter jets and air surveillance radar systems to reestablish the Philippines’ air defense posture. In 2014, following the modernization act passed at the end of 2012, the Philippine air force developed a long-term blueprint for rebuilding the Philippines’ air defense posture, known as “Flight Plan 2028.” In the same year, a contract was signed with South Korea for the introduction of FA-50 fighter jets, with flight training conducted in parallel in South Korea. In addition, the government decided at the end of 2014 to introduce three sets of air surveillance radar systems from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-cooperation-with-other-countries&quot;&gt;Seeking Cooperation with Other Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the formulation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act at the end of 2012, budgetary constraints and a lack of human resources to operate the equipment limited the Philippines’ efforts to develop the naval and air force capabilities necessary for territorial defense. Therefore, it was natural for the Philippines to compensate for those limitations by seeking defense cooperation with the United States, its ally, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the security relationship between the Philippines and the United States after the Cold War was not stable. In September 1991, the Philippine Senate refused to renew the Philippines-U.S. Military Base Agreement, the legal basis for stationing U.S. troops in the Philippines, which resulted in the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country and the loss of the U.S. military presence in the region. But the Chinese occupation of Mischief Reef in 1994 caused the Philippines to reaffirm the importance of the U.S. presence, leading to the signing of the Visiting Forces Agreement in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2000, security cooperation between the United States and the Philippines began in earnest as part of the war on terrorism, especially operations against the Abu Sayyaf. Unlike groups such as the MILF, which aimed to gain independence from the government, Abu Sayyaf was increasingly associated with al Qaeda, which was committed to global jihad, and Jemaah Islamiyah, which aimed to create an Islamic state in Southeast Asia. In January 2002, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines, and until the end of the operation in 2014, an average of 500 to 600 U.S. special forces personnel were stationed in the Philippines annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in U.S. diplomacy in the early 2010s were also a factor that allowed the Aquino administration to deepen security cooperation with Washington. In 2011, the Obama administration announced a “rebalancing policy” to allocate more military and economic resources to the Asia-Pacific region. In response, the Aquino administration deepened security cooperation with the United States. Then, in 2014, the two countries signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which institutionalized the bilateral alliance by allowing the United States to rotate troops into the Philippines for extended periods of time and to build and operate both U.S. and Philippine military facilities at bases in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aquino administration also deepened security ties with Australia. The two countries had already signed a Status of Forces Agreement in 2007 similar to the Visiting Forces Agreement signed by the United States and the Philippines. The agreement allowed Australian troops to stay in the Philippines, guaranteed their legal status, and facilitated joint Australia-Philippines counterinsurgency training. But the Philippine Senate did not ratify the agreement until 2012, likely in response to China’s increased assertiveness. In 2013, the Australian government’s White Paper on Defence devoted an entire chapter to international defense engagement and proposed greater involvement in Southeast Asia. As a result, security cooperation between Australia and the Philippines has deepened partly because of Australia’s proactive stance on regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-policy-of-the-duterte-administration-20162022&quot;&gt;Security Policy of the Duterte Administration: 2016–2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated as the 16th president of the Philippines in June 2016 and had gained popularity during the campaign for his blunt statements on policy matters. His approach to foreign policy upon taking office also attracted attention. Duterte announced that he would take a tough stance on drug eradication, stating in his policy speech, “We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or been put behind bars. Or below the ground if they so wish.” He did not get along well with the United States after President Obama called for an end to human rights abuses related to the drug war. Duterte distanced himself from the United States and also played down a ruling by an international tribunal that dismissed China’s claims to much of the South China Sea, a case which had been brought to the Permanent Court of International Justice by the Aquino administration. And Duterte asked former president Fidel V. Ramos to make an unofficial visit to China to start informal bilateral talks, in stark contrast to Aquino’s firm stance against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the election period in April 2016, Duterte criticized Aquino’s acquisition of FA-50 fighter jets as a waste of money because they were inadequate to deter China, could not be used to fight insurgents, and could at best only be used for ceremonial flights. This appeared to place the Philippine military’s modernization program in jeopardy. However, a close look at security policy up to the end of 2021 shows no evidence that the Duterte administration significantly altered Aquino-era policies. Rather, there appears to have been a certain degree of continuity under the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act. From this perspective, the security policy of the Duterte administration will be reviewed in four areas: (1) continuing implementation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act; (2) enhancing maritime situational awareness; (3) enhancing air defense posture; and (4) deepening security cooperation with countries other than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continuing-implementation-of-the-revised-national-armed-forces-modernization-act&quot;&gt;Continuing Implementation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was initially believed that President Duterte’s security policy would prioritize domestic security to strengthen counterterrorism capabilities. Lieutenant General Ricardo Visaya, incoming chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), confirmed, “Duterte wants night fighting capabilities, so we will prioritize this.” However, immediately after Duterte’s inauguration, Defense Minister Delfin Lorenzana declared, “Territorial defense is one of the priorities of the Duterte administration. It is very important as we need to protect our territories against encroachment by other parties.” He also noted that the 15-year modernization program of the AFP would continue as scheduled, a sign that the Duterte administration would not abandon the modernization plan enacted by the previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine National Defense Strategy published in November 2018 clarified that the Department of National Defense would sustain its effort to improve territorial defense capabilities through continued implementation of the AFP Capability Upgrade Program and the AFP Modernization Program. It is evident that the security policy of the Duterte administration, which in the early years of the administration was thought to be focused on fighting insurgents, did not did not deviate much from that of the Aquino administration and ensured a certain degree of continuity and consistency thanks to the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act. Toward the end of his administration, Duterte strongly promoted the modernization of the AFP, so much so that an active-duty general assessed that “the AFP has always been grateful for the direction and support of the Commander-in-Chief [President Duterte] in continuously improving its capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-maritime-domain-awareness&quot;&gt;Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the Philippine government discovered a Chinese “fishing fleet” consisting of 220 vessels around Julian Felipe Reef in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. Defense Minister Lorenzana said, “We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory.” Further calls for action ensued on social media, with Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin protesting on Twitter. Images released by the Philippine coast guard (PCG) in April 2021 showed six Chinese-registered vessels around the reef and the PCG patrolling the area by boat. In September 2021, when asked about Julian Felipe Reef, Vice Admiral Leopoldo Laroya, the PCG commander, stated, “At present, we have been maintaining a continuous patrol of the West Philippine Sea. As far as Chinese fishing vessels are concerned, we have been in contact with some of them, and after due warning given to them, they leave the area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to determine whether the Chinese ships that had gathered on the reef were dispersed as a result of the PCG patrols, it is clear that Philippine maritime domain awareness (MDA) capabilities have improved to some extent, as evidenced by the protests of government officials and the PCG response to the incident outlined above. From 2013 to 2017, U.S. defense industry giant Raytheon was responsible for building the coastal surveillance system and designing the Philippines’ National Coastal Surveillance Center, with headquarters in Manila and two branches in Cebu in the central Philippines and on Palawan Island bordering the South China Sea. In addition, in 2016, at the end of the Aquino administration, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, chaired by the president’s national security adviser, was established as an interagency organization between the Office of the President, the Department of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the AFP, and the PCG. The task force remained intact during the Duterte administration and furthered efforts to enhance MDA. Presidents Aquino and Duterte adopted different approaches to China, but that did not affect the activities of the PCG, as shown in Table 1. In particular, the PCG has added 15 patrol boats to its fleet over the 10-year period from 2011 to 2021, including 10 multi-role response vessels from Japan. In addition, since 2017, the country has conducted trilateral patrols in the Sulu and Celebes Seas with Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1DV8kNQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: PCG Personnel and Equipment from Aquino to Duterte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Philippines announced its intention to introduce supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles from India to improve naval defense in the South China Sea. “As head of procuring entity (HOPE), I recently signed the Notice of Award for the Philippine Navy Shore-Based Anti-Ship Missile Acquisition Project,” Defense Secretary Lorenzana wrote in a Facebook post. Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, praised this decision as the “most strategic purchase the AFP has made in years.” On the other hand, a weakness is the lack of the “kill chain” between sensors and shooters for targeting moving maritime targets, which is required for robust technical and procedural capability. However, through training and expected future cooperation with partner countries, the AFP will strengthen its deterrent capabilities over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-air-defense-posture&quot;&gt;Enhancing Air Defense Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021, two FA-50PH fighter jets of the Philippine air force scrambled against an unidentified aircraft that had violated its airspace. In military aviation parlance, “scramble” refers to the immediate deployment of fighter aircraft to intercept an unknown or hostile aircraft. “The Philippine Air Defense Control Center (PADCC), through its radars, detected an unidentified inbound aircraft in the Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone (PADIZ), approximately 120 nautical miles northwest of Bolinao, Pangasinan,” Philippine air force (PAF) spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Maynard Mariano said in a statement. “In the past decades, aircraft flying without clearance would willfully violate the Philippine airspace knowing that they will not be challenged. Today, our airspace is being closely monitored jointly by the PAF and the CAAP [Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines],” he said. However, since there are no reports of similar scrambles since that incident, it is difficult to assess the air defense posture of the Philippines. But since the first 2 of the 12 FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea were acquired in 2015, this capability has steadily strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the construction of the MDA progressed under the Duterte administration, the restructuring of the air defense posture, which was initially feared because of Duterte’s statement that “fighter jets are a waste of money,” also advanced without major impediments. The acquisition plan for Israeli-made air defense radars established under the Aquino administration appears to have been executed, with radars installed in the Gozar Air Station near Mindoro Island, the Paredes Air Station located in the northern part of Luzon, and Mt. Salakot located in Palawan. In addition, a Japanese radar manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric will be installed in the near future, although the timing is unknown, and steady progress is being made in building a Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deepening-security-cooperation-with-countries-other-than-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Deepening Security Cooperation with Countries other than the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2018 Philippine National Defense Strategy defines the United States as “the only treaty ally of the Philippines,” bilateral security cooperation did not progress under the Duterte administration and arguably regressed compared to the Aquino administration. During his first visit to China, Duterte said, “I announce my separation from the United States,” and his foreign policy was dubbed “Duterte’s Dalliance with China.” Duterte’s approach did not change after the transition to the Trump administration in the United States. Although Duterte expressed thanks to Trump for the support of U.S. special forces during the battle for Marawi against Islamic State militants in 2017, the regular U.S.-Philippines military exercise known as Balikatan was scaled back to about 5,500 participants from more than 10,000 the previous year, and the emphasis of the exercise was shifted from military training to disaster response. Duterte’s decision to renounce the Visiting Forces Agreement also weakened momentum for bilateral security cooperation, and Japan and Australia tried to fill the void during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While relations with the United States soured under the Duterte administration, the security partnership between the Philippines and Australia deepened through counterterrorism operations and joint exercises under Balikatan. During the Marawi City siege in 2017, Australia sent Orion aircraft to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and sent military personnel to advise and support counterinsurgency operations. In addition, in October 2017, after the operation, the Philippines and Australia signed a security agreement on capacity building and counterterrorism. This enabled the Philippine navy to conduct capacity-building activities through Royal Australian Navy port visits. When Australian naval vessels visited the Philippines in November 2017, the two navies conducted a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise in Subic Bay for demonstration purposes while President Duterte was onboard the Australian vessel HMAS Adelaide, and he expressed his appreciation for their cooperation against terrorism. Describing why security cooperation between the Philippines and Australia deepened during this period, Professor Renato Cruz De Castro of De La Salle University said it was “the best way for the Philippines to avoid succumbing headlong to China’s interests.” De Castro has further argued that the two middle powers of Japan and Australia played an important role in the modernization of the Philippine military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines was not prepared to adequately defend against external threats when China began to pursue maritime expansion in the 2010s. Both Aquino and Duterte emphasized the need for infrastructure development in the Philippines while recognizing budgetary constraints regarding the acquisition, maintenance, and improvement of defense equipment. As the Philippines continues to develop its maritime security and air power capabilities, it will need not only hardware in the form of defense equipment but also education, training, and communication networks that are critical to the success of any military modernization project. Japan has actively supported the Philippines by promoting defense exchanges and capacity building, but in order to take the Japan-Philippines security relationship to the next level, it will be necessary to conclude agreements that facilitate information sharing and joint training. Japan can also play an important role in encouraging security cooperation between the Philippines and the United States while sustaining its own efforts to enhance the capacity of the Philippine air force to strengthen preparedness and deterrence in an increasingly complex regional security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the security partnership between Japan and the Philippines could be strengthened through several actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Hold regular foreign and defense ministerial meetings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, the first foreign and defense ministerial meeting (2+2) between Japan and the Philippines was held. The joint statement issued by the two countries declares that they will consider concluding a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) for facilitating reciprocal visits and an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) for exchanging goods and services. The two governments also agreed to meet on a regular basis to align their strategic perspectives on developments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convening the 2+2 regularly is essential for the development of a strong bilateral security relationship and networking with other countries in the region. Australia was the first country other than the United States with which Japan established a 2+2 framework, and the number of such engagements with other countries has grown, as shown in Table 2. While Japan does not necessarily maintain strong security relationships with all the countries it has engaged under the 2+2 framework, regular meetings are a prerequisite for building strong security partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r9DpD8B.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Japan’s 2+2 Meetings (Excluding the United States)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the U.S.-Japan 2+2 shows that since the first meeting in September 1960, it has functioned as an important consultative body to consider a variety of issues related to consultations under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and bilateral cooperation in the security field. Just as former U.S. secretary of state James Baker proposed in 1990 to upgrade the U.S.-Japan 2+2 to its current ministerial level, it is a natural step to encourage consultations between Japan and the Philippines above the vice-ministerial-level meetings between the foreign and defense authorities of Japan and the Philippines that have already taken place nine times. The Japan-Australia security relationship has developed remarkably in recent years, with the signing of a Japan-Australia RAA in January 2022 to facilitate joint training and the Australian Department of Defence announcing in April 2022 that an Australian KC-30A aerial refueling aircraft had successfully tested aerial refueling on a Japanese F-2 fighter jet. Additionally, both countries coordinate closely with the United States under the Trilateral Security Dialogue. The three countries should coordinate their respective approaches to defense cooperation with the Philippines and make effective use of each country’s limited resources to enhance the role of the Philippines as a regional defense partner. Japan reflects the outcome of those discussions in the agenda for the Japan-Philippines 2+2 to establish and implement common strategic objectives for defense cooperation in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Establish a formal agreement or de facto framework for information sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Philippines should conclude an information security agreement or an equivalent de facto framework for information sharing to enhance their capacity to jointly assess regional security dynamics. Such an agreement is the foundation (“infrastructure”) of security cooperation and is essential if Japan-Philippines defense cooperation is to deepen in the future. Such an agreement would also enable the two countries to share information on defense equipment and military operations and would facilitate defense equipment exports and joint training. Since Japan first signed a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the United States in 2007, it has added eight other GSOMIA partners in the following order: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), France, Australia, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, South Korea, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, the Sankei Shimbun reported that the government of Japan was considering sharing information with the Philippines on air defense radar exports. According to the article, several Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officials stated that “information on the Bashi Strait is becoming indispensable for Japan’s defense.” Since 2016, China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force has conspicuously dispatched aircraft to the Pacific Ocean through the Miyako Strait between Miyako Island and Okinawa as well as the Bashi Strait between Luzon Island in the Philippines and Taiwan. Experts have suggested that if Japan and the Philippines can share information on the locations of Chinese military aircraft, it will be possible to facilitate countermeasures against China’s attempts to project air power beyond the First Island Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sharing sensitive information, it is essential to introduce strict penalties in case of leakage. The government of Japan enacted the Specially Designated Secrets Act in December 2013 and will have to initiate in-depth discussions with the Philippines on how the country can introduce similar measures. If that process takes time, both governments should consider establishing a de facto information-sharing framework, to the extent possible under domestic laws, until the agreement is concluded and aim to effectively enhance the situational awareness capacity of the Philippines as soon as possible. Although the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness is a multilateral initiative, it is a good example of a de facto framework because it allows unclassified information sharing by using existing technologies and institutions without concluding a de jure specific security protection agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the mere existence of such agreements does not automatically facilitate bilateral security cooperation. For example, the Moon Jae-in administration of South Korea announced in 2019 its intention to abrogate the GSOMIA with Japan, but under pressure from the United States, the notification was suspended just before it expired. The Moon administration took the position that the GSOMIA could be abrogated at any time, depending on South Korea’s decision. However, NBC News points out that during the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States provided Ukraine with real-time intelligence such as geospatial data, intercepted communications, and targeting information. Establishing such a framework for sharing classified information in peacetime rather than in wartime will greatly improve regional deterrence and capabilities to cope with urgent situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Conclude a Reciprocal Access Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutional arrangements such as the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) Japan recently concluded with Australia are needed to facilitate joint training and exercises between the JSDF and Philippine armed forces (AFP). In June 2015, President Aquino expressed interest in signing a similar Visiting Forces Agreement with Japan and suggested that both governments recognize the need for such a framework. Professor Ken Jimbo of Keio University said, “The role of the SDF under the Indo-Pacific Initiative should be expanded,” and “to this end, it is necessary to conclude the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with India, the Philippines, and Singapore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has a Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States and a Status of Forces Agreement with Australia. The April 2022 Japan-Philippines 2+2 joint statement noted that Japan and the Philippines should start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . to consider frameworks to facilitate reciprocal visits as well as reciprocal provision of supplies and services in order to further enhance and facilitate cooperation such as exercises between Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Going forward, the Japanese side will proceed with deliberations, including on the possibilities of concluding a reciprocal access agreement and an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the government of Japan is initiating or considering negotiations with the United Kingdom and France regarding RAAs, similar to its agreements with Australia, in order to maintain peace and stability in the region. However, it took about seven and a half years to conclude the Japan-Australia RAA due to concerns such as Japan’s use of the death penalty. Therefore, it may be difficult for a Japan-Philippines RAA to be signed soon, but such a de jure framework will be necessary to make training and exercises between the Philippines and Japan smoother, which will deepen the Japan-Philippines security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Promote further transfer of defense equipment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should promote more exports of defense equipment to improve interoperability between the JSDF and AFP. As noted above, radars made by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation will be transferred from Japan to the Philippines. Since the easing of Japan’s Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment in 2014, Japan tried to secure agreements to export submarines to Australia and surveillance radars to Thailand but failed in both cases. However, there have already been several successful cases between Japan and the Philippines, such as the provision of TC-90s and UH-1 parts. There are also reports that the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is considering human resource development projects with the Philippines connected to radar exports. Packaging defense equipment exports with training initiatives would serve as a foundation for deepening Japan-Philippines defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Medium Term Defense Program states: “The government as a whole will promote the appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.” Based on Japan’s policy, Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) launched a feasibility study for the overseas transfer of defense equipment in April 2020 as a “new initiative for promoting equipment transfer” (Figure 3). In this new initiative, a contract is signed with a trading company at the start of the survey, the public and private sectors collaborate in the process of narrowing down the scope of equipment to be covered, and the project concept is eventually materialized through discussions between the public and private sectors. Initially, surveys will be conducted in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and it is hoped that these efforts will be carried out in the Philippines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rui Matsukawa, a member of Upper House of the Diet representing the Liberal Democratic Party, expressed her concern that the private sector in Japan is assuming all the risks involved in defense equipment contracts and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will actively promote the overseas transfer of defense equipment as a defense policy. To this end, the government of Japan should take responsibility for establishing an adequate system centered on Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency. In addition, it is important to appropriately ease the strict application of the three principles of defense equipment transfer to the corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further insists that this point should be included in the National Security Strategy and other related documents to be revised later this year. She also suggests that “businesspeople working for trading companies should be hired as defense attachés in charge of equipment transfer for a limited period of time, and they should work in Japanese embassies in countries where there are likely to be prospects for development.” Overlapping with ATLA’s efforts, if the Japanese embassies in the Philippines, in addition to the above four countries, were to appoint such personnel, it could be a breakthrough in promoting the transfer of defense equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/svDzUGK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Image Feasibility Study Launched by ATLA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Implement more proactive and strategic overseas development assistance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should utilize overseas development assistance (ODA) proactively and strategically to reduce the budgetary burden of defense purchases on the Philippines. Under the “Non-Project Grant Aid for Provision of Japanese Disaster Reduction Equipment” agreement signed in March 2015, Japan provided the “Life-Saving System” in October 2021 to the AFP, which includes the JSDF’s electro-hydraulic equipment, cutters, spreaders, electric pumps, acoustic probes, lighting equipment with generators, boats for use in situations such as tsunamis and guerrilla rains, life jackets, life-saving belts, and other equipment and materials necessary for saving lives during disasters. In November 2021, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force conducted a briefing for the AFP on the handling of life-saving equipment to efficiently utilize the equipment during disaster response. Japan’s 2020 White Paper on Development Cooperation states that Japan will continue to leverage its various forms of support, including ODA, in its efforts to realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. The white paper also outlines a policy of working with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the European Union to help developing countries in various fields such as maritime safety and disaster management, in which ODA is playing an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Prime Minister Abe said that Japan would combine various options to support developing countries in the region, including strategic use of ODA (e.g., provision of patrol vessels, dispatch of experts), support for capacity building by the JSDF, and defense equipment and technology cooperation. In 2015, the government of Japan revised the ODA Charter and established the Development Cooperation Charter, which clearly states the philosophy that ODA can be used to support the military forces of other countries for “non-military purposes such as public welfare or disaster-relief purposes” and that “such cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis in light of their substantive relevance.” The capacity-building projects by the JSDF cover 15 countries mainly in Southeast Asia and are conducted annually for the AFP in a wide range of areas, as shown below in Table 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/saMU8Pa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Japanese Capacity-Building Assistance to the Philippines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as mentioned above, opportunities for defense equipment transfers between Japan and the Philippines are gradually increasing. Furthermore, if goods are provided to the Philippines through ODA, education to become proficient in operations and maintenance will prove essential to help the Philippines improve its capabilities. One of the greatest advantages of ODA is that, in the case of grants, funds can be given without any obligation to repay. Even in the case of ODA loans, the repayment period is long and interest rates are as close to interest-free as possible. Through such schemes, development cooperation for non-military purposes such as public welfare and disaster relief can be actively pursued, saving the limited budget of the Philippine government while contributing to improving the humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime security capabilities of the AFP and Philippine coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidential election in the Philippines. Like his recent predecessors, Marcos will need to define the relationship with the United States, a treaty ally, and develop a strategy to manage China, which continues to challenge the status quo in the maritime domain. According to a survey of ASEAN countries published by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore in February 2022, 83.5 percent of Filipino respondents answered that they would choose the United States if the Philippines were forced to align with either the United States or China. This suggests an interest in furthering alliance ties with Washington, but in reality, for the Philippines and other countries in the region, this involves the maintenance of a delicate balancing act between the two great powers. It is also possible that Marcos could pursue outreach with China just as Duterte did at the onset of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States have introduced strategies to maintain regional stability and prosperity by realizing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, and enhancing cooperation with Southeast Asian partners such as the Philippines is critically important to those efforts. Japan has a long history of engagement with the Philippines rooted in economic cooperation, but gradually expanding to include defense cooperation and capacity building is critical to managing an increasingly complex regional security environment marked by increased Chinese assertiveness in the maritime domain. Japan should further develop its security partnership with the Philippines to reflect its geopolitical importance and address its security vulnerabilities in coordination with the United States and other regional partners. Experts in Japan and the United States have addressed the importance of engagement with the Philippines in geostrategic terms but with less consideration of what exactly should be done. This paper details ways to sustain momentum for bilateral security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines as a step toward multilateral security cooperation with the United States or Australia in the future. There should be no doubt that strengthening security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, a process over 10 years in the making, will enhance deterrence in the region and contribute to the future development and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

Planners for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started to talk about integrating digital technologies and to debate strategy, tactics, and operations in ways that drew on lessons from the Gulf War. PLA learning, debate, assimilation, and adaptation has continued over these subsequent decades — up to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Talk to us a little bit about how we should think about the role of learning in the Chinese armed forces. How important are foreign military engagements, doctrines, conflicts for them?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA are careful and meticulous students of modern warfare, particularly the U.S. way of war. They are voracious consumers of publicly available information, as well as all of the information that their very aggressive intelligence efforts provide them. When I was the defense attaché at [Pacific Command] and in the Office of [the] Secretary of Defense, I used to say, “If it’s online, they’ve read it.” And I remember being in meetings where they would quote word for word any doctrine that we had posted online, or revisions to our doctrine, as well as the performance capabilities of U.S. weapon systems. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite recent organizational reform efforts, the PLA remains essentially a political entity with a war-fighting mission. It is a party army, not a national army. And its approach to learning and leadership is heavily influenced by its own organization, as well as traditional Chinese culture and education. For example, one of the principal elements of the initial Russian military failures in Ukraine is a function of command and control, poor leadership development, internal corruption, inadequate training, and poor troop motivations. In the PLA system, development of these key capabilities is a Communist Party — not a strictly military — responsibility. And [Chinese President] Xi Jinping himself has acknowledged this. So the question becomes, and this is a historical issue with the PLA, how will the party address these military shortcomings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is a Leninist system. Decisionmaking is centralized, but there is debate in the system. And historically within the PLA, there’s been debate in which some views prevail, and some views end up getting eclipsed, sometimes for political reasons, sometimes for operational reasons. . . . Are there views in the PLA that have basically become obsolete in the last five to ten years because of things that they have observed in foreign military situations?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; There are two things that have fundamentally changed over the past forty years. The first of those is this concept among the PLA leadership that they had the advantage of defense in depth, and as a result, they didn’t necessarily need to develop even a limited power projection capability. I can remember years ago PLA generals telling me, “Well, if you attack Tianjin, we’ll fall back to Beijing. And if you attack Beijing, we’ll fall back to Chengdu.” And I remember thinking, “Why in the world would we do that?” That’s fundamentally changed. We see their defense modernization focused on giving them the ability to have a limited power projection capability, if only for anti-access area denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second [fundamental change] is the concept that they have an overwhelming advantage in mass. But qualitative quantity has an even higher quality all its own. So there’s been an abandonment of this perception that [the PLA] have this overwhelming advantage in mass that’s sufficient to deter an enemy from attacking, and more of an emphasis on reducing the size of the PLA ground forces and increasing the quality of the strategic rocket forces and the support forces in the Navy, in an effort to ensure that their quality matches the qualitative advantage that the United States has always enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Russian President] Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24. China, as we all know, has spent a couple of decades thinking about ways to coerce Taiwan. What’s happened since the 24th that might be relevant to Taiwan?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; I think at the very strategic military level, one of the most fundamental tenets of PLA modernization has actually been validated by the Ukraine conflict, but it’s also paradoxical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of warfare never changes — the applications and violence to achieve a political end — but the character of warfare is constantly evolving. And that’s what we’re seeing now: an evolution of the character of warfare toward the defense, as opposed to the offense. The defense or the defending nation has an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia clearly possessed an overwhelming advantage in combat power and just sheer throw weight when compared to Ukraine. But despite this, Ukraine has been able to offset this advantage by a skillful application of asymmetric military capabilities that have been supplied by its allies and partners. Now, what we need to understand is the PLA has always perceived themselves to be the defender and the United States to be the aggressor. We tend to look at it [through] the Taiwan element of it — as China being the aggressor and us being the defender — but that’s not how they see it. And indeed, their entire defense modernization emphasis . . . has been specifically focused on denying the United States the ability to project power into the Western Pacific and to prevent [it] from building “mountains of iron.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go to war anywhere in the world, we build a mountain of iron — in Kuwait, in Iraq, and in other places. And then we unleash this mountain of iron on whoever our foe is far from our shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox here is that while the United States is clearly the aggressor and attacker, within this paradigm, Taiwan is clearly the defender. And the Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that a well-supplied, well-motivated defender can effectively disrupt or even defeat a clearly superior adversary. If nothing else, this defender can significantly increase the cost and length and duration of a military conflict to the detriment of the attacker. So, when you look at the overall lesson here, it’s the fact that this is far more complex than they might have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is there anything [the PLA has] done that they should feel better about as a result of what’s happened to the Russians in Ukraine?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me talk first about noncommissioned officer [NCO] corps — the issue of cultural evolution of a military force. Because what a lot of people don’t understand about leadership, battle command, and NCO corps is that the essence of the strength of these capabilities is cultural, not technical. It is the willingness of the senior officer to delegate authority and to accept the counsel of a subordinate in their command over their own judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as a general, I had a sergeant major. If I propose to do something and he says, “Sir, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” I have two choices. I can get angry about it or feel as if I’ve lost face, or I can modify my plans based upon the wise counsel that he’s given. In the U.S. system, I gain in stature with my forces by doing that. In some other cultures, that would produce a loss of face and a challenge to authority that could not be countenanced. That’s why you can form an NCO corps, but it may not be as effective in a Russian or a Chinese cultural context as it is in the U.S. context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing I’d raise is this issue of battle command. Russian officers keep getting killed because they don’t trust their junior subordinates to give them an accurate picture of the battlefield. They’re being hounded by Moscow to [share] what’s going on, and they only trust their own judgment. The success of [breaking up larger formations into smaller ones] is predicated on active, adaptive combat leaders who are willing to use their own initiative during the rapid evolution of combat operations. To illustrate that, we have a saying in the U.S. military that fundamentally describes the cultural difference between the Chinese and Russian militaries and the U.S. military. And every military officer learns it from the very beginning of his training: It’s easier to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[U.S. military officers] learn to use and trust their own judgment in a rapidly evolving combat situation and explain their actions later on. And they anticipate that their leadership will support their actions, particularly if there’s a favorable outcome. And these types of cultural tenets are not necessarily common to either Russian military culture or Chinese culture. Those types of capabilities are absolutely essential to the success in information warfare– and hybrid warfare–based environments. And as we see in the Russian military, they simply don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are two questions from audience members that get at that question of false conclusions and false analogies: What are the risks attached to over-comparing Ukraine to Taiwan? Given that the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA have their own perspectives, what are the wrong or inaccurate lessons they may be drawing from the Ukraine conflict?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; Two quick points. Number one: I think one of the flawed analogies here is if we do all of the things that the Russians didn’t do, we will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is something that I’ve not seen a lot of people talk about: the complete failure of strategic deterrent signaling and the reading of deterrence signaling on the part of both Russia and the United States as a prelude to the Ukrainian conflict. I was rereading John Toland’s The Rising Sun about the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire, and I was struck by the failure of strategic deterrence signaling between the United States and Japan before Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw a similar failure of strategic deterrent signaling between the United States and Russia and between NATO and Russia. Prior to the Ukrainian conflict, both sides seemed to misread signals. And I think that there should be some study given to the strategic signaling that could take place prior to Chinese military operations against Taiwan or against the United States, so that we have a much clearer understanding of what they are saying, which might both precede the conflict and hopefully help to avoid the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Does that mean we’re headed for trouble?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s exactly what I mean by a failure of deterrent communication. We are talking past each other. We’re not really listening to each other, and we’re not considering the messages that are being sent in the context of our opposite number, as opposed to our own context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[What are your] headline takeaways from what you’ve observed since February?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; There are no regional conflicts in the twenty-first century involving great powers. The Ukraine-Russia conflict has caused food shortages in Tunisia and vegetable oil shortages in Indonesia, and rising oil prices. If we think the global implications of a Russia-Ukraine conflict are significant, wait until you see the global implications of a China-U.S. conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In your view, what are the main policy continuities from the last administration? What do you think are the strengths of Biden’s China policy and Asia policy, and where do you think the administration needs to step up its game?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; We can start with comparisons between this administration and the last administration. I think the [current] administration gets a bad rap as “Trump lite.” I just think that is an unfair criticism because, sure there are similarities and differences, but the differences, to me, are big, important, sort of chunky differences between the Biden approach and the Trump approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it is important to remember that Biden, from day one, basically said that they are not interested in changing China. So they took regime-change off the table, which is something the Trump administration very specifically embraced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number two, the Trump administration wasn’t really interested in working with allies and partners. That literally is the centerpiece of what Biden is doing in terms of his China strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number three, the Trump team, through their tariffs and other economic measures, was pretty committed to a very robust economic decoupling. That’s not where the Biden administration is. I think the Biden administration realizes there needs to be a judicious and smart approach to economic interdependence to reduce those areas of national security risk and vulnerability, but that trade and investment serves the interests of American businesses, workers, and consumers. The Trump administration didn’t really believe in dialogue. They said dialogue was just a waste of time, and they didn’t really believe in cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Only in the trade space, the negotiations on trade, that was the only dialogue the Trump administration had up and running.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s right. And I think the Biden team has shown they’re pretty different. They believe in high-level dialogue. My favorite fun fact of the day is that the administration has been in place for sixteen months, and Biden and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] have now talked with each other four times. So that’s basically a high-level meeting every four months. That’s pretty good. Of course, [National Security Adviser] Jake Sullivan met with [China’s senior diplomat] Yang Jiechi in Luxemburg just this week. So clearly, they believe in high-level dialogue, and they’re doing good things with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jake Sullivan met with Yang Jiechi in Rome, and then three days later, President Biden met with President Xi. These high-level dialogues helped the administration succeed in effectively putting a cap on the Russia-China relationship: no military cooperation and sanctions compliance. That is a really serious piece of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they believe in dialogue, they have demonstrated they can achieve strategic results with that dialogue. The other piece is: they don’t like to talk about this dialogue and the successes from it. They should talk more about it. There is actually limited and episodic cooperation: students are flowing back and forth, the administration last year used very high-level diplomacy to get the Chinese to participate in a coordinated release of the strategic petroleum reserve, the Chinese are still playing ball with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] on Iran. I don’t want to overdo the cooperation point, because the Chinese are not really in the mood to cooperate, but the Biden administration basically said, “Theoretically, when it’s in our interest, we are ready to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I give [Secretary of State] Tony Blinken very substantial credit for laying out four baskets in his speech where he could cooperate. And look, those are all politically sensitive issues where he is subject to vulnerability. But my broader point is, where there are differences between Biden and Trump, there are pretty fundamental, chunky, important differences. That’s why I think Biden’s policy is not Trump lite — it’s Biden plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given China’s latest declarations and pronouncements regarding territorial waters and military activities outside of Chinese territory and recent actions to intercept Australian aviation activity, is it not inevitable that some form of military conflict will occur between the United States and China?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; I am very concerned about the Taiwan issue. I see a lot of loose talk, including on the U.S. side. I think the United States needs to say less and do more, with a greater focus on deterrence and less commentary and discussion about actual U.S. policy, which is muddying the waters. I see hardening positions on all sides, especially in mainland China. I see growing military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re about to enter into a transition period as Taiwan prepares for its January 2024 election. . . . I worry less about the outbreak of armed conflict — an actual amphibious assault on the part of the People’s Republic of China. What I worry about is a convergence of trends that could precipitate a fourth Taiwan Strait crisis. I am concerned that if Beijing becomes sufficiently frustrated [or] anxious that it [will] decide to throw the equivalent of a strategic brushback pitch against Taiwan. It could do something that tries to convince Taiwan and the United States to stop changing the status quo according to Beijing. We could be on a dangerous trajectory because of growing anxieties, concerns, [and] changes in intentions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement a few weeks ago that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was going to travel to Taiwan created a lot of concern. If that trip had gone forward, it could have been very destabilizing. We need to be aware of actions like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There’s a lot of interest in Biden’s statements on Taiwan. Three times, in response to questions, he said the United States would get involved militarily to defend Taiwan. The White House then has to roll that back and say that U.S. policy has not changed. Politicians on both sides of the aisle are coming out saying that this is a great development because we need strategic clarity. We need Beijing to know what we will do should something happen. In your view, would a less ambiguous Taiwan policy exacerbate tensions?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; We are where we are today [because] the president of the United States has made these statements three or four times, depending on how you count. And I think that’s created an environment of some confusion about the nature of U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to tread really, really carefully. Doing things like monkeying around with the components of our One China policy on the State Department website creates all sorts of confusion, increases anxieties, and makes it harder to deter mainland China. The focus needs to be on deterring Beijing. It is going to be really hard to deter mainland China if they think we’re trying to move from a One China policy to a One China, One Taiwan policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People forget that our One China policy has many components to it. A big one is the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) . . . . The preamble of the TRA says very clearly that an action to try to coerce Taiwan militarily will be seen as a grave threat to peace and stability in the western Pacific. That’s pretty explicit. We should just use that language in the TRA and remind Chinese officials about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting for some volunteer battalions began in June but has intensified in July, with new volunteer units being reported daily. The battalions apparently will consist of roughly 400 men each aged between 18 and 60. They will belong to various branches of service including motorized rifle, tank, and naval infantry, but also signals and logistics. Recruits are not required to have prior military service and will undergo only 30 days of training before deployment to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This recruitment effort will likely be expensive if it comes close to meeting its targets.&lt;/strong&gt; It appears that the Russian Ministry of Defense will pay the volunteers’ salaries while the “federal subjects” will pay their enlistment bonuses. Salaries generally start at roughly $3,000 per month per soldier or about $1.2 million per month per 400-man unit. Enlistment bonuses offered by at least some units appear to be roughly a month’s salary. If the effort generates 85 battalions each of 400 men it would bring an additional 34,000 volunteers into the fight at the cost of about $102 million per month in salary alone. Considering that the 30 days of training the volunteers will receive before entering combat will not produce combat-ready soldiers, that price is very high. The volunteers will receive veteran status and benefits if they serve in Ukraine, moreover, in addition to their salaries and bonuses, a commitment that will add to the Russian Federation budget for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This drive will likely produce “soldiers” of lower quality than the normal conscripts in the Russian army at close to professional-soldier prices.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a remarkable expedient that suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compel his people to fight and unable to attract them to fight voluntarily without considerable incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;primorsky-krai&quot;&gt;Primorsky Krai&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Tigr” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (Naval Infantry, part of 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade): Russian outlets reported that “Tigr” is recruiting volunteers with or without military experience ages 18 to 60, on July 9, but it is unclear when the recruitment drive begun in Primorsky Krai. The governor of Primorsky Krai reported that the battalion is enrolling only residents of the krai and has the highest number of registered volunteers of any federal subject in Russia. “Tigr“ will undergo a 30-day, two-stage training period with officers of the 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade at the Bamburovo and Gornostay Training Grounds and will replenish the naval infantry brigade. Social media videos show that some servicemen are already exercising at an unspecified training ground, but it is unclear if ”Tigr” has formally deployed for its 30-day training period. Distinguished servicemen in the unit will receive a 50,000-ruble bonus ($860) after two weeks of training, and all servicemen will receive a 150,000-ruble payment ($2,575) after completing the training. Funds will be drawn from the Primorsky Krai budget. “Tigr” servicemen will receive a monthly salary of 200,000 rubles ($3,430) and veteran status. Social media users noted that footage of the “Tigr” battalion shows that the recruits are older than traditional military age and are likely in their 50s to 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kursk-oblast&quot;&gt;Kursk Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Seym” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (logistics): The “Seym” Battalion is a volunteer logistical support battalion that began recruiting volunteers on July 11. The Kursk Oblast Administration announced that the battalion will focus on transporting fuel, food, ammunition, with servicemen up to 60 years of age receiving monthly salaries of 200,000 to 500,000 rubles ($3,430 to $8,580) depending on the time spent at the frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moscow-city&quot;&gt;Moscow City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sobyanskiy Polk” Regiment&lt;/strong&gt;: Moscow officials began recruitment for the newly-established “Sobyanskiy Polk” regiment on July 1 and are offering over 200,000 rubles per month (approximately $3,400) to volunteers drawn from the Moscow City budget. Russian opposition outlet Meduza noted that most of the volunteers came from regions other than Moscow City as of July 13. Meduza stated that former commander of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Militia Roman Vysotsky is one of the recruiters for “Sobyanskiy Polk,” but it is unclear if the regiment will merge with DNR forces. The “Sobyanskiy Polk” volunteers (up to 60 years of age) will undergo training at the Mulino Training Ground in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast before deploying to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-tatarstan&quot;&gt;Republic of Tatarstan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alga” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Republic of Tatarstan created a joint Telegram channel to recruit for the “Alga” and “Timer” Battalions on June 23, but had likely already begun the recruitment drive as the unit reportedly had 300 registered volunteers on June 24. The official recruitment channel claimed that the republic had recruited over 500 volunteers for the “Alga” Battalion on July 1even though the original recruitment target had been 400. The Republic of Tatarstan dispatched the “Alga” volunteer battalion for a month-long training program in Orenburg Oblast on July 8. The battalion will then deploy to Nizhny Novgorod Oblast where they will receive their combat assignments before entering Ukraine. The Republic of Tatarstan will pay servicemen 3,000 rubles (approximately $53) per day in addition to a one-time 260,000 ruble payment (approximately $4,450) for enlisting drawn from the republic’s budget. Republic of Tatarstan also offered an additional 8,000 rubles (approximately $140) per day spent in combat, but it is unclear if the Republic or Russian Defense Ministry will sponsor the payment. The Russian Defense Ministry will reportedly pay servicemen a starting monthly salary of 150,000 rubles (approximately $2,600).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Timer” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Republic of Tatarstan is forming the “Timer” Battalion as of July 1, and 300 to 350 men had already passed the selection process by that date. The battalion will reportedly have over 400 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orenburg&quot;&gt;Orenburg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yaik” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (motorized rifle battalion): Orenburg City officials announced the establishment of the “Yaik” volunteer motorized rifle battalion on July 8. Any Orenburg Oblast men ages 18 to 50 can enlist, and a military commission will certify the health and clean criminal record of volunteers. Servicemen will receive a salary of 200,000 rubles ($3,430) for serving in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nizhny-novgorod-oblast&quot;&gt;Nizhny Novgorod Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Kuzma Minin” Tank Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Nizhny Novgorod Oblast announced the formation of the “Kuzma Minin” Tank Battalion on July 1 via the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Russian Union of Afghan Veterans. The battalion is recruiting men ages 20 to 50 for a six-month contract. Nizhny Novgorod Oblast offers 200,000 ruble ($3,430) one-time payment upon signing the contract and a 220,000 to 350,000 ruble monthly salary ($3,775 to $6,000). Nizhny Novgorod Oblast offers volunteers veteran status, unspecified military training, and a full social package for the serviceman and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;krasnoyarsk-krai&quot;&gt;Krasnoyarsk Krai&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown&lt;/strong&gt; - Ukraine’s Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) obtained a document stating that Krasnoyarsk Krai allocated 120 million rubles (approximately two million dollars) to recruit 400 servicemen from the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-chechnya&quot;&gt;Republic of Chechnya&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Vostok Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced on June 29 that Chechen officials successfully formed the “Vostok Akhmat” Battalion that will shortly move to a permanent base. Kadyrov also reported that the Chechen Republic is building new bases and military facilities for servicemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Zapad Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced on June 26 that Chechen forces formed a West-Akhmat battalion “in the shortest possible” time and claimed that the unit would deploy to a well-equipped base in Chechnya. The unit is subordinate to the Russian Southern Military District. Its commander is Islaim Aguev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yug Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced the formation of “Yug Akhmat” on June 26, but did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sever Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced the formation of “Sever Akhmat” on June 26, but did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-bashkortostan&quot;&gt;Republic of Bashkortostan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Shaimuratov” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Russian organization “Veterans of the Marine Corps and Special Forces of the Navy” announced the creation of the battalion at the end of May and noted that servicemen will receive a month of training in Orenburg Oblast before deploying to Ukraine. Some pro-Kremlin media outlets announced the deployment of a new volunteer battalion from the Republic of Bashkortostan to Donbas on July 6, while some sources claimed that the battalion arrived in Orenburg for training. The battalion had reportedly arrived in Alkino, Republic of Bashkortostan, on July 2. The Republic of Bashkortostan recruitment Telegram channel reported that the ”Shaimuratov” Battalion had registered 250 volunteers as of June 16 and is seeking to recruit a total of 800 volunteers split between two battalions. The Republic of Bashkortostan and the Russian Defense Ministry financially incentivized servicemen by offering 200,000 rubles ($3,430) for signing the military contract and 2,000 rubles ($34) for every day served, but it is unclear whether this payment refers to service in a combat zone. Volunteers will reportedly receive monthly salaries of 220,000 rubles ($3,775).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexander Dostavalov” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: A local Ural region outlet reported that the “Alexander Dostavalov” Battalion is deploying to a place of unit coordination in Ilishevsky District, Republic of Bashkortostan, on July 14. The battalion began recruitment prior to June 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perm-oblast&quot;&gt;Perm Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Parma” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Perm Oblast officials announced a recruitment campaign for the “Parma” battalion on May 25. The recruitment campaign offered volunteers a 300,000-ruble monthly salary ($5,150), federal housing, higher education grants, and social benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Molot” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Perm Oblast officials stated that they are continuing recruitment for the “Molot” Battalion as of July 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chelyabinsk-oblast&quot;&gt;Chelyabinsk Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Uzhnouralets” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast Alexei Teksler announced on July 13 that the region has been forming two battalions as part of the Central Military District: “Uzhnouralets” and “Uzhnyi Ural. The region held a departure ceremony for 82 servicemen of the battalion that deployed to the training ground in Nizhny Norgorod on July 15. First Deputy Regional Minister of Public Security Vladimir Gusak said that ”Uzhnouralets” has in total 263 volunteers, including the recently deployed servicemen. Local news reports said that the youngest serviceman is 21 and the oldest 54.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Uzhnyi Ural” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: First Deputy Regional Minister of Public Security Vladimir Gusak said that “Uzhnyi Ural” had recruited 251 volunteers as of July 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-chuvashia&quot;&gt;Republic of Chuvashia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Atal” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (Signals): Republic of Chuvashia Head Oleg Nikolaev said that the Republic is currently forming the “Atal” Battalion as of July 11. Nikolaev said that volunteers will receive a ”lump-sum cash payment” of 200,000 rubles ($3,775) when enlisting into the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-north-ossetiaalania&quot;&gt;Republic of North Ossetia–Alania&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alania” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Alania Battalion is the first Russian volunteer battalion that ISW observed operating in Ukraine in 2022. Alan Valerievich Mamiev – a Russian combatant who fought in the Donetsk People’s Republic’s “Vostok” Battalion in Donbas in 2014 – announced the formation of the Alania Battalion in January 2016. The payment, benefits, and deployment terms promised to Alania Battalion fighters to fight in Ukraine in 2022 are unclear. The Alania Battalion deployed to Ukraine likely around late May or early June 2022 and participated in combat operations on the southern axis in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Head of the Republic of North Ossetia Sergei Menyailo visited the Alania Battalion and reportedly received a concussion near Hulaipole. A unspecified T-62 tank unit (likely a platoon-sized tank unit) reinforced the Alania Battalion on June 20. Combat imagery from early July documented the Alania Battalion’s loss of at least one of the tanks that reinforced the battalion.&lt;/p&gt;

Or, to put it in the simpler words of Jim Malone, Eliot Ness’s counselor in The Untouchables, “You wanna know how to get Capone? They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That’s the Chicago way! And that’s how you get Capone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Capone is an apt analogy for what the West confronts in Russia: a particularly noxious mix of Mafia mentality, hypernationalist ideology, and totalitarian technique. Elegance is not the Russian way, and it cannot be our way. This is the light in which one should measure the accomplishments of NATO’s recent gathering in Madrid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tangible efforts that Western leaders announced were impressive in many respects, particularly the commitments to provide Ukraine with nearly 500 artillery systems, 600 tanks, hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, and more. The question, as always, is whether these will be delivered as swiftly as they can be absorbed, and whether the United States and its allies are “leading the target” by putting in place now the infrastructure to prepare Ukraine for the weapons it will require and hopefully receive one, two, or six months from now, and for training the large forces it must mobilize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2022/06/photos-more-than-100-days-of-war-in-ukraine/661217/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: More than 100 days of war in Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States made some incremental additional commitments of forces to Europe, including two destroyers for a naval base in Spain. The policy declarations were important as well: a decision to expand by an order of magnitude NATO’s high-readiness forces; a formal recognition of the challenge (NATO avoided for now the word threat) posed by China; and an agreement to welcome Finnish and Swedish applications to join the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these moves, beneficial as they may be, only partly meet the needs of the moment. Time and again Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to absorb high-end military hardware and deploy it quickly and effectively. This seems to be the case with HIMARS, the mobile rocket systems that are extremely accurate, and with which Ukrainian forces seem to be already hitting Russian ammunition dumps and military headquarters. Instead of the promised eight, the Ukrainians need 80, and work should be happening now to scale up transfers of these and like weapons as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Biden administration still struggles with is the ultimate purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/ukraine-western-support-concession-economic-cost/661155/&quot;&gt;Western assistance to Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. At his press conference, the president said that the United States and its allies would not “allow Ukraine to be defeated.” That is the wrong objective. It should be, rather, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/why-ukraine-must-defeat-putin-russia/629940/&quot;&gt;ensure Russia’s defeat&lt;/a&gt; — the thwarting of its aims to conquer yet more of Ukrainian territory, the smashing of its armed forces, and the doing of both in a convincing, public, and, yes, therefore humiliating way. Chicago rules, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the administration is wrong to titrate arms out of a misguided desire to avoid provoking Russian escalation or enabling the Ukrainians to do too much. The West is in a moment of military-industrial crisis; it should be taking concrete measures to ramp up industrial mobilization, with the goal of equipping Ukraine to the maximum while rearming the expanding forces of a newly awakened NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Western allies counter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/&quot;&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, they must also meet the broader and longer-term threat that Russia poses to the eastern members of NATO, particularly the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western allies will not invade Russia, nor will they overthrow its regime directly — one day, hopefully, Russians will do that. Putin is motivated by imperial fantasies of imitating Peter the Great and other, even less savory Russian leaders. And Putin’s successor, should the Russian leader die or become incapacitated while in office, will likely be no better. For evidence of that, one need only consult the ravings of key advisers such as Nikolai Patrushev. If and when the battles cease in Ukraine, Russia’s intentions to expand and subjugate its neighbors will remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news here is that if one sets aside misleading memories of World War II and the Cold War, and disregards the ominous mutterings of experts who exaggerated Russian capacity before the war, then it becomes obvious that Russia is a weak state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s GDP is less than that of South Korea. Its leadership is afraid to openly mobilize its middle class, so it refuses to declare war and send young men from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the slaughterhouse that is the Donbas. Its generals are, for the most part, incompetent, which is why purges of them continue. It is scraping the bottom of its manpower barrel and so raises to absurd heights the age level of potential service members. Corruption and indiscipline have rotted out its maintenance and low-level leadership. What it has is Cold War–era stockpiles of weapons and munitions (and those are huge, but finite); some pockets of excellence, for example its railroad units; and utter disregard for human life throughout the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, a mangy, myopic, and rabid bear is still a dangerous beast. That’s why beating Russian forces in Ukraine is not enough. The West must impose upon Russia sanctions intended not, as the current ones are, to punish, but rather to enfeeble (Chicago rules, again). The plummeting of Russian car production is an example of a basic fact, which is that Russian production depends, more than one might think, on access to Western chips, machine tools, and special materials. However the Ukraine war ends, permanently or temporarily, the West needs to settle into a comprehensive sanctions regime that will weaken Russia’s economy in the long haul and throttle its ability to rearm on a large scale when the shooting stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO expansion should assist in this process. The alliance will soon in all likelihood have Sweden and Finland as full members. They have real and potential capacity (Finland more the former, Sweden more the latter) and serious political leadership. But a NATO of 32 members will be even more unwieldy than what we now have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/07/nato-europe-america-trump-strategy/661459/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: The accidental Trumpification of NATO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution — which cannot be publicly declared — is a NATO-within-NATO. Germany, France, and Italy have the largest economies in the European Union and in theory should carry the most weight in European-security decision making as well. But they cannot. Germany, the proverbial Hamlet of nations, is fatally compromised by its unwillingness and inability to make good on military commitments, and its recent sordid past in enabling Russia’s growth and stranglehold on European energy supplies. France is domestically torn, while the overweening vanity of its presidents makes it difficult for them to get a receptive hearing from lesser mortals. Italy, as ever, produces statesmen on occasion, but not statesmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nascent coalition of powers is, however, willing to take Russia seriously and has the muscle to thwart her while bringing less resolute European states along. The Eastern European and Baltic states, with Poland in the lead, know Russian tyranny firsthand, and are ready to stand up to it; the Scandinavian states, in particular Finland and Norway, are almost as intent; the English-speaking external powers, including the United Kingdom and Canada, are similarly alive and determined. It is to this core group that American statecraft must look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British chief of the General Staff recently described the Ukraine crisis as a 1937 moment for the West. It was an acute historical comparison. In that year the Sino-Japanese war began, setting the stage for World War II. In that year the West had before it choices that could have avoided the horrors of a far worse conflict, but it ducked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To their credit, in the current moment, Western leaders are performing far better than did their counterparts 85 years ago — but not yet well enough. We’re dealing with Capone, and while, like Eliot Ness, we need to stay within the constraints of law and basic decency, we also need to apply Chicago rules.&lt;/p&gt;

At present, however, several Russian advantages and Ukrainian weaknesses are leading to an attritional conflict that risks a protracted war, eventually favouring Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian electronic warfare (EW) is denying Ukraine a sufficiently fast kill chain to destroy Russia’s artillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian artillery is fixing the Ukrainian military and preventing the Ukrainians from concentrating to undertake offensive manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian cruise missiles are imposing a high economic and political cost on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shortage of skilled infantry and armoured operators is limiting Ukraine’s offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited staff capacity is limiting Ukraine’s ability to plan and execute combined operations at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners have the ability to reverse these dynamics to enable Ukraine to retake its lost territory. This cannot be achieved through the piecemeal delivery of a large number of different fleets of equipment, each with separate training, maintenance and logistical needs. Instead, Ukraine’s partners should rationalise the support they provide around a small number of platforms. Ukraine’s key capability requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-radiation seekers for loitering munitions to suppress or destroy Russian EW complexes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to target and destroy Russian logistics and ammunition stockpiles to starve Russian artillery of ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;155-mm howitzers and ammunition to prevent Russian troop concentration and support Ukrainian troop concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure communications systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-tank guided weapons and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protected mobility to enable Ukrainian troops to manoeuvre under artillery threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point defences to protect critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also necessary for Ukraine to receive training at scale to form new units able to undertake offensive operations and to receive staff and junior leadership training to support the orchestration of combined arms offensive manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four months of intense fighting in Ukraine have seen Russia’s grand offensive strokes descend into a grinding attritional struggle. Ukraine’s determination to resist, flawed Russian planning and execution, and the rapid delivery of arms to the Ukrainian armed forces have ensured Kyiv’s survival. The support that has enabled Ukraine to survive, however, will not deliver an end to the conflict. Russia could still wear down Ukrainian ammunition stockpiles, its reserve of skilled troops and the patience of the international community to slowly claw back a path towards meeting its aims. Ensuring Ukrainian survival in the longer term means enabling Ukrainian victory, and this requires a different kind of support to its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International support to Ukraine over the first four months of the war has been driven by two imperatives: what Ukraine’s partners have had immediately available; and what can be brought into Ukrainian service with the minimum necessary training and enablement. Given the magnitude and acuteness of the threat, this approach was justified. As the war protracts, however, there is a need to ensure that Ukraine’s war effort can be sustained, and that Ukraine is armed to deconstruct Russia’s system of systems, rather than produce a symmetrical stalemate that can only bring about an attritional conflict, risking Ukraine’s exhaustion. Whatever capabilities are provided, it is also necessary for standardisation and for them to be provided at scale. Given that this will require orders from Western industry, it is essential that the right capabilities are prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report seeks to outline how Russian forces are conducting their war against Ukraine through the examination of their technical capabilities and how they are being employed against the Ukrainian armed forces. By examining the tactical performance of the Russian system of warfare, the report reaches conclusions as to what international support is best placed to achieve disproportionate effect against it. The report is based on fieldwork in Ukraine both prior to and during the conflict, extensive interviews with Ukrainian military, scientific, security and intelligence personnel in both leadership and tactical positions, physical examination of captured Russian military equipment, observation of the armed forces of Ukraine on operations, interviews with Western security and military personnel, interviews with fighters in Ukraine’s foreign legion, examination of Russian military documents assessing their own operations and tactics in Ukraine, and the scraping of videos, images and accounts of fighting from open sources alongside a literature review of press coverage and academic writing about the war. The report takes into consideration, but largely discounts, Russian military performance and especially tactics, techniques and procedures documented during the first three weeks of fighting because the operational context makes these anomalous. To avoid similar contextual factors leading to overly broad conclusions, the report seeks to document consistent Russian behaviours and proficiencies observed between multiple fronts, such as in Donbas, Kherson and in some areas around Kyiv. It neglects a detailed examination of Russian unconventional operations and Ukraine’s maritime flank. These are important topics that should be examined separately. Instead, this report focuses on the dynamics of ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally, the report focuses on four elements of Russian operations: artillery; EW and reconnaissance; ground manoeuvre; and the air war. It ends with an overview of the conclusions as to what support should be prioritised for Ukraine. Although the report is heavily based on assessments of Ukrainian military performance and deficiencies in the Ukrainian armed forces, these are detailed sparingly to avoid providing Russia with useful insight into Ukrainian capabilities and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beneath-the-iron-rain&quot;&gt;Beneath the Iron Rain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery is one of the most important components of Russian operations, and in terms of lethal capabilities it has become Russia’s mission-critical force multiplier. The generally mediocre performance of Russia’s ground forces has been increasingly offset by their leveraging of massed artillery fires to facilitate a slow and methodical advance. Sustained bombardment has progressively displaced the local population and levelled the settlements and infrastructure that were being defended, forcing the Ukrainian military to abandon territory after it is devastated. Furthermore, by preventing Ukrainian forces from massing to counterattack and causing considerable attrition to those units holding the line, particularly in Sievierodonetsk, Russian artillery was the key to preventing Ukrainian forces from turning the tables in the close fight as they did in the Battle for Kyiv prior to the Russian withdrawal from that axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of the Battle for Kyiv, the battlefield geometry prevented Russian artillery from being employed effectively. Russian forces were trapped on two main supply routes, leaving their lead elements in range of Ukrainian artillery positions while their own artillery and its ammunition were trapped behind congested friendly forces. In the south and in Donbas, by contrast, Russian forces have been able to deploy their artillery units more effectively and in a manner more consistent with Russian doctrine. Despite this, Russian artillery use reflects the Russian military being in a transitionary state. It had yet to widely implement many of the doctrinal and technical innovations that it had experimented with in recent years and intended to employ at scale. While battalion tactical groups (BTGs) have their own organic artillery, mostly mortars and limited numbers of field howitzers,  many units lacked full complements of modernised guns, with most commanders unwilling to release artillery from the artillery tactical groups generated at the brigade and divisional level. This problem has been exacerbated by equipment losses early in the conflict, and has meant that Russian artillery has largely operated independently from – rather than in close support of – its manoeuvre elements, with supportive fire missions having long delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge resulting from the disorganisation of the first phase of the war is that as Russian casualties have been replaced by conscripts, new short-term volunteer contractors, and mobilised citizens with prior military experience, there are fewer personnel trained to use Russia’s latest fire-control and battlespace management systems. In theory, Russian fires are mediated by the AKATSIA and AQUEDUCT systems. Russian forces were moving towards a common information environment as trialled at smaller scale in Syria. Under this concept of operations, which borrowed heavily from US and NATO concepts and doctrine and has been referred to as the Reconnaissance Fires Complex, artillery tactical groups could, through secure channels, receive targeting information in real time from ISTAR systems and units, be flexibly tasked to provide fire support to different units, and coordinate fires from multiple gunlines and groups to provide effect on targets. However, shortages of the required secure communications systems, alongside weaknesses in the training of both new recruits and older veterans called up to replace casualties and who are not familiar with the latest modernised systems, have resulted in failures to use it correctly. Russian artillery organic to BTGs have often communicated via unencrypted communications, or have followed up signals on their fire control systems with communications via cell phone or commercially procured devices. This has caused a centralisation of the artillery system into the artillery tactical groups under the command of more senior officers and staffs with experience of the appropriate battlespace management tools and in a slowing of the kill chain and resultant reduction in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these frictions, Russia has achieved fires dominance through the sheer volume of tactical artillery and munitions that it can bring to bear. In addition to vast stockpiles that the Soviet Union accumulated, and which have yet to be depleted – by some estimates, several years’ worth still remains – the Russian defence industry has a significant capacity for producing artillery shells. For example, Soviet-era armaments factories based in Ukraine were fulfilling orders for Russian forces up until 2014 with the capacity to assemble 2,000,000 152-mm howitzer shells per year in contracts that had been continued since the 1980s. Many similar large-scale plants remain in operation inside Russia. Although the Ukrainian factory had the capacity to assemble this many shells, actual outputs were often slightly below this figure, largely because of a bottleneck in the production of explosive material for the propellant and warhead. Nevertheless, the result of this stockpile is that, at present, Russia is firing approximately 20,000 152-mm artillery shells per day compared with Ukraine’s 6,000, with an even greater proportional disparity in multiple rocket launchers and missiles fired. Despite the prevalence of examples in the social media narrative of precision fires being delivered, the majority of artillery fires in Ukraine are conducted by traditional unguided mortars, field howitzers and MLRS. Although guided artillery ammunition has been produced and made available to Russian units, personnel and training problems have hampered implementation. This has often resulted in guided munitions being used as dumb shells. Ukrainian troops have observed Russian forces firing laser-guided artillery ammunition, for example, without using a laser designator to mark targets. Similar to previous conflicts, area-effect artillery reliant on blast and fragmentation as the principal mechanisms for causing damage to targets is devastating against soft targets such as dismounted personnel and light vehicles but is of limited effectiveness against armour. Against armoured vehicles and hard targets or structures, the use of these fires tends to be to fix the defenders, which can make them susceptible to either bypass, or destruction through the employment of thermobaric artillery such as the TOS-1A MLRS. Due to poor ISTAR capability and long response times, Ukrainian artillery units have reported being able to consistently evade being subjected to effective Russian targeting and counterbattery fire. However, when employed en masse against fixed targets, such as defended positions and urban areas, the cumulative effect of Russian artillery has proven potent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that tactical artillery has been employed is roughly consistent with established doctrine, albeit lacking much of the C4ISTAR coordination as envisioned by the Reconnaissance Fire Complex and exhibiting a considerable degree of systemic friction and slowed responsiveness. Where the Reconnaissance Fire Complex has been successfully established in Ukraine – which has occurred periodically – it has been through the adoption and integration of UAV and EW ISTAR to identify targets and coordinate fires. In terms of physical deployment, Ukrainian forces have observed that the Russians deploy their artillery systems set back from the frontline by one third of their maximum range as a protection measure; mortars are largely positioned 1.5 km back from the forward line of own troops, artillery tactical groups subordinated to brigades 8 km back, and artillery tactical groups armed with longer-ranged systems dedicated to deep fires at 10–15 km back. There is significant variation from these distances, with artillery units often moving forward to extend their reach. Nevertheless, the principle is generally adhered to. Batteries are deployed across an area of up to 100 by 300 metres, with between 20 and 40 metres between each gun. MLRS are generally deployed in a linear gunline, with up to 150 metres between each launcher. However, some artillery batteries have been detected as being split up into dispersed subunits. This is partly due to artillery shortages at the BTG and brigade level, with pairs of, or individual, guns fulfilling a support function that should be the task of a full battery. However, some of this dispersion is due to the use of mobile fire units supported by UAVs to attack key Ukrainian targets. While limited in scale, these instances show where the Russian Army’s aspirations to modernise have begun to be realised. Where they have been realised, Russian fires have been responsive, accurate and highly lethal. Russian artillery units have also set up dummy positions using one artillery piece with the remainder made up of damaged or destroyed Russian artillery, to draw Ukrainian fire. Russian MLRS are used primarily for area denial, often to constrain the movement of Ukrainian units, while field howitzers are used against specific targets, though this is not a universal rule. For counterbattery fire against artillery, Russian forces will generally task those artillery tactical groups armed with heavier,
longer-ranged weapons, or Tochka-U.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ukrainian artillery crews, Russian artillery is generally able to bring accurate artillery fire down on targets 3 to 5 minutes after UAV reconnaissance has identified them, but if a target is identified with EW direction finding, acoustic reconnaissance or counterbattery artillery radar, it will take Russian artillery approximately half an hour to bring inaccurate artillery fire to bear. The importance of UAVs to Russia’s artillery precision and responsiveness has forced Ukraine to maintain organic MANPADS teams with their artillery, preferably armed with visually guided systems such as Starstreak and Martlet, which have proven much more effective against UAVs and helicopters. If Russian forces are able to maintain UAV reconnaissance over a target, they are able to adjust fire in near-real time even if the target is moving. When subjected to counterbattery fire themselves, Russian MLRS units will tend to relocate, whereas howitzers, whether towed or self-propelled, will usually be left in position while the crews seek cover or position themselves at a distance from their guns until incoming fire has subsided. Russian batteries often do not relocate after fire missions, but will relocate to a new position or gunline within the same approximate area if they come under attack. It was noted that when plugged into the AKATSIA fire-control architecture, Russian counterbattery fire was assigned to unengaged batteries, and was not conducted by batteries that were themselves being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant deviation from doctrine is that Russian forces have made extensive tactical use of the Tochka-U ballistic missile for counterbattery and tactical strikes. Although almost entirely retired from frontline service by 2019, as they were officially replaced by Iskander-M, the reliance of Russian forces on indirect fires resulted in the Tochka-U’s restoration to active service and its repurposing from a long-range precision-strike system to part of the tactical artillery system. Although Tochka-U is often used by Russian forces to target EW units and command posts located in the enemy rear, it has become valued for its large high-explosive warhead, which Russian forces seem to view as effective against a wide variety of targets for which it was not originally intended. This has sometimes manifested in acutely inefficient targeting. In one engagement, a single Ukrainian M109 howitzer was targeted by three Tochka-U strikes. The crew were forced to temporarily abandon the howitzer in order to seek hard cover, but it survived with light damage that could be repaired in a few hours with some basic spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, despite the deficiencies and inefficiencies of the Russian Army’s artillery forces, in their present form they remain a major obstacle to Ukrainian forces, enabling continued Russian offensive operations and impeding Ukrainian counterattacks. Breaking down Russia’s fires dominance is critical if Ukrainian forces are to be able to retake ground and stem their current high rate of attrition. The main weakness of the Russian artillery system is the logistics burden posed by the transportation and stockpiling of the vast quantity of shells that allows Russia to continue to manoeuvre by fire. Russian dependence on the railway network as the primary means of transporting war stocks was well understood before the war. Due to a lack of planning time for lower echelons, Russia struggled to move materiel from rail heads to its frontline positions in the opening phase of the conflict. During April, however, a system of contractorisation for moving materiel from railheads to the divisional rear was developed, with military units then shifting ammunition to large ammunition depots behind the main artillery concentrations. From there, the ammunition is shuttled to the guns. The reliance on railheads and civilian vehicles, which are largely restricted to road movement, makes key bottlenecks in Russian artillery highly predictable. Moreover, the ammunitions dumps at the divisional and brigade level are large, distinct, hard to conceal or defend, and slow to relocate. Given Ukraine’s limited capacity to strike at the Russian military’s rear echelons and fight a deep battle, this is a weakness that is yet to be widely capitalised upon. Isolated strikes on ammunition dumps show what is possible but given the disparity in guns and the shortage of Russian precision fires, the fastest way to level the playing field is to enable Ukraine to strike Russian artillery logistics. The critical factor in this is precision, range and payload. Ukraine needs strike systems with a sufficiently powerful warhead to ignite stored ammunition or damage key logistical infrastructure, accurate enough to hit these targets precisely, and with the range to do so from beyond Russian howitzer fire. The best system for this is MLRS, although with a more powerful munition than the UK’s reduced lethality unitary warhead GMLRS. These capabilities need to be provided at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In breaking up the Russian fires complex, targeting ammunition would significantly reduce the volume of fire that Russia could bring to bear and thereby offer advantage to the force able to strike with greater precision. Although Ukrainian ammunition consumption may not rise to Russian levels, the destruction of Russian guns and the provision of close support to Ukrainian units will necessitate a significant number of both howitzers and shells. Given that 152-mm ammunition is in limited supply and NATO countries lack production lines for this nature, it will be necessary to provide Ukraine with a large number of 155-mm howitzers and a consistent supply of ammunition. One challenge here is that NATO standardisation is not very standardised, with different countries’ howitzers not only having completely different maintenance requirements but also using different charges, fuses and sometimes shells. The current approach by which each country donates a battery of guns in a piecemeal way is rapidly turning into a logistical nightmare for Ukrainian forces with each battery requiring a separate training, maintenance and logistics pipeline. Making support to Ukraine sustainable requires the provision of one or two kinds of gun and for countries to step up production of the appropriate ammunition. It will also necessitate the establishment of second-line maintenance for these systems. Of course, these efforts will be of limited value if Ukrainian forces cannot find their targets in a timely manner, and so we must turn to the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contesting-the-spectrum&quot;&gt;Contesting the Spectrum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is to defeat Russian fires through a combination of range and precision, its armed forces need a kill chain that can identify and communicate the location of Russian targets. This can either be delivered by UAVs, reconnaissance teams or electronic direction finding. All these methods, however, are hindered by Russia’s EW complexes which are integral to Russian concepts of operation. It is therefore necessary to assess how these are being employed in Ukraine, their limitations and where they present tactical challenges that must be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial phase of the war in Ukraine is not indicative of Russian EW capabilities because the confusion caused by a lack of planning time led to fratricide, poor command coordination and thus many Russian EW systems being kept off. Subsequently, the Russian armed forces have started to use their EW capabilities more systematically. On 6 June 2022, for example, a field assessment of the Russian armed forces concluded that ‘the enemy’s UAVs, high-precision loitering and artillery ammunition and communications equipment rely on positioning through the reception of signals from satellite radio navigation systems’. To protect Russian forces from these capabilities, it was recommended that they continuously suppress access to satellite navigation through the constant operation of the Pole-21 system and the constant employment of the R330Zh, both on maximum power using omnidirectional jamming. The advice noted that these systems could be deconflicted with the employment of Orlan-10 UAVs by the Russian forces. The effect on Russian command and control was limited by the linking of command posts by ground-laid field cable, which Ukrainian forces have noted is now always emplaced within hours of the Russians setting up a position. Both Pole-21 and R330Zh are turned off prior to the commencement of Russian artillery strikes that may need to rely on accurate satellite-based positioning. In practice, while widespread, coverage is not constant because the R330Zh requires a significant supply of fuel to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more active layer in the Russian EW defence architecture is provided by Shipovnik-Aero, a truck-mounted jamming system optimised for targeting UAVs but also capable of suppressing a range of communications networks. The system has a range of 15 km and detects UAVs through their control frequency. The system takes approximately 25 seconds to analyse the control frequencies of newly encountered UAVs, and around 2 seconds to reconfirm the control frequencies of previously encountered UAVs. It then jams the command frequency. In addition, the system overrides the positioning of the UAV so that ‘return to base’ protocols lead the UAV to land in a location designated by the Russians. The Shipovnik-Aero has two workstations and is able to engage two UAVs at a time. Its jamming effect is delivered on a bearing with a width of approximately 3 degrees, suppressing friendly and civilian signals in the targeted bands within this area. Although these systems are not universally available to Russian formations, their presence has become widespread, limiting the airspace that Ukrainian UAVs are able to penetrate and monitor. The Shipovnik-Aero can take up to 40 minutes to set up and, like many other Russian EW systems, is therefore vulnerable to suppression through forced displacement or strike if its position can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge faced by Ukrainian troops is that Russian direction finding is highly capable and where it is not possible to suppress UAVs, it is often possible to target the ground control station. The means by which ground control stations have been targeted depends on the type of UAV and its range, but has included the dedicated firing of 152-mm howitzers, 300-mm MLRS and Tochka-U at UAV operators. Between these threats and those of EW causing UAVs to crash, or interception by air-defence systems, the lifespan of Ukrainian UAVs is roughly 7 days with some variation by system. In consequence, many Ukrainian units are forced to choose between having a live feed from their UAVs and thereby risking a high likelihood of losing the platform or sending UAVs out on pre-set flight plans and analysing the images they take on their return to a pre-set location. The use of jamming detection and inertial navigation can mitigate against the jamming of satellite navigation for a UAV following a pre-set flight plan. However, this method imposes a significant time delay between a target being identified in a location and the capacity of Ukrainian forces to bring fires to bear. This is either because the enemy is not in the location that the UAV was pre-programmed to examine requiring subsequent UAV launches, or because of the time required to conduct the analysis and confirmation of images after the UAV has completed its flight, compounded by the analytical challenge of confirming the coordinates of targets observed when accurate satellite navigation over the target area is denied. During fieldwork, the authors observed that a UAV launched to observe Russian positions in the latter manner did not face serious interference from EW, but that a subsequent UAV flying with a command link came under electronic attack as soon as it approached Russian forces. At present, it is widely observed that the Russians rarely displace from favourable positions once established. This, however, is likely a consequence of Ukraine having so few means to strike these targets, and it must be assumed that if Ukraine were to gain the means to strike – as outlined in the previous section – Russian units would begin to displace at intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians have had very limited success in denying Ukrainian communications. Despite Russian forces fielding EW complexes dedicated to the suppression of satellites, such as the 1RL257 Krasukha-4, the density of the Starlink satellite architecture means that Ukrainian forces are able to maintain reliable satellite connections across tactical formations. Cyber attacks against satellite architectures have been disruptive, but periodic, and the effect has not been something that the Russians can synchronise with other actions. Where 1RL257 has proven more effective is in the preparatory jamming of radar and other defensive systems in preparation of large-scale artillery or air strikes. Another element of the use of EW in an offensive role is the TORN-MDM signals intelligence vehicle, capable of direction finding and triangulating tactical communications within a radius of between 30 and 70 km depending on frequency. This system can also record and analyse communications, with the organic capacity to attempt decryption. Although Harris radios have been found to function despite Russian EW and to have robust encryption, Motorola radios used extensively by Ukrainian forces are more suspectable to jamming and technical examination suggests the signals are decrypted, although it takes around two hours. Training, tactics and procedures can mitigate the risk to operational security as a result of this penetration for tactical actions but it severely limits the Ukrainian capacity to disseminate operationally relevant orders and instructions in a secure manner and is therefore a constraining factor in the scale at which Ukrainian forces can coordinate. A further complication is the Russian employment of Leer-3 EW payloads mounted on Orlan-10 UAVs to target cell phone networks. While widely employed, the effect of these systems has been limited by their protracted employment over the past 8 years in Donbas so that Ukrainian forces are familiar with the risks posed by the system and effective countermeasures to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, Russian EW employment is not preventing Ukrainian communications and denying access to the electromagnetic spectrum. However, it is disrupting, limiting the accuracy of positioning, and slowing down vital kill chains and imposing significant limitations on Ukrainian reconnaissance in depth. Because long-range strike depends on precision systems, which are only available in limited numbers, Russian EW is a critical barrier to Ukrainian forces effectively employing the highly capable Western systems that could enable them to win the firefight and undermine Russia’s most important advantage. A means of countering Russian EW is thus necessary to enable Ukraine to conduct timely and accurate reconnaissance. The best method of delivering this effect is a radar-homing seeker payload for explosive-laden UAVs. Ukraine has the industrial capacity to manufacture airframes at scale, and there is a significant advantage in allowing Ukraine to develop multiple wing-forms for this mission because it makes the detection, classification and destruction of the UAVs much harder for Russian forces. However, a robust, cheap and reliable seeker that can be provided at scale is the critical component to enable this capability. Even if such a system did not account for a large number of destroyed Russian EW systems, because all EW complexes must emit – save for collection systems such as the TORN-MDM – they are readily targeted in this manner. Russian forces can avoid the destruction of their systems by leaving them off or displacing. Given that most EW complexes take between 25–40 minutes to set up, however, forcing displacement is an effective means of suppression that, in turn, would create many windows of opportunity for Ukrainian UAVs and reconnaissance teams to communicate the position of Russian systems in real time and determine the exact coordinates of positively identified high-value targets. The development of a cheap seeker that can be provided to Ukraine at scale is therefore a critical capability that Ukraine’s partners should immediately prioritise. If Ukraine can counter Russian EW, it becomes possible to apply accurate fires to counteract the shaping by massed Russian artillery and thereby bring about the favourable conditions for Ukrainian ground manoeuvre that are a pre-condition to the liberation of occupied Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hectares-lost-and-liberated&quot;&gt;Hectares Lost and Liberated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground manoeuvre is an area in which Ukraine holds significant advantages, but as these advantages are primarily related to the defence there will need to be significant support to enable Ukraine to retake lost ground. To begin with the Russian ground forces, at the beginning of the invasion, Russian units were organised into BTGs that were often understrength in their infantry component but nevertheless predominantly made up of contract soldiers. Poor tactical employment combined with a shortage of infantry to support armour saw the Russians take exceedingly heavy equipment and personnel losses. In the aftermath of the withdrawal from Kyiv, Russian forces have sought to reconstitute their forces in two ways. First, they have offered short-term contracts for service in Ukraine with inflated salaries. Second, the Russian government has been conducting a stealthy mobilisation of older citizens with prior military experience and with technical competences in order to reduce the training time for their integration into the force. Having raised the age for eligible service, the Russian government assesses that it has 1.6 million people within its current target group for mobilisation. Ukrainian officials are predicting that 9 million Russians will be unemployed by the end of the year, potentially increasing those volunteering for service. Nevertheless, the draft appears extremely unpopular and even among hard Russian nationalists is seen as a signal that the government has conducted the war incompetently. Furthermore, bottlenecks in government records, training capacity and equipment serviceability mean that the Russian government cannot pull all these individuals into uniform in a short space of time. Instead, the process of mobilisation is anticipated to be an ongoing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics outlined above have created several problems for Russian ground forces. First, their units are now amalgamations of troops with variable levels of training, experience and equipment and with little time spent working together. The lack of a professional non-commissioned officer corps in the Russian Army has inhibited the cohesion of these composite units. Furthermore, the massive casualties among Russia’s contract soldiers – disproportionately concentrated among the airborne and special forces – in the first month of the war has left many soldiers who survived to be very reluctant to embark on offensive operations. Thus, the most experienced troops who ought to be critical to leading newly mobilised personnel are, in many cases, the most reluctant to prosecute attacks. The result is that Russian forces on the offensive lack momentum, and demand massive artillery preparation of their objectives as well as overwhelming numerical superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these deficiencies, the Russians continue to seize ground and are inflicting casualties on the Ukrainian military at an average rate of 100 per day. There are several reasons for this. First, the artillery dominance of the Russian forces prevents Ukrainian troops from concentrating much above the size of the company group. Russian forces, which are not under a comparable artillery threat, can concentrate at the decisive point and are therefore achieving localised force ratios upwards of 7:1 on their main effort. Furthermore, by operating across a broader front, Russian forces are better able to exploit their considerable firepower and resilience than during their attempts at a coup de main against Kyiv. Furthermore, after taking massive casualties, the Russians have once again taken up their lessons from Chechnya and Syria and begun to employ mobile storm groups to spearhead offensive operations in urban areas, built around 20-person assault teams supported by armour. This tactical adaptation has enabled Russian forces to make greater progress in urban fighting, with casualty rates among Russian and Ukrainian units currently approaching parity, despite the Russians usually being on the offensive. Although Ukrainian troops are much better motivated, Russian numerical superiority and the ability to kill Ukrainian forces with artillery as they manoeuvre mean that Ukrainian units continue to cede ground and to pay disproportionately on the offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling Ukraine to defeat Russian ground manoeuvre forces is not just a matter of winning the artillery war. Ukrainian troops must be able to take the offensive, and here it is necessary to address some serious misconceptions about the structure and capabilities of the Ukrainian Army. US commentators have applauded excellent Ukrainian tactical proficiency and often ascribed this to Ukraine adopting a professional non-commissioned officer corps. This is an impression produced by disproportionate interaction with a small number of highly capable Ukrainian units that have had long exposure to NATO. To step into the headquarters of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, for example, would be a very familiar experience for any NATO officer. The layout of the room, range of specialisms present, orders process and culture, with briefings delivered by junior officers and soldiers under the supervision of their superiors, is similar to what prevails in the most proficient NATO command posts. The 95th Brigade – and several others – also have non-commissioned officers who have interacted extensively with NATO counterparts. Speak to them about their role, however, and they are the first to admit that there is little standardisation of how non-commissioned officer posts are used by commanders across the Ukrainian Army, that professional military education for the corps was nascent before the war and that their units are not representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most units of the Ukrainian armed forces today contain a significant proportion of civilians with limited military experience, mobilised technical specialists with considerable expertise but without rank, and small numbers of professional soldiers who have rarely operated at scale. The culture is highly egalitarian. Orders groups are more akin to debates in which the commander’s statement of the mission objective results in a chaotic discussion enabling all participants to raise questions, concerns and ideas. The result is often an innovative and technically complex tactical scheme and is a large cause for Ukraine’s widespread tactical successes. It is an approach that maximises the contribution of motivated soldiers with a wealth of creativity and a wide range of competences. However, such a process, while viable in platoon and company groups, is not replicable at scale. In battalion- and brigade-sized actions, which is the minimum level at which full combined arms capabilities come together and is therefore the level at which offensive actions are most successfully undertaken, commanders must often make decisions that trade risk against a part of their force in exchange for advantage in another. This is a process that is not best reached by consensus but by unity of command, a clear orders process and mechanisms to oversee the implementation of orders. In many Ukrainian units, the lack of planning staffs and non-commissioned officers to manage execution of rapidly transmitted orders make the transition from defence to offence challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because of poor pay prior to the conflict, the Ukrainian armed forces had trained vastly more technical specialists – such as mechanics, drivers and pilots – than it required to fill its order of battle. This was because of chronic retention problems. Now that Ukrainian society has been fully mobilised, the force has an abundance of technical specialists, and this is supplemented by civilian engineers, programmers and skilled professionals who make the Ukrainian military creative and able to build and employ a wide range of innovative capabilities. However, while this is exceedingly useful for communications, technical surveillance and reconnaissance, EW and other functions, the core of effective offensive operations relies on not only the much-needed uplift in military equipment but also the infantry fieldcraft, tankmanship, tactical proficiency and the well-practised coordination of these elements into true combined arms manoeuvre. Troops and commanders who are highly proficient in this are in far shorter supply. To compensate for the dearth of field experience in many Territorial Defence Battalions, the Ukrainian armed forces broke up some of their best units to push experienced infanteers into newly formed units. In the defence, this has led to reasonable combat performance by these troops. For the attack, however, the Ukrainian armed forces have found it necessary to bring their best units back together and have them spearhead attacks. The combination of distributing a limited supply of highly proficient professional soldiers across frontline units, and then their concentration for offensive operations, has seen disproportionate casualties among Ukraine’s most-capable troops. If Ukraine is to effectively fight a manoeuvrist war, able to withdraw from enemy concentrations and punish the Russians with fires, while setting up counterattacks to break up Russian formations, it will be necessary to improve the tactical soldiering skills across a significant number of Ukrainian troops from the various combat arms and to ensure that the staffs at brigade level are able to effectively employ these units. UK training of 10,000 infantry will help, but will be insufficient without staff and junior leadership training. The survivability of Ukrainian forces while manoeuvring also requires protected mobility able to survive Russian fires. It is also important that newly trained Ukrainian troops are not filtered into units piecemeal to simply maintain troop levels but are instead held in formed units that can offer higher Ukrainian echelons available units of action to execute manoeuvre and thereby unhinge Russia’s operations. If Ukraine can execute offensive manoeuvre, it will quickly take the initiative away from the Russians and thereby reduce the current massing of unfavourable force ratios at key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s international partners, enabling Ukraine to shift on to the offensive to retake its lost territories requires three lines of effort. First, there is a need to deliver infantry training to newly raised Ukrainian units at scale. Second, there is a need to deliver staff training at the brigade and divisional level to help expand the scale at which Ukraine can orchestrate operations. Third, there is a need to provide a standardised protected mobility platform with first- and second-line maintenance to give newly formed brigades the equipment to remain survivable while they concentrate. All of these are tasks that Ukraine’s international partners have the capability to deliver. The US has managed to gift armoured vehicles by the acre to allies in the Middle East. Even large numbers of armoured HMMWVs would be preferable to a smorgasbord of antiquated vehicle fleets. In the Balkans, MPRI’s support to Croatian forces during Operation Storm is a demonstration of how staff capacity can be rapidly expanded. Large-scale infantry training is something that has been conducted multiple times over the past 30 years. The question is how Ukraine’s partners plan to share the burden of these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-land-without-safety&quot;&gt;A Land Without Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial phase of operations, both the Russian Air Force and the Ukrainian Air Force have found that much of the air over enemy territory is denied to them. For Russia, a lack of pilot training for large-formation flying, limited capabilities for the suppression of air defences and the lack of unified command of air operations led to a significant number of aircraft losses and poor effects on Ukrainian territory. For Ukraine, the density and lethality of Russian air defences have meant that its air force cannot routinely approach areas of active operations, while helicopters are employed sparingly, only to areas confirmed to lack coverage from air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the longer-ranged Russian air-defence systems provide protection over the frontlines, the Russians have been able to maintain a significant tempo of close air support strikes in Mariupol and Donbas. However, the density of Ukrainian MANPADS forces Russian aircraft to fly at dusk and dawn, and at higher altitudes, limiting accuracy with unguided munitions. Against helicopters, Ukrainian forces report that Igla and Stinger MANPADS are routinely defeated by Russian countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russia’s ability to strike targets deep inside Ukraine is not removed by the denial of airspace to the VKS. From the first days of the war, Russia has struck across Ukraine with cruise and ballistic missiles. The initial failure by Russia to mass these fires against Ukrainian logistics and key infrastructure enabled Ukrainian forces to reposition in the opening stages of the war and is a partial cause of the failure of Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv. Nevertheless, as the conflict protracts, Russia’s ability to strike wherever it wishes has a number of effects that are detrimental to Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, these strikes minimise Ukraine’s capacity to domestically produce defence materiel, to conduct large-scale maintenance of its combat systems, exercise new formations of troops or maintain significant fixed infrastructure. From the destruction of Yavoriv Training Base with a salvo of 30 missiles near Lviv on 13 March, to the concentration of a salvo of missiles against Kyiv on 26 June, Russia is capable of conducting large-scale strikes on selected targets. The persistent strikes on Ukrainian cities have an attritional effect on the confidence of the Ukrainian public in its security, the prospects for reconstruction and economic recovery, and the management of internally displaced people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also appears that Russia is striking targets in civilian areas to send political messages, and to hold civilian areas at risk. There is a persistent concern that Russian missile systems positioned in Belarus may move south to conduct a mass strike on the capital at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been widely reported that Russia is running out of these munitions. It is certainly true that all these long-range strike systems rely on foreign components that Western sanctions are limiting Russia’s access to. It is also clear that Russia has a limited stockpile. Nevertheless, at current rates of expenditure, strikes can continue for months. So long as the capacity to deliver these effects remains, they also have a shaping function on Ukrainian forces, the economy and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most destructive system employed against Ukraine is the Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile, which is also the hardest to intercept. As it is manoeuvrable, the Iskander-M is exceedingly difficult for ballistic missile defence to plot an interception. Furthermore, it dispenses decoy emitters in its terminal phase, each approximately the size of a drinks can, which collectively expand and distort the contours and apparent trajectory of the missile when interrogated by radar. Despite being highly effective, Iskander-M is both one of Russia’s scarcer weapons systems and central to its concepts for defence against NATO, limiting the number of munitions that are used. The vast majority of strikes against Ukraine are conducted using cruise missiles, including: the 9M727 launched from the Iskander transporter erector launcher; the Kh-101 mainly launched from bombers from the north of Ukraine; the Kh-59 air- and ground-launched cruise missile; and the 3M-54 Kalibr launched in large numbers from Russian vessels in the Black Sea. The launch method, range and payload of these munitions varies, but they also have a large number of common characteristics and components. For example, some computers for processing sensor data are common in both the 9M727 and Kalibr missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarities between these missiles mean that they have comparable advantages and vulnerabilities. They are subsonic (though some variants can go supersonic in their terminal dive), low flying and manoeuvrable. The selection of waypoints en route to target allows these missiles to avoid detection by defensive radar if the locations of these defences have been established. Russian forces have been observed to use E95M air targets to encourage the illumination and thereby mapping of defensive radar. In any case, these missiles give little warning to missile defence systems and can often approach targets from poorly defended or even undefended trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of the manoeuvrability of these missiles is that, when they enter Ukrainian air space, their eventual destination cannot be determined – even if they are observed on a particular trajectory, they can turn to fly in a completely different direction. As a result, the Ukrainians must initiate their air raid warnings across a very wide area. However, multiple such alerts a day lead to many people ignoring the air raid warning, placing them at risk when the missiles eventually reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The missiles rely on a range of sensors to guide their flight. Several have imaging capabilities and can compare the footage to pre-loaded mapping. Others use radar for a similar purpose. They also tend to have an aerial mounted on the top of the missile for receiving satellite signals and have fibre-optic gyroscopes for inertial navigation in case weather, enemy countermeasures or damage denies access to their primary sensors. Interestingly, the Iskander 9M727 cruise missile – and this may be true of the others also – relies on GPS and GLONAS for its satellite navigation and is unable to receive BeiDou signals. The GPS is the primary navigation tool for the missile, probably because Russian satellite coverage over target countries is intermittent and because it is assumed that the enemy will not deny GPS signals over territory that they control. Briefings by the Pentagon have reported that a large number of Russian cruise missiles fail to either find their targets or malfunction and crash in flight. As far as Ukrainian military scientists can determine, this is actually quite rare. Because of their subsonic flight, Ukrainian troops can indicate to nearby units when these cruise missiles overfly them, and this has enabled Ukrainian Zu-23 gunners to prepare to engage munitions in flight. Other cruise missiles have been shot down by Ukrainian air-defence systems, including SA-11 and by fast air interceptors. Many of the downed missiles exhibit signs of having been hit in the fuselage and wing by cannon fire or fragmentation blasts, suffering damage to either their sensors or control surfaces and therefore having their stability in flight compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ground-based anti-aircraft artillery, ground-to-air and air-to-air missiles are able to knock out the majority of Russia’s long-range precision-strike capabilities, it is evident that Ukraine needs two kinds of support. First, there is the need for a means to disseminate cruise missile track data more effectively. For a warning system inside Ukraine, this could be app based, with civilians encouraged to tap to indicate when a cruise missile is overflying them. The cyber security of this architecture would be critical. More importantly, however, the provision of point defences for Ukrainian critical military infrastructure would be highly beneficial. Although Ukrainian air defences have proven capable of intercepting Russian missiles, there are too few of these platforms to provide adequate coverage given that the low flight profile of cruise missiles makes the area that a given air defence battery can cover very small. Instead, capabilities such as C-RAM and some EW systems could enable Ukraine to significantly harden critical areas in its rear to expand its ability to sustain domestic war production and to secure training sites that will be critical to the ongoing reconstitution of Ukrainian ground elements. Additional stocks of air-to-air missiles also offer the prospects of the continued interception of cruise missiles by the Ukrainian Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian victory is possible, but only with international support. In the absence of that support Ukraine may either be worn down through attrition and economically strangled, or else fight a protracted and bloody war over several years. International support so far has been hugely consequential in enabling Ukraine to survive but has also been piecemeal and is introducing significant logistical frictions into the Ukrainian military. The first step in delivering effective support to Ukraine is the rationalisation of the equipment being provided with standardisation of platforms and munitions supported by appropriate maintenance. Burden-sharing between Western defence industry and governments will be important. For this purpose, a committee to agree a process for rationalisation of support should be established to ensure its sustainability, where allies agree to each provide specific kinds of capability at scale, rather than each state offer small numbers of a wide range of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has sought to outline Ukraine’s foremost tactical requirements if it is to be able to retake the ground lost to Russia and thereby achieve the operational defeat of the Russian Army. First, Ukraine must suppress Russia’s artillery advantage by destroying the logistical enablement of Russia’s massed fires. Second, Ukraine must employ its own fires to prevent Russia concentrating to achieve positive force ratios. Third, the Ukrainian military must be able to strike Russia’s EW architecture to enable the kill chains to win the fire fight. Fourth, this should enable Ukrainian offensive ground manoeuvre, but will require large-scale training in infantry skills, support to Ukrainian brigade and divisional planning, and the provision of protected mobility. Finally, Ukrainian training bases, critical national infrastructure and population centres need greater protection from Russian long-range precision strikes, which demands the provision of support in tracking cruise missiles and point defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities for equipment support to Ukraine may be defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MLRS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52-calibre 155-mm howitzers and a consistent supply of ammunition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anti-radiation seekers for loitering munitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harris radios or comparably secure tactical communications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anti-tank guided weapons capable of overflight or top attack, most notably NLAW, Javelin and Brimstone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visually guided MANPADS such as Starstreak and Martlet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protected mobility platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point defence systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second-line maintenance support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and longevity of support that Ukraine requires is significant and will stretch many Western allies. These requirements cannot be met through the donation of existing stocks but will instead require the production of new munitions. The cost may lead Western states to slow-roll the provision of support. In practice, however, a slow attritional conflict will be much more costly in the long term. Rationalising support to Ukraine today and delivering capability at scale is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia is to be convinced that stopping its invasion is the best line of policy – just as the Russian military determined that it had to withdraw from Kyiv – then the Kremlin must be convinced that it cannot win through a protracted conflict that exhausts Ukrainian stockpiles and Western resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some setbacks since 2014, crony capitalism’s stakeholders have shown their ability to continue to manipulate Ukraine’s public institutions in the face of the deepest set of reforms undertaken since independence, as well as in conditions of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismantling the networks of systema will require a combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to curb corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research paper sets out how systema operates across key sectors of Ukraine’s economy, and identifies the main mechanisms that enable its stakeholders to preserve their privileges and divert public resources. It also considers the factors that may change the behaviour of those who benefit from crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s systema – commonly described as oligarkhiya in Ukraine – grew out of a specific form of crony capitalism that took root in the late 1990s. It has proved impressively resilient and adaptive to political and economic disruption since the 2004–05 Orange Revolution. It allocates resources inefficiently and in ways that do not benefit society, and increases economic costs by reducing competition. At the same time, it weakens institutions and perpetuates high levels of inequality and corruption. As such, it is the underlying obstacle to the development of fully functioning democratic institutions and rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema has proved particularly hard to dislodge because it rests on a firm alignment of interests between big business and the political class in favour of rent seeking over wealth creation for the public good. Across the state sector, and at different levels, it has spawned an extensive supporting structure of beneficiaries that service those interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema’s structures are in place not just in Kyiv but across the country. The same operating principles are replicated at regional level for the benefit of powerful local elites and their accomplices in regional governments and councils.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The influence of systema across the banking, energy, transport and healthcare sectors rests on the same foundations, and achieves broadly similar results for its stakeholders, even if some reforms have significantly reduced opportunities for the levels of rent seeking seen before the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. The agricultural sector is anomalous partly because of the absence of the main financial-industrial groups (FIGs) and because the issue of land reform resonates strongly with society and has limited the ambitions of some of the influential players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main FIGs dominate the media sector because ownership of media assets is vital for influencing politics and thereby preserving their influence. Over time, however, a combination of regulatory changes, digital disruption, and the appearance of new channels and new models of media business may erode their control of the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although systema has undoubtedly suffered setbacks since the Revolution of Dignity, it still has considerable residual strength, and the ability to undo some of the most important achievements of the reforms undertaken since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema has left Ukraine with a serious lack of expertise in government that contributes to weak state capacity. The major FIGs attract and retain much of the best talent in the country, putting it to work to make governing institutions work for them. This imbalance is likely to take many years to correct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reducing the influence of systema requires changing the calculus of the main players. Rent seeking needs to become more difficult, to carry greater risk and to be less profitable than wealth creation through the establishment of well-managed, transparent businesses that attract investment and generate employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ukraine’s system of crony capitalism reflects the absence of a strong state, and an enduring relationship between big business and the political class that puts their own interests before those of society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form of crony capitalism that emerged in Ukraine in the late 1990s has proved impressively resilient and adaptive to political and economic disruption since the Orange Revolution in 2004–05, followed by the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It functions based on a deeply integrated network bound by shared interests described here as systema, but known more commonly in Ukraine as oligarkhiya. Breaking its grip is essential for the consolidation of democratic institutions and the development of rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema is by no means a uniquely Ukrainian phenomenon. Variations of the same model exist to different degrees around the world, including in ‘old’ EU member states such as Greece and Italy as well as ‘new’ ones such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. Unlike its Russian analogue, which rests on a centralized structure of power, Ukraine’s systema reflects the absence of a strong state. The common features of these governance models are high concentrations of capital in the hands of a small number of politically connected business owners in environments characterized by institutions that siphon public money for the benefit of the few, low levels of transparency, limited accountability and weak rule of law. To different degrees, the effects include the undermining of democratic governance, the distortion of economies, and the promotion of criminality and corrupt practices through the influence on public policy of a dominant group’s business interests. In short, these systems seriously hinder the functioning of an autonomous state for the public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts often describe the ability of Ukraine’s major financial-industrial groups (FIGs) to penetrate parliament and the agencies of government in order to put their interests before those of the country as ‘state capture’, or ‘regulatory capture’. However, what is happening is not the one-way process that these terms imply. There is a symbiotic relationship between big business and politicians and officials in which each needs the other to sustain a system that allocates resources for their benefit. The FIGs depend on politicians, who are sometimes their direct representatives, to pass favourable laws and ensure the state apparatus implements them. Major business owners such as Rinat Akhmetov, Viktor Pinchuk and former president Petro Poroshenko have even served in parliament themselves, as Poroshenko does again now. At the same time, large numbers of politicians depend on the FIGs to finance their campaigns and to deploy media assets in support of their combined interests. Both sides benefit from their ability to influence the judicial system. ‘Shadow state’ is perhaps a more accurate description of such a model in which institutions are co-opted and subverted rather than ‘captured’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pernicious fusion of interests on the part of big business and a ‘service’ class creates systema. While its effects are visible in Ukraine’s poor economic performance for much of the period since independence, and in its disturbingly high levels of inequality, much of the fabric of systema is non-transparent and lives in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine typifies what some social scientists describe as a ‘limited access order’, in which a ruling class artificially restricts political and economic competition to amass wealth and protect itself. Since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, systema’s stakeholders have shown their ability to continue to manipulate public institutions not just in the face of the deepest set of reforms undertaken since independence, but also in conditions of war. Putting their own interests before those of society, they have shown their determination to allow as little change as possible to the functioning of systema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have sustained an economic model of rent seeking that prevents the creation of a level playing field by granting benefits to some companies over others. Not only does a system of this kind allocate resources inefficiently and in ways that do not benefit society, it increases economic costs by reducing competition. A further damaging side effect is the co-optation by its participants of the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to safeguard their assets and revenue streams as well as to ensure their immunity from prosecution. Over the years, this has limited possibilities for reforming the police, the security services, the Prosecutor’s Office and the judiciary. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Ukraine continues to score poorly in the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index. In 2020, it ranked 72nd overall out of 128 countries and jurisdictions assessed – albeit six places higher than the previous year. However, it ranked 110th in the category ‘absence of corruption’, and 90th in ‘criminal justice’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subversion of the legal system also creates possibilities for organized crime to operate alongside business. The problem deepened under Viktor Yanukovych’s presidency in 2010–14: mafia structures in Donbas colluded with government agencies, including the Security Service. There is no evidence to suggest that the problem of organized crime in Ukraine has diminished. It is part of a deeply rooted social culture that goes back to the 19th century, materializing in the form of a brotherhood of ‘thieves’ with its own laws and morals. The revolutionary environment of 2014 and its aftermath created increased opportunities for organized crime, particularly people-trafficking and drug-smuggling, as the new authorities focused on containing the uprising in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of systema is reflected in the concentration of economic assets. According to 2015 data, politically connected businesses accounting for less than 1 per cent of companies in Ukraine owned more than 25 per cent of all assets and accessed over 20 per cent of debt financing. In the capital-intensive mining, energy and transport sectors, politically connected businesses accounted for over 40 per cent of turnover and 50 per cent of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;According to 2015 data, politically connected businesses accounting for less than 1 per cent of companies in Ukraine owned more than 25 per cent of all assets and accessed over 20 per cent of debt financing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the second half of the 1990s, when systema originally took root under President Leonid Kuchma, these businesses have used their political relationships to pursue a wide range of rent-seeking opportunities, including rigged public procurement tenders and privileged access to state aid, tax benefits, soft loans and debt guarantees from state banks. Several of these practices have continued since 2014 despite the closure of some of the largest schemes, notably in the banking, energy and healthcare sectors. However, political influence still translates into the capacity to gain business advantage by encouraging monopolistic practices. This is particularly visible in the energy industry. It is no coincidence, for example, that Ukraine ranked 128th out of 190 countries for ‘getting electricity’ in the World Bank’s 2020 Ease of Doing Business rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema has proved particularly hard to dislodge because it rests on a firm alignment of interests between big business and the political class in favour of rent seeking over wealth creation for the public good. Across the state sector at different levels, it has spawned an extensive supporting structure of beneficiaries that service those interests. Including dependents, this interest group comprises millions of people. This translates into a sizeable constituency in Ukrainian society that wishes to preserve this model and sees danger in reforms that could undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear to what extent President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team have ever felt able to disrupt systema in order to achieve their declared goals of rapid economic growth and reduced levels of corruption. On the face of it, Zelenskyy’s election mandate in 2019 gave him an unprecedented opportunity to use his popularity and his parliamentary majority, based on first-term MPs, to start developing a new model of governance – one that prioritizes society’s interests over those of the ruling class. However, his performance so far, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, suggests that he cannot govern without systema and will bow to its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of significant developments in 2020 pointed to the renewed influence of interest groups opposed to changing the established rules of the game. First, in March 2020, was the dismissal of the government of prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, followed, a day later, by the removal from office of the reformist prosecutor-general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka. Then, in April, came the Constitutional Court’s blocking of judicial reforms, and a ruling by the same court, in October, that effectively paralysed the work of the National Agency for Corruption Prevention. Evidently, the Revolution of Dignity did not bring about the dismantling of these old networks, which also oppose Western influence on the reform agenda and, in some cases, propagate anti-Western disinformation. In the case of the Constitutional Court, four of the 15 sitting judges in October 2020 were holdovers from the Yanukovych era who had taken up their positions before the start of post-revolutionary judicial reform and the adoption of a new anti-corruption strategy. Those appointed later were part of the same ‘judicial corporation’, with its own interests and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper shows how Ukraine’s systema remains in place across the main sectors of the economy, and identifies the main mechanisms of control that enable its stakeholders to preserve their privileges and divert public resources. It also considers the factors that may change the behaviour of systema’s participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis deliberately avoids the terms ‘oligarchs’ and ‘undue influence’, as both mischaracterize the underlying governance problem facing Ukraine. One challenge for reformist forces is to develop a new vocabulary in Ukrainian and English that will more accurately describe certain features of systema and the obstacles to reducing its influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is not an oligarchy in the classic sense because it is not ruled by a small group of individuals. As noted above, while the owners of the largest business groups hold considerable sway over aspects of economic policy, they depend on a wider group of government officials, members of parliament, policy experts and managers of state companies to exercise their power. Some among this ‘service class’ are direct representatives of FIGs, but the majority are not. They have their own interests and influence channels. Competing regional interests further complicate the picture. Thus, to this extent, power is shared. Adopting policies requires consensus building and trading of positions with individuals that these business owners do not always directly control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Undue influence’ is a misnomer for two reasons. First, the main stakeholders are more than just influencers. They are often actors in their own right, as systema allows them to participate directly in decision-making on state policy outside formal institutions. Zelenskyy’s request, in March 2020, to leading businesses to support the government’s efforts to tackle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of how this can happen openly. Poroshenko’s appointment of two leading businessmen, Igor Kolomoisky and Serhiy Taruta, in 2014 to run southeastern regions is another. Second, Ukraine’s system of governance has not yet evolved to the point at which it is possible to describe key stakeholders’ influence as ‘undue’ or excessive. In a limited access order, this is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systemas-four-pillars&quot;&gt;Systema’s Four Pillars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite their privileges, the companies controlled by the Ukraine’s major financial-industrial groups – the primary stakeholders in systema – are less productive and slower to increase growth and create jobs than are non-politically connected companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four pillars support systema in Ukraine and provide it with considerable stability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep penetration of government decision-making processes via senior officials who favour the interests of big business and benefit from these connections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence over the legislative process including through paid-for support of MPs who either have direct business interests or stand to benefit indirectly from their support of the business interests of others;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence over the judiciary and law enforcement agencies through the appointment of loyal individuals, as well as the use of bribery and other incentives to protect systema’s interests; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Control of the media through ownership of the main outlets that provide a platform for selected politicians to develop their careers and for big business to shape public opinion in systema’s favour, including by attacking those who stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6y9eoij.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1. The four pillars supporting systema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major FIGs in Ukraine have dominated the economy over the past two decades through their ownership of vertically integrated businesses across multiple sectors, including agriculture, banking, energy production and transmission, media, mining and steel. These are systema’s primary stakeholders. Despite their privileges, the companies controlled by the FIGs are less productive and slower to increase growth and create jobs than are non-politically connected companies. Preservation of this model has depended on keeping a large section of the economy in state hands. This has allowed the stakeholders to benefit either by managing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to extract gain through preferences granted to them by the state, or by working closely with SOEs to do so. Not surprisingly, corporate governance reform has held little appeal for these groups, while privatization has advanced at a snail’s pace, and discriminatory conditions have often excluded foreign investors. Three decades on from the collapse of the Soviet economy, Ukraine still has around 3,700 SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the notable exceptions of PrivatBank and the national oil and gas company Naftogaz, the business operations of the FIGs have proved sustainable, despite the costs to society, because they have continued to create value for their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs compete with one another for influence and access to rents, but have a strong motivation to coexist according to a set of informal rules. The Yanukovych ‘clan’ violated these rules in its dash to place rent seeking under its centralized control. In the process, it destabilized systema and forfeited the support of other players who concluded that they were better off without it despite the disruption of revolution. Some were quick to find their balance again in the post-revolution world in which systema still held sway, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinat Akhmetov, one of Ukraine’s wealthiest business figures, was able to find an accommodation with President Poroshenko after 2014 that allowed him to rebuild his business after suffering serious losses because of the conflict in Donbas. His business interests do not appear to have suffered under Zelenskyy’s presidency, and his television channels have shown the president in a positive light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Akhmetov’s rivals at the top table of business owners, initially allied himself with the Poroshenko administration, and as governor of Dnipropetrovsk region he played a key role in 2014 in mobilizing resistance against Russian efforts to destabilize southeastern Ukraine. He left the country following a rift with Poroshenko, only to make a triumphant return after Zelenskyy’s election, determined to contest the nationalization of PrivatBank, the centrepiece of his business empire, that had taken place under the Poroshenko administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts were quick to point to the influence of the major FIGs in the parliament that was elected in 2019. Volodymyr Fesenko, one of Ukraine’s top political commentators, noted in September of that year that Kolomoisky could count on the support of up to 30 MPs, Dmytro Firtash, a prominent player in the energy and chemicals sectors on 15, and Akhmetov on six. It is widely believed in Kyiv that Akhmetov’s direct influence on the government has increased since the 2019 elections, even if he controls far fewer votes in parliament. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal previously held a senior position at Akhmetov’s energy company DTEK, while Olha Buslavets, the acting energy minister from April–November 2020, had a professional background in Donetsk’s coal industry, which is dominated by Akhmetov. She denied reports of having ties to DTEK. Meanwhile, the influence of Firtash appears to have waned, as demonstrated by the recent decision of Ukraine’s Security and Defence Council to impose sanctions against him. Kolomoisky’s influence in parliament may have diminished in recent months, after the US authorities imposed sanctions, in January 2021, on his close associate in parliament Oleksandr Dubinsky. The earlier fracturing of Zelenskyy’s parliamentary majority had allowed Kolomoisky to control closer to 40 votes from the Servant of the People party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below these top-level FIGs are smaller groups that operate according to the same principles of rent seeking, but whose owners are not as visible and as networked in politics at the national level. They tend to have a local presence and to own local media outlets. Some of the bigger players in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries fit into this category. Similarly, the biggest beneficiaries of Ukraine’s unreformed customs system, for example, are lower-level companies that avoid paying taxes through smuggling. They use some of the same mechanisms as the entities involved in large-scale rent seeking: penetration of the government system, including through collusion with law enforcement bodies, support in parliament, and use of the media to attack reformers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systemas-structure&quot;&gt;Systema’s Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The striking feature of Ukraine’s systema is the depth of its penetration and replication in national and regional decision-making processes and within the bureaucracies that implement decisions across the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rent-seeking machinery in Ukraine operates at three levels. At the top, big business takes the largest cut. In the middle, systema’s enablers such as senior to mid-level government officials, MPs and managers of state-owned enterprises receive rewards from above and below as the largest and smallest players pay their dues. At the bottom are the low- to mid-level officials who collect bribes. They keep a portion for themselves but pass the greater part to their superiors. This is consistent with equivalent models of systema around the world. However, the striking feature of the Ukrainian version is the depth of its penetration in the national decision-making process and within the bureaucracy that implements decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema’s structures are in place not just in Kyiv. Across the country, the same operating principles are replicated at regional level for the benefit of powerful local elites and their accomplices in regional governments and councils. This can sometimes mean that cities and regional administrations, because of their political power, are able to defy the authority of national agencies. This has been evident during the COVID-19 crisis, when some cities have chosen not to comply with restrictions issued by the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema’s regional dimension gives it considerable additional stability through a hierarchy of interest groups below the biggest FIGs at the top. The decentralization reform begun after 2014 has strengthened regional and local elites. As the local elections in November 2020 showed, in Kharkiv and Odesa especially but in other major cities as well, mayors have built power bases that rest on their popularity as local leaders rather than on the appeal of national parties. The mayors of Kharkiv and Odesa have significant business interests. At lower administrative levels, the combination of political connections and wealth can also lead to local interests buying influence in regional centres and in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivations of the largest business owners often come into conflict over the distribution of rents, but such disagreements have not proved sufficiently disruptive to threaten systema’s foundations. These key business figures share an interest in having a common set of red lines that determine the level of reforms they are prepared to accept. Even if they find themselves marginalized or excluded, they seek a way back into systema rather than trying to transform it. Most know that their businesses would struggle to survive, let alone prosper, in a non-rent-seeking environment, and that they could not easily protect themselves in a law-governed state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this convergence of interests among FIGs are clearly visible in the form of a vicious circle of restricted competition in Ukraine’s politics and its economy, which results in permanently weak institutions, poor legislation and the absence of rule of law. Inevitably, this feeds corrupt practices at all levels, which provide the lubrication to keep systema’s wheels turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema succeeds in being self-sustaining because it keeps the barrier for entry into top-level politics particularly high for independent actors. This is partly due to Ukrainian politics being a competition of money rather than of ideas. For example, with no cap on campaign finance, only political actors with high levels of monetary support could compete in the 2019 presidential election. Indeed, according to the Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law, a Ukrainian NGO, the three highest-polling candidates each spent between $5 million and $21 million, mostly on TV advertising. By comparison, in Poland, where GDP per head is almost four times higher, campaign spending by candidates in the presidential election of 2015 together amounted to some $4.8 million. The high levels of election spending in Ukraine are partly attributable to the fact that campaigns start earlier than officially permitted, as well as the fact that there are no restrictions on campaign spending. A further problem that restricts competition is that under the current rules, political parties can hide their sources of financing by using intermediaries. At the same time, they do minimal public fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming a limited access order into an open access order typically takes decades, because of the complexity of changing the calculus of the main players while simultaneously nurturing independent institutions. In the case of Ukraine, however, the evidence of the past six years points to two contradictory patterns of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, despite the exigencies of the armed conflict with Russia, which have revealed many of the country’s weaknesses, there is still no consensus within Ukraine’s ruling class about the need to change the way it is governed. Instead, the main FIGs have continued to compete for influence: Kolomoisky returned to Ukraine in 2019 on the eve of the presidential election; Viktor Medvedchuk (who was President Kuchma’s chief of staff) and Poroshenko were re-elected to parliament – although in May 2021 Medvedchuk was charged with high treason and placed under house arrest; and Akhmetov is once again in favour in the President’s Office. Even so, some reforms supported by Western countries have dramatically reduced certain opportunities for rent seeking and undercut the interests of some of systema’s beneficiaries. The IMF’s insistence on making financial assistance dependent on enacting specific anti-corruption reforms and other measures, including judicial reform, threatens to change the status quo irreversibly to the disadvantage of systema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while these reforms remain incomplete, and there have been increasing signs that parts of systema have seen Zelenskyy’s presidency as an opportunity to recover ground lost during the Poroshenko years, that a president was chosen from outside the elite group demonstrates a striking rejection of the status quo by the electorate. This represents the most powerful challenge to systema over the past 20 years, one that it has moved fast to interrupt by replacing a reformist government and trying to upend the anti-corruption reforms begun after 2014. To function effectively, however, systema requires political leadership that is accepted by society. The dramatic fall in Zelenskyy’s approval ratings between mid-2019 and early 2020, subsequently magnified by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, carries dangers for systema’s main players. Zelenskyy’s reduced popularity could easily translate into a loss of authority and trigger new elections – although at the time of writing there was growing speculation that he may seek to run for a second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IMF’s insistence on making financial assistance dependent on enacting specific anti-corruption reforms and other measures, including judicial reform, threatens to change the status quo irreversibly to the disadvantage of systema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, there is no single body of research available in or outside Ukraine on how systema maintains its grip on power, let alone any detailed prescriptions for how to reduce or break it. The research conducted so far has tended to focus on specific individuals and their businesses, rather than on systema as a whole. The issue defies easy analysis because the numerous networks in operation extend across different economic sectors, and they reach deep within the machinery of the state and influence public opinion via different channels. It is easier to feel the presence of these networks than to see them because they are not just hidden, they are also fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how systema functions, the chapter that follows identifies the structure of ownership in four main sectors of the economy – banking, energy, transport and healthcare – and the mechanisms of influence used by the principal players in each to protect and advance their interests. They show a consistent pattern of influence that derives from the pillars on which systema rests. The ability to control the legislative process, deploy media and law enforcement tools, and rely on an amenable government system to implement decisions is clearly visible. However, the example of land reform – an issue that is particularly sensitive for the public, and which is supported by Ukraine’s international partners – suggests that sectors where the largest FIGs are not present are less susceptible to systema’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systema-in-the-banking-energy-transport-and-healthcare-sectors&quot;&gt;Systema in the Banking, Energy, Transport and Healthcare Sectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ability of big business to control the legislative process, deploy media and law enforcement tools, and rely on an amenable government system to implement decisions is clearly visible across multiple economic sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banking&quot;&gt;Banking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-owned institutions today account for around 60 per cent of Ukraine’s banking sector assets. PrivatBank, Oschadbank and Ukreximbank are the biggest, with combined assets exceeding UAH 1 trillion. Close to 20 banks with foreign ownership have combined total assets of over UAH 500 billion, followed by nearly 50 domestically owned banks with total assets worth around UAH 250 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clean-up of the banking sector after 2014, by a reformist team at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), was far-reaching, and ended a large number of the extensive schemes associated with related-party lending that had operated for many years. Around 100 banks, most now closed, stand accused of siphoning abroad a total of $15 billion of taxpayers’ money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorities have so far put little effort into recovering these and other funds stolen from the state during the Yanukovych years, and there is evidence to show that parts of systema succeeded in obstructing attempts to do so. Under the Poroshenko administration, not only did the Prosecutor General’s Office fail to take appropriate action; the Deposit Guarantee Fund also dragged its feet, despite its power to initiate civil proceedings against individuals responsible for losses to banks. The president nominates the heads of both agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrivatBank provides a particularly good example of residual resistance to reforms. It was nationalized in 2016, after the discovery of a $5.5 billion hole in its balance sheet. Its former owners started an unprecedented legal campaign to challenge the nationalization in the courts, initiating hundreds of cases and threatening the credibility of banking sector reform as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBU’s assault on many of the old schemes for misappropriating public money has met with resistance not just from the former owners of PrivatBank. Parliament’s initial hesitation in 2018 in adopting IMF-backed legislation to establish independent supervisory boards for state banks reportedly demonstrated the power of some of the biggest holders of non-performing loans. These actors were able to lobby parliament from within because they were also sitting MPs. The legislation was, however, eventually approved in July 2018. Subsequently, in early 2020, a small group of MPs tabled 16,000 amendments to a draft law on banking insolvency that was required by the IMF as a condition for future lending. This was clear evidence of the influence of external interest groups that wanted to block legislation intended to prevent the former owners of insolvent banks from regaining control of them. However, the urgent need for IMF support because of the economic problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic undermined their campaign. Parliament passed the legislation, and Zelenskyy signed it into law in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign against the NBU’s management in late 2019 and early 2020, and the highly personal targeting of former governor Valeria Hontareva, are reminders that some of the opponents of banking reform are prepared to go to extreme lengths to protect their interests. The listing of Hontareva as a suspect in a criminal case ostensibly unconnected with PrivatBank raises suspicions about manipulation of the legal process. Media owned by Kolomoisky and others have played an important role in depicting the NBU as acting against Ukraine’s interests. The NBU issued a statement in November 2019 that held Kolomoisky responsible for attacks on its reputation, including alleged paid-for demonstrations outside its building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2020 Zelenskyy forced the resignation of Yakov Smolii as NBU governor. After leaving his position, Smolii referred to ‘systematic political pressure’ on the bank, and did not rule out a coincidence of interest between the President’s Office and Kolomoisky. He said that the President’s Office wanted to replace the NBU’s leadership with people it could control. Smolii’s resignation came shortly after Ukraine had received the first tranche of a new $5 billion IMF stand-by arrangement. A key condition for continued IMF support was the independence of the NBU, and the IMF had made it clear that it held Smolii and his team in high regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector has been the source of the largest rents in Ukraine over the past nearly three decades. For this reason, energy companies form the foundation of the business empires of many of the country’s wealthiest business figures. For example, Rinat Akhmetov remains the biggest player in the coal industry. In 2017, his company DTEK accounted for 86 per cent of Ukraine’s total production of 28 million tonnes of thermal coal. Akhmetov also has interests in the production of gas and renewables, as well as in electricity production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major FIGs exercised powerful influence over the energy industry from the time of the Kuchma presidency (1994–2005) until 2014 – particularly over arrangements for the supply of gas, which favoured imported gas from Russia over domestic production. Illegal arbitrage schemes exploiting the difference between subsidized gas prices for households and market prices for industry were a source of enrichment for large sections of the ruling class. Gas traders ‘captured’ the national regulator to create this differential. Such practices not only distorted the gas market and discouraged households from restricting consumption; they also had profound national security implications by creating a dangerous dependency on Russian gas. By 2014, Naftogaz had amassed a deficit equivalent to 5.7 per cent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gravity of the situation brought about the most serious reversal of a FIG’s influence seen so far. The reforms undertaken at Naftogaz led to the cessation of gas supplies from Russia, the removal of the previous arbitrage margins and a dramatic improvement, through corporate governance reforms, in the transparency of the company’s dealings. By common consent, the biggest loser of these reforms was Dmytro Firtash, who not only no longer had access to cheap Russian gas but also could no longer profit from the arbitrage business. Even so, he retained control of most of Ukraine’s regional gas companies, a part of the sector still considered highly opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if Firtash could no longer shape the gas sector to the same extent as before, another group was able to dictate policy in the coal and electricity sectors. In 2016, the National Energy Regulatory Commission (NERC) took the controversial decision to set wholesale electricity prices at levels favouring domestic coal producers, following the ‘Rotterdam +’ formula that favoured Akhmetov’s DTEK. Commentators viewed this as the product of a reconciliation between Akhmetov and President Poroshenko, after a deterioration in relations between the two following the Revolution of Dignity. In return for NERC’s decision, it seems that Akhmetov offered Poroshenko the support of MPs loyal to him. Akhmetov’s main business partner, Vadim Novinsky, and several of the senior managers in his companies entered parliament in 2014 as representatives of Opposition Bloc, a remnant of Yanukovych’s Party of the Regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretariat of the Energy Community was scathing in its 2018 review of the NERC’s performance, noting that its members were apparently ‘under the pressure of certain political and business groups which actually influence the outcome of the decisions’. The resignations of several members of the NERC after Zelenskyy became president reportedly took place under political pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is still too early to say whether the NERC will function differently with its changed membership, it seems likely that the same lobbying tactics on the part of the FIGs will continue. The core problem that weakens the possibility for independent regulation is a shortage of expertise and the absence a cadre of specialists who can stand up to business interests. This is particularly visible in the Ministry of Energy and Environmental Protection and in parliament’s Energy and Utilities Committee. The greatest energy expertise is not in the public sector; instead, it is in the FIGs, where salaries are much higher and there are better opportunities for professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planned efforts to de-monopolize household gas supply, for example, are likely to run up against Firtash’s interests. As he demonstrated after 2014, he was able to deploy powerful lobbying capacity to protect his businesses. The embargoes on fertilizers produced in Russia helped his company Ostchem to reinforce its monopoly on the domestic market. The cessation of imports from Russia disadvantaged Ukrainian farmers by denying them access to cheaper fertilizer supplies. However, Zelenskyy’s imposition of sanctions on Firtash in late June 2021 suggested that his position had weakened significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core problem that weakens the possibility for independent regulation is a shortage of expertise and the absence a cadre of specialists who can stand up to business interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If necessary, the FIGs are also able to use the media to support their position against the government, as well as funding friendly trade associations or Ukrainian and foreign think-tanks. They have also successfully used the courts in the past to challenge NERC decisions on tariffs. There has been speculation, too, that the blocking of efforts by the Honcharuk government to change the management of Centrenergo and three regional energy companies was a key factor in its dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2020, there was significant political pressure on Naftogaz and the gas transmission system operator that was unbundled at the beginning of the year. The deep reforms of the gas sector to cut energy dependence on Russia and align Ukraine’s gas market with the free-market principles enshrined in EU energy legislation have helped the country to integrate rapidly into a wider EU market, but they have not been popular in some quarters in Ukraine. In May of that year, 47 MPs from former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko’s Fatherland party and Medvedchuk’s Russia-friendly Opposition Platform – For Life jointly called on the Constitutional Court to examine the legality of the unbundling of the transmission system. The government’s decision, in January 2021, to regulate household gas prices for the rest of the heating season may have had an economic justification to limit continued price-gouging by companies associated with Firtash that control 75 per cent of the retail gas market. Yet among the supporters of the government’s move were forces hostile to Western-style reforms and thus happy to damage Ukraine’s relations with the IMF. The fund had previously insisted on Ukraine raising domestic gas prices to market levels as a condition for its continued support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transport&quot;&gt;Transport&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transport sector is largely state-owned, but provides a stark example of how the interests of major FIGs can distort an SOE’s functioning for their own purposes. Direct losses to the sector from FIG-led schemes amount to an estimated $5 billion per year. Exceptionally, Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) is a private company, owned by offshore entities affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence over pricing mechanisms for use of the transport system are crucial for the FIGs that operate commodity-producing businesses. This is particularly visible in the case of the railways. The cheapest and most efficient means of transporting bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore, steel, corn, wheat and sunflower oil is by rail, in part because of the unsatisfactory quality of roads. However, the FIGs’ strategy of driving down costs for rail use has left the railways in a deplorable state. Poorly maintained infrastructure and a shortage of rolling stock, particularly locomotives, have created costly bottlenecks for the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGs have succeeded in keeping in place a system of tariffs established in the 1960s that makes it cheaper to transport raw materials than finished goods. As a result of hryvnia depreciation, tariffs are 10 times lower than their equivalents in Poland or Hungary. According to one analysis, the main beneficiaries of the tariffs are SCM (owned by Rinat Akhmetov) and Ferrexpo (owned by Kostyantin Zhevago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs have also profited from their participation in tenders to supply goods, fuel and maintenance services to Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia). For example, Akhmetov’s Metinvest supplies rails, while Viktor Pinchuk’s Interpipe is a supplier of wheels for locomotives and rail cars. Companies connected with Petro Poroshenko and his associate Ihor Kononenko have supplied fuel. In some cases, business interests have hijacked certification procedures within Ukrzaliznytsia to allow only purchases from monopoly suppliers. A company connected with Yaroslav Dubnevych, the former chairman of parliament’s Transport Committee is alleged to have supplied components to Ukrzaliznytsia at inflated prices. In October 2019 parliament revoked Dubnevych’s parliamentary immunity, and prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of stealing UAH 93 million through corrupt procurement schemes. He was later released on bail. In April 2020, the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office reported that it was filing charges against Dubnevych and forwarding the case to the High Anti-Corruption Court for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGs also exercise influence over the operations of the 13 seaports managed by the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority (USPA) to obtain logistical and other advantages, including customs privileges. The ports are vitally important to these groups for their exports of metals and grain as well as imports of coal and oil products. Access to limited port capacity is a key issue. One analysis notes that the FIGs influence port operations through the law enforcement agencies, MPs and the top management of the USPA. An indication of the latter is that, in 2018, 11 of 13 heads of seaports were ‘acting’ rather than permanent appointments. This is a mechanism used in other areas such as customs to induce officials, concerned for their job security, to be more receptive to certain interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aviation sector, Kolomoisky exercises influence through appointees in the management of Kyiv’s Boryspil airport. As a result, UIA reportedly benefits from privileged conditions there. Although Kolomoisky’s lobbying of the government and legal action were not sufficient to prevent the entry of the low-cost carrier Ryanair into the market, before the COVID-19 crisis his oil products business had benefited from the growth of demand for aviation fuel. Around 30 per cent of the volumes supplied in Ukraine came from Kolomoisky’s Kremenchug refinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the road-building sector, there are strong suspicions that the interests of FIGs influence decisions at the state agency Ukravtodor to favour their businesses by determining which roads should be built, the routes these should take, and which roads should be prioritized for repair. In addition, according to one report, in 2018 and 2019, three companies won one-third of all contracts from Ukravtodvor, one of them allegedly connected with the mayor of Odesa, Hennady Trukhanov, who has been subject to multiple investigations by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau related to suspected embezzlement of state property, money laundering and other offences. None of these has so far resulted in a criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;healthcare&quot;&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The healthcare market is competitive, with no single company accounting for more than 6 per cent. The largest FIGs are absent from the sector. The owners of healthcare companies are often significant donors to political parties, and have their representatives in parliament’s Public Health Committee. The pharmaceutical sector as a whole accounted for only 1 per cent of GDP in 2018, according to NBU data. This almost certainly explains why it is not a sector that is attractive to the main FIGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2015, manipulation of the tendering process through collusion between government officials and companies supplying equipment and medicines led to purchases at vastly inflated prices. The two sides shared the proceeds. In some cases the prices were two to three times higher than those paid for the same medicines in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one 2017 estimate, 40 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s spending on procurement of medicines was ‘black cash’. In 2014, six companies, four of them controlled by the same person, supplied 95 per cent of the drugs for treating AIDS, cancer, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Under the leadership of Ulana Suprun as acting minister from 2016 to 2019, the Ministry of Health succeeded in closing down much of the space for these practices by outsourcing the procurement of medicines to international specialists. Manipulation of the process for registering medicines produced abroad in favour of domestic manufacturers and distributors was another major problem confronting Suprun’s team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlash from the interest groups that lost out because of the removal of these schemes was immediate and sustained. Representatives of the Accounting Chamber visited the Ministry of Health on several occasions to investigate the new procurement process. Government agencies suddenly also showed an interest, including the Security Service, the Prosecutor General’s Office and the National Police. Parliament’s Public Health Committee contained several individuals who were on the payroll of pharmaceutical companies. Glib Zahoriy, the owner of one of the largest such companies, Darnitsa, was an MP from Poroshenko’s party. He lobbied against changes to the procurement process in parliament and tried unsuccessfully to appoint a close associate to head the State Expert Centre that was responsible for registering medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there were intense media attacks on Suprun and her team as well as efforts using the Prosecutor General’s Office to intimidate two prominent health reform NGOs by opening criminal cases against them for alleged mismanagement of foreign grants. In February 2019, a Kyiv court instructed the State Bureau of Investigations to open a criminal case against Suprun for interfering in the work of the court. She has said that at one point, her team faced up to 20 court appearances a week that was part of an effort to waste their time and slow down the reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current chairman of parliament’s Public Health Committee is Mykhaylo Radutsky, the former owner of the Boris network clinics, who was elected on the Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People list. Due to his close relationship with the president, he reportedly received carte blanche from the President’s Office to reform the health service. According to some sources, Radutsky was in effect running the Ministry of Health at the beginning of 2020. In addition, an alliance of pharmaceutical companies and distributors lobbied the government not to extend the system for outsourcing procurement of medicines to international agencies that was due to end in 2020. Their efforts failed as a result of a dispute between the Ministry of Health and its own procurement agency that required the government to call again on the services of international partners at the beginning of 2021, amid urgent efforts to procure vaccines against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s procurement practices during the COVID-19 pandemic point to efforts to bypass the Prozorro electronic auctions system to purchase protective equipment for medical staff. This has resulted in the state paying more than double the cost than in other countries for equipment meeting the same quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Zelenskyy convened a meeting in March 2020 with the country’s leading business owners and demanded their financial assistance and other support in providing urgently needed medical supplies. This was recognition that the government had neither the financial nor the organizational resources to manage the crisis on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agriculture-a-counterexample&quot;&gt;Agriculture: A Counterexample&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite the size and influence of Ukraine’s major agro-holdings, the politically sensitive issue of land reform has exposed some of their weaknesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is an exceptional case in Ukraine, in that it is a large sector of the economy not controlled by the top-tier business interests that dominate sectors such as banking, energy, metals and transport. Agricultural lands used for commercial farming are held by private individuals in the form of communal property. Commercial farmers lease these and operate at the level of large agro-holdings, mid-sized farms and small farms, with around 50,000 legally registered entities active in the agricultural sector. In addition, there are an estimated 1–4 million unregistered small farms cultivating around a third to half of the country’s arable land (up to 20 million hectares). These have no access to state subsidies or bank finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of successive governments to permit the free purchase and sale of agricultural land has favoured the development of large agro-holdings controlling 50,000 hectares and more in the absence of a legal limit on the amount of land they can lease. Some have been able to secure access to land on decades-long leases. Even though the agro-holdings control less than 25 per cent of Ukraine’s agricultural lands, they have exercised decisive influence on legislation, market rules and lease prices, as well on prices for commodities and equipment. These companies include Astarta, Kernel, MHP, Salic (formerly Mriya) and UkrLandFarming. Typically, companies of this size have strong relationships with regional authorities because of their importance as employers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sector blighted by ‘corporate raiding’, the big companies have their own security guards but often work closely with local law enforcement agencies to protect their assets – and in some cases to increase their land holdings by using various tactics to put other farmers out of business. At the national level, they also have significant lobbying capacity. One of the best-known examples is that of Vitaly Khomutynnik, a shareholder in Kernel and a member of parliament’s Tax Committee at the time when, in 2018, it pushed through VAT legislation favouring Kernel and other companies in the oilseed-crushing business. The founder of Kernel, Andriy Verevsky, was an MP for over 10 years up to 2013, and served on parliament’s Agriculture Committee until forced to step down because of a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a sector blighted by ‘corporate raiding’, the big companies have their own security guards but often work closely with local law enforcement agencies to protect their assets – and in some cases to increase their land holdings by using various tactics to put other farmers out of business.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the size and influence of the agro-holdings, the issue of land reform has exposed some of their weaknesses. This became clear after the IMF signalled that ending the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land would be a precondition for a new support programme. Up to that point, the large agro-holdings were happy with the status quo, and in some cases actively discouraged reform, sometimes using the media to harness public support. Oleksii Mushak, Verevsky’s cousin and the then prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk’s adviser on land reform, was an advocate of the most liberal version of the law to allow foreign ownership of land, a provision that favoured large companies such as Kernel because of their ownership structure. Faced with a popular backlash against concentrated ownership of land, including by foreign entities, the government was forced to retreat. It ultimately proposed a version of the law that favoured the interests of the operators of small farms (up to 100 hectares) over the biggest companies. Parliament adopted a new version of the bill in a second reading without revisions of substance and Zelenskyy signed it into law. Some observers consider that the government chose to disregard the lobbying of big business because of the sensitivity of the issue with the public and fear that it could have a negative impact on upcoming local elections. Others point to the risk that some of the large companies may succeed in persuading lessors that they are better off leasing land than selling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The land reform issue is an important example of how dominant business interests were unable to win the day in a sector in which the biggest FIGs, with their lobbying and media tools, are absent. Although the law adopted is not as liberal as some reformers had hoped, the pressure of the IMF and the strength of public feeling proved more important for the government than any gains it may have received by supporting the position of the agro-holdings. Ultimately, these business groups do not command the same level of authority as the main FIGs which – with their representatives in government and parliament as well as their media channels – have far greater resources to influence decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-place-of-the-media-in-systema&quot;&gt;The Place of the Media in Systema&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The financial-industrial groups’ dominance of Ukraine’s main media outlets – and their ability to subsidize their losses – ‘captures’ politicians who rely on media access to develop the profile needed to win votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of the mainstream media is critically important for the biggest stakeholders in systema because of its political power. The largest FIGs are the dominant players in the media market. Four groups own the 15 most popular nationwide television channels, as well as the most popular newspapers, radio stations, regional TV channels and internet media sources. They are StarLight Media (owned by Viktor Pinchuk), Media Group Ukraine (owned by Rinat Akhmetov), 1+1 Media (owned by Ihor Kolomoisky, Viktor Medvedchuk and Ihor Surkis), Inter Media Group (owned by Dmytro Firtash, Valeriy Khoroshkovskii and Serhiy Lyovochkin). According to one estimate, these groups together reach over 75 per cent of Ukraine’s TV audience. Ownership in the sector has experienced a remarkable degree of stability over the past decade. During this time, the top 10 media owners (by size of audience) have remained almost unchanged. This is a powerful indicator of systema’s durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs’ ownership of the main media outlets and their ability to subsidize their losses – for example, Inter lost $70 million in 2012 – ‘captures’ politicians who rely on media access to develop the profile required to attract voters. This relationship leads to inevitable politicization of media coverage, particularly during election campaigns, and provides a platform to challenge unwelcome reform efforts. Elected politicians also seek to use media to maintain voters’ trust. Political advertising, especially on TV, consumes a large part of campaign budgets because of its perceived effectiveness, and contributes to a distortion of the media market in favour of FIGs’ interests. There are currently no restrictions on campaign spending on advertising. Media owners are also able to use their outlets to protect their businesses from competitors and politicians, particularly during pre-election campaigns when they can shape national news reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some regional centres, subsidiaries of the major FIGs or local business groups have stakes in local media and exercise influence over coverage in the same way as happens at national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspilne, the public broadcaster launched in 2015, is starting to make inroads into the audiences of FIG-controlled media as the quality of its programming has improved, but it cannot compete with their offering. There are signs, too, that it is suffering from political interference and underfunding that limit its effectiveness. Similarly, independent media are in no position to match the major channels’ ability to attract advertising for television and digital channels. FIGs also have a strong presence in the digital media sector, where they own three of the top 10 news websites (in terms of audience reach: obozrevatel.com, segodnya.ua and tsn.ua).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government regulation of the media remains open to political influence. The president and parliament appoint, by equal quotas, the members of the regulator, the National Council of Television and Radio Broadcasting. Similarly, the president nominates the head of the licensing body, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and parliament approves the appointment. The draft media law that has been under discussion in parliament since early 2020, and which had not yet had its first reading at the time of writing this paper, is the work of several individuals in government and parliament connected with media groups controlled by the FIGs. It is hardly surprising that the major media companies have no need to lobby against its provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the FIGs’ dominance of the major media channels remains unchallenged. Over time, a combination of regulatory changes, digital disruption, and the appearance of new channels and new models of media business may erode their influence. For example, increased transparency of ownership and funding of digital media, as envisaged by the draft law, could make it harder to use digital media for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dismantling Ukraine’s system of crony capitalism will require a combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to restrict corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema as whole in Ukraine has suffered setbacks since the Revolution of Dignity, but it still has considerable residual strength – and the ability to undo some of the most important achievements of the reforms undertaken since 2014. Its four pillars of support provide possibilities for using different mechanisms in different combinations and at different intensity to advance its interests. The greatest disruption to the interests of systema stakeholders has been in the banking, energy and healthcare sectors. Yet in all three cases, there are clear dangers of regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reformist forces have not yet achieved a final victory against the former owners of PrivatBank, as underlined by the resignation of the NBU governor in July 2020, and by the fact that the Constitutional Court is due to rule on the legality of the Deposit Guarantee Fund. This fund is responsible for liquidating insolvent bank assets. If its creation is ruled unconstitutional, this will call into question the entire clean-up of the banking sector during the Poroshenko years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest of the former deputy CEO of PrivatBank in February 2021, as he tried to flee the country, suggests that the net may be tightening around Ihor Kolomoisky and his associates, particularly as the US authorities imposed sanctions against Kolomoisky for ‘significant corruption’ shortly after. However, there are also serious concerns about the independence of the national gas transmission operator MGU and the oil and gas company Ukrnafta. There are fears, too, that corporate governance reform could further regress, particularly given the summary dismissal of the CEO of Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolev, in April 2021. To enable his removal from office, the government temporarily suspended the company’s supervisory board, all members of which subsequently resigned in protest at this blatant manoeuvre. The decision by Ukrnafta’s supervisory board, in May 2020, to cancel the process for the independent selection of a new CEO was also discouraging. Signs that the big players in the pharmaceutical industry are positioning themselves to reverse changes in the procurement system in their favour are a disturbing reminder of the institutional weakness of parts of government and their susceptibility to manipulation by narrow interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the agriculture sector appears to offer an example where reform in an area that is particularly sensitive for the public, and which is supported by Ukraine’s international partners, can limit the lobbying capacity of large companies. In this case, too, the IMF made its $8 billion loan package conditional on land reform, among other requirements. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the largest FIGs, and their lobbying capacity, are not present in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the stranglehold of the largest FIGs on the media remains the critical factor that preserves the fusion of business and political interests. For example, Zelenskyy could not have launched himself as a presidential candidate without Kolomoisky’s 1+1 channel showing his ‘Servant of the People’ series. At the same time, he and the government depend on favourable media coverage to maintain their authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reform of the judicial system and the law enforcement agencies has suffered significant difficulties, partly because of internal resistance and institutional capacity but mainly because of the interest of systema in maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reform of the judicial system and the law enforcement agencies has suffered significant difficulties.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Ukraine has shown that it has a very active and increasingly capable civil society, and that its population respects democratic values. The 2020 Ukraine in World Values Survey found that more citizens want a greater say in important government decisions today than was the case in 2011. At the same time, large shares of the population perceive state authorities (72.2 per cent) and civil service providers (67.1 per cent) as corrupt. This points to the resilience of systema. Critically, the electorate still has to confront the fundamental issue of why its leaders govern for the few, not the many. Civil society’s focus has been on addressing problems created by systema, and limiting its capacity in certain areas rather than on dismantling it. However, some parts of civil society are starting to consider the problem more broadly. Low standards of living, poor public services and stubbornly high levels of petty corruption are problems largely created by the overall model of governance and the incomplete state of reforms. Zelenskyy’s electoral success in 2019 and the election at that time of a large number of first-time MPs suggest that parts of society are genuinely seeking change. However, the lack of real political parties rooted in society and committed to deep reforms does not allow the translation of these aspirations into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine has enjoyed unprecedented attention and assistance from its Western allies. The EU and other major donors as well as international financial institutions (particularly the IMF, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped to launch important structural reforms by using their political leverage to impose conditionality. The EU has deployed many of the tools it has used successfully in Central Europe to promote good governance and the rule of law, as part of an overall process of political association and ‘legal approximation’ enshrined in the Association Agreement signed with Ukraine in 2014. Weak state capacity explains in part the limited progress on implementing the agreement, but there appear to be other reasons too. Efforts to improve the quality of regulations and their implementation by strengthening the regulatory authorities have, in some cases, been undermined because systema’s major players do not see the benefits and have the capacity to resist change through their influence on lawmaking and government decision-making. For example, despite long-standing efforts supported by the EU and other donors to give it teeth, the Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMCU) still requires further reform to enforce competition rules, including stronger safeguards to ensure its independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy appeared to side with systema in the spring of 2020 when he criticized the number of foreigners on supervisory boards of state companies, and in pushing for the resignation of the head of AMCU. Some observers have suggested that an alliance of forces associated with Kolomoisky and Medvedchuk as well as former prime minister Tymoshenko is working to reverse the progress made on corporate governance in state companies. Amos Hochstein, a US businessman, resigned from the supervisory board of Naftogaz in October 2020, alleging ‘sabotage’ of its good governance reforms by the government and ‘oligarchs’ seeking to enrich themselves. Shortly before this, the highly regarded Swedish economist and Eastern Europe expert Anders Åslund had similarly resigned from the supervisory board of the national railway company, claiming that the working conditions of supervisory board members had been made impossible, and that Zelenskyy and his ‘loud MPs’ do not believe in good corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By June 2021, however, after the Ukrainian authorities had introduced sanctions against Medvedchuk’s assets in February and placed him under house arrest on charges including treason, Zelenskyy felt sufficiently emboldened to table draft legislation to curb the influence of big business on politics and the economy. He threatened to hold a referendum on the issue if parliament failed to support the new law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of reining in systema goes much deeper than forcing the wealthiest businesspeople to declare their assets and disclose their contacts with officials as the draft law intends. Systema has left Ukraine with a serious lack of expertise in government that contributes to weak state capacity. The major FIGs attract and retain much of the best talent in the country, putting it to work to make governing institutions work for them. This imbalance is likely to take many years to correct. The EU’s considerable efforts to encourage public administration reform will inevitably take time to produce results because of the long-term nature of change programmes of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, efforts by Western donors to promote rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives through measures such as strengthening of regulatory bodies, judicial reform and the creation of new investigative and prosecutorial agencies, as well as the requirement for unprecedented levels of transparency of assets held by officials, have so far produced only modest results. This is not surprising, since the experience of transition in Central European countries has shown that reforms in these areas are typically met with strong resistance and require considerable effort over many years. However, there have also been clear examples of success on the anti-corruption front, including the cleaning up of Naftogaz and reforms in administrative services, banking, the patrol police, procurement and taxation. Decentralization has also created new opportunities for citizens to hold local authorities accountable for managing public resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of accountability for high-level corruption crimes in an effort to promote the rule of law, Ukraine’s international partners have placed heavy emphasis on establishing new anti-corruption bodies, including the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office have suffered from the absence of a properly functioning judicial system, and NABU has come under increasing political pressure from systema interests concerned about its investigations. Judicial reform conducted in parallel has encountered obstruction from within the judiciary itself. As a small ‘island’ surrounded by hostile systema interests, the anti-corruption infrastructure developed since 2014 is likely to face further efforts to limit its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk that some forces could try to use the anti-corruption infrastructure to conduct politically motivated investigations and prosecutions against rivals. It will be important for Ukraine’s international partners to monitor developments closely, and to step in if necessary to protect the independence of these institutions. The country has bitter experience of politicized justice from the Yanukovych years. Efforts by opponents to bring criminal charges against Poroshenko through the Prosecutor’s Office are an indication that this risk is real. Oversight by its international partners remains essential at this stage of the reforms when rule of law is weak and Ukraine has still to develop a set of reliable checks and balances for investigative and prosecutorial bodies to function without abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A vicious circle is at work: the largest FIGs have a clear interest in ensuring that they can continue to enjoy access to rents and limit competition, since most of them do not have another business model.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema has also retained the capacity to fight against measures designed to improve the law enforcement agencies and free the courts from external interference, because the reforms conducted so far in other areas have not weakened it at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms that have most heavily affected systema’s interests are those that have closed down major schemes for diverting public funds. In the case of the banking and gas sectors, there was a national security imperative to do so. The healthcare sector was different: a determined reform team at the Ministry of Health successfully faced down the pharmaceutical industry with the backing of Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman as well as Western governments and the international organizations that took over procurement of medicines and delivered huge savings. The owners of the pharmaceutical companies and distributors did not have the institutional strength at the time to cancel these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation of the electronic public procurement platform Prozorro, developed by civil society and reformers in government together with business, has helped to close down well-established corruption schemes that were prevalent in the Yanukovych era. Punitive measures are also a necessary means to deter corrupt practices and must accompany efforts to restrict the space for corruption, although they must not become a substitute for other efforts to reduce systema’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vicious circle is at work: the largest FIGs have a clear interest in ensuring that they can continue to enjoy access to rents and limit competition, since most of them do not have another business model. To do so, they have an incentive to remain politically connected and maintain control of the media to shape the political agenda and influence the execution of government policy. For their part, a large number of politicians and senior officials have an interest in continuing to benefit as the FIGs’ enablers. In turn, the layers of bureaucracy below them have a strong incentive to continue operating the machinery that keeps the system functioning because they receive income from the corruption that it spawns. Consequently, the instigators and enablers of rent seeking have an interest in limiting their accountability before the law. This clearly places a serious brake on judicial reform and the establishment of reliable courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-ukraines-international-partners-do&quot;&gt;What can Ukraine’s international partners do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries that have attempted fundamental governance reform can provide useful reference points for thinking about what may limit the power of systema in Ukraine. For example, South Korea’s successful experience of reducing the influence of its chaebols and Chile’s exceptional achievements in becoming one of the least corrupt countries in Latin America deserve attention. There is also much relevant experience closer to home: in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no universal model for achieving a transition from a ‘limited access order’ whereby rent seeking is the norm to a politically and economically competitive ‘open access order’ where the needs of society come first. Every country is different, and progress may sometimes be the by-product of other changes rather than the direct result of reform measures. Antitrust legislation can over time be part of a framework to create a competitive economic environment, but it cannot be a solution on its own to addressing the wider problem of systema, particularly when Ukraine lacks an independent judiciary and other institutions that could enforce new rules. A combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to restrict corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable are necessary to address the problem as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general principle, reducing the influence of systema requires changing the calculus of the main players. Rent seeking needs to become more difficult, to carry greater risk and to be less profitable than wealth creation through the establishment of well-managed, transparent businesses that attract investment and generate employment. Economic growth will then create new players and diversify the asset-owning class. The reduced appeal of rent seeking will encourage greater political competition through the diversification of constituencies. Regulating further the use of media for electoral campaigning purposes and developing a properly resourced independent public broadcaster could be part of this process, along with further efforts to regulate and control campaign financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systema interests may be strengthened, and others weakened, as the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic plays out. Some FIGs may find themselves rewarded by the government for their support, while others may lose ground because of the conditions of future IMF support. It is notable that during the ‘lockdown’ period from March to May 2020, large companies were able to continue working, while small and medium-sized business could not. FIGs and their affiliates benefited, as did their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privatization of state companies, and improving the corporate governance of the remaining ones, offers considerable opportunities to reduce traditional rent seeking and force some of the FIGs to reconsider their business models. However, this presupposes that the process of privatization is competitive, and not prone to the type of insider dealing seen in the past. The possibility, under legislation adopted in March 2018, to apply English law to large-scale privatization sale and purchase agreements is an encouraging development in view of the failure so far to improve the delivery of justice in Ukrainian commercial courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judicial reform is a long-term process that requires sustained support from Ukraine’s international partners, but with their acceptance that the principles of the Council of Europe do not easily translate into local reality. The attempt to respect the principle of judicial independence by leaving the unreformed High Council of Justice in charge of the reform process has produced predictably meagre results. International support to civil society and investigative journalists should continue, since they play an important watchdog role in monitoring reforms – for example, by exposing the rigging of judicial appointments and drawing attention to disciplinary proceedings in the case of allegations of malfeasance. The international partners must distinguish between cosmetic and substantial reform of the judiciary. A reminder of the state of the judicial system is that Kolomoisky’s defence against claims by state-owned PrivatBank looks much weaker in foreign jurisdictions than it does in Ukraine. International partners also need to tie financial and other support to real judicial reform. Strict IMF and EU conditionality made it possible to create the new anti-corruption infrastructure, and should make it possible to conduct deep judicial reform. Ukraine is likely to need significant financial support over the next two years to service its foreign debt and cope with the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and a shortage of foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s international partners must distinguish between cosmetic and substantial reform of the judiciary.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most powerful tool for challenging systema is the greater part of Ukrainian society that does not benefit from it nor from preserving the status quo. Sustained calls by the public to stop specific rent-seeking practices will put pressure on the FIGs and their enablers in government and parliament. An alliance of reformist politicians, business figures and civil society has the potential to play an important role in this process, but only if backed with appropriate support by Ukraine’s international partners. Dismantling systema and replacing it with robust, competent institutions will be a long-term process that is unlikely to be linear because of the political battles that will need to be fought along the way, and because of the need to co-opt the progressive-minded part of the elite that sees the need to look beyond maintaining the status quo. To drive this effort, civil society will need to broaden its capabilities and expand beyond the biggest cities, while the public must have better access to balanced reporting via independent media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Western countries must show much greater resolve to investigate suspected money laundering by the beneficiaries of rent seeking and corruption in Ukraine. There is abundant evidence of the latter’s ability to use banks in EU countries and in the UK to buy real estate, educate their children and protect their assets in rule-of-law jurisdictions. Some of these individuals bear heavy responsibility for Ukraine’s weak institutions and the national security problem that they have created. Continued failure to deter these practices will not only sustain systema. It will also increasingly lead to accusations of Western double standards and tarnish the EU’s image in Ukraine as a community of law-governed states that is genuinely committed to upholding democratic values and supporting reform in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-strategic-misfortunes&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Strategic Misfortunes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy is a concept that is exceptionally easy to understand – on paper that is. In practice, it remains notoriously difficult to execute. We know this because of the wealth of knowledge contained within the history of warfare – or if one chooses, throughout strategic history. Yet, precisely what is this high concept? What does it mean and what is its role? After all, these are questions that must be answered, however briefly, before one can begin to understand any misfortune in the function of Strategy. If we turn to history’s greatest military theorist, the Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz, we understand that Strategy is the “use of the engagement for the purpose of the war”. In Clausewitz’s definition, “engagement” ultimately implies violence and “purpose” denotes the political condition and/or political behavior being sought. Today, one may prefer to use a definition of Strategy proffered in more modern wording: “Strategy refers to the use made of force and the threat of force for the ends of policy. It is the bridge that connects policy with military power.” Though separated by 175 years, ultimately both definitions speak to the very same meaning and role of Strategy: it is an activity, deportment, or even response concerned with the linkage of violence to political purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of warfare has provided posterity with a treasure chest of examples where military leaders devised and executed Strategy with sheer excellence. For one example, we can turn to the Battle of Marathon, which, with great thanks to historians such as Hans Delbrück, we now have a clearer understanding of the events that took place in this ancient battle. It was in the Vrana Valley in 490 B.C.E. that Miltiades and his hoplite forces defeated the invading Persians. He was able to accomplish this through, among others, a combination of his brilliant understanding of the terrain; the force deployment of his Athenian hoplites aimed at opposing Persian cavalry and their formidable archers prior to the battle; and in how he managed to utilize his forces in order to counter attacks to their flanks once violence began. The purpose of the engagement was simple. Miltiades and his hoplites accepted battle with the Persians for the maintenance of the security of Athens, and arguably, Greece at large. This was a display of Strategy at its finest. Brilliant lessons in Strategy aside – let alone Strategy that has been executed “good enough” – arguably, they are not equivalent to the strategic misfortunes found throughout strategic history, including contemporary and current times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of strategic misfortunes is long and bloody, too long to be listed even in a special edition dedicated to the subject. However, a few examples are necessary in order to bring forth a clear understanding of the purpose of this edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While historical accounts and records of wars may be incomplete and slanted, the end result of wars cannot be. We know who won and we know who lost. As concerns strategic history, it is chock full of strategic misfortunes found within the conduct of war. A strategic misfortune can imply anything from difficulty to outright failure in linking “ends” and “means” via “ways”. Moreover, failure in the function of Strategy need not occur within one instance of fighting – it can actually be a long and drawn out process. For example, and again turning to the chronicles of strategic history, in 216 B.C.E. General Hannibal of Carthage defeated one Roman army (possibly up to 50,000 dead Romans and Italians) at the Battle of Cannae within the spate of a day. Yet, despite such a tactical achievement, Hannibal failed strategically. He subsequently occupied parts of Italy for over a dozen years and never succeeded in turning his battlefield achievements or military occupation of Italy into positive political effect for Carthage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contemporary historical times, Napoleon is a prime candidate for strategic misfortunes. Despite the French Emperor’s numerous tactical successes, Napoleon racked up an abundance of strategic failures spread across the European continent, and beyond, throughout his rule. Similar to Hannibal, he could never turn his bloody triumphs into positive political achievements for the French Empire. Such failures effectively ensured that every battle won ultimately mattered little, at least for the maintenance of the French Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War I, volumes could be written on the strategic misfortunes that took place in Europe alone. In 1914, the German General Staff’s “Schlieffen Plan” quickly turned into a massive strategic failure for Germany, placing pressure on the entire German armed forces. As a result of, among others, amendments to the original German plan, the unexpected speed at which the Russians were able to organize and deploy, and the French ability to mount a counterattack, culminating in the Battle of the Marne, Germany’s initial political aims were quickly lost. In what was expected to be a rapid victory against France, events morphed into years of so-called trench warfare and ultimately, in the defeat of the German Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, and despite knowledge that the history of warfare has provided, strategic failure continues unabated. Strategic misfortunes have permeated numerous conflicts since the 1980s – from the Soviets in Afghanistan, the Argentinians in the Falklands War, the US and French in Lebanon, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the US and international forces in Somalia in 1993, United Nations’ forces in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, to the Israel Defense Force in the Second Lebanon War in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how and what can we learn from both historical and current strategic failures that will assist in the future? Answering these questions through the examples provided in the following articles is the purpose of this Infinity Journal Special Edition. In this edition, six individuals have written on a wide range of topics that do not simply point out the strategic failures that have occurred, but perhaps more importantly, why they happened. It is from these writings that we must learn and subsequently apply lessons if one desires to avoid, as best as possible, future strategic misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eminent strategic theorist Professor Colin S. Gray argues that the Luftwaffe’s failure in the summer of 1940 was the direct result of the excellence of RAF Fighter Command, rather than because of its own mistakes, serious though these were. In this Infinity Journal Special Edition article, Gray explains the strategic nature of the German defeat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lt. Col. Dr. Antulio J. Echevarria, II, a world-renowned historian, Clausewitzian scholar, and Director of Research for the U.S. Army War College, argues that Erwin Rommel’s generalship continuously pushed men and materiel to their limits, which precipitously wore down forces that were merely intended to provide security and stability along the flank of the main theater of operations against the Soviet Union. Rommel failed to appreciate the operational interplay between land power and air power – and his forces paid the price at El Alamein.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense analyst and lecturer at the Israeli Defense Force Command and General Staff College, Dr. Eado Hecht, holds that adaptation of Israel’s successful strategy to quell Palestinian attacks emanating from neighbouring Arab states to the unique circumstances of Lebanon led to the First Lebanon War in 1982. However, after initial success, the strategy failed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States Army Colonel and Director of Military History at West Point, Gian P. Gentile, provides a self-critical assessment of how he came to violate the dictates of being a good historian: he began to think like a social scientist and embraced a model that placed the primacy of strategy over tactics in war. What he found, however, is that history does not always conform to that model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associate Professor and Senior Analyst, Dr. C. Dale Walton, examines US decisions regarding war and peace from the Vietnam War to the present. He finds a disturbing pattern of “anti-Clausewitzian” behavior. Walton argues that the US military is very good at fighting wars, but America’s civilian leaders frequently have misused their military instrument, engaging in ill-conceived adventures without first carefully assessing likely human, financial, and other costs, establishing clear goals, and crafting a realistic roadmap for winning the conflict in a timely fashion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lastly, Adam Elkus, a defense and security analyst and doctoral candidate in international relations, writes that the sheer scale and complexity of the Chinese Civil War belies assertions that today’s substate conflicts are uniquely challenging.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most fundamental reason for the German defeat was a failure in strategy. Most of the decisions which determined the outcome of the Battle had been made before it began. Given the defence systems, the aircraft, the training and the plans, all put in place by the decisions of a few people in leadership positions on each side, the odds were stacked heavily against the Luftwaffe from the first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bungay is right in his unequivocal claim, quoted above. But, is it more correct to register the outcome of the Battle of Britain as a failure of strategy on the German part, rather than as a success for British strategy? When scholars and others choose to focus on the behaviour and misbehaviour of only one side to a conflict, balanced judgment is likely to fall victim as a consequence. Clausewitz insists that war is a duel and every PowerPoint presentation on strategy more or less faithfully restates the obvious important truth that the enemy votes on how well we need to do. And yet, somehow, the duelling nature of strategic affairs frequently escapes proper notice and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one asks ‘why did the Luftwaffe lose the Battle of Britain?’ the question encourages a biasing emphasis upon German performance that is anchored in the fact of defeat. Although the Luftwaffe made many mistakes in the summer of 1940, it would be a serious mistake to attribute its defeat to strategic misfortune – it was not bad luck. Similarly, it would not be useful or persuasive to argue that a different German choice here or there should have made all the difference between defeat and victory. The Luftwaffe failed strategically in summer 1940 because Britain, and especially its Fighter Command, was too good for it in the geostrategic context of the conflict at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the Germans did not conduct a sufficiently effective campaign against Fighter Command, but it needs to be appreciated that the German weaknesses and errors were not, in the main, misfortunes (i.e. instances of bad luck), rather were they the products of a system that was not capable of fighting with strategic sense. The Battle of Britain in the summer and autumn of 1940 was a struggle that has to be understood as a unity, not only as a German defeat or a British victory (pick one). However, as an exemplary tale of strategy, or its absence, in action, the Battle is much better explained as a British victory than as a German defeat. History records many cases of ‘fighting and winning ugly’, but the evidence of 1940 shows unmistakeably that the Luftwaffe, fighting ugly or not, was never likely to prevail. RAF Fighter Command strictly did not require good fortune in order to win, but one cannot deny that German folly certainly was welcome. The Battle of Britain serves as one of history’s clearest examples of the rewards and the costs of both good and poor strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theory-and-practice-for-1940&quot;&gt;Theory and Practice for 1940&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an intellectual key to the understanding of strategy that is not difficult to present. Simply stated: a strategy should achieve desired political ends by using appropriate means in effective ways. There are usually good reasons why ends, ways, and means fail to mesh as cooperatively as one would like, but the practical ambition is only to function with strategic sense well enough, not to perform perfectly. In the military realm one has to expect to fight under less than perfect conditions, which is why one should strive to learn from unfolding experience, and be sufficiently flexible as to be able to adapt to unwelcome developments and yet survive and even succeed. Because of its super-reductionist simplicity, the ends, ways, and means formula enables us to test historical experience fairly reliably for strategic sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the strategic trinity just cited one needs to add the intellectually and evidentially challenging factors of assumptions and also of context. The people and the machines of 1940 had to perform in action then, but they were very substantially the products of the circumstances of a British context for homeland air defence that had form from 1916, and of a German context rooted only in 1933 (and then not for an air campaign against Britain at home). The rival air forces had to fight in 1940, but each was made in the preceding years. Most of the RAF’s system and the Luftwaffe’s advantages and disadvantages can be traced to pre-war circumstances and concerns. RAF Fighter Command in 1940 was the product of a fairly consistent focus on homeland air defence traceable back to 1915-16, while the Luftwaffe’s close attention to Britain was a novel phenomenon in the summer of 1940. One side was long prepared for the battle of the day, the other was not. These are facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not wish to employ ends, ways, and means mechanistically in the analysis that follows, but readers are alerted to the value that of this gloriously inclusive yet still taut inherently holistic conceptual trinity. It permeates my argument. Although I will argue that RAF Fighter Command won a well merited strategic victory in 1940, it is necessary also that I explain why the Luftwaffe suffered strategic defeat. I must proceed thus, given the essential unity of strategic experience between rivals and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation-and-battle&quot;&gt;Preparation and Battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any military force can have a bad day or two, and the reasons for poor combat performance can be many and complex. That said, the history of military aviation shows that air forces tend to fail or succeed for reasons with paper trails over many years. The Battle of Britain was a struggle with two timelines. It mattered critically how effectively the rival air forces fought from July to October 1940, but that net effectiveness was influenced massively by the strategic events of the previous quarter-century. Typically, in popular histories and TV documentaries the strategic tale begins in Flanders in May-June 1940, and then proceeds at a galloping pace from the opening probing ‘round’ over the Channel in July, to the main event (in two or three ‘rounds’) in August and September. All too often, strategically vital differences between RAF Fighter Command and the Luftwaffe pass unflagged. Neglecting the contextual dimension to the air warfare of summer 1940 is probably the most punishing mistake one can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain, although now we know most everything that there is to be known about the air warfare of 1940, that very familiarity can function unhelpfully as a barrier to our understanding. We have knowledge, but we tend to lack empathy because we do not think about air warfare as people did in 1940. It would be hard to exaggerate the relevance of the strategic historical fact that the Battle of Britain was the first air battle in all of history effectively unconnected to on-going terrestrial warfare. This was an attempt to win well enough in and from the sky, leading either to terrestrial success with brute force in combat, or to political victory as a result of coercion from altitude. Could it be done? More to the point, could the Luftwaffe do it in August-September 1940? No-one knew, and in part they did not know because it had never been tried before, anywhere by anyone. Theory was plentiful, if not abundant, but reliable evidence was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of 1940 was that only one air force, the RAF, knew what it had to do and, in principle, how to do it. The Luftwaffe, in contrast, was committed to the world’s first stand-alone air campaign. Moreover, the RAF, and the Royal Flying Corps before it, had been devoted to the strategic mission of homeland air defence since 1915 with some activity, and certainly since 1917 in the most careful detail. British air defence had a track record of considerable success in action in 1916-18,was reorganised twice in the inter-war years, albeit with large continuities, and it was always fit enough for its contemporary purpose – as far as one can judge for peacetime(!) – through the 1920s and 1930s. This is not to deny that there was a brief period in the very early 1920s when the air defence narrative seemed in peril, but this was fixed by 1924 (courtesy of anxiety occasioned by a perceived French air menace). More troubling was the delay in 1937-8 in reequipping with the new fast monoplane fighters, with the Luftwaffe’s Bf109 acquisition being two years in advance of the Hurricane and Spitfire. The Hurricanes were delivered for squadron service in November 1937, Spitfires on 4 August 1938. The Bf109 first flew on 28 May 1935, the Spitfire on 5 March 1936. The new first-generation monoplane Bf109s were fed into the Condor Legion’s war in Spain, but it was untried against a similarly equipped enemy until it met Spitfires over Dunkirk in late May 1940. The point of historical contextual significance, though, is that Britain had ready enough an organisation, peopled, trained, and equipped adequately for the task of the hour, homeland air defence – and Germany did not have sufficiently offsetting advantages on the offensive side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British air defences had defeated three German air campaigns conducted from 1915 to 1918 (2 by Zeppelin airships and one by Gotha aircraft), and then had prepared for the threat that materialised by and in 1940. The Germans had to improvise most aspects of their air campaign against Britain in 1940; the British needed to improvise hardly anything. The Luftwaffe fought with the weapons it had, ones acquired and then employed briefly in relatively short-range continental warfare. This is not to suggest that the Germans could not succeed in the air in 1940, but it is to highlight the abundantly evidenced fact that only one belligerent in 1940 had prepared over time and in depth for an air battle across the Channel over Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature on the Battle of Britain is abundant, vastly repetitive, and typically innocent of much strategic sense. There are, however, two exceptional readable yet scholarly studies which tell the story of 1940 as well as one needs to have it told. Without qualification, I recommend Richard Overy’s The Battle of Britain: Myth and Reality (2010), and Stephen Bungay’s The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain (2000). Because of the excellence of the granular histories of the Battle in 1940, I will not waste space with more than a summary of the story arc of the most relevant combat in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May – June:&lt;/strong&gt; German assault beginning on 10 May routs the French army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Most of the BEF (226,000) and some French soldiers (112,000) are evacuated from Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June. The RAF in France is ineffective, but Fighter Command aircraft from British airfields provide a nasty shock to the Luftwaffe over Dunkirk. The 9 days of air combat associated directly with the Dunkirk operation cost the RAF 177 aircraft to 240 for the Luftwaffe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 July – 11 August:&lt;/strong&gt; The Luftwaffe tries to entice RAF Fighter Command into battle over the Channel. The Germans avoid crossing the Channel and instead probe British air defences by attacking shipping in a rather desultory fashion (the kanalkampf). 10 July – 11 August saw the RAF lose 115 fighters and 64 bombers, these 179 compare with Luftwaffe losses of 216. Both sides learnt from the fighting, but the Germans did not unravel the architecture and operational design of Fighter Command. In order to preserve assets and deny intelligence to the enemy, the Command deliberately limited its reactions to the German campaign against Channel shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12/13 August – 6/7 September:&lt;/strong&gt; This brief period was the main event of the Battle, militarily considered (it included days when flying was either impossible or severely restricted by bad weather). Between these dates the Luftwaffe strove none too consistently to render RAF Fighter Command hors de combat. The Command was attacked directly on its principal airfields (the Luftwaffe was not well informed about dispersion to much rougher satellite fields), and in its specific industrial base (aircraft and engine manufacturing plants). The most vital target set, the coastal radar stations were attacked heavily on 12 August, but very little thereafter (the number of Chain Home and Chain Home Low radar stations grew from 51 in July 1940 to 76 by the end of September that year). The attritional combat was heavy, if somewhat episodic, but Fighter Command survived into early September, damaged but definitely not crippled. The operational air general, Keith Park commanding 11 Group (London and the South East), was not compelled to evacuate his airfields to the south and east of London.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-15 September:&lt;/strong&gt; Desperate for a more speedy victory than they had achieved thus far, the Germans shifted strategy to bomb British urban targets (in daylight), especially London and its docks. The hope was that RAF Fighter Command would be obliged to ascend in the largest number it could still manage, where it could be attrited in greater numbers than before. This ‘round’ in the Battle, really the final one, concluded on 15 September, when the Luftwaffe sought to darken the sky over London with 965 aircraft (348 bombers and 617 fighters). The scale of the attacks, and the geographic depth of their necessary penetration, allowed Fighter Command the time to assemble a large enough near continuous defence as to inflict immensely demoralising damage on the German bomber crews in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late September — :&lt;/strong&gt; The daylight ‘Blitz’ principally against London of the 7-15 period, was succeeded by a largely nighttime ‘Blitz’ through the autumn and winter, a campaign to which Fighter Command had no answers at that time (lacking airborne radar in 1940).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitler officially postponed sine die the planned invasion of Britain (Seelowe) on 17 September 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;explaining-the-defeat&quot;&gt;Explaining the Defeat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did RAF Fighter Command win in 1940? The answer is only two-fold when stated bluntly and minimally: because of Britain’s 25 year record of competent professional attention to homeland air defence, and because of the superior performance of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding as the strategic leader and military commander of British air defence. The whole story is of course complex and contains as much detail as anyone finds tolerable. However, these two reasons – 25 years of dedicated practice, and Dowding – comprise the heart of the matter. Because my argument is advanced so confidently in praise of the RAF and Dowding, it is only prudent to lead this part of the analysis with a summary of the reasons why Germany lost the Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germanys-problems&quot;&gt;Germany’s problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignorance of the enemy:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking in German terms of RAF Fighter Command as a target set, it would be difficult to improve on this judgment by Stephen Bungay: “The core problem for Kesselring and Sperrle was that they literally did not know what they were doing.” Luftwaffe intelligence, to ignore the glaring irony, correctly understood little that was vitally significant about Fighter Command. Oberst Beppo Schmid, the catastrophically incompetent head of Luftwaffe Intelligence, persistently underestimated RAF Fighter Command. This goes a long way towards explaining why Luftwaffe morale suffered heavily, following aircrew puzzlement, when their enemy continued resisting into September in numbers not visibly much if at all reduced, despite the cumulatively high ‘kill’ rates claimed. In every aspect of the Battle the Germans were hampered severely by acute, literally lethal, ignorance of the enemy. They knew about British radar, but they did not know how the RAF used it. In fact, Luftwaffe Intelligence had no comprehension of RAF Fighter Command as the world’s first, and then only integrated air defence system. Because the Luftwaffe in 1940 did not centralize its radar data and filtering, it did not occur to them that Fighter Command was truly a network, which is to say a system with integrated sub-systems (thanks to Post Office land lines). A key part of the German ignorance was their lack of comprehension of the existence and role of the 7 Sector Stations that Air Vice Marshal Keith Park was using as instruments of his operational air generalship. Naturally, since the Luftwaffe did not know of what Fighter Command consisted and how it functioned, bombardment for strategic effectiveness – identified by Giulio Douhet as the “most delicate and difficult task in aerial warfare … defined as aerial strategy” – had to be a substantially haphazard affair.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive failure of strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany’s political ends did not sit comfortably well enough with its selected ways or its enabling means. In short, Germany needed its Luftwaffe either to assist its navy and army to win the war by a successful invasion, or to coerce the British government by air action alone into acquiescence in German political leadership (which may not have required many German boots on Britain’s green and pleasant land). In failing to suppress the RAF the Luftwaffe effectively thwarted the political ‘end’ of a compliant, possibly even friendly, government in London. The political guidance to the Luftwaffe’s operational level commanders (Generalfeldmarschall Alfred Kesselring – Luftflotte 2, Brussels; Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle – Luftflotte 3, Paris) was minimal. Indeed, Hitler showed little interest in the air campaign, while Hermann Goring did not function strategically in military perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inadequate military means:&lt;/strong&gt; The Luftwaffe of 1940 was the world-leading air force of the day – it was truly formidable. It had the finest medium, light and dive bombers, and arguably the finest single-seat fighter, the Bf109. However, the Luftwaffe was a relatively short-range force and it was always on the edge of crisis over spare parts and replacement aircrew and aircraft. The service was a near miracle of hasty construction, but it had been built as a Nazi political and cultural showcase, as a coercive instrument against those likely to be easily shaken, and if need be, as a force enhancer of swift terrestrial continental victory. It was not built to be able to sustain and recover from recurring heavy losses, or to fight across seas against an enemy over his home. Numbers are arguable because of the problems of dating the audit and selecting what really were the “serviceable” numbers. Nonetheless, a good enough count for the balance holds that RAF Fighter Command and the Luftwaffe joined serious combat in summer 1940 with orders of battle at approximately 754 Hurricanes and Spitfires in 48 squadrons versus 1,107 Bf109s. Single-seat fighters were the significant combatants. By and large, everything else in the air was only a potential ‘kill’. Fighting literally overseas, the Bf109s were too few, with their margins of numerical superiority inadequate. To illustrate: by my calculation between 1 June and 1 November 1940, Britain built 1,367 Hurricanes and 724 Spitfires (average per diem works out at 8.9 and 4.7 respectively). Compare those numbers with the total (operational) loss rate, which for the longer period 10 May to 4 November averaged 4.4 (Hurricanes) and 2.7 (Spitfires) per diem, and it is not hard to appreciate why the Luftwaffe failed to clear the air of annoying British aircraft. Among the many things that Oberst Schmid did not know was the non-trivial fact that in the summer and autumn of 1940 Britain was out-producing Germany in fighter aircraft (nor did he know about the superb RAF organisation for recovery and repair). Numbers abound in military aviation history and sometimes they are strategically meaningful. On the launch day for the great German air assault on Fighter Command, which is to say 13 August (to ignore the attacks on the radar system on 12 August), the Luftwaffe (Luftflotten 2 and 3) could commit only 871 Bf109s, against a Fighter Command total in the 640s. There were too few first-line operationally ready German single-seat fighters. As for the enemy, not only was Britain out-producing the Germans in fighters, but the relevant operationally available pilot numbers also tell the tale of strategic defeat for the Luftwaffe. On 6 July Fighter Command could call on 1,259 pilots, on 1 September 1,142 pilots and on 2 November, 1,797 pilots. This is the arithmetic of German strategic defeat. The dependable Bungay provides suitable closing metrics on the most relevant aircraft holdings. Apparently, on 17 August Schmid told Luftwaffe commanders that RAF Fighter Command had only 300 serviceable fighters in its active force. The real numbers for Fighter Command were “855 with operational squadrons, 209 at storage units, and another 84 at training units, a total of 1,438 twice as many as in the beginning of July.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor campaign adaptiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; German aircrew and aircraft were excellent for their place and day, but that place and day was not over Britain in 1940. Error is inevitable and unavoidable in the practice of strategy, so the unarguable fact of German mistakes cannot itself be an issue of interest here. Rather, the question is ‘how did the Luftwaffe adapt to correct for the errors which experience was revealing?’ Could it be flexible and immediately find ways to fight more effectively against Britain? The short answer, and even a long answer, is simply ‘no’. Germany lacked intelligence on most vital aspects of British air defence, and it could not possibly correct for aircraft production rate mistakes in real-time in August and September 1940. One can identify many crucial errors that could have been avoided or mitigated, had only nazi Germany in the mid to late 1930s known what historians today know. Hindsight is wonderful. The German political leadership was thoroughly disengaged from the Battle of Britain at all levels of performance: tactical, operational, and certainly strategic. Luftwaffe officers, high and low, were not formally educated at all in strategy. But, notwithstanding the many zones of German error, had the intelligence picture been far more accurate, even the physical inadequacies of the bomber force (range and/or payload) might not have been so constraining of achievement. For example, if the Luftwaffe had known what sector stations were and what they did, and if the medium bombers had attacked persistently even with their poor bomb sights, real damage with value might well have been done. Fortunately, the Luftwaffe in 1940 was not an organisation capable of improvised adaptations to the challenge from strategic hell that was the Fuhrer’s call about Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-did-britain-win-the-battle&quot;&gt;Why did Britain win the Battle?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for Germany’s defeat are legion; indeed one is spoiled for choice. With respect to the RAF’s victory, it may be recalled that I staked a claim earlier for two essential , mutually complementary, explanations: the British air defence system which had a provenance of 25 years by 1940, and the performance of that system’s leader from 1936 until November 1940, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh ‘Stuffy’ Dowding. In 1940, the air defence system was Dowding’s. British air defence was a team effort, as it had to be, but Dowding’s contributions were by far the most significant to the team’s achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise: in the early 1930s he had been the most important figure in decisions on research and development bearing upon air defence; his support was vital to the breakthrough on radar on 26 February 1935; his voice was reflected in the aircraft and armament steps taken crucially in early and mid decade; and after air defence was re-branded as Fighter Command in July 1936, with himself as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, his was the dominant role over the tactics, operations, and strategy of British homeland air defence. The integrated air defence system won a team battle over Germany in 1940, but the team had an outstanding leader. Dowding designed what Fighter Command became: he established its procedures; he decided how it would function as a seamless network; and last but not least he selected the operational concept for engagement that made most strategic sense. The victory in 1940 was a victory for the system, but it was the ‘Dowding System’. The system was strong and had valuable redundancies, but had it been commanded by another brain and personality it might well have performed far less effectively. I conclude with an appraisal of Fighter Command’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dowding’s strategic sense:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding functioned persistently and consistently in strategic mode; he understood that as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Command his responsibility was for the strategy of air defence, inclusively considered. He committed to ensuring that each of the classic constituents of strategy – ends, ways, and means, and their underpinning assumptions – had integrity both in and of themselves and, no less important, as vital enablers for the others. This claim is so familiar as to risk appearing banal, but its frequent neglect in practice highlights its fundamental importance. Dowding modernised the system of air defence and its supporting infrastructure so as to ensure that the ways and means were sufficiently adaptable to cope with unpredicted, even unanticipated, circumstances. Moreover, Dowding had to ensure that the fighting power of his command – with its physical, moral, and conceptual components – could succeed in combat against the enemy on the day, whenever that day should dawn and for as long as it might last. Dowding possessed and consistently exercised strategic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence planning with ‘minimum regrets’:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding’s major equipment and research decisions over a ten-year period, including his long term on the Air Council from 1930-36, proved ‘right enough’. He passed the minimum regrets test. The strategist does not need to record flawless strategic performance, only one free of irrecoverable mistakes. Wherever one looks at the ends, ways, and means of British home air defence in the 1930s and into the 1940s, there is no serious room for doubt that Dowding was either right, or sufficiently correct, on the biggest decisions and in the ways in which they were to be implemented. His strategic sense enabled him to adapt to unanticipated circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability:&lt;/strong&gt; British air defence and its victory in 1940 were the result of a quarter century of preparation that was nearly always paced well enough to be combat competitive with the extant or anticipated threat of the period and its near future. Even in the short lifetime of air power, Fighter Command in 1940 enjoyed a lengthy provenance. Dowding the strategist did not have to improvise on many significant aspects of his Command’s capability. Exceptions clearly included combat tactics, which in practice were adapted (away from the lethal ‘vic’ formation) at the squadron level, and with respect to night fighting which Dowding insisted correctly could be improved only when airborne radar was ready, and suitable two-seat aircraft to carry and employ it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dowding succeeded in preparing an architecture of air defence that could cope with a German air menace that evoled rapidly and altered markedly in quality and quantity of tactical and operational menace as a result of unpredicted, certainly unpredictable, geostrategic changes. Fighter Command was not created, developed, and then fine-tuned to deal with a Luftwaffe based in Northern France (meaning a radar assisted warning time cross Channel of 6 minutes!). RAF leaders had envisaged the German air threat in the 1930s primarily as a menace based in Germany, just possibly the Low Countries, and taking the form of medium bombers without single-seat fighter protection.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some might argue that Fighter Command was always likely to win, almost regardless of German choices. With Germany and its Luftwaffe as they were in 1940, one can make a persuasive case to the effect that the Luftwaffe’s campaign direction was not critically important. Given what the Luftwaffe did not know about Fighter Command, and what Clausewitz called the “grammar” of war (applied to 1940), one might argue that it did not much matter whether the Germans bombed airfields, cities, or both. Fighter Command was resilient against the kind of performance that the Luftwaffe was capable of imposing. In principle, Britain’s aircraft manufacturing industry was highly vulnerable to attack, as also were the coastal facilities of the Chain Home radar system(s). But, principle and practice were far apart. And one should not be seduced either by common sense or by imagination into believing that the Luftwaffe might well have made a different operational choice here and there, and as a consequence won the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There were systemic reasons why the Luftwaffe of 1940 performed as it did in the way it did. Dowding was certainly fortunate in his enemy’s incompetence, but that is not to argue that he succeeded because he was lucky. It was true that he was the fortunate command legatee of two decades of high British competence in air defence. It is also true to say, however, that Dowding personally contributed very significantly to the future strength of that air defence by virtue of his enthusiastic endorsement of vital technical developments both before and after he assumed command in July 1936. Of course, the successful defensive performance in 1940 was won by a team of outstanding contributors to Fighter Command’s combat potency, but the overarching and most persuasive explanation for the victory was that the Command benefited from superior strategic leadership for long enough to give it decisive advantages over the Luftwaffe. It was not luck that in 1940 Fighter Command had excellent equipment when it mattered most, that it was settled in pursuit of the most prudent and effective master operational concept, that its battlespace general (Keith Park) truly was Dowding’s alter ego in military grasp and strategic sense, and that scientific and technical challenges consistently were addressed competently by the Command.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding persisted with what history demonstrated to be the correct command philosophy and broad guiding concept of operations (near continuous engagement with the minimum force necessary to disrupt him – to limit British losses). He reserved for himself the role of strategist, delegating operational command to his exceptionally capable subordinate, Keith Park, at 11 Group, who played the role of Sherman to Dowding’s Grant. Park, in his turn, delegated tactical command to his sector station controllers – up to the point of air-to-air contact, when squadron commanders aloft took charge. Because he adhered firmly to a strategic standard for his performance, Dowding selected a concept of operations for Park to follow that expressed the strategic purpose of the command at that time. Dowding never forgot that his goal was to deny the Germans a convincing narrative that would support the invasion option. He could not decide for Berlin how much damage his Command needed to inflict on the Luftwaffe. What he could do, however, was ensure that no rational, if optimistic, Luftwaffe briefing to the Fuhrer could claim credibly to have defeated the RAF. Overy is plausible when he writes: “It is evident that not a lot was needed to deter Hitler from the idea of invading Britain. Fighter Command tipped the balance.” Dowding could not have known this at the time. He needed both to be able to continue to hurt the Luftwaffe seriously, all the while, in the process, never ceasing to demonstrate that Fighter Command remained alive and well enough. Dowding made his single greatest strategic contribution to British survival in 1940 in mid May over the burning issue of the immediate dispatch to France of many more Hurricanes from the home defence force. On 16 May Dowding wrote a 10 point memorandum to the War Cabinet, via the Undersecretary of State for Air, Harold Balfour, in which he explained the current strategic facts of life with characteristic exemplary bluntness. He wrote that if Fighter Command sent more planes to France (in a losing cause) they would not only fail to save the French, but their loss would all but guarantee the subsequent consequential defeat of Britain also. Dowding prevailed, Fighter Command (almost) ceased leaking Hurricanes to France, and the Command was not expended in a lost cause in May-June. Dowding was not afraid to tell Prime Minister Churchill what he did not want to hear – that we should not try to help the French anymore, even though they were still fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can summarise Dowding’s concept of operations as minimum effective response, to deny the Luftwaffe even the possibility of a decisive victory in the air (or against airfields). Many of Dowding’s critics could not understand why Fighter Command committed only a fraction of its total force, most especially of its best fighter aircraft, the Spitfire, to combat at any one time. His was not the most exciting of operational concepts, but it was far and away the most prudent, and it was a strategic victory by any plausible definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.militarystrategymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/70.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, perhaps the most familiar of Hitler’s lieutenants. Bashing the Rommel myth has become something of a pastime for historians — and why not? The legend of the “Desert Fox” was deliberately and aggressively fashioned by Rommel himself — with the enthusiastic collaboration of the vast Nazi propaganda machine. Clearing away the underbrush of legend is one of the services that historians provide. And there is much to clear away in this case. To be sure, Rommel defeated a number of able French and British commanders before his string of successes was broken by General Bernard Law Montgomery in the autumn of 1942. The phrase “doing a Rommel” even became a catchword for outsmarting an opponent, whether on the battlefield or the game board. However, Rommel’s string of victories also worked against him — concealing not only the extent to which the German way of war had become bifurcated, but also two elements that made the Wehrmacht’s tactical successes possible in the first place, namely, logistical support and air cover. If, as Clausewitz said, war has its own grammar, but not its own logic, then Rommel’s military grammar detached itself from the war’s political logic and attempted to follow its own path. That path put a premium on waging a fluid war of movement, and continually pushed men and material to their limits, regardless of logistical realities and the operational range of air power. It was also a method that ultimately ran counter to Hitler’s larger strategic aims because it precipitously wore down the very fighting machine that was merely supposed to buy time and achieve some stability along the flank of the main theater of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North African theater was never more than a sideshow for Hitler, an effort to bolster a failing ally who was fast becoming a liability. After June 1941, the main effort for the Reich was the war against the Soviet Union, which by the autumn of that year had escalated from a supposedly swift campaign of occupation into a brutal struggle for existence between National Socialism and Stalinism. Rommel’s theater would never enjoy anything more than a tertiary status — behind the campaign in the east and the war in the Atlantic — something he apparently understood, but refused to accept. Right or wrong, Hitler’s political logic was clear. Yet, Rommel continually appealed to the High Command for more troops, as if taking Cairo and the Suez Canal could end the war in Germany’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing in Rommel’s personal background suggests that he had the mettle to rise to high-level military command. As an officer candidate, he was rated above average, but definitely not exceptional. As a junior officer in the First World War, he proved to be intelligent, brave, and resourceful — but so were tens of thousands of other young men. Good fortune and his relentless self-promotion, perhaps driven by personal insecurities regarding his class and social standing (he was not Prussian), enabled him to make the most of his exploits: he was awarded the Iron Cross, first and second classes, as well as the Pour le’Merite. His book, Infantry Attacks (1937), was little more than a collection of war stories posing as tactical lessons; yet, it added much to his personal image as a tactician. Rommel later wrote, “position warfare is always a struggle for the destruction of men — in contrast to mobile warfare, where everything turns on the destruction of enemy material.” This is an ironic observation given that El Alamein was a classic example of position warfare. He clearly preferred a war of movement, captured rather adroitly with the phrase “Schlacht ohne Morgen” or battle without end, and — almost to a fault — consistently placed himself at the point of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, regardless of his rank, Rommel habitually exerted his personal influence at the decisive point. However, that habit reveals that he was a micromanager, a leader who was unwilling to trust his subordinates with important tasks. He often assumed command of his subordinates’ units, a practice that ran contrary to the supposed German tradition of issuing broad orders of intent (Auftragstaktik) and giving one’s subordinates the latitude to execute them according to the situation. One notable example is the 7th Panzer Division’s attempt to cross the Meuse River on May 13, 1940, during the campaign in France. The attempt failed despite Rommel’s personal intervention because, in his view, his subordinate officers “were appalled by their heavy losses and unwilling to press forward.” Ironically, while he typically expected nothing short of instant obedience from his own officers and men, he frequently disregarded his superiors’ orders, or creatively reinterpreted them so that they were less restrictive. Rommel’s practice contradicts the received view regarding the importance of Auftragstaktik in German military practice, and this contradiction is an issue historians have yet to examine more closely. Moreover, he habitually disregarded the physical and psychological limits of the personnel under his command, and deftly shifted blame for failure onto them to preserve his image. This habit inhibited his ability to conduct an objective analysis of his own shortcomings and style of command so as to increase his chances of success in the long-term. The cultivation of his image not only required constant attention; it also meant suppressing inconvenient truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rommel’s skills seem to have peaked at the battle of Gazala in June 1942, about one week before the first battle of El Alamein. For purposes of this essay, the events around El Alamein that took place between July 1, 1942, and November 4, 1942, are considered as three distinct battles. Although the battle of Gazala would end successfully, Rommel actually followed what for him had become a predictable scheme of maneuver: a wide envelopment of the British left flank, followed by an attack in the rear across the British lines of communication. The scheme pushed the Afrikakorps’ logistics to its extreme limit, and nearly caused a disaster. It is likely that Rommel’s style of leading from the front saved him from defeat in this case, as it enabled him to issue orders, and counter-orders, faster than his opponents. He operated inside his enemy’s decision cycle, to use one of today’s popular military expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most of the successes he enjoyed at Gazala and the subsequent assault on Tobruk were due to his foe’s ineptitude. During the encounters that took place in and around the “Cauldron” or “Sausage Pot” (May 30 to June 1, 1942), for example, Rommel had rashly maneuvered himself into a difficult situation: to his west he had a series of extensive minefields with half dozen fortified “boxes,” or strong points, occupied by dug-in infantry brigades, reinforced with tanks and artillery; while to his east he faced several British armored formations, some of which were equipped with the new American Grant tanks armed with powerful 75mm guns. A vigorous attack by the British commander, Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, might have crushed the Afrikakorps, which by this time had lost a third of its tanks and was desperately low on fuel. Instead, Ritchie threw his armor into the battle in piecemeal fashion, which enabled the Axis formations to fight and defeat them individually. To be saved from a desperate situation by the poor choices of one’s opponent is not the same as winning by demonstrating consummate skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobruk fell in the summer of 1942, and during the pursuit and exploitation that followed Rommel should have pushed his air cover forward. Otherwise, he would have little real hope of taking Cairo, or of holding anything he had gained, since he would be exposed to Allied air attack. Some analysts have argued that he ought to have paused to take Malta and strengthen his logistical situation, after all Axis forces required roughly 100,000 tons of supplies per month during the late summer and early autumn of 1942; but were only receiving half that much on average. However, establishing forward air cover was actually more critical since his forces were already exposed, and because Allied ground forces essentially operated free of the threat of Axis air attack. Rommel could not win the race to build up materiel, whether or not Malta was taken, and thus — by his own formula — he was becoming less capable of winning a war of movement. His operational intelligence, ground movement, and logistics’ flow suffered markedly due to the limited range of Axis air cover. Without forward air bases, he could not prevent his ground forces or their supply lines across Libya from being bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the point: as the Allies advanced into Italy in 1943, their air cover also leapfrogged to new bases and airfields in order to ensure adequate coverage for the next series of ground operations. The Allies’ task was, obviously, made easier by the fact that more of the Luftwaffe’s planes were being diverted to defend the German homeland from major bombing offensives. Still, modern warfare had evolved into a system by which the forward movement of ground forces was often driven by the need to capture another airfield, so that air cover could be extended to cover the next ground offensive, and so on. Fire and movement, always mutually reinforcing at the tactical level of war, had become similarly interdependent at the operational level of war as well. Rommel came to appreciate this fact far too late in the North African campaign (though he appears to have learned it by the battle for Normandy in 1944), and never took effective action to ensure his formations had adequate protection from Allied air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pursuit after Gazala, Rommel attempted to avoid drifting into a war of position by getting ahead of the retreating British; however, his lack of fuel, the fatigue of his men, and the state of their equipment prevented him from doing so. His troops were all but spent, having fought hard across 500 miles of desert; his tanks were low in fuel and ammunition, and badly in need of refitting. The Desert Fox, too, was mentally and physically drained, as were many of his subordinate commanders, notwithstanding the emotional boost that came from his promotion to Generalfeldmarschall in late June, and the Afrikakorps’ stunning success at Gazala. Fatigue and perhaps a bit of overconfidence led to hasty command decisions and poor staff coordination as the first battle of El Alamein began on July 1, 1942. Once again, Rommel overestimated the capabilities of his troops, while at the same time underestimating those of his foes. After three weeks of fighting, Rommel’s forces had lost 70 percent of their manpower, 85 percent of their armor, 65 percent of their anti-tank weapons, and 50 percent of their heavy anti-aircraft guns. Rommel found himself forced to transition from a war of movement, where his tight decision-cycle and his penchant for pushing his forces to their limits gave him an advantage, to a war of position, where superiority in numbers would tell. The uniqueness of the terrain around El Alamein and the rapidity with which British strength could grow meant that he would gradually lose his room to maneuver, and, thus, his ability to create chaos for his adversary. In addition, the Allies enjoyed an intelligence advantage through ULTRA that enabled them to read the coded messages sent between Rommel’s headquarters and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rommel renewed his offensive on August 30, 1942, which became known as the second battle of El Alamein, or Alam al-Halfa; but it was doomed from the start. Even though he allegedly scaled back his original objectives, he apparently retained high hopes of success. As he confided in his wife, Lucie: “I have worried so much about this day, but I am taking the risk because I will not have another chance, in terms of the moonlight and ratio of forces. So much is at stake. If I succeed, this may have a decisive effect on the course of the war.” Yet, Rommel’s plan of attack was very reminiscent of Gazala, so much so that the British did not need ULTRA to prepare for it. Rommel sent the Italian infantry in a pinning attack to the front, and directed the Afrikakorps to punch through a perceived 13-mile gap between the southern positions of the British forces and the Quattara Depression. They were then to attack across the coastal roads leading west into El Alamein, thereby severing British lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the predictability of the plan and the Allies’ advantages in strategic and operational intelligence, terrain, and materiel began to tell almost immediately. The attack bogged down, and Rommel called it off on September 4, 1942. General Montgomery received the credit for stopping the Axis advance; but his plan was essentially the same as that of his predecessor, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck. Montgomery’s success was ensured, so long as he avoided committing a blunder, such as allowing himself to be baited into counterattacking prematurely. With materiel preponderance, he had the luxury of time and could afford not to chase imaginative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Montgomery launched the final battle of El Alamein on October 23, 1942, Rommel was in Germany on much needed sick leave. He returned to North Africa on the evening of the 25th; but the battle was all but lost by then. Montgomery enjoyed a 2:1 superiority in manpower, a 3:1 superiority in aircraft, and more than a 4:1 superiority in medium tanks. The third clash at El Alamein was little more than a World War I battle of attrition; but it was one the Allies could afford to wage. To be sure, there were several crises that required Montgomery to exert his will over subordinate commanders who were not accustomed to pushing forward against enemy fire. However, the outcome of the battle was a matter of military science, the mathematics of attrition. Military art had little say, and could not change the result. The interdiction efforts of Allied air power had severely limited Rommel’s flow of supplies. Although he attempted to launch a few counterattacks, the deficiencies in fuel and ammunition were crippling. His army was overextended and egregiously exposed, as it had been since the first battle of El Alamein, though he and many of those around him chose to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, Rommel’s style of command, while often praised by military historians, was actually ill-suited to the conditions in which he found himself. It resembled the leadership style in vogue in the nineteenth century, where the timely appearance of the commander at the decisive point on the battlefield might tip the scales toward victory. However, in the twentieth century, command at higher levels required mastering and incorporating new dimensions, such as operational-level air support and theater-level intelligence, into one’s scheme of maneuver. Rommel did not fully incorporate those dimensions into his planning. To draw an analogy, Rommel was like a chess player who used the same combination of moves again and again, while neglecting to appreciate that the rules of the game had changed. He repeatedly went on the offensive with his armor and, though enjoying many tactical successes, fatally overextended his logistics and exceeded the range of his air cover. Hitler, rightly or wrongly, desired that the campaign in North Africa should have only a tertiary priority. Rommel was unwilling, or possibly unable, to function under such an inconsequential status. His conduct of the campaign in North Africa, and in particular the battles of El Alamein, illustrate the principal flaw in a way of war predicated on the idea that wars are won from the ground up — through tactical victories. In such an approach, strategy matters little and the influence of policy even less, for the power of tactical success seemingly trumps all. However, as Rommel’s example shows, his exquisite grammar had become detached from the larger logic of the war. His brilliant tactical successes failed to achieve anything of strategic value, and ultimately Hitler’s policy trumped them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last shots of Israel’s War for Independence were fired in early 1949. From January to July 1949 Israel negotiated separately with each of its Arab neighbours – Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria – to work out a political arrangement and an official cessation of hostilities. The first agreement was signed with Egypt in February 1949 and the last was signed with Syria in July of the same year. However, Israel’s hope that these agreements would be peace treaties or would, at least, become the first step leading to such treaties was disappointed. Concluding that a rematch was inevitable, Israel’s political and military leadership began to develop a grand-strategic doctrine and a strategic doctrine. These doctrines were not formulated in a single official document and did not develop in a single smooth trajectory. They developed in many debates, flashes of inspiration, and adapting in response to enemy activities. Different people had different ideas. Sometimes, it was who was sitting in which chair that was more important than the debates being conducted around the table. Changes in the manning of senior positions and lessons learned from specific events brought about changes in the concepts. However, it is not the purpose of the present article to describe all the twists and turns along the path, only to discuss a single event to which these doctrines were applied, achieved some success, but then failed – Israel’s war with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Lebanon, which culminated in the all-out Israeli offensive into Lebanon in 1982. The seeds of the decision to undertake this offensive were sown over thirty years earlier in the formulation of the aforementioned doctrines, and so the relevant aspects will be described in brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s first order of business after winning its War of Independence was not to prepare for future conflict, but rather to prepare for peace – building a society, an economy and a legal system, while simultaneously absorbing an enormous influx of immigrants from around the world, speaking different languages and living according to different cultural norms. However, very quickly it became clear that the War of Independence might be over officially but not in fact. Palestinian Arabs who had fled into neighbouring countries began to conduct forays into Israel. Some were innocent – people trying to collect possessions left behind, and some were criminal – theft of Israeli property in order to facilitate life in the refugee camps. Gradually they began to be more and more political, aiming simply to kill Israelis and cause damage to property. The Arab armies also conducted cross-border intelligence raids or tried to nibble bits of land away from Israel. Israel’s political and military leaders concluded that they were in fact facing two distinct threats, each of which required a different strategic approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fundamental Threat – an all-out offensive by an Arab army or combination of Arab armies. This required Israel to build an army capable of defeating any combination of Arab armies, despite being numerically inferior, without bankrupting Israel’s still fragile economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Routine Threat – the conduct of intermittent cross-border raids by small groups of guerrilla-style fighters or regular troops. These raids were not considered an existential threat in the sense of being able to physically destroy Israel, but Prime-Minister Ben-Gurion feared that they could destroy the self-confidence of the new immigrants, settling along the borders, and cause them to flee the country – thus achieving gradually what the Arab armies had failed to achieve in one fell swoop. Again, the solution had to be one that would not require massive expenditure of Israel’s limited manpower and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of Routine Security, developed through the 1950s, was the core of the decision to invade Lebanon in 1982. Israel’s initial strategy was defensive – army units were deployed in ambushes and patrols along the borders. This failed – there were not enough troops to cover more than a fraction of the border at any one moment. The next strategy was aptly named ‘An Eye For An Eye’. Following each Arab raid into Israel, the Israeli army conducted a raid aimed at causing similar casualties and damage across the border. This aroused an ethical argument in Israel, international condemnations, and failed to elicit the desired response – a reduction in Arab raids. So Israel’s leadership upped the ante – it decided to change the targets and retaliate more massively. The new target was Arab property, not people, but en masse. If an Israeli village was attacked then an Arab village was captured, evacuated and the houses destroyed. However, Arab raids continued unabated and the ethical problem was not solved, as became clear after the botched Kibya operation in autumn 1953, in which the Israeli force ordered the population to evacuate but, contrary to orders, did not search the houses to ensure that all had actually done so. 63 civilians died. The result was uproar in Israel and around the world. It was clear that this strategy was neither effective nor sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this point Israel had tried to achieve Routine Security by confronting the perpetrators (commonly known as Fedayeen) directly or by deterring them via retaliation raids. Both ways had failed. The Israelis could not find the Fedayeen in the field nor in their safe-havens, and the damage caused to the neighbouring Arab population did not really interest the Fedayeen because they were not from the same clans or families. The Israelis decided on a new strategy – they could not find the Fedayeen, but the governments of the host-states could. The new strategy was to compel the Arab governments to stop the attacks from their territory by retaliating for Fedayeen raids with counter-raids on the host-states’ military. Hopefully, repeated expensive defeats of their troops would shame the Arab governments and they would prefer to prevent further provocation of Israel. It took time, but the new strategy worked – Egypt was the first to gradually suspend Fedayeen activity through its border with Israel from the mid-1950s; then Syria, which, from the mid-1960s, continued to support Fedayeen activity but only if the actual raid was conducted through Jordan or Lebanon; and finally Jordan forcibly evicted the PLO from its territory in September 1970. Only the Lebanese border remained open for the Fedayeen raids. Encouraged by Syria, the Fedayeen had begun to gradually intensify their operations from Lebanon from the late 1960s. To the cross-border raids they added two new operational modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand-off fire – at first with short-range weapons and gradually with longer-ranged weapons culminating in the late 1970s with long-range field-guns and rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overseas raids – attacking Israelis and non-Israeli Jews in locations around the world. The most notorious attacks were the hijacking of civilian aircraft and the massacre in the 1972 Olympic games in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 1970s, fighting along Israel’s border with Lebanon had become an almost daily affair. In theory Israel had a proven strategic solution. However, this solution was not suitable to the Lebanese theatre. It depended on the host-state having a strong central government capable of imposing its political will, and if need be, military will on the Fedayeen. Lebanon did not have such a government. By the early 1970s Lebanon’s society and political system had unraveled. Established by the French to provide the local Christian community a state of their own, in which they were a majority, its political system had been designed on a sectarian-religious basis. However, by 1970 the Christians were no longer the majority. They were still the largest religious group, but smaller than any other two groups combined. The arrival of the PLO’s military forces in Lebanon had completely destroyed the last vestiges of Christian superiority over the other religious groups. Lebanon disintegrated into civil war. Each religious group battled the others for territory, political and economic benefits and clans within each group often battled each other for domination of the group. The Lebanese army disintegrated along religious lines. The strongest military force in Lebanon was the PLO – also divided into factions often battling each other. A new-old actor entered the Lebanese stage – Syria. Syria had always claimed that Lebanon was actually an integral part of Syria, illegitimately torn away by the departing French Empire. Covertly Syria had assisted the gradual dissolving of the Lebanese government’s control. Another Syrian interest in Lebanon was money. Lebanese banks, the international port of Beirut, Lebanese agriculture and industry – all were important to the well-being of Syria’s fragile agriculture-based economy. The civil war threatened Syria’s economy and Syria reacted by invading Lebanon. At first, the Syrian invasion was aimed to assist the Christians because they dominated most of the areas important to Syria. However, gradually, the Syrians began to assert their domination against the Christians and fighting broke out between them – the ratio of power ensuring a Syrian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-to-israel-in-the-early-1950s&quot;&gt;Back to Israel in the early 1950s&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine Security was an important issue, but Fundamental Security was considered more critical. It was clear that Israel could never match the size of her neighbours’ military forces. Foreign powers refused to sell anything other than second-hand, mostly well-worn, World War Two vintage equipment to Israel, so it was also fairly clear that Israel could not achieve technological superiority. During 1950 – 1953 a series of tactical disasters in Routine Security operations seemed to show that even the Israel Defence Forces’ superiority in tactics and fighting spirit no longer existed. The Israel Defence Forces’ senior command addressed the quality issue in various ways not relevant to this article. What is relevant is that during this period Prime Minister Ben-Gurion advanced the idea of an ‘Alliance of Minorities’. The Jews were not the only ethnic minority struggling to float in the stormy sea of the Moslem Arab world: the Copts in Egypt, the Kurds and the Druze in Syria, the Kurds in Iraq and the Maronite Christians and the Druze in Lebanon. An ‘Alliance of Minorities’ would strengthen each separate minority in its own private struggle by splitting the attention and resources of the Moslem Arab states between a number of simultaneous conflicts. Israel’s main benefit would be that the Arab states would be hard put to enact the worst nightmare of Israel’s military leaders – called the ‘Everybody Scenario’, an organized alliance of all the Arab states conducting a simultaneous properly planned assault on Israel. As it turned out, the idea was stillborn. The Copts proved completely incapable of organizing effectively to further their political agenda. The Kurds were similarly split into rival factions, though from the early 1960s until 1975 the Iraqi Kurds managed to conduct an insurgency that diverted most of Iraq’s attention to them and away from Israel. The Druze and the Maronites were not interested. The Maronites were the only non-Jewish minority with a state of their own and saw no threat that required them to befriend Israel. However, as the situation in Lebanon gradually developed against them they turned to Israel for help. Though officially the idea of the ‘Alliance of Minorities’ had been shelved, the principle that helping another minority would help Israel remained – as in the case of the Iraqi Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gradually worsening plight of the Maronites also triggered another Israeli ideological concept. One of the main complaints of the Jews following the Second World War was that they had been abandoned by the world to suffer the Holocaust. Even requests for small, relatively cheap actions that could have partially alleviated the plight of the Jews suffering Nazi persecution (such as the bombing of Auschwitz Extermination Camp which would have slowed the killing-machine) had been refused. When faced with cries for help from a religious minority, ostensibly about to suffer decimation and persecution, Israel’s political leaders were incapable of denying assistance. Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad and the Israel Defence Forces were ordered to provide equipment and training and occasional military action to support the Maronites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1980 some of Israel’s political and military leaders were already beginning to formulate a new strategy for solving the Lebanese conundrum. The new strategy was based on a series of assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason the Christians had lost power in Lebanon was the arrival of the PLO after it had been forcibly ejected from Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Destruction of the PLO’s military power and evicting its political infrastructure from Lebanon would enable the Christians to reassume their position as the dominant group in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evicting Syrian military forces out of Lebanon would also be required.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Christians would gratefully acknowledge Israel’s assistance in achieving their political goals by signing a full peace treaty with Israel – the second Arab state to do so (after Egypt) – and prevent the return of the Palestinian political and military leaders to Lebanon, thus terminating the Routine Threat on this front too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s Minister of Defence at the time, Ariel Sharon, hoped that the successful result would also cascade into other theatres of conflict: removal of the PLO’s political and military infrastructure from its last contact with Israel’s border would fatally weaken its standing among the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states in general. This would also enable Jordan to sign a peace treaty with Israel, leaving only one Arab state on Israel’s border, a defeated Syria, alone in its refusal to accept Israel but far too weak to do anything about it. However, implementing the new strategy required a particular set of political conditions that would legitimize such an offensive in the eyes of the Israeli public and the world at large – especially Israel’s only ally, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 1981, and again in March and in April, the PLO initiated a series of artillery attacks on northern Israel, each lasting a few days. In late April, following the indiscriminate bombardment by the Syrian army of the Lebanese Christian town of Zakhle, Israel threatened to intervene against Syria. To put the point across forcefully, the Israeli air force was ordered to shoot down two Syrian helicopters flying near Zakhle. The Syrians responded by violating a tacitly agreed ‘red-line’ – they deployed a number of Surface-to-Air Missile batteries in Lebanon. Only American diplomatic pressure stopped Israel from immediately attacking these missile batteries. Meanwhile, on June 7th, while the diplomatic exchange was still in progress and tensions high, Israel surprised the world by destroying Iraq’s new nuclear reactor. On July 9th the Palestinians again fired a salvo of rockets into northern Israel. Over the next two weeks Israel and the PLO exchanged fire, and Israel prepared to conduct a large-scale strategic punitive raid into southern Lebanon. An attempt by the Syrian air force to intercept Israeli aircraft over Lebanon resulted in a Syrian aircraft being shot down. An Israeli air-strike on a Palestinian headquarters in Beirut accidentally killed and injured many civilians living around the target. This prompted American intervention, which brought about a ceasefire. However, the exact agreement was not clear. The Palestinians claimed the ceasefire was only for the Lebanese-Israel border and they were free to attack everywhere else. This left Israel at a disadvantage since it could be attacked almost anywhere but could not respond because all of the Palestinian’s political and military infrastructure was in Lebanon. From August 1981 to May 1982 the Palestinians conducted 248 attacks in Israel and overseas. Israel responded with threats and troop deployments, but each time backed-off. In March 1982 and again in April Israel retaliated with air-strikes in Lebanon, and the Palestinians fired dozens of rockets from Lebanon into Israel, though aimed mostly at unpopulated areas so as not to over-antagonize Israel. On June 3, 1982 Palestinians shot the Israeli ambassador in Britain. Israel retaliated again with air-strikes in Beirut and the Palestinians again fired rockets into Israel. On June 5th, after two days of mutual firing, the Israeli government decided that it would not tolerate a repeat of the previous summer’s artillery duel. The Israeli Defence Forces were ordered to invade Lebanon and capture all the terrain from the border to just beyond the extreme range of the Palestinian artillery – that is to say, to advance to a line that was nowhere closer than approximately 40 kilometers to the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the supporters of the new strategy described above had received the ‘go ahead’ to implement it. In fact, they had not. Implementation of the strategy required the Israeli army to reach and capture Beirut – that was where all of the political infrastructure and leadership and most of the military infrastructure were located. It also required the Syrians to be either maneuvered into withdrawing from Lebanon or defeated and forced out. Both were well beyond the objective defined by the government. Minister of Defence Sharon faced two tactical problems to implement the new strategy: the political problem of convincing the government to increase the scope of the operation and convincing the public to support this; and the military problem of conducting the operation in disjointed phases as the government gradually allowed each extension of the operation, thus allowing the enemy time to recover, reorganize, reinforce and gradually comprehend the operational plan, making each succeeding phase harder to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli offensive began at noon on June 6th. Sharon gradually overcame both tactical problems but the price was that an operation planned to last a few days stretched to a number of weeks, then a few months. This stretching produced new problems. Politically, it allowed internal and foreign resistance to the operation to build up. As the war dragged on, parts of the Israeli public began to question the validity of the decision to initiate it and foreign powers began to intervene diplomatically. Militarily, the cost in casualties rose and further fueled the growing resistance in Israel to maintain the effort – the first mass Israeli demonstration against the war occurred on July 4th. However, despite all problems, the military objective was partially achieved towards the end of August – the PLO agreed to leave Lebanon and was shipped to Tunisia, and overt Syrian presence was removed from Beirut-proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time had come to implement the second political phase – handing power back to a Christian-dominated government. The Israelis withdrew from parts of Beirut. The Lebanese conducted elections on August 23rd and Israel’s ally Bashir Jumayel, head of the largest Christian party, was elected to be the President of Lebanon. Israel’s strategy, as interpreted and implemented by Defence Minister Sharon, had prevailed. Then, suddenly, everything began to unravel. It quickly became clear that the Palestinians had covertly left a portion of their fighters in Beirut to conduct a guerrilla campaign against the Israelis. Having promised not to enter certain areas in Beirut, the Israelis demanded that the Lebanese government prove its ability to handle the common enemy on its own. However, on September 14th Syrian intelligence operatives assassinated President Jumayel. He was replaced by his brother Amin – who was understandably less willing to actually implement the agreements his dead brother had with Israel. Meanwhile, the Jumayel’s private military militia, tasked with clearing Palestinian guerrillas from two Palestinian neighbourhoods in Beirut – Sabra and Shatilla, avenged the death of their leader by massacring a few hundred Palestinians. Though conducted by Lebanese Christians the massacre was blamed on Israel – not just around the world, but also inside Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis – nearly 10% of the Jewish population, gathered in the largest ever demonstration in Israel to protest the fact that the Israeli army had not prevented the massacre. Lastly, Israel’s outright support for the Maronite Christians reassuming full power in Lebanon did not sit well with the other ethnic groups – the Sunnis, the Shiites and the Druze. Initially many members of these groups had supported the Israeli invasion, greeting Israeli soldiers with flowers and rice. Now they began to attack the Israelis. Leading these attacks were two Shiite parties – Amal (the larger of the two) and Hizbullah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary political and military objective of the war had been achieved – the PLO had been evicted from its last stronghold directly in contact with Israeli territory. It could no longer conduct cross-border attacks on Israel proper. However, the secondary political object, though seeming at first to be in hand, was lost. The single bomb that killed Bashir Jumayel proved to be more powerful than all the thousands of bombs and shells fired by the Israelis. The Syrians remained in control of Lebanon. An Israeli judicial committee sacked Sharon for failing to prevent the massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. The Israelis did not give up immediately. But gradually, as casualties mounted and it became clear that their continued presence in Lebanon was not going to achieve their second political objective of obtaining a peace treaty with Lebanon, they decided to cut their losses and make do with a half-win. The withdrawal was gradual and completed in 1985. To secure their border, the Israelis organized a buffer-zone held by the South Lebanese Army – a militia manned by local volunteers from southern Lebanon, funded, equipped and trained by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s withdrawal was accepted by all the Lebanese militias fighting against them as well as terminating the war – all except Hizbullah. For approximately 18 months the fighting subsided as Hizbullah grew from a small almost insignificant group into a major player, and then began a guerrilla-style offensive on the Israeli buffer-zone, forcing the Israelis to reinforce the South Lebanese Army with Israeli units. It seemed that Israel’s decisive defeat of the PLO had only achieved a brief reprieve and simply replaced the enemy at the gates. Against this new enemy the Israelis had no clear policy and no clear strategy other than to stick it out at the least cost possible in blood and resources. They continued to do this until 2000, when they withdrew from the buffer-zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, from the mid-1950s Israel’s ultimate strategy against the Routine Threat was to punish the host-states until they prevented hostile actions from their territory. This strategy was not possible in Lebanon because the Lebanese government was too weak. In attempting to manufacture a strong Lebanese government Israel invaded Lebanon and evicted the PLO and then, in accordance with the concept of the ‘Alliance of Minorities’, tried to hand over power to the Lebanese Christians – thus alienating the other Lebanese religious groups. Moreover, the Israelis misjudged the Christians’ political and military strength relative to these other Lebanese groups – even with Israeli backing the Christians were no longer capable of ruling Lebanon. Three years later – in 1985 – under continuous attack, hundreds of additional casualties, and billions of shekels worth of resources more than planned, the Israelis decided to cut their losses and they withdrew. Not properly adapted to Lebanon – Israel’s strategy had failed to achieve more than a partial victory. This, it turned out, was just the beginning of a new war, with a new enemy (Hizbullah) upon the same turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last half decade since arriving at West Point to teach history after three years of Cavalry Squadron command (one of those years in combat in west Baghdad in 2006) I have made a sustained argument in many published works about the primacy of strategy over tactics in war. My argument has basically said that if a state gets its strategy right in war then the tactics of war will fall into place. However, I argued simplistically and wrongly, if a state fails at strategy, then no amount of tactical excellence can save a war fought under a botched strategy. I began to develop this argument in response to a certain narrative that had formed since the Surge of Troops in Iraq in 2007. That narrative offered the attractive proposition that the US Army had failed at the tactics of counterinsurgency in Iraq from 2003 to 2006 but then the army was saved by an enlightened general named David Petraeus who turned his army around, got it doing the tactics of counterinsurgency right, and Iraq was put on the path to success thus giving Iraqis, in Petraeus’s own words, a “new hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe the Iraq Surge triumph narrative is misleading. Petraeus as a general performed in essentially the same way as his predecessor General George Casey, and there was no radical shift in operational method between the Surge army and what came before. Instead, violence in Iraq dropped by the end of 2007 primarily for other reasons, such as the spread of the Anbar Awakening, the effects of the previous two years of sectarian warfare, and the shia militia decision to stand down attacks. There is a growing body of analytical literature to support this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I also believe that I have become somewhat dogmatic in my sustained argument about the primacy of strategy over tactics. Last year while giving a lunchtime keynote address at a history conference at Columbia University in New York City where I made the argument of the primacy of strategy over tactics, Professor Anders Stephanson, a scholar of American diplomatic and political history at Columbia, pushed back in the ‘question and answer’ period by saying that my argument was “a-historical.” In the weeks following my lecture I reflected on what he said and concluded that he was right. If by rule strategy is always more important than tactics, then the logic of that rule is that tactics in war simply don’t matter. But they do. Any military historian worth his or her salt knows that sometimes in war tactics mean a lot, and wars can be lost by failing at tactics. Consider Louis XIV and the War of Spanish Succession from 1701 to 1713. Louis’s aims in the Low Countries were not stymied by poor strategy but more so by generals who were unable to fight effectively with the emerging technologies and tactics of early modern linear warfare. In fact, if Louis had been asked which one was more important during the war of Spanish Succession he almost certainly would have said tactical competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such a nuance of historical understanding was buried by my rule of the primacy of strategy over tactics. By establishing as a rule the primacy of strategy over tactics I have turned into what historians most often fear: the social scientist and the constructionist of models, which lead to the cherry picking of history to confirm the model. I found myself using historical examples that conformed to my rule. My favorite example to support the rule of the primacy of strategy over tactics was the German army in World War II. Probably one of the finest industrialized tactical fighting forces the world had ever seen, I argued, that all of their tactical excellence could not rescue Germany from a dysfunctional strategy and morally perverse policy under Nazism. True enough of course for Germany and World War II, but for the historian just because something is true in one part of history, does not mean it is true for it all. This is what historians call contingency and the uniqueness of historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being slaved to my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics also caused me to fail at one of the hallmarks of good scholarly history: factual accuracy. Here is what happened to me. About three years ago when I was arguing forcefully that better tactics did not turn the war in Vietnam around under Abrams, nor in Iraq did enlightened counterinsurgency tactics under Petraeus turn that war around either, I came across a quote that was apparently made by Sun Tzu. “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory, but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” That reported Sun Tzu quote summed it all up for me in one short, clear, and brilliantly insightful phrase. Get your strategy right and the tactics will fall into place. Get your strategy wrong, however, and tactical excellence is only noise. But Sun Tzu never said it. To be sure it is an apocryphal quote where people believe Sun Tzu said it, though being apocryphal is different from established fact. I had become trapped by my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics and Sun Tzu’s reported quote seemed to sum it up so nicely with the weight of history and the power of the philosophy of Sun Tzu behind it, that I failed as a historian to check the actual primary source, The Art of War, to see if he actually said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the seductive power of social scientific models: they order and rationalize things so well and explain present day problems so neatly. For me, the principle of the primacy of strategy over tactics in war became an unalterable rule, which history and my own writings of it had to conform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have seen the errors of my ways and am recovering from the addiction of a rule-bound model that overly simplifies the past. My recovery was aided, naturally, through the study of history and teaching it in the classroom. It is not that I have come to believe that tactics matter most in war, or that tactical excellence can save failed strategy. Instead, through the study and teaching of history I have come to see that tactics do matter, sometimes a lot, and battles matter too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Washington and the year 1776 in the American Revolution come to mind. It was a difficult year for the Continental Army, Washington, and the Revolution itself. The previous year saw a string of apparent American victories by militia forces at Lexington-Concord and at Bunker Hill. But in 1776 the British became focused and allocated resources toward crushing the rebellion. Thus, the Continental army under Washington felt the full weight of British imperial power at the Battle of Long Island, White Plains, and the embarrassing retreat of Washington and his Continentals across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington’s army was poor at tactics relative to British regulars, and the general knew it. Let’s play with history here a bit. Let us say we went back in time, put ourselves down in Washington’s headquarters in November 1776 – as his army was in tatters – and we told him of two famous aphorisms about counterinsurgency warfare from the modern world. First, that strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat. Second, that in an insurgency (like the American Revolution) the insurgent wins if he doesn’t lose. I think Washington would have laughed at those two aphorisms. He would have scratched his head and said my big problem right now at this point in time is not strategy, but the simple fact that my army can’t fight effectively at the tactical level, and it has shown at such battles as Long Island in August 1776. He would have also been puzzled by the concept of simply not losing, for Washington knew that to maintain the morale of his army and the citizenry, there came a time when he needed to win a battle or two. I think he would have also said that at least in his war bad tactics could lose the war for him, and conversely that tactical excellence was a key component to rebel victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the present. If I had stuck with my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics it would have led me to a false understanding of Washington’s situation in late 1776 and the criticality of tactical performance of his army. I would have concluded that for Washington tactics simply didn’t matter, as long as he got his strategy right. In a sense this is what American counterinsurgency expert John Nagl, sometimes whimsically called a Coindinista by American investigative reporter Carl Prine, did in his 2005 book Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam. He constructed a model that said if an army learns and adapts following a certain set of steps, and if it has as a certain end point of learning – call it the perfection of population centric counterinsurgency – then it can win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that model in hand Nagl undertook a study of the British in Malaya and the United States in Vietnam. Using his model of organizational learning as a template Nagl concluded that the British in Malaya followed his model and therefore they won, and the American’s didn’t follow his model and therefore they lost. It is a strikingly clever and seductive conclusion and one that led many to take that very template and apply it to Iraq and Afghanistan. But it is also a conclusion that horribly distorts the past and one fundamentally not supported by primary evidence. In so trying to make his model work Nagl severely misinterpreted Clausewitz and Jomini. He then went on to distort history by characterizing 18th Century warfare as made up of single battles “that often decided a war.” Yet the historian is hard pressed to find even one example of such a battle that ended a war during that age. More importantly Nagl’s apparent addiction to his model led him to misunderstand the two wars of Malaya and Vietnam. In the former the concern of senior British leaders was never really about the Army’s performance but of the Malayan police. And in Vietnam, the primary evidence shows quite well that the American Army followed Nagl’s learning model to a tee, but the US still lost the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such are the perils of social scientific models when applied to the past in an attempt to explain it through history. In my journey back from the dark side and addiction of social scientific model through the study of history I believe that I have come to a more balanced understanding of the relationship between strategy and tactics in war. Generally speaking, history does show the importance of good strategy in war and that if it is not done right dubious results will often follow. But history also shows that bad tactics can cause a state to lose a war, or at least cause it to modify its original war aims. And I also think that in some historical cases one can find examples of where a war was fought with a faulty strategy but solid tactics from the start generated opportunities for strategy to reform itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have jettisoned my rule-bound model of the primacy of strategy over tactics in war, I still believe that the problems America faces in Afghanistan today are widely tied to a broken strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekaran writes in his new book on Afghanistan, Little America, of a war fought by the United States that has seen buckets and buckets of wasted energy and effort, bungled military operations, dysfunctional command and organizational structures, and naïve, misguided priorities. To be sure the American war in Afghanistan has seen those things from the very start, just like in Iraq. But wars in general and the militaries that fight them are never models of efficiency – far from it. The Prussian philosopher of war Carl von Clausewitz in his seminal book, On War, first published in 1832, introduced the idea of “friction” in war. Since wars are fought between peoples and militaries with opposing wills in the realm of death and destruction, friction has the effect of making seemingly smooth running military organizations quite imperfect, and at times, dysfunctional. The American military in Afghanistan in this regard is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider some examples from military history. In the American Civil War the Union Army’s command structure never produced efficient staffs at the higher levels to adequately convey orders and plans to subordinate units, and the Confederates were even worse. Nor did the Union Army prioritize its resources in the most efficient way throughout the war, as evident in its telegraph systems being concentrated solely at the highest levels of command and never really making their way down to where the telegraph could have assisted lower level commanders. Moreover, the Union Army, arguably, never really got its organizational structures for combat right. It never developed a powerful striking force of all arms that could exploit victories in battle to make them truly decisive. Union commanding General George Meade at Gettysburg had soundly defeated Lee’s army but since he lacked a powerful counteroffensive force of cavalry and infantry and artillery he could not destroy Lee’s Army through exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, prior to the Normandy invasion, the American Army under General Omar Bradley had badly conceived the use of airpower to destroy German defensive positions on the bluffs overlooking Omaha Beach. There was an assumption that American high-flying strategic bombers would pulverize the beach defensives so that when the 29th and 1st Infantry Divisions landed they would easily move off of the beach and on to the high ground. But airpower did not have the assumed effect so that the plan that the assaulting divisions carried out went dreadfully wrong, and there was a high payment in blood as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in both cases — the Union Army in the Civil War and the American Army at the Normandy landings — the wars were fought under a broader strategic framework that made sense. When a state gets its strategy right in war, problems with tactics, organizational structures and procedures, and even problems with generalship tend to be subsumed and improved within a functioning and rational strategy. The Union Army in the American Civil War and the American Army in World War II, to be sure, had their fair share of “friction” but good strategy smoothed those problems out in the end. What Chandrasekeran essentially exposes in his new book on the Americans in Afghanistan is nothing new in war: friction. But when a state fights a war under a botched strategy — as the United States is currently doing in Afghanistan — without that umbrella of a functioning strategy then such friction is exposed to, and laid bare with, nothing higher for cover. Without good strategy the flaws and dysfunction that Chandrasekeran exposes is seen as instrumental noise, but without the melody of music — good strategy — to make sense out of it and give it direction and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Sun Tzu never said “strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat,” he did actually say something similar in The Art of War about the meaning and relative worth of strategy and tactics in war: “All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer,” argued Sun Tzu, “but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with American strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan is that everyone could see the tactics of counterinsurgency, but as they saw them they also saw the strategy. And therein ultimately rests a profound point of which history teaches, and that can’t be reduced into a simplistic, social science rule. In some wars there may be times where tactics, in terms of relative importance, are more important than strategy. But as long as strategy is seen for what it is, and viewed in a separate light, then it can employ effectively tactical action. But let the two become one, as in Iraq and Afghanistan where it was not uncommon to hear pundits and generals referring to a “counterinsurgency strategy,” then we have lost the bubble on the proper relationship between tactics and strategy in war and the end result is nothing more than a hopeless strategic muddle that wastes blood and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Sun Tzu said another thing about the temporal aspect of war: “ There is no instance of a country having been benefited from prolonged warfare.” By merging the tactics of American counterinsurgency with strategy in Afghanistan, the United States has allowed its military to adhere to a tactical imperative of counterinsurgency — that counterinsurgency campaigns take a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting in 2010 on how long the United States would be in Afghanistan, General Petraeus said, “this is the kind of fight we’re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids’ lives.” With regard to his strategic assessment of Afghanistan relative to Sun Tzu’s aphorism of the perils of protracted war for states, General Petraeus was wildly off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is a calculation of strategy, and good strategy in Afghanistan should have discerned long ago that such an investment of time combined with massive amounts of blood and treasure was simply not worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.militarystrategymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/73.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resources that the United States allocates to national security inspire awe. The precise amount spent annually is open to debate—among other things, the figure arrived at is impacted considerably by what percentage of national debt payments are counted (reflecting past spending) and how factors like equipment depreciation and pensions (which will impact future spending) are treated. In any case, however, the expenditures are staggering—sufficient, for example, to cover the entire cost of Alexander the Great’s bid for global hegemony many times over. Unlike Alexander’s Macedon, however, the United States does not typically win its wars anymore — the US military history of the past half century largely is a dismal tale of outright loss (the Vietnam War), de facto defeat (the Afghanistan War), and Pyrrhic-victory-at-best (the Iraq War). There are exceptions, of course — most notably, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, as well as are a variety of small wars against powers ranging from the minor to the microscopic; the latter category includes the Kosovo War, the invasions of Panama and Grenada, and similar operations. Nevertheless, the general arc is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US armed services are an extraordinary strategic instrument, and have been throughout the period under discussion. The image of the US Army in Vietnam as a drug-addled rabble owes more to urban legends about the supposed ubiquity of officer “fraggings” and the script of the decidedly fictional Apocalypse Now than actual history. The US military, particularly the Army, did suffer discipline problems in the Vietnam era, mostly in the later years of the war with rear-echelon units and, especially, ones stationed outside of Vietnam itself. The services responded to this by implementing successful reforms that purged the ranks of troublemakers and reimposed discipline. Yet, the excellence of the US military itself does not guarantee strategic success; indeed, a paradox of the sort which Edward N. Luttwak described in his classic Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace bedevils Washington: because their military is such an impressive tool, American civilian leaders feel a great temptation to use it, and they do so too liberally, often without having carefully and realistically weighed the likely long-term consequences of military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fighting second and third-rate enemies, operational excellence generally is sufficient to avoid complete humiliation in the short-term; the US military is sufficiently competent that it has not allowed an enemy to win a major tactical victory since the Korean War. The Tet Offensive of 1968, though widely perceived as a defeat for the United States, in fact was perhaps its greatest battlefield victory of the conflict: the indigenous Viet Cong suffered a bloodletting from which it never recovered, and the revolution in the South effectively was crushed. From that point forward, keeping the war alive required ongoing very large-scale infiltration by North Vietnamese forces (People’s Army of Vietnam – PAVN). The Iraqi and Afghan enemies of the United States have failed even to win a dubious victory of the sort enjoyed by the Viet Cong: they have proven incapable of overwhelming all but the smallest US units. When they have attempted to do so, as the Taliban did in the early months of the Afghan conflict, they have suffered accordingly, as their efforts played directly to the defining US military strength from the Second World War onward: quickly bringing crippling firepower to bear against enemy targets. Thus, both Iraqi and Afghan insurgents had little choice but to rely on terroristic tactics, killing and wounding American troops through sniping, the planting of improvised explosive devices, and similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ending-wars-afghanistan-and-iraq&quot;&gt;Ending Wars: Afghanistan and Iraq&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of these foes to win large-scale battlefield victories against US forces, however, did not make strategic success impossible for them. Indeed, it could even be said to have encouraged them to focus their efforts on a dimension of war in which they enjoyed a singular advantage over Washington: time. The Vietnam and Afghanistan Wars are dissimilar in many obvious respects, but alike insofar as both involve the United States fighting an expeditionary war on foreign territory against non-great power foes. These circumstances clearly are distinct from those facing Washington in many of its other conflicts; for instance, the Second World War provides a vivid contrast. From mid-December 1941 onward, it was entirely obvious even to the most politically disinterested American that a crushing military and political victory was the only acceptable outcome to the war in which the United States had finally become formally engaged. The precise character of that victory might be debatable — whether something less than unconditional Axis surrender might be contemplated, for instance — but, in any case, the war must not end with either the Japanese Empire in command of the Western Pacific and the Rimland of Asia or a hostile Nazi superpower consolidating its control over the bulk of the resources, industry, and population of the European continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnam War was a more vague endeavor. Certainly, the United States government was attempting to prevent South Vietnam (more formally, the Republic of Vietnam – RVN) from falling to communist control, and — aside from the more radical elements of the left and the tiny surviving remnants of the isolationist right — there was broad public agreement that the United States should resist the spread of communism in general and Soviet and Chinese power in particular. Whether it was especially important that the RVN survive was, however, a rather more difficult question — indeed, over time discussion increasingly shifted away from the importance of the country itself and focused on whether its collapse would damage US credibility as a protecting power more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive for the US occupation of Afghanistan was plain — the Taliban’s refusal to surrender Osama Bin Laden and his associates in a prompt and appropriately contrite manner — but what precisely the United States is attempting accomplish now in that country is not altogether clear. The fantasy that Afghanistan could be turned into a stable democracy has long since evaporated. At this point, it seems that President Obama is repeating the experience of his predecessor Richard Nixon: saddled with a unpopular and apparently endless war which he did not begin, he is mainly trying to avoid national (and personal) disgrace and wind down US involvement on acceptable terms. President Nixon, however, was in a somewhat superior position for an ironic reason: he and his subordinate Henry Kissinger were negotiating the American exit from Vietnam with the icy leaders of a totalitarian enemy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout most of the Vietnam conflict, the United States fought in a very constrained fashion. The Johnson Administration — deeply fearful of the possibility that China might enter the war and enamored of the notion that “graduated escalation” was the appropriate methodology for attaining US goals at minimal risk — always conducted the war diffidently. The United States even left much of Hanoi, not only the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) but also its most important industrial city, and the port of Haiphong, the key point of entry for the Soviet and Chinese war materiel that made the PAVN’s expeditionary conflict possible, untouched by its bombing campaign, despite having the ability to devastate both cities at will. Throughout most of his first term, the Nixon Administration was more assertive than Johnson’s in some respects — undertaking, for example, Operation Menu, the bombing of North Vietnamese troops and facilities in Cambodia in 1969-70; however, it largely continued the American policy of caution in the use of violence against the North. The results were as unimpressive as one might expect, but by early 1972, the Administration’s successful efforts to effect a rapprochement with China had given the president the confidence to increase the military pressure on Hanoi through efforts such as the mining of Haiphong Harbor and initiation of the Linebacker I bombing campaign, which hit a range of previously excluded targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Hanoi’s massive 1972 operational push (called the “Easter Offensive” by the Americans), was broken, with very heavy losses to the PAVN in both men and materiel. From August 1969 onward, Kissinger and his DRV counterpart, Le Duc Tho, had held secret negotiating sessions, but following the collapse of the offensive the prospects for a settled peace appeared especially promising. By October, the general outlines of a US-DRV peace agreement existed, but Hanoi remained cagy, still seeking favorable revisions and refusing to finalize an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 1972, Nixon won an impressive electoral victory over Democratic Party nominee George McGovern, but the president nevertheless was rightly concerned about the possibility that the incoming Congress, with Democratic majorities in both houses and a very strong Congressional “peace wing” which included many liberal Republicans, might undermine his efforts to achieve a favorable peace. At the same time, Saigon opposed any peace settlement that did not contain various concessions — such as the recognition of the South Vietnam as a separate, sovereign state by the DRV — that Hanoi certainly would not grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given his temporarily strong but nonetheless precarious position, Nixon decided on the risky gambit of giving the DRV a very sharp shove — the massive Linebacker II bombing campaign. The campaign that occurred from 18-29 December (interrupted in the middle by a 36-hour stand-down for Christmas Day) was operationally devastating. The United States took significant losses — including the shooting down of fifteen B-52s and significant damage to several others — but North Vietnam was gravely wounded, its air defenses largely destroyed and its highly sophisticated logistics network (briefly) wrecked. Nixon’s gamble succeeded: in January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Afghan equivalent of the government in Hanoi: the forces undermining Afghan stability are a motley collection of tribal warlords, religious fanatics, drug lords, kleptocrats, Pakistani intriguers, and generic thugs. Many individual actors fall into more than one of these categories. Moreover, unlike the leadership of the DRV, many of them lack the intellectual discipline necessary to make prudent strategic decisions; the generals running Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) appear to have a special genius for devising elaborate plots, which invariably backfire and cause chaos in Pakistan itself. Given all this, even if Obama possessed the will to unleash violence on a Nixonian scale, it would make no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest equivalent to the DRV perhaps is the government of Pakistan, but of course it formally is a US ally. The practical reality is considerably more complex — Islamabad is more enemy than ally — but, even leaving aside all considerations of global diplomacy and US domestic political opinion, violence directed against the Pakistani government would be deeply counterproductive. The simple truth is that Afghan stability is not especially important to the overall security of the United States; however, Pakistani stability is important, particularly insofar as that country possesses a sizable nuclear arsenal which might fall into very unsavory hands if Pakistan collapses into anarchy. Thus, it would unwise to take any action that might fatally damage the chronically unhealthy government of Pakistan. Even if that worst-case scenario did not transpire, it would certainly be undesirable if one or more of the factions within Pakistan’s military leadership – angry and humiliated by US action – decided to ramp up their efforts to undermine US interests. The apparent links between the ISI and the terrorists who conducted the 2008 Mumbai attacks serve as a stark illustration of how spectacularly imprudent many Pakistani policymakers are; if sufficiently motivated, they might even attempt to organize attacks on US embassies or other targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from Pakistan, there is no potential negotiating partner remotely worthy of the name. The United States already has accepted the indignity of negotiating with the Taliban, but its efforts to negotiate an acceptable peace ultimately will prove futile. The Taliban is not a unified body, but rather a set of factions loosely united by ethnicity (as an instrument of Pashtun supremacism in Afghanistan), religious obscurantism, and a loathing of the West and its values. Even if a peace agreement is extracted from “the Taliban”, factional rivalry soon will render it worthless. Thus far, both the Obama Administration and its Republican opponents apparently are unwilling to accept – regardless of precisely how the US ends the war – that it already has been lost. American withdrawal (correctly) will be perceived globally as an operational retreat reflecting a strategic (and policy) failure — the collapse of the US effort to craft even a modestly convincing imitation of a modern, democratic, and secure Afghan state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was possible to craft a better outcome to Vietnam, and the Nixon Administration did so. The Paris Peace Accords hardly reflected a stunning US victory and, indeed, were somewhat embarrassing — particularly the tacit acceptance of a permanent PAVN presence in South Vietnam and the refusal of the DRV to recognize that country’s legitimacy — but their terms, if enforced, insured an (admittedly very imperfect) US strategic victory in Vietnam. The core US goal was the survival of a non-communist South Vietnam and the core DRV goal was the absorption of that country — therefore, at the time that the treaty was signed there was every reason to believe that the United States had won the Vietnam War, just as it had in essence won the Korean War. These were frustratingly incomplete victories, but ones that allowed for the survival of a weak post-colonial Asian ally confronted by a stronger communist counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paris Peace Accords did not permit a continuing US military presence of the sort still ongoing in South Korea — but, given the US domestic political atmosphere of the time, the maintenance of a large US military force in South Vietnam would not have been feasible in any event. South Vietnam, however, was not without the ability to defend itself — the serious “Vietnamization” efforts of the Nixon era had shown considerable success. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) did not have the man-for-man fighting power of the US Army of the day, but neither did the PAVN. The question was whether it was good enough to insure the RVN’s survival even against an invasion on the scale of the 1972 Easter Offensive. The answer almost surely was “yes,” provided that two conditions were met: first, continued provision of ample financial and military aid to the South; second, direct US military intervention should the DRV ignore the Accords and mount a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Vietnam, however, was then doomed by a bizarre series of events. The Nixon of January 1973 was a respected global statesman with a domestic stature sufficient to enforce the Accords militarily, if need be — but the Watergate scandal soon thereafter began to corrode his status radically. In June, a much-weakened Nixon was compelled to accept a (constitutionally very questionable, as it seriously constrained the president’s authority as the commander-in-chief) ban on the expenditure of funds for military operations in Southeast Asia after 15 August 1973. The following year he resigned office, and the 1974 Congressional elections resulted in a Congressional majority strongly inclined to starve Saigon of aid. As the PAVN offensive gained momentum in early 1975, President Gerald Ford faced a bleak choice. He could have ordered the American military to intervene on behalf of the RVN, thus directly challenging Congress’ attempt to hamstring the commander in chief. Doing so, however, would have caused the greatest US constitutional crisis since the Civil War. Alternately, he could observe helplessly as strategic gains made at the cost of tens of billions of dollars, and nearly 60,000 US (and hundreds of thousands of allied) lives were tossed away. When all factors, domestic and international, are considered, he probably was wise to choose the latter course. The fact that the US Congress obliged him to make the decision, however, was an act of shocking strategic irresponsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end game in Afghanistan of course will be radically different from that in Vietnam. Most likely, either the second Obama or first Romney Administration will continue the current policy of slowly winding down the war until, finally, it can quietly end US combat operations altogether (a concluding stage similar to the one in Iraq). Yet both conflicts reflect a central flaw running throughout US strategic culture: an unwillingness on the part of most US civilian policymakers to apply Clausewitzian analysis – applying military violence in a well-considered way and crafting an intelligent strategy that ultimately furthers US policy aims at an acceptable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-american-anti-clausewitzism&quot;&gt;Conclusion: American Anti-Clausewitzism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might fairly describe US strategic culture as “Anti-Clausewitzian”, not in the sense that it has consciously rejected Clausewitz but that (aside from within the US military) there is very little appreciation of the need to apply force in a thoughtful manner, assessing the likely financial, diplomatic, and human costs of war and creating a strategy that realistically should result in desired ends being achieved at an acceptable price. This is what Colin S. Gray has dubbed “the Strategy Bridge”, and it is a calculation that has been critical to success in statecraft since before humans developed the written word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely why US strategic culture has developed this unhealthy characteristic is complex, reflecting both moral attitudes — most US policymakers find coldly rational discussions of warfare distasteful, preferring to couch discussions of interest in happy vagaries about “spreading democracy” and “American values” — and the tapestry of US history. It is clear, however, that the United States has not, throughout most of its history, been incapable of rationally connecting political ends and military means. Small, weak republics on the Eastern Seaboard of North America do not become continental superstates if they are incapable of using violence ruthlessly and effectively against a variety of foes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, a reasonable observer might argue that the outcome of the Vietnam War was an anomaly, the calamitous ultimate outcome of the strategic ineptitude of Lyndon Johnson and Robert McNamara and a collective madness that descended upon Capitol Hill as a result of anger at Nixon for Watergate and longstanding frustration with Saigon as an ally. In 2012, however, it is obvious that there is a strong continuing pattern of poor US strategizing regarding the use of military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was the strategy for Afghanistan unrealistic, but the planning for the invasion of Iraq also was deeply flawed. Saddam Hussein was a long-standing irritant and the desire to see him removed from power altogether understandable. However, the fact that the Bush Administration believed that declaring Iraq a democracy would somehow prevent civil war and block Iran from having enormous influence in the country was as delusional as its belief that Afghanistan could be transformed into a functional state. When one also considers the examples of the US intervention in Lebanon in the 1980s and the US war in Libya — an adventure whose consequences are still playing out — as well as ill-considered uses of force in the Balkans that were at least nominally successful thanks to the weakness of Serbia and Slobodan Milošević’s arrogance and strategic ineptitude, the flaws in US strategic culture are all too clear. Moreover, it should be noted that they are bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Luttwakian paradox, it is a long record of US historical success that has encouraged this more recent pattern of failure. Because the United States succeeded so impressively overall in its grand strategy from the War of Independence to the end of the Cold War — and the Vietnam debacle did not completely destroy US containment, which proved a good enough strategy to bring the competition with the Soviet Union to a peaceful end — “victory disease” has taken deep root in US strategic culture. The aforementioned impressiveness of the military instrument and the fact that, even now, the United States is so much more powerful than any of its rivals blind policymakers to the limitations on their ability to impose their will on sentient enemies who react to the use of force, often in a creative and surprising manner. Victory disease is a self-correcting condition; eventually patterns of failure become so clear that policymakers are compelled to acknowledge them, whereupon they modify their strategic behavior. The questions that have yet to be answered are how much additional damage the United States will inflict on its interests and how much more it will pay in blood and dollars before it ceases to act in this dysfunctional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) over the Guomindang (GMD) in the Chinese Civil War of 1946-49 offers a powerful lesson in strategic misfortune. The GMD’s decay, corruption, and failure to offer a persuasive hope for future prosperity in the aftermath of the horrors of the second Sino-Japanese War were certainly prominent factors in its defeat. But the GMD nonetheless had the military power and will to militarily crush the CCP, as it often did before the onset of sustained Japanese aggression in the late 1930s. Political failure may have weakened the GMD, but strategic failure in managing large land campaigns sealed its fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-destruction&quot;&gt;Strategy of Destruction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Civil War is a powerful case study in the centrality of battle even in civil war. Ideology, popular mobilization, and governance were all important. But to heavily focus on these factors ignores Mao’s oft quoted maxim that “power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” European counterinsurgency theorists such as David Galula studied Mao, but rarely understood the centrality of battle to early 20th Century China’s strategic history. Guerrilla operations and peasant revolts sat alongside large-scale operations waged by those with European military training and ideas. Mastery of continental land warfare as well as guerrilla operations proved key to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War motivated the Qing leaders to create a powerful and bureaucratic military organized around European lines with the aid of German advisors. The 1911 revolution was not won by mass mobilization; Sun Yat-Sen’s GMD was a secret society that focused its efforts on winning over intellectuals, economic elites, and soldiers in Qing military forces. Yuan Shikai, Marshal of the Qing’s forces, defected with his elite Beiyang Army to Sun’s side and tilted the military balance in favor of the rebels. A lack of political consensus over the structure and distribution of political power helped fragment the military balance and thus create the impetus for China’s infamous ‘warlord period’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides in the Chinese Civil War were also thoroughly familiar with European political-military ideas and training. German advisors instilled in warlord armies an appreciation of the importance of large infantry armies, artillery, and the necessity of controlling land forces with telegraphic communication and railroad transport. German influence may have been eventually eclipsed by the Soviets, but German ideas still figured strongly in GMD doctrine and operations. GMD and CCP political-military commanders both had military training in Europe and received training from Soviet advisors in the Whampoa Military Academy, before the White Terror suppression of CCP forces in Shanghai and beyond by the GMD that ended their putative alliance in the late 1920s. Both the GMD and the CCP adopted political commissar systems and were strongly influenced by the Soviet idea of the party army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the GMD understood that the CCP posed an existential threat and committed to its destruction. It engaged in encirclement operations to search and destroy CCP forces, the success of which was aided by the CCP’s initial Leninist conception of a strategy of urban revolt. Mao and Zhu De worked in concert to develop an alternative strategy built around concepts of protracted war, guerrilla tactics, and political mobilization of the peasantry. The growth of base areas throughout China provided the impetus for the growth of the party army and the CCP’s distinctive military tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD moved in the early 1930s to encircle and destroy the base areas, but were initially stymied. CCP forces responded by “luring the enemy into the deep,” tricking the GMD forces into overextending their supply lines and destroying individual enemy units. However, the success of these tactics must be qualified. GMD units often consisted of former warlord troops of uneven quality, and local revolts and Japanese encroachments harmed overall GMD ability to coordinate operations. When the GMD devoted its full attentions and resources to annihilating the CCP, it was remarkably successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMD forces did not have to compete for the allegiance of the populace to defeat the CCP’s base area strategy. Rather, the GMD starved the CCP base areas of resources and nullified Mao’s famed tactics by refusing to be lured into the deep. Networks of blockhouses linked by communication nodes were constructed to exert GMD control, but this time GMD troops refused to overextend their lines. CCP guerrillas were starved of resources, and any CCP attempts to exert local control resulted in destruction by pinpoint artillery and aircraft bombing. The CCP found itself fighting offensively to survive, but doing so led to crushing military defeat in pitched battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final encirclement campaign severely reduced the CCP base areas. The GMD’s aggressive pursuit of the Communist remnants during the torturous Long March destroyed nine tenths of CCP military power. Were it not for the onset of Japanese aggression, it is quite likely that the GMD would have completely destroyed the weakened CCP forces. The Second Sino-Japanese War not only provided breathing room for the CCP, but also allowed the CCP the opportunity to finally compete for political authority on a national scale. CCP forces infiltrated behind Japanese lines to organize the masses against the Japanese and build up a power base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-consolidation&quot;&gt;Strategy of Consolidation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP modified its policies in order to make itself attractive to local economic elites while still seeking to lower the peasant’s burden. This politically adroit compromise enabled the CCP to play to peasant sympathies while also plying local landlords that would have otherwise supported the GMD. The increasing formalization and sophistication of the CCP’s command and control structure increased as it expanded rapidly in its base areas; it reached a peak strength of 1.27 million men under arms and 2.6 million militia members by the fall of 1945. The CCP, once regarded as yet another group of renegades with a propensity for redistributive violence, now became seen as patriots waging a virtuous struggle against the Japanese invader. The fact that the CCP’s major military efforts were largely failures did not matter, as the Communists rose while the GMD was pushed to the brink of extinction by the pressure of tackling the Japanese head-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD paid a high price for its efforts to maintain the prewar Chinese polity. It lost 2.4 million men, and some of its best officers perished in positional warfare against the Japanese onslaught. At war’s end, large pockets of territory remained under the control of Japanese troops, local puppet regimes, and the CCP. Even American aid was not enough to sustain the power of the sinking GMD state. The war destroyed 55 percent of industry and mining, 72 percent of shipping, and 96 percent of railway lines. Inflation in GMD territory rose to an annual average of 230 percent. The war shattered the GMD’s prewar evolution into a Soviet-style hierarchal party and the political necessity of compromising with local elites during the war led to substantial corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD’s political failure to consolidate its control is heavily emphasized in the literature of the war, and for good reason. Years of warlordism, civil war, and the depredations of Japanese aggression had disrupted the political, social, and economic fabric of China. The GMD, challenged by the CCP’s competing nationalism, would have to demonstrate its competence in order to regain political control and legitimacy. But the GMD entered the postwar situation with a substantial lack of revenue, and the wartime disruption of China’s heavy industry resulted in substantial price increases. GMD reforms were crippled by a lack of understanding of modern monetary policy, though they were not totally without beneficial effect. Hyperinflation, unemployment, and indirect taxation all presented a dismal picture of government failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD also failed to adapt to social changes, such as the rise of labor activism, autonomous peasant uprisings, revolts from traditionally oppressed groups, and the rise of a heavily nationalist and CCP-linked student movement. The war’s destruction of traditional markers of social cohesion and class status helped create a large group of elites willing to entertain visions of a China ruled by a power other than the GMD. The GMD found it initially easy to re-establish control in the countryside and handle peasant revolts with indirect rule through a combination of local elites and coercive law enforcement. But it did not understand the need to respond the deepening social crisis in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD strategy of attempting to gain control of large urban centers ran into severe difficulty as factional infighting, predatory local officials, and lack of governing capacity hindered efforts to rebuild. By 1948, total economic collapse had devastated the middle class, bankrupted businessmen, and severely disrupted the GMD’s elite power base. Once-tight party control eroded, and the circle of elites willing to fight for the GMD narrowed. The CCP deftly exploited these difficulties by mobilizing the urban middle class, students, and labor to frustrate the GMD’s political control of the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP, however, could also be quite ruthless and at times equally inept at the task of extending its authority. The CCP’s success at radical land reform among the peasantry can best be described as mixed. Land reform’s quality varied, led to political conflicts, and most peasants simply sought to survive rather than take sides. Some even resisted the CCP’s efforts to violently overturn the prewar political and social order. More important was the CCP’s ability to create local order, manipulate local elites, and militarize its areas of operation. When it succeeded, the CCP did so by adapting to local conditions and promising all things to all men. When it failed, it was because of overzealous ideological mobilization and lack of attention to the needs of the locals. The CCP succeeded not necessarily in generating a giant peasant army, but in gaining a base for supply and support. It gained enough recruits to sustain its losses and wage a civil war on a continental scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-victory&quot;&gt;Strategy of Victory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the GMD’s manifold political failures, it held one crucial trump card: the power of battle. As in the encirclement campaigns, the GMD had the raw military power to crush the CCP. Without eliminating the GMD’s forces, including an elite group of American-trained units, the CCP could not win the civil war. Its liberated areas depended on military support to survive. In spite of its losses and economic mismanagement, the GMD’s armed forces had grown larger and the party continued to hold international recognition. Crucially, the GMD military could also count on American and British assistance for air and naval transport. The CCP, in contrast, could count on sporadic support at best, from Moscow. In 1945 the GMD, despite its setbacks, controlled three quarters of the country, 300 million people, all large cities, and transportation hubs. Its ranks boasted 4.3 million troops, including 2 million regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP was not prepared for Japan’s sudden collapse in 1945, but the GMD could deftly exploit it. Japan’s strategic defeat, and the subsequent power vacuum it created, complicated the CCP’s slow efforts to create guerrilla bases in south and central China and develop a positional defense of the emerging CCP mini-state in the north. If successful, the plan would force the GMD into engaging in counterinsurgency in the south while contending with mobile warfare in the north. Japan’s sudden collapse caught the CCP in the middle of the process, before either front was ready for battle. The GMD used Allied transport to rapidly move its forces into north China, prompting the CCP to engage in a mad dash to prevent GMD expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic decision that helped save the CCP was actually made by Mao’s subordinate, Liu Shaoqi. Abandoning the prewar plan, Liu shifted the CCP’s best troops into the northeast, gaining Manchuria and shortening CCP lines in the south. As one group of forces moved to the northeast in Manchuria, CCP units once tasked to the south would abandon their bases and move north to Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei. These maneuvers established Manchuria as a logistical base that could supply the war effort nationally. Nevertheless, the plan also immediately ran into problems. Building a base of support in northeast China had proved more difficult than Liu expected. In addition to political problems with the area’s populace, the GMD dispatched strong units to the area to contest the CCP’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1946 found the CCP still struggling in Manchuria and thwarted in their quest to establish a safe rear area for the liberated areas in north China, along the Yellow River. The GMD unleashed its American-trained elite units and succeeded in severely disrupting CCP military forces in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong and trapping CCP armies in the east. Meanwhile, offensives continued in the north and northeast. Yet at this point, the GMD, failing to notice the problems inherent in its failure to destroy Communist armies in the field, assumed that it had secured Shanxi, Suiyan, Chahar, Anhui, Rehe, and the Central Plains as well as the majority of Jiangsu, Hebei, and Manchuria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the GMD decided to embark on the Strong Point offensive, an attempt to destroy the CCP’s political apparatus to the west in Yan’an as well as the trapped CCP army in the east. The Strong Point offensive was based on the tenuous assumptions that the GMD had secured its conquered territory and could afford to shift its effort away from the northeast and northern theaters. It failed to finish off the CCP, even though it came close enough that the party headquarters in Yan’an were evacuated. By the end of the Strong Point offensive in 1947, the CCP still had its strategic base in the northeast, and the GMD had failed to fully pacify a single region or completely destroy the Communist mobile armies. The GMD’s strategic reserves were exhausted, and it lacked the resources to properly defend all of its gains. The GMD held the coastline and all of the major cities and railroads from Shaanxi to Shandong, but this counted for little as long as Communist armies remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD had failed to consolidate control over northeast and northern areas in Manchuria, Hebei, and Shanxi, while shifting the bulk of GMD forces to Shandong in the east and Shaanxi to the west. Fatally overextended, the GMD’s strength was primarily concentrated on the flanks and thus was ripe for an offensive in the center. With northeast and northern areas still in play and the bulk of GMD strength concentrated in Shandong and Shaanxi, the CCP successfully disrupted GMD defenses with its Central Plains offensives. The shock of watching a CCP army infiltrate deep behind enemy lines south of the Yellow River forced the GMD to strip Shandong, Manchuria, and north China of their defenses to shore up its center. Decisive battles in the northeast and Central Plains were now possible for the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1948, the GMD had failed to gain anything more than a foothold in Manchuria, was tied down in the center and was struggling to combat counteroffensive operations in both Manchuria and the north. Meanwhile, military reorganization, improvements in weaponry, the mobilization of peasants and conscription of captured GMD soldiers allowed the CCP to transform itself into an organization truly capable of decisive mobile warfare. Collapse would come rapidly in three decisive campaigns in the northeast, north, and the Central Plains. These three campaigns would destroy GMD military power and allow the CCP to sweep over the rest of continental China. Perhaps the most notable was the Huai-Hai campaign, which stretched over 7,600 square miles and involved a million combatants. The CCP encircled and destroyed the bulk of the GMD forces in a single blow, triggering a political crisis that would mark the beginning of the end for the Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-strategic-misfortune&quot;&gt;A Strategic Misfortune?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD’s economic mismanagement, corruption, and various failures in the countryside certainly cost it heavily, but the CCP’s social initiatives had mixed effects throughout its base areas and at most allowed it to stay in the game rather than win outright. Failure to crush the CCP in the 1930s allowed it to survive and grow, and strategic failures in the mid-1940s squandered the GMD’s superior position. The GMD’s bad policies may have been synergistic with its military failures, but those military failures doomed it to strategic defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD proved incapable of managing a war fought on a truly continental scale, overextending its forces and exhausting its reserve. It could not hold the areas it took and failed to focus on the enemy armies rather than the territories they held. The center of gravity was not people or territory, but the political power that grew out of Mao’s guns. GMD strategic misfortune was the cause, not the consequence, of the birth of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-1-what-are-the-key-strengths-of-the-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Feature 1: What Are the Key Strengths of the China-Russia Relationship?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature explores how the China-Russia relationship came to be so close, up until the time of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The analysis centers on five key ways in which China benefits from the relationship, each of which is examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths highlighted in this feature is the strong personal relationship between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since he became China’s president in 2013, Xi has met with Vladimir Putin 39 times, which is more than double the number of times Xi has met with leaders of any other major power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-2-what-are-the-weaknesses-of-the-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Feature 2: What Are the Weaknesses of the China-Russia Relationship?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature explores key areas of uncertainty and weak points within the China-Russia relationship. While ties between Beijing and Moscow are currently close, there are areas of tension and uncertainty within the relationship. One potential long-term stressor on the relationship is the growing power disparity between the two countries, as China solidifies its position as the more “senior” partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most visible with respect to economic power. China’s GDP has already far outpaced Russia’s, and the gap between the two is set to widen as China’s GDP is expected to climb toward nearly $30 trillion in the coming years, while Russia’s is forecasted to stagnate at well under $2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-3-how-does-china-benefit-from-military-cooperation-with-russia&quot;&gt;Feature 3: How Does China Benefit from Military Cooperation with Russia?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forthcoming feature will assess Chinese and Russian military cooperation, a crucial element of the broader bilateral relationship. One key area of China-Russia military cooperation that will be examined in this feature is military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries conducted their first joint military exercise in 2005, with another four exercises between 2007 and 2012. Starting in 2013, however, China and Russia significantly ramped up their participation in bilateral and multilateral exercises with each other. Through 2021, they have held a total of 53 military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for this feature to learn more about how China and Russia benefit from these military exercises, as well as other forms of military cooperation, such as arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;
